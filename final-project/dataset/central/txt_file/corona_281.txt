 help snopes become a founding member when u s president donald trump was asked what he d say to people who lost family members to covid 19 he replied i would say this didn t hurt anyone as much as it hurt me one of the primary issues that the u s federal and state governments were wrestling with during the covid 19 coronavirus disease pandemic in may 2020 was the trade off of keeping social distancing and business closure restrictions in place to protect lives versus the trade off of ongoing and possibly permanent economic harm to individuals businesses and the country as a whole on may 5 2020 while u s president donald trump was in phoenix arizona to tour a medical face mask manufacturing facility there he was interviewed by david muir of abc news about the subject of reopening the u s shortly after the interview aired a meme began to circulate on social media holding that when trump had been asked during that interview what he d say to people who lost family members to covid 19 he replied i would say this didn t hurt anyone as much as it hurt me although this meme is vaguely reflective of something trump said during that interview it grossly misrepresents both what he literally said and what he meant according to the transcript of that interview trump was asked the following by muir we ve lost more people now to covid 19 than we lost in the vietnam war what do you want to say to those families tonight trump responded in full as reproduced below i want to say i love you i want to say that we re doing everything we can i also want to say that we re trying to project people over 60 years old we re trying so hard and everything i ve said today i d like to preface it by saying if you re 60 years old and especially if you re 60 or even less than that and you ve had a heart condition or you ve had diabetes or a problem of any kind it seeks out problems this is a vicious it seeks out weakness in terms of medical if somebody has any form of a heart problem or diabetes anything it seeks it out it s a vicious vicious virus but i want to just say to the people that have lost family and have lost loved ones and the people that have just suffered so badly and just made it and just made it that we love you we re with you we re working with you we re supplying vast amounts of money like never before we want that money to get to the people and we want em to get better and we want them you can never really come close to replacing when you ve lost some no matter how well we do next year i think our economy is going to be raging it s going to be so good no matter how well those people can never ever replace somebody they love but we re going to have something that they re going to be very proud of and to the people that have lost someone there s nobody i don t sleep at night thinking about it there s nobody that s taken it harder than me but at the same time i have to get this enemy defeated and that s what we re doing david that s what we re doing as indicated in the bolded passages above trump expressed sympathy for the families who had suffered and lost loved ones to covid 19 said he didn t sleep night at night thinking about it and asserted that nobody had taken it i e grappling with the effects of the pandemic harder than himself he perhaps undercut his message somewhat by mixing in the anguish of losing loved ones to disease those people can never ever replace somebody they love with talk about recharging the economy i think our economy is going to be raging we re going to have something that they re going to be very proud of but he did not say anything that could reasonably be interpreted as meaning that coronavirus related deaths didn t hurt anyone as much as it hurt me we have big plans we need your help abc news transcript abc news anchor david muir interviews president trump in arizona 5 may 2020 the driving force behind michigan s anti lockdown protests and their connections to the family of betsy devos is even more complex than we initially thought the u s president went without a mask for much of his visit to a ford manufacturing plant in michigan in late spring 2020 a years old hoax recirculated in 2020 this time with gates name attached to it the concept was very on brand during the covid 19 coronavirus pandemic in the spring of 2020 some rumors never die they just grow new heads an old prediction got a new origin story hand sanitizer is definitely flammable but enough to start a car fire prolonged usage of certain masks can cause some health concerns norris now 80 has been a frequent subject of hoaxes over the years this isn t the first time the painting was mistaken as an official white house portrait 1995 2020 by snopes media group inc this material may not be reproduced without permission snopes and the snopes com logo are registered service marks of snopes com
