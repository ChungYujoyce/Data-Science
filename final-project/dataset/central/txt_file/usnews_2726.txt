rep justin amash announced april 28 that he was launching an exploratory committee to seek the libertarian party s presidential nomination there had long been buzz about a potential presidential run around amash who last year left the republican party and became an independent member of congress a spokesperson for amash says he is now officially a libertarian member of congress though he s been critical of trump and the republican party amash says his main argument is broader he believes the country is locked in what he s repeatedly called a partisan death spiral in which representative government is broken amash who says he will not seek reelection to his current house seat spoke with time via skype from his home in michigan on may 3 where he discussed the state of the current republican party how he believes campaigning virtually levels the playing field and why he thinks he has a pathway to the nomination below is a lightly edited condensed transcript of the interview as a presidential candidate what would the core idea of your campaign be the core idea is liberty and representative government and what we have right now in washington is a very broken system what happens right now too often is a few leaders in congress negotiate with the white house and they decide everything for everyone and this leads to a lot of frustration and a lot of partisanship because when congress can t deliberate actual policies when you have most members of congress left out of the process then they start to debate personalities why are you dipping your toes into this with an exploratory committee instead of just outright running i m new to the libertarian party and i m seeking the nomination of the libertarian party i want to be respectful of all the delegates i want to be respectful of the people who have been a part of that party for a long time and i m starting it as an exploratory committee so that i can try to earn the nomination and if i m able to get further along and obtain the nomination then we can talk about changing it to a full committee do you have a deadline then when it comes to deciding whether you will actually run versus exploratory i don t have a specific deadline in mind i think as this goes on we ll have a better idea of where we stand with the delegates and there may come a point where i feel more comfortable moving forward concretely and saying yes i m in 100 i m going all the way but right now i want to make sure i m being respectful of the delegates and working to earn their trust and i m going to continue to work to do that over the next few weeks why now when it s so late in the election cycle and in the middle of a pandemic well for one thing i think it s important to think about the fact that the election cycles have been getting longer they re starting early in the year before the election and we don t need that much campaigning going on for a presidency otherwise these things are just nonstop around the clock and people get really tired of it but actually at the beginning of this year in february i started to look at it very carefully and wanted to consider whether i would be a candidate and i would have made a decision earlier but then we had the coronavirus pandemic come up and i had to make the decision the right decision i believe to delay the final judgement of whether i m going to jump in or not because i want to be able to represent my constituents during this time i wanted to make sure i m in top of what was going on in congress and i wanted to reassess how a pandemic situation where we re all stuck at home would affect the campaign is it still possible to advance the things you want to talk about as a third party candidate it is possible to do that and the way i m going to do that is by getting my message out there and if i do that i feel confident that people will see that among the three candidates the one running as a libertarian party nominee right now or seeking the libertarian party nomination is the one who will be the most compelling and qualified candidate of the three do you think your presence in the race will help or hurt either candidate i think it hurts both candidates the goal is to win so you obviously want to take votes from both candidates there s a huge pool of voters who aren t represented by either of the parties and a lot of times they just stay home or they settle for one of the two parties but they would be happy to vote for someone else if they felt there was another candidate that was compelling have you thought about whether you d vote for biden or trump i would not vote for biden or trump getting rid of donald trump does not fix the problems because donald trump is just a symptom of the problems the problems will still exist with joe biden in the white house is there anything that your friends in the republican party could do to redeem themselves now in your eyes i don t think that there s any way to pull them back from where they are the culture of donald trump that has become dominant in the republican party is not going away anytime soon it s probably here for at least a decade it s a very different tone it s a very different style there s not much focus on principles anymore it s a focus on personality what makes you think that there s a viable path for you when you think about whether republicans are firmly behind trump yes they re firmly behind trump because they don t see an alternative and they view the alternative right now as joe biden and that s not a viable alternative for most republicans so there is a path for a third candidate to receive votes from republicans michigan has been in the news recently for the protests against the governor s coronavirus policies can i ask what you made of them i support people protesting i support their right to protest i think people are very upset in michigan about much of the overreach i do condemn and denounce things like using nazi flags or nazi symbols at protests or coming into the state capitol holding weapons in a way that might be intimidating to many people what about the protests where folks haven t been adhering to social distancing practices it shouldn t happen where people don t keep away from each other by at least 6 ft i mean we re hearing from doctors and epidemiologists and others we should adhere to those guidelines what was the decision not to run for reelection like it was one of the most difficult decisions of my life i think it s important to focus on one race at a time and this is the race i m focused on ultimately i decided that even though i can win reelection as an independent i wasn t sure it would make the same kind of difference to our system as running a presidential campaign and winning that campaign if you win as an independent some people might just write it off to some oddity of the third district of michigan saying well in that district an independent can win but it won t work anywhere else if you win the presidency as a libertarian you have a chance to really upset the system in a way that can restore our constitutional process and our representative government and to me that is the more important thing what s it like being home and deciding whether you want to run for president under these circumstances it s a different kind of campaign but it s one that actually may work to my benefit if we were running a normal campaign i obviously don t have the name id yet to go out and hold massive rallies or any of those kinds of things like the president might or maybe joe biden might so we re at a point where we can compete with the other candidates through video and through technology and i have an advantage in that maybe as a younger candidate going out there and
