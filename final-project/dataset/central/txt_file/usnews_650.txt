it s been a messy day for senator bernie sanders when sanders one of the frontrunners in the 2020 elections endorsed cenk uygur a controversial congressional candidate in california with a long history of making problematic statements about women and other minority groups on thursday the move sparked immediate criticism from democrats by friday afternoon less than 24 hours after uygur first tweeted about the endorsement sanders withdrew his support cenk has been a longtime fighter against the corrupt forces in our politics sanders said in his statement of withdrawal on friday however our movement is bigger than any one person i hear my grassroots supporters who were frustrated and understand their concerns uygur is the founder of left leaning online outlet the young turks and one of several democrats running to replace former us rep katie hill in california hill resigned from congress in october after she was accused of having inappropriate relationships with subordinates uygur announced he would run for her seat in november but he s been under scrutiny since 2017 when the wrap uncovered some of his old blog posts from the early 2000s in which he reportedly made sexist comments that included saying women are poorly designed creatures who do not want to have sex nearly as often as needed for the human race to get along peaceably and fruitfully and running down rules of dating such as there must be orgasm by the fifth date cnn and the los angeles times separately reported he d also made offensive remarks about other marginalized communities after the posts came to

uygur who told time he deleted his posts about 15 years ago has repeatedly apologized for his comments including in an interview with time on friday he also said he was not accepting endorsements in his campaign a move apparently designed to give sanders cover to withdraw i ve decided that while i deeply appreciate senator sanders and others support i m not accepting endorsements in this campaign so that s a decision we made today so none of this should be on senator sanders or anyone else who back me uygur said in a phone interview the only endorsements i m taking going forward are the voters of california 25th district uygur said sanders was the only endorsement he had requested from a presidential candidate and that he d spoken with sanders to thank him for backing him and tell him his decision not to accept endorsements he was very gracious i told him i really appreciate his support but i ve decided to go in this direction uygur told time he didn t explicitly ask sanders to withdraw his support sanders endorsement which took many by surprise raised questions over whether progressives should embrace candidates with controversial histories that run counter to what they stand for asked by time why sanders chose to endorse uygur despite his past controversial comments sanders campaign did not answer the question aimee allison founder of she the people told time in a text friday morning that women of color would have little tolerance for a candidate unqualified to lead when she was asked for her thoughts on the endorsement senator sanders should know that and we aren t going back to the day when it s any democrat no matter how vile some things cannot be overlooked allison said she was not alone in her condemnation of the decision this isn t one or two one off comments this is a decade long history of some really rank sexist things jill filipovic a democratic author of a book on feminism told time i just don t think there should be room for that in the democratic party in progressive activist and in leftist activism we re just supposed to be better than that the la times also reported that the president of california young democrats which backs

california progressive who serves as a national co chair for the sanders campaign who also endorsed uygur did not respond to a text from time asking to talk about the endorsement but on friday
