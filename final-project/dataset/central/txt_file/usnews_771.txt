declare that we will call upon the bold thinking needed to address the disparity of income in america which is at the root of the crisis of confidence felt by so many americans as justice brandeis said we may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we can t have both we must end that injustice and restore the public s faith in a better future for themselves and their children we must be champions of the middle class and all those who aspire to it because the middle class is the backbone of democracy it has been so since the birth of democracy itself

committee on the climate crisis the entire congress must work to put an end to the inaction and denial of science that threaten the planet and the future this is a public health decision for clean air and clean water an economic decision for america s global preeminence in green technology a security decision to keep us safe and a moral decision to be good stewards of god s creation we have no illusions that our work will be easy that all of us in this chamber will always agree but let each of us pledge that when we disagree we will respect each other and we will respect the truth we will debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from and in that spirit democrats will be offering the senate republican appropriations legislation to re open government later today to meet the needs of the american people to protect our borders and to respect our workers and i pledge that this congress will be transparent bipartisan and unifying that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this chamber and across the divisions in this great nation in the past two years the american people have spoken tens of thousands of public events were held hundreds of thousands of people turned out millions of calls were made countless families even sick little children the little lobbyists bravely came forward to tell their stories and they made the difference now the floor of this house must be america s town hall where the people will see our debates and where their voices will be heard and affect our decisions this house will be for the people empowered by our mandate we will pursue our mission to lower health care costs and prescription drug prices and protect people with pre existing conditions to increase paychecks by rebuilding america with green and modern

and families of gun violence by passing commonsense bipartisan background check legislation we will make america fairer by passing the equality act to end discrimination against lgbtq americans and we
