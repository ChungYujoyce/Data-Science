president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more despite or perhaps because of a growing sense that he is the most trusted expert on the coronavirus crisis the white house moved on monday to squash suggestions that fauci could be ousted from the president s task force on the crisis and fauci himself sought to shore up his position during the white house press briefing when he walked back remarks he had made at the weekend during a cnn interview on sunday fauci had suggested that mitigation measures would have been more effective had they been put in place earlier but that there had been pushback against them after trump invited fauci to the lectern within minutes of beginning monday s press briefing the doctor said that his reference to pushback was the wrong choice of words he also said that trump went to the mitigation the first time he was asked to do so the remarks came after ominous signs for fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases on sunday trump had retweeted a message that included the words time to

former north carolina congressman who has just taken over as white house chief of staff the op ed intensified whispers of in fighting within the administration between those who are pushing for a return to something like normalcy as soon as possible and those who favor a more cautious approach trump has acknowledged that the decision of when to push for a reopening of the nation s economy could be the biggest decision of his life if he moves too hastily and the virus becomes resurgent it could easily doom his chances of reelection but the longer the shutdown continues the more disastrous the economic effects will be the nation s economic health is already reeling with about 16 million new unemployment claims in the past three weeks in public health circles meanwhile the idea of a move against fauci causes serious consternation lawrence gostin a georgetown law professor who specializes in public health and has known fauci for 30 years said i believe tony is america s doctor and i believe it would be catastrophic to fire the most trusted person in america right now there is some data that backs up gostin s point on public trustworthiness abusiness insider surveymonkey surveypublished monday asked respondents to rank various public figures on a five point scale in terms of how much they were trusted on the coronavirus fauci scored the highest of the figures tested with an average score of 3 96 and 44 percent of respondents giving him the maximum rating of five trump was one of the lowest figures tested scoring an average 2 48 but those are the kind of ratings that are likely to rankle trump who has a long record of moving against figures including subordinates whom he sees as rivals for public trust or the spotlight trump vigorously defended himself during the monday white house press briefing including showing a video that sought to make the case that he had acted promptly and assertively the video itself drew pushback msnbc cut away from its coverage of the briefing as it was being shown with anchor ari melber calling it video propaganda fauci has become a fixture of tv news and other interviews some of which have included implicit criticism of trump since the crisis began in march fauci expressed exasperation in an interview with science magazine with trump s propensity to make inaccurate or misleading statements during white house briefings i can t jump in front of the microphone and push him down ok he said it let s try and get it corrected for the next time fauci said fauci is following in the footsteps of several people who have ultimately found themselves exiled from the trump administration the president s patience has worn thin for figures whom he perceived to be enjoying the limelight too much or

coronavirus diagnosis more s departures can all be seen in that light we know that trump is intolerant of anyone who even takes a sliver of the spotlight away from him said allan lichtman a history professor at american university and one of the few experts who correctly predicted trump s 2016 election victory we know that trump can t bear to have any criticism within his administration the white house however had already pushed back against suggestions that fauci could be marginalized the media chatter is ridiculous president trump is not firing fauci white house spokesperson hogan gidley said in a statement monday gidley was responding to coverage of trump s retweet that had included the firefauci hashtag he said that trump was actually responding to media attempts to maliciously push a falsehood about his china decision to block visitors from that country in an attempt to rewrite history it is in any event complicated for trump to directly fire fauci from his position at the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases which is not a political appointment but he could marginalize him or remove him from the task force one way or another concern about fauci is fostered partly because he has personally been in the firing ling and partly because there has been persistent skepticism about the scientific projections of the coronavirus s likely effects most right wing figures have shifted away from their earlier insistence that covid 19 could be no more serious than the flu or that it is somehow a democrat led hoax but suggestions that the scientists are still overstating the scale of the threat linger during an appearance on sean hannitysean patrick hannitytrump lashes out at fox news after poll shows him trailing biden trump complains

sheasserted it s now obvious that our press will oppose any strategy that doesn t lead to a complete lockdown for at least the remainder of the year but fauci allies like gostin insist that even the questions and tensions around the scientist were themselves damaging even if they stopped short of his firing it is deeply harmful to the covid response because it signals that the president doesn t
