night that a member of the staff tested positive for covid 19 alexander will chair tuesday s hearing from tennessee in recent days alexander has said that the coronavirus testing the united states has done so far is not nearly enough and there is no safe path forward to combat the novel coronavirus without adequate testing trump has touted the overall number of tests that have been conducted in the country now more than 8 million but at times he s read a different message in them if we did very little testing america wouldn t have the most cases trump said wednesday so in a way by doing all of this testing we make ourselves look bad and trump s reservations about testing appear to be rooted in politics trump said friday he believes some democrats hope the economy doesn t bounce back i will tell you you look at some cases some people think they re doing it for politics trump said on fox news channel here we go again but they think they re doing it because it ll hurt me the longer it takes to hurt me in the election the longer it takes to open up but trump s focus on how the pandemic makes him and the nation look doesn t get the country closer to being prepared and able to live

plateaued but it appears to have a long tail and that flattening is masked by new york and new jersey s daily new cases coming down because new cases are on the rise in other places loading 2 those cdc guidelines for reopening if you re wondering why despite access to some of the top scientists in the world there haven t been clearer and more detailed reopening guidelines for states businesses and religious institutions coming from the federal government you re not alone and now we know why the white house buried them the guidelines from the cdc were shelved the ap reported following the publication of the report cdc director redfield issued a statement that appeared to run contrary to his published internal emails he took responsibility and said the document was shared prematurely was in draft form and had not been vetted through the interagency review process because of that redfield added he was not yet comfortable releasing a final work product will the cdc release new guidelines at some point now that this is out there 3 will the white house push for another relief package or not white house economic adviser kevin hassett said on cnn s state of the union sunday that another relief package would be premature given the others that have already passed and trillions total in aid we think that we have a little moment the luxury of a moment to learn about what s

director of the biomedical advanced research and development authority a key agency in vaccine development will testify before a house committee thursday it comes after he filed a whistleblower complaint against the trump administration for being dismissed from his position he says for sounding alarms about the coronavirus early on and expressing opposition to unproven treatments favored by trump bright s lawyers say the office of special counsel has made a determination that he was dismissed for retaliation and should be temporarily reinstated while the office investigates trump has ignored the same office s recommendations before but bright s case will continue to be in the public eye especially this week and as the pandemic fallout continues it would have been bad even with the best of governments it has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of what s in it for me and to heck with everybody else when that mindset is operationalized in our government former
