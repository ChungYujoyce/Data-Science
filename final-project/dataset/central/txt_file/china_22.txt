however it was not a word used by the chinese themselves during the period its origin has been traced through portuguese malay and persian back to the sanskrit word c na used in ancient india 16 china appears in richard eden s 1555 translation l of the 1516 journal of the portuguese explorer duarte barbosa m 16 barbosa s usage was derived from persian ch n which was in turn derived from sanskrit c na 21 c na was first used in early hindu scripture including the mah bh rata 5th centurybce and the laws of manu 2nd centurybce 22 in 1655 martino martini suggested that the word china is derived ultimately from the name of the qin dynasty 221 206 bce 23 22 although this derivation is still given in various sources 24 the origin of the sanskrit word is a matter of debate according to the oxford english dictionary 16 alternative suggestions include the names for yelang and the jing or chu state 22 25 the official name of the modern state is the people s republic of china chinese pinyin zh nghu r nm n g ngh gu the shorter form is china zh nggu from zh ng central and gu state n a term which developed under the western zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne o it was then applied to the area around luoyi present day luoyang during the eastern zhou and then to china s central plain before being used as an occasional synonym for the state under the qing 27 it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the huaxia people from perceived barbarians 27 the name zhongguo is also translated as middle kingdom in english 29 archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited china between 2 24 million and 250 000 years ago 30 the hominid fossils of peking man a homo erectus who used fire 31 were discovered in a cave at zhoukoudian near beijing they have been dated to between 680 000 and 780 000 years ago 32 the fossilized teeth of homo sapiens dated to 125 000 80 000 years ago have been discovered in fuyan cave in dao county hunan 33 chinese proto writing existed in jiahu around 7000bce 34 damaidi around 6000bce 35 dadiwan from 5800 5400bce and banpo dating from the 5th millenniumbce some scholars have suggested that the jiahu symbols 7th millenniumbce constituted the earliest chinese writing system 34 according to chinese tradition the first dynasty was the xia which emerged around 2100bce 36 xia dynasty marked the beginning of china s political system based on hereditary monarchies or dynasties which lasted for a millennia 37 the dynasty was considered mythical by historians until scientific excavations found early bronze age sites at erlitou henan in 1959 38 it remains unclear whether these sites are the remains of the xia dynasty or of another culture from the same period 39 the succeeding shang dynasty is the earliest to be confirmed by contemporary records 40 the shang ruled the plain of the yellow river in eastern china from the 17th to the 11th centurybce 41 their oracle bone script from c 1500bce 42 43 represents the oldest form of chinese writing yet found 44 and is a direct ancestor of modern chinese characters 45 the shang was conquered by the zhou who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuriesbce though centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened zhou no longer fully obeyed the zhou king and continually waged war with each other in the 300 year spring and autumn period by the time of the warring states period of the 5th 3rd centuriesbce there were only seven powerful states left the warring states period ended in 221bce after the state of qin conquered the other six kingdoms reunited china and established the dominant order of autocracy king zheng of qin proclaimed himself the first emperor of the qin dynasty he enacted qin s legalist reforms throughout china notably the forced standardization of chinese characters measurements road widths i e cart axles length and currency his dynasty also conquered the yue tribes in guangxi guangdong and vietnam 46 the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years falling soon after the first emperor s death as his harsh authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion 47 48 following a widespread civil war during which the imperial library at xianyang was burned p the han dynasty emerged to rule china between 206bce and ce220 creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the han chinese 47 48 the han expanded the empire s territory considerably with military campaigns reaching central asia mongolia south korea and yunnan and the recovery of guangdong and northern vietnam from nanyue han involvement in central asia and sogdia helped establish the land route of the silk road replacing the earlier path over the himalayas to india han china gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world 50 despite the han s initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the qin philosophy of legalism in favor of confucianism qin s legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the han government and its successors 51 after the end of the han dynasty a period of strife known as three kingdoms followed 52 whose central figures were later immortalized in one of the four classics of chinese literature at its end wei was swiftly overthrown by the jin dynasty the jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor the five barbarians then invaded and ruled northern china as the sixteen states the xianbei unified them as the northern wei whose emperor xiaowen reversed his predecessors apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects largely integrating them into chinese culture in the south the general liu yu secured the abdication of the jin in favor of the liu song the various successors of these states became known as the northern and southern dynasties with the two areas finally reunited by the sui in 581 the sui restored the han to power through china reformed its agriculture economy and imperial examination system constructed the grand canal and patronized buddhism however they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern korea provoked widespread unrest 53 54 under the succeeding tang and song dynasties chinese economy technology and culture entered a golden age 55 the tang empire returned control of the western regions and the silk road 56 brought traders to as far as mesopotamia and the horn of africa 57 and made the capital chang an a cosmopolitan urban center however it was devastated and weakened by the an shi rebellion in the 8th century 58 in 907 the tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable the song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960 leading to a balance of power between the song and khitan liao the song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first chinese polity to establish a permanent standing navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade 59 between the 10th and 11th centuries the population of china doubled in size to around 100 million people mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern china and the production of abundant food surpluses the song dynasty also saw a revival of confucianism in response to the growth of buddhism during the tang 60 and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity 61 62 however the military weakness of the song army was observed by the jurchen jin dynasty in 1127 emperor huizong of song and the capital bianjing were captured during the jin song wars the remnants of the song retreated to southern china 63 the 13th century brought the mongol conquest of china in 1271 the mongol leader kublai khan established the yuan dynasty the yuan conquered the last remnant of the song dynasty in 1279 before the mongol invasion the population of song china was 120 million citizens this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300 64 a peasant named zhu yuanzhang overthrew the yuan in 1368 and founded the ming dynasty as the hongwu emperor under the ming dynasty china enjoyed another golden age developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture it was during this period that admiral zheng he led the ming treasure voyages throughout the indian ocean reaching as far as east africa 65 in the early years of the ming dynasty china s capital was moved from nanjing to beijing with the budding of capitalism philosophers such as wang yangming further critiqued and expanded neo confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations 66 the scholar official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements which together with the famines and defense against japanese invasions of korea 1592 1598 and manchu invasions led to an exhausted treasury 67 in 1644 beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by li zicheng the chongzhen emperor committed suicide when the city fell the manchu qing dynasty then allied with ming dynasty general wu sangui overthrew li s short lived shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of beijing which became the new capital of the qing dynasty the qing dynasty which lasted from 1644 until 1912 was the last imperial dynasty of china its conquest of the ming 1618 1683 cost 25 million lives and the economy of china shrank drastically 68 after the southern ming ended the further conquest of the dzungar khanate added mongolia tibet and xinjiang to the empire 69 the centralized autocracy was strengthened to crack down on anti qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce the haijin sea ban and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition causing social and technological stagnation 70 71 in the mid 19th century the dynasty experienced western imperialism in the opium wars with britain and france china was forced to pay compensation open treaty ports allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals and cede hong kong to the british 72 under the 1842 treaty of nanking the first of the unequal treaties the first sino japanese war 1894 95 resulted in qing china s loss of influence in the korean peninsula as well as the cession of taiwan to japan 73 the qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died especially in the white lotus rebellion the failed taiping rebellion that ravaged southern china in the 1850s and 1860s and the dungan revolt 1862 77 in the northwest the initial success of the self strengthening movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s in the 19th century the great chinese diaspora began losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the northern chinese famine of 1876 79 in which between 9 and 13 million people died 74 the guangxu emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy but these plans were thwarted by the empress dowager cixi the ill fated anti foreign boxer rebellion of 1899 1901 further weakened the dynasty although cixi sponsored a program of reforms the xinhai revolution of 1911 12 brought an end to the qing dynasty and established the republic of china on 1 january 1912 the republic of china was established and sun yat sen of the kuomintang the kmt or nationalist party was proclaimed provisional president 75 however the presidency was later given to yuan shikai a former qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself emperor of china in the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own beiyang army he was forced to abdicate and re establish the republic 76 after yuan shikai s death in 1916 china was politically fragmented its beijing based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless regional warlords controlled most of its territory 77 78 in the late 1920s the kuomintang under chiang kai shek the then principal of the republic of china military academy was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political manoeuvrings known collectively as the northern expedition 79 80 the kuomintang moved the nation s capital to nanjing and implemented political tutelage an intermediate stage of political development outlined in sun yat sen s san min program for transforming china into a modern democratic state 81 82 the political division in china made it difficult for chiang to battle the communist people s liberation army pla against whom the kuomintang had been warring since 1927 in the chinese civil war this war continued successfully for the kuomintang especially after the pla retreated in the long march until japanese aggression and the 1936 xi an incident forced chiang to confront imperial japan 83 the second sino japanese war 1937 1945 a theater of world war ii forced an uneasy alliance between the kuomintang and the pla japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population in all as many as 20 million chinese civilians died 84 an estimated 40 000 to 300 000 chinese were massacred in the city of nanjing alone during the japanese occupation 85 during the war china along with the uk the us and the soviet union were referred to as trusteeship of the powerful 86 and were recognized as the allied big four in the declaration by united nations 87 88 along with the other three great powers china was one of the four major allies of world war ii and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war 89 90 after the surrender of japan in 1945 taiwan including the pescadores was returned to chinese control china emerged victorious but war ravaged and financially drained the continued distrust between the kuomintang and the communists led to the resumption of civil war constitutional rule was established in 1947 but because of the ongoing unrest many provisions of the roc constitution were never implemented in mainland china 91 major combat in the chinese civil war ended in 1949 with the communist party in control of most of mainland china and the kuomintang retreating offshore reducing its territory to only taiwan hainan and their surrounding islands on 21 september 1949 communist party chairman mao zedong proclaimed the establishment of the people s republic of china with a speech at the first plenary session of the chinese people s political consultative conference 92 93 94 this was followed by a mass celebration in tiananmen square on 1 october at which the proclamation was made publicly by mao at the tiananmen gate the date becoming the new country s first national day 95 in 1950 the people s liberation army captured hainan from the roc 96 and incorporated tibet 97 however remaining kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western china throughout the 1950s 98 the regime consolidated its popularity among the peasants through land reform which included the execution of between 1 and 2 million landlords 99 china developed an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons 100 the chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974 101 however the great leap forward an idealistic massive reform project resulted in an estimated 15 to 35 million deaths between 1958 and 1961 mostly from starvation 102 103 104 in 1966 mao and his allies launched the cultural revolution sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until mao s death in 1976 in october 1971 the prc replaced the republic in the united nations and took its seat as a permanent member of the security council 105 after mao s death the gang of four was quickly arrested and held responsible for the excesses of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping took power in 1978 and instituted significant economic reforms the party loosened governmental control over citizens personal lives and the communes were gradually disbanded in favor of working contracted to households this marked china s transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment 106 china adopted its current constitution on 4 december 1982 in 1989 the violent suppression of student protests in tiananmen square brought sanctions against the chinese government from various countries 107 jiang zemin li peng and zhu rongji led the nation in the 1990s under their administration china s economic performance pulled an estimated 150million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11 2 108 109 the country joined the world trade organization in 2001 and maintained its high rate of economic growth under hu jintao and wen jiabao s leadership in the 2000s however the growth also severely impacted the country s resources and environment 110 111 and caused major social displacement 112 113 living standards continued to improve rapidly despite the late 2000s recession but political control remained tight 114 preparations for a decadal leadership change in 2012 were marked by factional disputes and political scandals 115 during the 18th national communist party congress in november 2012 hu jintao was replaced as general secretary of the communist party by xi jinping 116 117 under xi the chinese government began large scale efforts to reform its economy 118 119 which has suffered from structural instabilities and slowing growth 120 121 122 the xi li administration also announced major reforms to the one child policy and prison system 123 in december 2019 a new strain of coronavirus later identified as covid 19 broke out in wuhan hubei then spread to other provinces of china and then worldwide becoming the covid 19 pandemic 124 125 as of may 2020 more than 5 59million cases of covid 19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories resulting in more than 350 000 deaths and then 2 28million recovered people 126 china s landscape is vast and diverse ranging from the gobi and taklamakan deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south the himalaya karakoram pamir and tian shan mountain ranges separate china from much of south and central asia the yangtze and yellow rivers the third and sixth longest in the world respectively run from the tibetan plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard china s coastline along the pacific ocean is 14 500 kilometers 9 000mi long and is bounded by the bohai yellow east china and south china seas china connects through the kazakh border to the eurasian steppe which has been an artery of communication between east and west since the neolithic through the steppe route the ancestor of the terrestrial silk road s the territory of china lies between latitudes 18 and 54 n and longitudes 73 and 135 e china s landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory in the east along the shores of the yellow sea and the east china sea there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains while on the edges of the inner mongolian plateau in the north broad grasslands predominate southern china is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges while the central east hosts the deltas of china s two major rivers the yellow river and the yangtze river other major rivers include the xi mekong brahmaputra and amur to the west sit major mountain ranges most notably the himalayas high plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north such as the taklamakan and the gobi desert the world s highest point mount everest 8 848m lies on the sino nepalese border 128 the country s lowest point and the world s third lowest is the dried lake bed of ayding lake 154m in the turpan depression 129 china s climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer in the winter northern winds coming from high latitude areas are cold and dry in summer southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist 130 the climate in china differs from region to region because of the country s highly complex topography a major environmental issue in china is the continued expansion of its deserts particularly the gobi desert 131 132 although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern china each spring which then spread to other parts of east asia including japan and korea china s environmental watchdog sepa stated in 2007 that china is losing 4 000km2 1 500sqmi per year to desertification 133 water quality erosion and pollution control have become important issues in china s relations with other countries melting glaciers in the himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people 134 china has a very agriculturally suitable climate and has been the largest producer of rice wheat tomatoes brinjal grapes water melon spinach in the world 135 china is one of 17 megadiverse countries 136 lying in two of the world s major biogeographic realms the palearctic

while regulations such as the 1979 environmental protection law are fairly stringent they are poorly enforced as they are frequently disregarded by local communities and government officials in favor of rapid economic development 153 urban air pollution is a severe health issue in the country yet matters have been improving in recent years the world bank estimated in 2016 that only 1 of the world s 20 most polluted cities is located in china making significant improvements since previous rankings 154 155 156 china is the country with the second highest death toll because of air pollution after india there are approximately 1 million deaths caused by exposure to ambient air pollution 157 158 china is the world s largest carbon dioxide emitter 159 the country also has significant water pollution problems 8 2 of china s rivers had been polluted by industrial and agricultural waste in 2019 and were unfit for use 160 161 in 2014 the internal freshwater resources per capita of china

chemical hazard which is mainly caused by lead pb chromium cr arsenic as cadmium cd mercury hg zinc zn copper cu cobalt co and nickel ni five metals among them pb cr as cd and hg are the key heavy metal pollutants in china heavy metal pollutants mainly come from mining sewage irrigation the manufacturing of metal containing products and other related production activities high level of heavy metal exposure can also cause permanent intellectual and developmental disabilities including reading and learning disabilities behavioral problems hearing loss attention problems and disruption in the development of visual and motor function according to the data of a national census of pollution china has more than 1 5 million sites of heavy metals exposure the total volume of discharged heavy metals in the waste water waste gas and solid wastes are around 900 000 tons each year from 2005 2011 165 however china is the world s leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization with 52billion invested in 2011 alone 166 167 168 it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local scale renewable energy projects 169 170 171 by 2015 over 24 of china s energy was derived from renewable sources while most notably from hydroelectric power a total installed capacity of 197 gw makes china the largest hydroelectric power producer in the world 172 173 china also has the largest power capacity of installed solar photovoltaics system and wind power system in the world 174 175 in 2011 the chinese government announced plans to invest four trillion yuan us 619 billion in water infrastructure and desalination projects over a ten year period and to complete construction of a flood prevention and anti drought system by 2020 163 176 in 2013

freedom of the press freedom of assembly the right to have children free formation of social organizations and freedom of religion 184 its current political ideological and economic system has been termed by its leaders as a consultative democracy people s democratic dictatorship socialism with chinese characteristics which is marxism adapted to chinese circumstances and the socialist market economy respectively 185 186 according to lutgard lams president xi is making great attempts to sinicize marxist leninist thought with chinese characteristics in the political sphere 187 since 2018 the main body of the chinese constitution declares that the defining feature of socialism with chinese characteristics is the leadership of the communist party of china cpc 188 the 2018 amendments

countries and maintains embassies in 162 its legitimacy is disputed by the republic of china and a few other countries it is thus the largest and most populous state with limited recognition in 1971 the prc replaced the republic of china as the sole representative of china in the united nations and as one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council 200 china was also a former member and leader of the non aligned movement and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries 201 along with brazil russia india and south africa china is a member of the brics group of emerging major economies and hosted the group s third official summit at sanya hainan in april 2011 202 under its interpretation of the one china policy beijing has made it a precondition to establishing diplomatic relations that the other country acknowledges its claim to taiwan and severs official ties with the government of the republic of china chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to taiwan 203 especially in the matter of armament sales 204 much of current chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on premier zhou enlai s five principles of peaceful coexistence and is also driven by the concept of harmony without uniformity which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences 205 this policy may have led china to support states that are regarded as dangerous or repressive by western nations such as zimbabwe north korea and iran 206 china has a close economic and military relationship with russia 207 and the two states often vote in unison in the un security council 208 209 210 china became the world s largest trading nation in 2013 as measured by the sum of imports and exports 211 by 2016 china was the largest trading partner of 124 other countries 212 in 2019 china s exports of goods and services was 2 5 trillion and imports was 2 1 trillion thus resulting in 4 6 trillion of foreign trade citation needed in recent decades china has played an increasing role in calling for free trade areas and security pacts amongst its asia pacific neighbours china became a member of the world trade organization wto on 11 december 2001 in 2004 it proposed an entirely new east asia summit eas framework as a forum for regional security issues 213 the eas which includes asean plus three india australia and new zealand held its inaugural summit in 2005 china is also a founding member of the shanghai cooperation organization sco along with russia and the central asian republics china has had a long and complex trade relationship with the united states in 2000 the united states congress approved permanent normal trade relations pntr with china allowing chinese exports in at the same low tariffs as goods from most other countries 214 china has a significant trade surplus with the united states its most important export market 215 in the early 2010s us politicians argued that the chinese yuan was significantly undervalued giving china an unfair trade advantage 216 217 218 since the turn of the century china has followed a policy of engaging with african nations for trade and bilateral co operation 219 220 221 in 2012 sino african trade totalled over us 160 billion 222 china maintains healthy and highly diversified trade links with the european union china has furthermore strengthened its ties with major south american economies becoming the largest trading partner of brazil 223 and building strategic links with argentina 224 china s belt and road initiative has expanded significantly over the last six years and as of 2019 includes 137 countries and 30 international organizations 225 ever since its establishment after the second chinese civil war the prc has claimed the territories governed by the republic of china roc a separate political entity today commonly known as taiwan as a part of its territory it regards the island of taiwan as its taiwan province kinmen and matsu as a part of fujian province and islands the roc controls in the south china sea as a part of hainan province and guangdong province these claims are controversial because of the complicated cross strait relations with the prc treating the one china policy as one of its most important diplomatic principles 226 in addition to taiwan china is also involved in other international territorial disputes since the 1990s china has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders including a disputed border with india and an undefined border with bhutan china is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the east and south china seas such as the senkaku islands and the scarborough shoal 227 228 on 21 may 2014 xi jinping speaking at a conference in shanghai pledged to settle china s territorial disputes peacefully china stays committed to seeking peaceful settlement of disputes with other countries over territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests he said 229 china is regularly hailed as a potential new superpower 230 231 with certain commentators citing its rapid economic progress growing military might very large population and increasing international influence as signs that it will play a prominent global role in the 21st century 232 233 others however warn that economic bubbles and demographic imbalances could slow or even halt china s growth as the century progresses 234 235 some authors also question the definition of superpower arguing that china s large economy alone would not qualify it as a superpower and noting that it lacks the military power and cultural influence of the united states 236 others namely irena have argued that china s investment in renewable energy has positioned it to be a likely superpower in that area especially due to a shift in global trade relations 237 the chinese democracy movement social activists and some members of the communist party of china believe in the need for social and political reform while economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in china since the 1970s political freedom is still tightly restricted the constitution of the people s republic of china states that the fundamental rights of citizens include freedom of speech freedom of the press the right to a fair trial freedom of religion universal suffrage and property rights however in practice these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state 238 239 although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling communist party are tolerated censorship of political speech and information most notably on the internet 240 241 are routinely used to prevent collective action 242 by 2020 china plans to give all its citizens a personal social credit score based on how they behave 243 the social credit system now being piloted in a number of chinese cities is considered a form of mass surveillance which uses big data analysis technology 244 245 in 2005 reporters without borders ranked china 159th out of 167 states in its annual world press freedom index which indicates a very low level of press freedom 246 in 2014 china ranked 175th out of 180 countries 247 rural migrants to china s cities often find themselves treated as second class citizens by the hukou household registration system which controls access to state benefits 248 249 property rights are often poorly protected 248 however a number of rural taxes have been reduced or abolished since the early 2000s and additional social services provided to rural dwellers 250 251 a number of foreign governments foreign press agencies and ngos have criticized china s human rights record alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial forced abortions 252 forced confessions torture restrictions of fundamental rights 184 253 and excessive use of the death penalty 254 255 the government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to social stability as was the case with the tiananmen square protests of 1989 falun gong was first taught publicly in 1992 in 1999 when there were about 70 million practitioners 256 the persecution of falun gong began resulting in mass arrests extralegal detention and alleged reports of torture and deaths in custody 257 258 the chinese state is regularly accused of large scale repression and human rights abuses in tibet and xinjiang including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression 259 260 at least one million members of china s muslim uyghur minority have been detained in mass detention camps termed vocational education and training centers aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees their identities and their religious beliefs 261 the camps were established under general secretary xi jinping s administration 262 in january 2019 the united nations asked for direct access to the detention camps after a panel said it had received credible reports that 1 1 million uygur kazakhs hui and other ethnic minorities had been detained in these camps 263 the state has also sought to control offshore reporting of tensions in xinjiang intimidating foreign based reporters by detaining their family members 264 the chinese government has responded to foreign criticism by arguing that the right to subsistence and economic development is a prerequisite to other types of human rights and that the notion of human rights should take into account a country s present level of economic development 265 it emphasizes the rise in the chinese standard of living literacy rate and average life expectancy since the 1970s as well as improvements in workplace safety and efforts to combat natural disasters such as the perennial yangtze river floods 266 267 268 furthermore some chinese politicians have spoken out in support of democratization although others remain more conservative 269 some major reform efforts have been conducted for instance in november 2013 the government announced plans to relax the one child policy and abolish the much criticized re education through labour program 123 although human rights groups note that reforms to the latter have been largely cosmetic 257 during the 2000s and early 2010s the chinese government was increasingly tolerant of ngos that offer practical efficient solutions to social problems but such third sector activity remained heavily regulated 270 after xi jinping succeeded general secretary of the communist party of china in 2012 human rights in china have become worse 271 the global slavery index estimated that in 2016 more than 3 8 million people were living in conditions of modern slavery or 0 25 of the population including victims of human trafficking forced labor forced marriage child labor and state imposed forced labor all except the last category are illegal the state imposed forced system was formally abolished in 2013 but it is not clear the extent to which its various practices have stopped 272 the chinese penal system includes labor prison factories detention centers and re education camps which fall under the heading laogai reform through labor the laogai research foundation in the united states estimated that there were over a thousand slave labour prisons and camps known collectively as the laogai 273 prisoners are not paid at all and need their families to send money to them prisoners who refuse to work are beaten and some are beaten to death many of the prisoners are political or religious dissidents and some are recognized internationally as prisoners of conscience a chinese leader said that they want to see two products coming out of the prisons the man who has been reformed and the product made by the man harry wu himself a former prisoner of the laogai filmed undercover footage of the laogai and was charged with stealing state secrets for this harry wu was sentenced to 15 years in prison but only served 66 days before being deported to the united states 274 in 2019 a world first study called for the mass retraction of more than 400 scientific papers on organ transplantation because of fears the organs were obtained unethically from chinese prisoners the study was published in the medical journal bmj open a report published in 2016 found a large discrepancy between official transplant figures from the chinese government and the number of transplants reported by hospitals while the government says 10 000 transplants occur each year hospital data shows between 60 000 and 100 000 organs are transplanted each year the report provided evidence that this gap is being made up by executed prisoners of conscience 275 with 2 3 million active troops the people s liberation army pla is the largest standing military force in the world commanded by the central military commission cmc 276 china has the second biggest military reserve force only behind north korea the pla consists of the ground force plagf the navy plan the air force plaaf and the people s liberation army rocket force plarf according to the chinese government china s military budget for 2017 totalled us 151 5 billion constituting the world s second largest military budget although the military expenditures gdp ratio with 1 3 of gdp is below world average 277 however many authorities including sipri and the u s office of the secretary of defense argue that china does not report its real level of military spending which is allegedly much higher than the official budget 277 278 as a recognized nuclear weapons state china is considered both a major regional military power and a potential military superpower 279 according to a 2013 report by the us department of defense china fields between 50 and 75 nuclear icbms along with a number of srbms 280 however compared with the other four un security council permanent members china has relatively limited power projection capabilities 281 to offset this it has developed numerous power projection assets since the early 2000s its first aircraft carrier entered service in 2012 282 283 284 and it maintains a substantial fleet of submarines including several nuclear powered attack and ballistic missile submarines 285 china has furthermore established a network of foreign military relationships along critical sea lanes 286 china has made significant progress in modernising its air force in recent decades purchasing russian fighter jets such as the sukhoi su 30 and also manufacturing its own modern fighters most notably the chengdu j 10 j 20 and the shenyang j 11 j 15 j 16 and j 31 282 287 china is furthermore engaged in developing an indigenous stealth aircraft and numerous combat drones 288 289 290 air and sea denial weaponry advances have increased the regional threat from the perspective of japan as well as washington 291 292 china has also updated its ground forces replacing its ageing soviet derived tank inventory with numerous variants of the modern type 99 tank and upgrading its battlefield c3i and c4i systems to enhance its network centric warfare capabilities 293 in addition china has developed or acquired numerous advanced missile systems 294 295 including anti satellite missiles 296 cruise missiles 297 and submarine launched nuclear icbms 298 according to the stockholm international peace research institute s data china became the world s third largest exporter of major arms in 2010 14 an increase of 143 percent from the period 2005 09 299 sipri also calculated that china surpassed russia to become the world s second largest arms exporter by 2020 300 chinese officials stated that spending on the military will rise to u s 173b in 2018 301 in the period of 2014 2018 china was the fifth largest exporter of major arms in the world with an increase of 2 7 compared to the previous period 302 in august 2018 china tested its first hypersonic flight the china academy of aerospace aerodynamics caaa claims to have successfully conducted the test with the aircraft starry sky 2 that touched a speed of mach 6 which is six times the speed of sound that can carry nuclear missiles 303 since 2010 china had the world s second largest economy in terms of nominal gdp 305 totaling approximately us 13 5 trillion 90 trillion yuan as of 2018 306 in terms of purchasing power parity ppp gdp china s economy has been the largest in the world since 2014 according to the world bank 307 according to the world bank china s gdp grew from 150 billion in 1978 to 13 6 trillion by 2018 308 china s economic growth has been consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978 309 china is also the world s largest exporter and second largest importer of goods 310 between 2010 and 2019 china s contribution to global gdp growth has been 25 to 39 311 312 china had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline 313 314 since economic reforms began in 1978 china has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing retail mining steel textiles automobiles energy generation green energy banking electronics telecommunications real estate e commerce and tourism china has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world shanghai hong kong and shenzhen that together have a market capitalization of over 10 trillion as of 2019 315 china has been the world s no 1 manufacturer since 2010 after overtaking the us which had been no 1 for the previous hundred years 316 317 china has also been no 2 in high tech manufacturing since 2012 according to us national science foundation 318 china is the second largest retail market in the world next to the united states 319 china leads the world in e commerce accounting for 40 of the global market share in 2016 320 and more than 50 of the global market share in 2019 321 china is the world s leader in electric vehicles manufacturing and buying half of all the plug in electric cars bev and phev in the world in 2018 322 china had 174 gw of installed solar capacity by the end of 2018 which amounts to more than 40 of the global solar capacity 323 324 as of 2018 china was first in the world in total number of billionaires and second in millionaires there were 658 chinese billionaires 325 and 3 5 million millionaires 326 however it ranks behind over 70 countries out of around 180 in per capita economic output making it a middle income country 327 additionally its development is highly uneven its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions 328 china brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history 329 between 1978 and 2018 china reduced extreme poverty by 800 million china reduced the extreme poverty rate per international standard it refers to an income of less than 1 90 day from 88 in 1981 to 1 85 by 2013 330 according to the world bank the number of chinese in extreme poverty fell from 756 million to 25 million between 1990 and 2013 331 china s own national poverty standards are higher and thus the national poverty rates were 3 1 in 2017 332 and 1 in 2018 333 in 2019 china overtook the us as the home to the highest number of rich people in the world according to the global wealth report by credit suisse 334 335 in other words as of 2019 100 million chinese are in the top 10 of the wealthiest individuals in the world those who have a net personal wealth of at least 110 000 336 from its founding in 1949 until late 1978 the people s republic of china was a soviet style centrally planned economy following mao s death in 1976 and the consequent end of the cultural revolution deng xiaoping and the new chinese leadership began to reform the economy and move towards a more market oriented mixed economy under one party rule agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized while foreign trade became a major new focus leading to the creation of special economic zones sezs inefficient state owned enterprises soes were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright resulting in massive job losses modern day china is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership 339 and is one of the leading examples of state capitalism 340 341 the state still dominates in strategic pillar sectors such as energy production and heavy industries but private enterprise has expanded enormously with around 30million private businesses recorded in 2008 342 343 344 345 in 2018 private enterprises in china accounted for 60 of gdp 80 of urban employment and 90 of new jobs 346 in 2015 china s middle class became the largest in the world 347 by 2019 there were more chinese than americans in the richest 10 of the people in the world 348 since economic liberalization began in 1978 china has been among the world s fastest growing economies 349 relying originally on investment and export led growth but now shifting more to consumption 350 351 352 in 2018 76 of growth in china s gdp came from consumption 353 according to the imf china s annual average gdp growth between 2001 and 2010 was 10 5 in the years immediately following the financial crisis of 2007 china s economic growth rate was equivalent to all of the g7 countries growth combined 354 according to the global growth generators index announced by citigroup in february 2011 china has a very high 3g growth rating 355 its high productivity low labor costs and relatively good infrastructure have made it a global leader in manufacturing china ranks no 1 in the production of steel aluminum and automobiles china s global market shares are 50 in steel 356 50 in aluminum 357 and 30 in automobile manufacturing 358 china has also been increasingly turning to automation becoming the world s largest market for industrial robots in 2013 between 2010 and 2015 china installed 90 000 industrial robots or one third of the world s total 359 in 2017 china bought 36 of all the new industrial robots in the world 360 china s plan is to also domestically design and manufacture 100 000 industrial robots by 2020 361 however the chinese economy is highly energy intensive and inefficient 362 china became the world s largest energy consumer in 2010 363 relies on coal to supply over 70 of its energy needs and surpassed the us to become the world s largest oil importer in 2013 364 365 in the last decade china has become 1 in the world in terms of installed solar power capacity hydro power and wind power according to the world economic forum china will account for 40 of the global renewable energy by 2022 366 in addition official gdp figures are seen as unreliable and there have been several well publicized cases of data manipulation 367 368 369 in the early 2010s china s economic growth rate began to slow amid domestic credit troubles weakening international demand for chinese exports and fragility in the global economy 370 371 372 china s gdp was smaller than germany s in 2007 however by 2017 china s 12 2 trillion economy became larger than those of germany uk france and italy combined 373 in 2018 the imf reiterated its forecast that china will overtake the us in terms of nominal gdp by the year 2030 374 economists also expect china s middle class to expand to 600 million people by 2025 375 tourism is a major contributor to the economy in 2017 this sector contributed about cny 8 77 trillion us 1 35 trillion 11 04 of the gdp and contributed direct and indirect employment of up to 28 25 million people there were 139 48 million inbound trips and five billion domestic trips 376 377 china is now no 1 in the number of skyscrapers buildings taller than 200m accounting for about 50 of world s total 378 in four years 2015 through 2018 china built 310 skyscrapers while the corresponding number for the us was 33 379 380 381 382 china is one of the world s most technologically advanced nations 383 384 it is the world s largest e commerce market amounting to 42 of the global market by 2016 385 and is expected to account for 55 of global e commerce retail sales in 2019 more than three times as large as the us market 386 china s e commerce market had online sales of more than 1 trillion in 2018 according to pwc 387 and is expected to be just under 2 trillion in 2019 388 china s e commerce industry took off in 2009 marked by the growth of internet giants tencent and alibaba purveyors of products such as wechat and tmall that have become ubiquitous in contemporary chinese life tencent s wechat pay and alibaba s ali pay have helped china become a world leader in mobile payments which amounted to about 30 trillion in china in 2017 and more than 40 trillion in 2018 389 390 china is also second only to the united states in venture capital activity and is home to a large number of unicorn startup companies 391 392 in 2018 china attracted 105 billion of venture capital investments amounting to 38 of global vc investments that year 393 in late 2018 the world s most valuable startup was bytedance a chinese company 394 and the two most valuable artificial intelligence ai startups in the world were sensetime and face both from china 395 in 2017 china s state council released its artificial intelligence development plan which declared ai technology a priority economic growth and investment sector 396 in 2018 china created 97 unicorns startups that are worth more than 1 billion which amounted to 1 unicorn every 3 8 days 397 chinese smartphone brands huawei xiaomi oppo vivo oneplus etc have captured more than 40 of the global market 398 399 by 2019 huawei had become the world s largest telecom infrastructure provider surpassing nokia and ericsson and had taken the lead in 5g technology 400 the company also entered the consumer smartphone and enterprise

world s largest flat panel display maker 404 didi world s largest and most valuable ride sharing company 405 and byd world s largest plug in vehicle maker including both bev and phev 406 china also the most number of supercomputers 227 out of the top 500 as of 2019 407 china is also the world leader in patents accounting for 1 54 million patents or almost half of all global patents in 2018 408 china s spending on r d has been growing rapidly in the last decade amounting to 277 billion in 2017 409 china is a member of the wto and is the world s largest trading power with a total

is a major owner of us public debt holding trillions of dollars worth of u s treasury bonds 419 420 china s undervalued exchange rate has caused friction with other major economies 217 421 422 and it has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods 423 424 china ranks 17th in the world in global innovation index not too far from the us which ranks 6th 426 china ranks 27th out of 137 countries in the 2017 2018 global competitiveness index 427 above many advanced economies and making it by far the most competitive major emerging economy this is largely owing to its strength in infrastructure and wide adoption of communication and information technology however it lags behind advanced economies in labor market efficiency institutional strength and openness of market competition especially for foreign players attempting to enter the domestic market 428 in 2018 fortune s global 500 list of the world s largest corporations included 120 chinese companies 338 many of the largest public companies in the world were chinese including the world s largest bank by total assets the industrial and commercial bank of china 429 following the 2007 08 financial crisis chinese authorities sought to actively wean off of its dependence on the u s dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system 430 to achieve those ends china took a series of actions to further the internationalization of the renminbi in 2008 china established dim sum bond market and expanded the cross border trade rmb settlement pilot project which helps establish pools of offshore rmb liquidity 431 432 this was followed with bilateral agreements to settle trades directly in renminbi with russia 433 japan 434 australia 435 singapore 436 the united kingdom 437 and canada 438 as a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi it became the eighth most traded currency in the world an emerging international reserve currency 439 and a component of the imf s special drawing rights however partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency it remains far behind the euro dollar and japanese yen in international trade volumes 440 china has had the world s largest middle class population since 2015 441 and the middle class grew to a size of 400 million by 2018 442 china s middle class population if defined as those with annual income of between us 10 000 and us 60 000 had reached more than 300million by 2012 443 wages in china have grown exponentially in the last 40 years real inflation adjusted wages grew seven fold from 1978 to 2007 444 by 2018 median wages in chinese cities such as shanghai were about the same as or higher than the wages in eastern european countries 445 more than 75 percent of china s urban consumers are expected to earn between 60 000 and 229 000 rmb per year by 2022 446 china has the world s second highest number of billionaires with nearly 400 as of 2018 increasing at the rate of roughly two per week 447 448 china s domestic retail market was worth over 20 trillion yuan us 3 2 trillion in 2012 449 and is growing at over 12 annually as of 2013 update 450 while the country s luxury goods market has expanded immensely with 27 5 of the global share 451 however in recent years china s rapid economic growth has contributed to severe consumer inflation 452 453 leading to increased government regulation 454 china has a high level of economic inequality 455 which has increased in the past few decades 456 in 2012 china s official gini coefficient was 0 474 457 458 a study conducted by southwestern university of finance and economics showed that china s gini coefficient actually had reached 0 61 in 2012 and top 1 chinese held more than 25 of china s wealth 459 by 2018 china s gini index had risen to 0 467 according to the world bank 13 china was once a world leader in science and technology up until the ming dynasty 460 ancient chinese discoveries and inventions such as papermaking printing the compass and gunpowder the four great inventions became widespread across east asia the middle east and later to europe chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers 461 462 by the 17th century europe and the western world surpassed china in scientific and technological advancement 463 the causes of this early modern great divergence continue to be debated by scholars to this day 464 after repeated military defeats by the european colonial powers and japan in the 19th century chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the self strengthening movement after the communists came to power in 1949 efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the soviet union in which scientific research was part of central planning 465 after mao s death in 1976 science and technology was established as one of the four modernizations 466 and the soviet inspired academic system was gradually reformed 467 since the end of the cultural revolution china has made significant investments in scientific research 469 and is quickly catching up with the us in r d spending 470 in 2017 china spent 279 billion on scientific research and development 471 according to oecd china spent 2 11 of its gdp on research and development r d in 2016 472 science and technology are seen as vital for achieving china s economic and political goals and are held as a source of national pride to a degree sometimes described as techno nationalism 473 nonetheless china s investment in basic and applied scientific research remains behind that of leading technological powers such as the united states and japan 469 474 according to the us national science board

china has the world s largest market for automobiles having surpassed the united states in both auto sales and production sales of passenger cars in 2016 exceeded 24million 536 a side effect of the rapid growth of china s road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents 537 with poorly enforced traffic laws cited as a possible cause in 2011 alone around 62 000 chinese died in road accidents 538 however the chinese government has taken a lot of steps to address this problem and has reduced the number of fatalities in traffic accidents by 20 from 2007 to 2017 539 in urban areas

about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping in 2017 the ports of shanghai hong kong shenzhen ningbo zhoushan guangzhou qingdao and tianjin ranked in the top 10 in the world in container traffic and cargo tonnage 558 water supply and sanitation infrastructure in china is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization as well as water scarcity contamination and pollution 559 according to data presented by the joint monitoring program for water supply and sanitation of who and unicef in 2015 about 36 of the rural population in china still did not have access to improved sanitation 560 in june 2010 there were 1 519 sewage treatment plants in china and 18 plants were added each week 561 the ongoing south north water transfer project intends to abate water shortage in the north 562 the national census of 2010 recorded the population of the people s republic of china as approximately 1 370 536 875 about 16 60 of the population were 14 years old or younger 70 14 were between 15 and 59 years old and 13 26 were over 60 years old 563 the population growth rate for 2013 is estimated to be 0 46 564 china used to make up much of the world s poor now it makes up much of the world s middle class 565 although a middle income country by western standards china s rapid growth has pulled hundreds of millions 800 million to be more precise 566 of its people out of poverty since 1978 by 2013 less than 2 of the chinese population lived below the international poverty line of us 1 9 per day down from 88 in 1981 330 china s own standards for poverty are higher and still the country is on its way to eradicate national poverty completely by 2019 567 from 2009 2018 the unemployment rate in china has averaged about 4 568 given concerns about population growth china implemented a two child limit during the 1970s and in 1979 began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family beginning in the mid 1980s however given the unpopularity of the strict limits china began to allow some major exemptions particularly in rural areas resulting in what was actually a 1 5 child policy from the mid 1980s to 2015 ethnic minorities were also exempt from one child limits the next major loosening of the policy was enacted in december 2013 allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child 569 in 2016 the one child policy was replaced in favor of a two child policy 570 data from the 2010 census implies that the total fertility rate may be around 1 4 although due to underreporting of births it may be closer to 1 5 1 6 571 according to one group of scholars one child limits had little effect on population growth 572 or the size of the total population 573 however these scholars have been challenged their own counterfactual model of fertility decline without such restrictions implies that china averted more than 500 million births between 1970 and 2015 a number which may reach one billion by 2060 given all the lost descendants of births averted during the era of fertility restrictions with one child restrictions accounting for the great bulk of that reduction 574 the policy along with traditional preference for boys may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth 575 576 according to the 2010 census the sex ratio at birth was 118 06 boys for every 100 girls 577 which is beyond the normal range of around 105 boys for every 100 girls 578 the 2010 census found that males accounted for 51 27 percent of the total population 577 however china s sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953 when males accounted for 51 82

chinese characters have been used as the written script for the sinitic languages for thousands of years they allow speakers of mutually unintelligible chinese varieties to communicate with each other through writing in 1956 the government introduced simplified characters which have supplanted the older traditional characters in mainland china chinese characters are romanized using the pinyin system tibetan uses an alphabet based on an indic script uyghur is most commonly written in persian alphabet based uyghur arabic alphabet the mongolian script used in china and the manchu script are both derived from the old uyghur alphabet zhuang uses both an official latin alphabet script and a traditional chinese character script china has urbanized significantly in recent decades the percent of the country s population living in urban areas increased from 20 in 1980 to over 55 in 2016 588 589 590 591 it is estimated that china s urban population will reach one billion by 2030 potentially

inhabitants 589 the figures in the table below are from the 2010 census 600 and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits a different ranking exists when considering the total municipal populations which includes suburban and rural populations the large floating populations of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult 601 the

international student assessment pisa a worldwide evaluation of 15 year old school pupils scholastic performance 615 despite the high results chinese education has also faced both native and international criticism for its emphasis on rote memorization and its gap in quality from rural to urban areas 616 there is an increasing number of top ranked international universities seeking influence in china in recent years washington university in st louis established an emba program with fudan university in 2002 which has since been constantly ranked as one of the best in the world 617 618 columbia global centers beijing opened in 2009 and harvard institute shanghai opened in 2010 619 two years later stanford university established an academic center in peking university 620 the

planning commission together with its counterparts in the local commissions oversees the health needs of the chinese population 624 an emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized chinese health policy since the early 1950s at that time the communist party started the patriotic health campaign which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene as well as treating and preventing several diseases diseases such as cholera typhoid and scarlet fever which were previously rife in china were nearly eradicated by the campaign after deng xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978 the health of the chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared along with the people s communes healthcare in china became mostly privatized and experienced a significant rise in quality in 2009 the government began a 3 year large scale healthcare provision initiative worth us 124 billion 625 by 2011 the campaign resulted in 95 of china s population having basic health insurance coverage 626 in 2011 china was estimated to be the world s third largest supplier of pharmaceuticals but its population has suffered from the development and distribution of counterfeit medications 627 as of 2017 update the average life expectancy at birth in china is 76 years 628 and

632 despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities china has several emerging public health problems such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution 633 hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers 634 and an increase in obesity among urban youths 635 636 china s large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks in recent years such as the 2003 outbreak of sars although this has since been largely contained 637 in 2010 air pollution caused 1 2 million premature deaths in china 638 the covid 19 pandemic was first identified in wuhan in december 2019 639 640 the chinese government has been criticized for its handling of the epidemic and accused of concealing the extent of the outbreak before it became an international pandemic 641 religion in china cfps 2014 642 643 note 2 the government of the people s republic of china officially espouses state atheism 644 and has conducted antireligious campaigns to this end 645 religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the state administration for religious affairs 646 freedom of religion is guaranteed by china s constitution although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution 253 647 over the millennia chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements the three teachings including confucianism taoism and buddhism chinese buddhism historically have a significant role in shaping chinese culture 648 649 enriching a theological and spiritual framework which harkens back to the early shang and zhou dynasty chinese popular or folk religion which is framed by the three teachings and other traditions 650 consists in allegiance to the shen a character that signifies the energies of generation who can be deities of the environment or ancestral principles of human groups concepts of civility culture heroes many of whom feature in chinese mythology and history 651 among the most popular cults are those of mazu goddess of the seas 652 huangdi one of the two divine patriarchs of the chinese race 652 653 guandi god of war and business caishen god of prosperity and richness pangu and many others china is home to many of the world s tallest religious statues including the tallest of all the spring temple buddha in henan clear data on religious affiliation in china is difficult to gather due to varying definitions of religion and the unorganized diffusive nature of chinese religious traditions scholars note that in china there is no clear boundary between three teachings religions and local folk religious practice 648 a 2015 poll conducted by gallup international found that 61 of chinese people self identified as convinced atheist 654 though it is worthwhile to note that chinese religions or some of their strands are definable as non theistic and humanistic religions since they do not believe that divine creativity is completely transcendent but it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being 655 according to a 2014 study approximately 74 are either non religious or practise chinese folk belief 16 are buddhists 2 are christians 1 are muslims and 8 adhere to other religions including taoists and folk salvationism 656 643 in addition to han people s local religious practices there are also various ethnic minority groups in china who maintain their traditional autochthone religions the various folk religions today comprise 2 3 of the population while confucianism as a religious self identification is common within the intellectual class significant faiths specifically connected to certain ethnic groups include tibetan buddhism and the islamic religion of the hui uyghur kazakh kyrgyz and other peoples in northwest china since ancient times chinese culture has been heavily influenced by confucianism for much of the country s dynastic era opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations which have their origins in the han dynasty 658 the literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in china such as the belief that calligraphy poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward looking national perspective 232 examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in china today 659 the first leaders of the people s republic of china were born into the traditional imperial order but were influenced by the may fourth movement and reformist ideals they sought to change some traditional aspects of chinese culture such as rural land tenure sexism and the confucian system of education while preserving others such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state some observers see the period following the establishment of the prc in 1949 as a continuation of traditional chinese dynastic history while others claim that the communist party s rule has damaged the foundations of chinese culture especially through political movements such as the cultural revolution of the 1960s where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed having been denounced as regressive and harmful or vestiges of feudalism many important aspects of traditional chinese morals and culture such as confucianism art literature and performing arts like peking opera 660 were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time access to foreign media remains heavily restricted 661 today the chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional chinese culture as being integral to chinese society with the rise of chinese nationalism and the end of the cultural revolution various forms of traditional chinese art literature music film fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival 662 663 and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide 664 china is now the third most visited country in the world 665 with 55 7million inbound international visitors in 2010 666 it also

zhou dynasty 668 concepts covered within the chinese classic texts present a wide range of thoughts and subjects including calendar military astrology herbology geography and many others 669 some of the most important early texts include the i ching and the shujing within the four books and five classics which served as the confucian authoritative books for the state sponsored curriculum in dynastic era 670 inherited from the classic of poetry classical chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the tang dynasty li bai and du fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively 671 chinese historiography began with the shiji the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in china is termed the twenty four histories which set a vast stage for chinese fictions along with chinese mythology and folklore 672 pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the ming dynasty chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the four great classical novels which include water margin romance of the three kingdoms journey to the west and dream of the red chamber 673 along with the wuxia fictions of jin yong and liang yusheng 674 it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the east asian cultural sphere 675 in the wake of the new culture movement after the end of the qing dynasty chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular chinese for ordinary citizens hu shih and lu xun were pioneers in modern literature 676 various literary genres such as misty poetry scar literature young adult fiction and the xungen literature which is influenced by magic realism 677 emerged following the cultural revolution mo yan a xungen literature author was

the eight major cuisines including sichuan cantonese jiangsu shandong fujian hunan anhui and zhejiang cuisines 680 all of them are featured by the precise skills of shaping heating colorway and flavoring 681 chinese cuisine is also known for its width of cooking methods and ingredients 682 as well as food therapy that is emphasized by traditional chinese medicine 683 generally china s staple food is rice in the south wheat based breads and noodles in the north the diet of the common people in pre modern times was largely grain and simple vegetables with meat reserved for special occasions

consumption 685 while pork dominates the meat market there is also the vegetarian buddhist cuisine and the pork free chinese islamic cuisine southern cuisine due to the area s proximity to the ocean and milder climate has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables it differs in many respects from the wheat based diets across dry northern china numerous offshoots of chinese food such as hong kong cuisine and american chinese food have emerged in the nations that play host to the chinese diaspora china has become a prime sports destination worldwide the country gained the hosting rights for several major global sports tournaments including the 2008 summer olympics the 2015 world championships in athletics the 2019 fiba basketball world cup and the upcoming 2022 winter olympics china has
