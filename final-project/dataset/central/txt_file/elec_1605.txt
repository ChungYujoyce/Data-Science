back one or not loading april 30 2016 justin schoville accomplished a rare feat for a protester at a trump event he managed to get himself thrown out three times just before donald trump s maiden foreign policy address at the mayflower hotel in washingtonon wednesday trump is a fascist we are a democracy he shouted during his second forced exit from the hotel lobby just a day before mr schoville a research analyst in bethesda voted for bernie sanders in the maryland primary but if the race comes down to mr trump vs hillary clinton he says he would vote for green party candidate jill stein even if it might help elect trump i can t in good conscience give my support to hillary clinton she represents the establishment the 1 percent and her policies i think will only deepen the problems that have caused donald trump to rise in the first place he says in most typical presidential elections voters like schoville might already have sighed and reluctantly thrown their support behind mrs clinton presidential primary races were all but over before the cherry trees blossomed along the potomac this year however the capital is deep into the azalea season andthe passions among voters and activists backing the underdogs are still blazing even as clinton and trump have now gained enough momentum to claim to be the presumptive nominees for november many voters are showing few signs of accepting that will they eventuallyrally around the presumptive leaders it s an oft repeated question every presidential campaign but the peculiar dynamics of this race make the answer less certain in the past disgruntled primary voters have rallied to the eventual nominee by one measure the tea party insurgents who seemingly held their nose to vote for mitt romney in 2012 were actually among his most active supporters during the general election there are indicators that the same thing could happen on the democratic side this time but clinton and trump are two of the three least popular presidential candidates of the past 24 years according to gallup and the question for republicans is reversed if mr trump wins will the moderate and establishment conservatives rally to his cause that answer appears less certain for their part sanders voters aren t conceding yet their candidate delivered another rock the rafters town hall meeting at gettysburg college in pennsylvania last friday just down the road from the site of pickett s charge that ended the confederate advance north on day 3 of the battle of gettysburg but clinton still swept four of five primaries this week along with enough delegates to put the nomination virtually out of reach for the vermont senator but whilesanders is already shifting gears away from winning the nomination to influencing the party s platform many of his supporters at the polling place on the gettysburg campus are still feeling bern and disappointed at the mounting prospect that clinton will be the nominee dana suitte who works for a printing company in gettysburg says she told her four sons to vote for sanders i really like the fact that he wants to look at everything and change anything that s not working while clinton comes off like a politician and is just running on her history with nothing original to say i think that she thinks that because a lot of black people voted for her husband they will automatically vote for her and that s not true says ms suitte who is black but her view could change if clinton picked sanders as a running mate she says i would love a woman to be president but i thought i wanted a little bit more from her the only upside is bill clinton s influence in the white house with her she adds bill clinton was a really good president that would be my only confidence on the republican side it s the antiestablishment side that triumphed as donald trump ran the table with outsize wins in pennsylvania maryland delaware connecticut and rhode island many republicans now face what some see as an even tougher choice over whether to support trump a recent gallup poll finds that 51 percent of democrats have a favorable view of both clinton and sanders but only 28 percent of republicans have a favorable view of both the top two gop candidates trump and sen ted cruz of texas robin williams beers a retired glass engraver who describes herself as a christian conservative attended a rally for ohio gov john kasich on the eve oftuesday sprimary vote in rockville md she stakes out a front row seat with her home made signs including resist the rage research think vote kasich in some respects she might seem a natural supporter for senator cruz or even trump who has drawn strong support from christian conservative voters in the south but she says that she had health issues at the start of the primary season and used her time in bed to read up on the candidates including governor kasich s account of the impact that bible study had on his life in his book every othermonday i feel like he unifies people and our country desperately needs that right now she says she showed up at the polls in kingsville md at6 30 a m to post signs for kasich as a volunteer and took down the signs at9 30 while at the polling venue many people asked me who would be the best vote to stop trump she said in a phone interview after the vote could she bring herself to vote for trump that s a very difficult thing to say in this point in time she says i m waiting and praying he does not have the magic number yet and so much has happened in this election that i hope that something will stop him from becoming the nominee when the time comes i ll cross that bridge when we come to it she says in an election that has so often defied expectations polls may not get to the critical question of whether voters will be motivated to turn out to vote for the nominee research shows that people who are most active for candidates who fail to get the nomination do not withdraw from general election activity but often become the most active it s a long way to november says ronald rapoport a political scientist at the college of william and mary in williamsburg va who has written extensively on ross perot voters and most recently tea party activists his own research working from a unique data set of surveys over time involving some 700 000 tea party supporters found that those who were the most active for tea party candidates like michele bachmann or herman cain were also the most active for mr romney in the general election so the good news for the republican party is that highly divisive primary contests between the tea party and establishment republicans did not undermine support for the party s nominee in the general election however it did produce significantly less positive ratings of the republican party he says a factor clearly in evidence in the antiestablishment surge backing trump but whether that carryover effect works in the opposite direction with establishment activists willing to work as hard for trump is not clear moreover trump is scarier to people than hillary a factor that could help disappointed sanders activists get behind clinton get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox but sharon wildberger a graduate student at george washington university also protesting trump outside the mayflower hotel isn t one of them she says that she strongly opposes trump but can t support clinton s hawkish foreign policy even in a general election somebody has to beat him but it doesn t mean i have to vote for her she says link
