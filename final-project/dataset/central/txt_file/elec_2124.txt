the five most recent christian science articles with a spiritual perspective every monday despite donald trump s and hillary clinton s unpopularity there is no third party choice polling above the 15 percent threshold to appear in presidential debates loading july 12 2016 polling suggests presumptive republican nominee donald trump and presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton are the least popularnominees since 1992 when independent ross perot captured nearly 20 percent of the vote but this time around no other candidates are polling above 10 percent leaving voters with just two candidates who appear nationally competitive fewer than half of voters registered in either party are happy with their choices for president with only 43 percent of democrats and 40 percent of republicans satisfied with the options according to a recent pew research poll forty one percent of voters say neither of the major party candidates would make a good president nevertheless neither libertarian party nominee gary johnson nor the green party s presumptive nominee jill stein are polling well enough to participate in the debates despite some americans hope for a more competitive independent candidate to appear none have arisen increased partisan polarization has left about 40 percent of each party completely committed to their party s nominee says lara brown the director of the political management program at george washington university s graduate school of political management in an interview with the christian science monitor we don t have that type of independent thinking or thought among those who are activist partisans she says they re focusing on making sure the other side doesn t win america s current political structure especially the electoral college stands in the way of a viable third party candidacy dr brown says former new york city mayor michael bloomberg considered an independent bidthis cycle but decided that even if he won the most popular votes no candidates would get an electoral college majority in a three way race sending the election to congress the electoral college allows both of the major political parties to make the argument that voting for a third party candidate could throw the election walter stone a professor at the university of california davis tells the monitor if you take away the winner take all aspect of the electoral college at least the wasted vote problem goes away in principle he says it s very easy for the major party candidate who is threatened by the third party to make the case that this is just going to help the worst candidate and the more polarized the system is the worse the worst candidate looks to your potential supporters partisan voters worry that voting for a third party candidate who may more closely align with their views may throw the election to the major party candidate they like less as many believe ralph nader did as the green party candidate in the 2000 election between al gore and george w bush the current ideological positioning of the two major parties leaves little room for a third party option says john aldrich a professor of political science at duke university candidates running as populists have seen the most third party success such as perot in 1992 and george wallace in 1968 during the 2016 primaries however that lane was filled by donald trump on the right and bernie sanders on the left blocking any possible populist third party bids by the time it became clear who the two nominees would be filing deadlines to appear on the ballot were rapidly approaching a very public effort to recruit a like minded third party option from the editor of the conservative publication the weekly standard bill kristol proved unsuccessful leaving the voters with trump clinton johnson and stein as the leading candidates when voters are presented with those four candidates johnson receives 6 7 percent according to the most recent polling averages from realclear politics while stein receives 3 5 percent both numbers are wellbelow the 15 percent threshold for debate entry the debates would certainly raise viability dr stone from uc davis says they convey a sense of legitimacy so that would be crucial publicity aside lesser known candidates views can also present stumbling blocks johnson s libertarian ideals for example appeal only to about ten percent of the electorate aldrich estimates stone agrees that johnson s policy positions prevent him from being a true contender both johnson the former governor of new mexico and stein an activist and physician are currently polling much higher than they finished when they ran in 2012 however that year johnson finished with almost 1 3 million votes just under 1 percent of the vote stein received 469 627 votes or 0 36 percent of the total this year will likely be an above average year for third party candidates brown says on average they get less than 3 percent of the total vote but it is feasible that johnson and stein could capture around 10 percent collectively she estimates but the chances of a third party candidate winning is stymied by current political polarization combined with the structural challenges faced by the plurality electoral system which fundamentally fosters two party competition get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox if a win by hillary clinton is widely expected as the election approaches however more members of the progressive left could vote for stein while more republicans may decide to vote for johnson i really think the popularity of the third party candidates this time around as a protest vote because that s likely what it would be is really going to be more about how much do people feel the other race is already decided brown says link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to the christian science monitor has expired you can renew
