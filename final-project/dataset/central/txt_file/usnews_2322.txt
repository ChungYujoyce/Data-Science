president donald trump delivered his second state of the union address before a joint session of congress on tuesday night the address was originally rescheduled for jan 29 but house speaker nancy pelosi asked trump to reschedule it in light of the partial government shutdown the government reopened on jan 25 after congress agreed to a 3 week funding stopgap but the government could come to a halt again on feb 15 if congress is unable to reach a compromise on a homeland security funding bill during the speech which lasted approximately an hour trump touched on many of his many favorite topics including the dangers of illegal immigration and the strength of the economy trump made several digressions from the written transcript that shifted the meaning of what he said for instance while in the prepared speech trump was supposed to say legal immigrants enrich our nation in countless ways i want people to come into our country but they have to come in legally he actually said legal immigrants enrich our nation in countless ways i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally the guests invited by the president and congressional democrats reflected the deep divisions in american politics trump s guests included three family members of a reno nevada couple allegedly killed by an undocumented immigrant whereas democratic sen jeff merkley invited albertina and yaquelin contreras a mother and daughter who were separated for nearly six weeks by u s immigration authorities and were later featured on time s feb 4 cover trump s speech was followed by a democratic response by stacey abrams who narrowly lost the georgia gubernatorial race this fall but is considered to be a rising democratic political star read

moment of unlimited potential as we begin a new congress i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic break troughs for all americans millions of our fellow citizens are watching us now gathered in this great chamber hoping we will govern not as two parties but as one nation the agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda it s the agenda of the american people many of us have campaigned on the same core promises to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers to rebuild and revitalize our nation s infrastructure to reduce the price of health care and prescription drugs to create an immigration system that is safe lawful modern and secure and to pursue a foreign policy that puts america s interests first there is a new opportunity in american politics if only we have the courage together to seize it victory is not winning for our party victory is winning for our country this year america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of america s mission and the power of american pride in june we mark 75 years since the start of what general dwight d eisenhower called the great crusades the allied liberation in europe on d day june 6 1944 15 000 young american men jumped from the sky and 60 000 more stormed in from the sea to save our civilization from tyranny here with us tonight are three of those incredible heroes private first class joseph riley staff sergeant irving locker and sergeant herman zeitchiek gentlemen we salute you in 2019 we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon half a century later we are joined by one of the apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag buzz aldrin thank you buzz american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets in the 20th century america save freedom redefined the middle class and when you get down to it there s nothing anywhere in the world that can compete with america now we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this next great american adventure and we must create a new standard of living for the new 21st century amazing quality of life for all of our american citizens is within reach we can make our communities safer our families stronger our culture richer our faith deeper and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before but we must reject the politics of revenge resistance and retribution and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation compromise and the common good together we can break decades of political stalemate we can bridge old divisions heal old wounds build new coalitions forge new solutions and unlock the extraordinary promise of america s future the decision is ours to make we must choose between greatness or gridlock results or resistance vision or vengeance incredible progress or pointless destruction tonight i ask you to choose greatness over the last two years my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades in just over two years since the election we have launched an unprecedented economic boom a boom that has rarely been seen before there s been nothing like it we have created 5 3 million new jobs and importantly added 600 000 new manufacturing jobs something which almost everyone said was impossible to do but the fact is we are just getting started wages are rising at the fastest pace if decades and growing for blue collar workers who i promised to fight for they re growing faster than anyone else thought possible nearly five million americans have been lifted off food stamps the u s economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world not even close unemployment has reached the lowest rate in over half a century african american hispanic american and asian american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an all time low more people are working now than at any time in the history of our country 157 million people at work we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit we virtually ended the estate tax or death tax as it is often called on small businesses for ranches and also for family farms we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty and to give critically ill patients access to life saving cures we passed very importantly right to try my administration has cut more regulations in a short period of time than any other administration during its entire tenure companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations and we have unleashed a revolution in american energy the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world and now for the first time in 65 years we are a net exporter of energy after 24 months of rapid progress our economy is the envy of the world our military is the most powerful on earth by far and america is again winning each and every day members of congress the state of our union is strong that sounds so good our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before when friday it was announced that we added another 304 000 jobs last month alone almost double the number expected an economic miracle is taking place in the united states and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan investigations if there is going to be peace and legislation there cannot be war and investigation it just doesn t work that way we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate in some cases years and years waiting not right the senate has failed to act on these nominations which is unfair to the nominees and very unfair to our country now is the time for a bipartisan action believe it or not we have already proven that that s possible in the last congress both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis a sweeping new farm bill historic v a reforms and after four decades of rejection we passed v a accountability so that we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans and just weeks ago both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform they said it couldn t be done last year i heard through friends the story of alice johnson i was deeply moved in 1997 alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first time nonviolent drug offender over the next 22 years she became a prison minister inspiring others to choose a better path she had a big impact on that prison population and far beyond alice s story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing and the need to remedy this total injustice she served almost that 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the remainder of her life in june i commuted alice s sentence when i saw alice s beautiful family greet her at the prison gates hugging and kissing and crying and laughing i knew i did something right alice is with us tonight and she is a terrific woman terrific alice please thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny thank you very much alice inspired by stories like hers my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african american community the first step act gives nonviolent offenders re enter society now states across the country are following our lead america is a nation that believes in redemption we are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee in 1996 at the age of 30 matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses over the next two decades he completed more than 30 bible studies became a law clerk and mentored many of his fellow inmates now matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act matthew please thank you matthew welcome home now republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government protect our homeland and secure our very dangerous southern border now is the time for congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes cartels and human traffickers out of business as we speak large organized caravans are on the march to the united states we have just heard that mexican cities in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection i have ordered another 3 750 troops to our southern border to prepare for this tremendous onslaught this is a moral issue of the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety and security and financial well being of all america we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today who follow the rules and respected our laws legal immigrants enrich our nation in countless ways i want people to come into our country in the largest numbers ever but they have to come in legally tonight i m asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country no issue better illustrates the divide between america s working class and america s political class than illegal immigration wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls gates and guards meanwhile working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration reduce jobs lower wages overburden schools hospitals that are so crowded that you can t get in increase crime and a depleted social safety net tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate it is actually very cruel one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north smugglers use migrant children as pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern day slavery tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl the savage gang ms 13 now operates in at least 20 different american states and they almost all come through our southern border just yesterday an ms 13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city we are removing these gang members by the thousands but until we secure our border they are going to keep streaming right back in year after year countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens i have gotten to know many wonderful angel moms dads and families no one should have to suffer the horrible heartache that they have had to endure here tonight is debra bissell just three weeks ago her parents gerald and sharon were burglarized and shot to death in their reno nevada home by an illegal alien they were in their 80 s and survived by four children 11 grandchildren and 20 great grandchildren also here tonight are gerald and sharon s granddaughter heather and great granddaughter madison and please stand few can understand your pain thank you and thank you for being here thank you very much i will never forget and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon that it should never happen again not one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border in the last two years our brave ice officers made 266 000 arrests of criminal aliens including those charged or convicted of nearly 100 000 assaults 30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 killings or murders we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes ice special agent elvin hernandez when elvin was a boy he and his family came to the united states from the dominican republic at the age of eight he told his dad he wanted to become a special agent today he leads investigations into the scores of international sex trafficking elvin says that if i couldn t make sure these young girls get their justice i ve really done my job thanks to his work and that of his incredible colleagues more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from the horror of this terrible situation and more than 1 500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement and i pledge to you tonight that i will never abolish our heroes from ice thank you my administration has sent to congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on the southern border it includes the humanitarian assistance more law enforcement drug detection at our ports closing loopholes that enable child smuggling and plans for a new physical barrier or wall to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry in the past most of the people in this room voted for a wall but the patrol wall never got built i will get it built this is a smart strategic see through steel barrier not just a simple concrete wall it will be deployed in the areas identified by the border agents as having the greatest need and these agents will tell you where walls go up illegal crossings go way way down san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in our country in response a strong security wall was put in place this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings the border city of el paso texas used to have extremely high rates of violent crime one of the highest in the entire country and considered one of our nation s most dangerous cities now immediately upon its building with a powerful barrier in place el paso is one of the safest cities in our country simply put walls work and walls save lives so let s work together compromise and reach a deal that will truly make america safe as we work to defend our people s safety we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace no one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women who have filled 58 percent of the newly created jobs last year you weren t supposed to do that thank you very much thank you very much all americans can be proud that we have more women in the work force than ever before don t sit yet you re going to like this and exactly one century after congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote we also have more women serving in congress than at any time before that s great and congratulations that s great as part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere this thursday we are launching the first ever government wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries to build on our incredible economic success one priority is paramount reversing decades of calamitous trade policies so bad we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries and stealing our intellectual property the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end therefore we recently imposed tariffs on 250 billion of chinese goods and now our treasury is receiving billions and billions of dollars but i don t blame china for taking advantage of us i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen i have great respect for president xi and we are now working on a new trade deal with china but it must include real structural change to end unfair trade practices reduce our chronic trade deficit and protect american jobs another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta i have met the men and women of michigan ohio pennsylvania indiana new hampshire and many other states whose dreams were shattered by the signing of nafta for years politicians promised them they would renegotiate for a better deal but no one ever tried until now our new u s mexico canada agreement the usmca will replace nafta and deliver for american workers like they haven t had delivered to for a long time i hope you can pass the usmca into law so that we can bring back our manufacturing jobs in even greater numbers expand american agriculture protect intellectual property and ensure that more cars are proudly stamped with our four beautiful words made in the u s a tonight i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product we can charge them the exact same tariff on the exact same product that they sell to us both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america s crumbling infrastructure i know that congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future this is not an option this is a necessity the next major priority for me and for all of us should be to lower the cost of health care and prescription drugs and to protect patients with pre existing conditions already as a result of my administration s efforts in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years but we must do more it s unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs often made in the exact same place this is wrong this is unfair and together we will stop it and we ll stop it fast i am asking congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients finally we should also require drug companies insurance companies and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs way down no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against h i v and aids scientific breakthroughs have brought a once distant dream within reach my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the h i v epidemic in the united states within 10 years we have made incredible strides incredible together we will defeat aids in america and beyond tonight i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind the fight against childhood cancer joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl grace eline every birthday hi grace every birthday since she was 4 grace asked her friends to donate to st jude s children s hospital she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself that s what happened last year grace was diagnosed with brain cancer immediately she began radiation treatment at the same time she rallied her community and raised more than 40 000 for the fight against cancer when grace completed treatment last fall her doctors and nurses cheered i love her and still love her with tears in her eyes and hung up a poster that read last day of chemo thank you very much grace you are a great inspiration to everyone in this room thank you very much many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies we will ask for 500 million to fund this critical life saving research to help support working parents the time has come to pass school choice for america s children i m also proud to be the first president to include in my budget for a nationwide paid family leave so every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days lawmakers in new york cheered with the life upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother s womb moments from birth these are living feeling beautiful babies who will never share their love and dreams with the world and then we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth to defend the dignity of every person i am asking congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late term abortion of children who can feel pain in a mother s womb let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth all children born and unborn are made in the holy image of god the final part of my agenda is to protect american security over the last two years we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military with 700 billion last year and 716 billion this year we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share finally for years the united states was being treated very unfairly by friends of ours members of nato but now we have secured over the last couple of years more than 100 billion of increase in defense spending from our nato allies they said it couldn t be done as part of our military buildup the united states is developing a state of the art defense missile system and under my administration we will never apologize for advancing america s interests for example decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capability while we followed the agreement and the rules to the letter russia repeatedly violated its terms been going on for many years that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or inf treaty we really have no choice perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement adding china and others or perhaps we can t in which case we will outspend and out innovate all others by far as part of a bold new diplomacy we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula our hostages have come home nuclear testing has stopped and there has not been a missile launch in more than 15 months if i had not been elected president of the united states we would right now in my opinion be in a major war with north korea much work remains to be done but my relationship with kim jong un a good one we will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam two weeks ago the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela and its new president juan guaido we stand with the venezuelan people and their noble quest for freedom and we condemn the brutality of their regime whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair here in the united states we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country america was founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion domination and control we are born free and we will stay free tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country one of the most complex set of challenges we face and have for many years is in the middle east our approach is based on principle realism not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress for this reason my administration recognized the true capital of israel and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years in afghanistan and iraq nearly 7 000 american heroes have given their lives more than 52 000 americans have been badly wounded we have spent more than 7 trillion in fighting wars in the middle east as a candidate for president i loudly pledged a new approach great nations do not fight endless wars when i took office isis controlled more than 20 000 square miles in iraq and syria just two years ago today we have liberated virtually all of the territory from the grip of these blood thirsty monsters now as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home i have also accelerated our negotiations to reach if possible a political settlement in afghanistan the opposing side is also very happy to be negotiating our troops have fought with unmatched valor and thanks to their bravery we are now able to pursue a possible political solution to this long and bloody conflict in afghanistan my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups including the taliban as we make progress in these negotiations we will be able to reduce our troop s presence and focus on counter terrorism and we will indeed focus on counter terrorism we don t know whether we will achieve an agreement but we do know after two decades of war the hour has come to at least try for peace and the other side would like to do the same thing it s time above all friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation s power and will to defend our people eighteen years ago violent terrorists attacked the uss cole and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of that attack we are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley whose son navy seaman craig wibberley was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost tom we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole thank you tom my administration has acted decisively to confront the world s leading state sponsor of terror the radical regime in iran it is a radical regime they do bad bad things to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal and last fall we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed by us on a country we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people we must never ignore the vial poison of antisemitism or those who spread its venomous creed with one voice we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs just months ago 11 jewish americans were viciously murdered in an antisemitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh swat officer timothy matson raced into the gun fire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer and he was very successful timothy has just had his 12th surgery and he s going in for many more but he made the trip to be here with us tonight officer matson please thank you we are forever grateful thank you very much tonight we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began not only did he escape death last fall more than seven decades ago he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps today is judah s 81st birthday they wouldn t do that for me judah judah says he can still remember the exact moment nearly 75 years ago after 10 months in a concentration camp when he and his family were put on a train and told they were going to another camp suddenly the train screeched to a very strong halt a soldier appeared judah s family braced for the absolute worst then his father cried out with joy it s the americans it s the americans thank you a second holocaust survivor who is here tonight was a prisoner at dachau he remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as american soldiers rolled in with tanks for me joshua recalls the american soldiers were proof that god exists and they came down from the sky they came down from heaven i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d day in the second world war one of them was herman but there is more to herman s story a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy herman was one of the american soldiers who helped liberate dachau he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth almost 75 years later herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight seated side by side here in the home of american freedom herman and joshua your presence this evening is very much appreciated thank you very much thank you when american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of d day 1944 they were just young men of 18 and 19 hurdling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war they did not know if they would survive the hour they did not know if they would grow old but they knew that america had to prevail their cause was this nation and generations yet unborn why did they do it they did it for america they did it for us everything that has come since our triumph over communism our giant leaps of science and discovery our unrivaled progress towards equality and justice all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before think of this capitol think of this very chamber where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery to build the railroads and the highways and defeat fascism to secure civil rights and to face down evil empires here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california together we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history what will we do with this moment how will we be remembered i ask the men and women of this congress look at the opportunities before us our most thrilling achievements are still ahead our most exciting journeys still await our biggest victories are still to come we have not yet begun to dream we must choose whether we are defined by our differences or whether we dare to transcend them we must choose whether we squander our great inheritance or whether we proudly declare that we are americans we do the incredible we defy the impossible we conquer the unknown this is the time to reignite the american imagination this is the time to search for the tallest summit and set our sights on the brightest star this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens as neighbors as patriots this is our future our fate and our choice to make i am asking you to choose greatness no matter the trials we face no matter the challenges to come we must go forward together we must keep america first in our hearts we must keep freedom alive in our souls and we must always keep faith in america s destiny that one nation under god must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world thank you god bless you and god bless america thank you very much write to
