sen bernie sanders stood on a stage in iowa city s pedestrian mall staring out at a crowd of more than 1 300 on friday night it was a cold autumn night and his audience was a sea of bundled up supporters holding up signs and giant letters spelling out his name children looked on from a nearby playground here was a group within which were some of his most ardent supporters things have been looking up for the vermont senator since the start of october when he suffered a heart attack and in many ways despite taking time off to rest he s managed to convert the last month into one of the most successful in his 2020 democratic presidential campaign so far he s still polling in the top three he s shown he s one of the strongest fundraisers in the field and he s got the backing of the likes of new york rep alexandria ocasio cortez and minnesota rep ilhan omar two of the most recognizable progressive politicians in the nation but one of the questions hovering over his campaign is whether he can grow his base of support enough not only to win the nomination but also to beat president donald trump in 2016 sanders performed very well in iowa defying expectations when hillary clinton just barely beat him in many ways it was his competitive run overall that helped pave the way not just for his own candidacy but for a collectively more progressive field of candidates happy to take up the mantle he turned mainstream part of the challenge for sanders now is keeping the coalition he had in 2016 and expanding it that s a hard feat for any candidate in a still wide primary field but possibly especially so for someone who is no longer a fresh face it s hard to capture the same kind of energy two times in a row said tim gannon a former democratic candidate for iowa secretary of agriculture of sanders the dynamics are so much different he s not as much the insurgent because he ran last time and proved that he was popular and a lot of his ideas were popular especially among democrats so instead of running after a person who was very much the front runner he s among the hunted this time around and i think that there are candidates who have eaten into some of the support that he enjoyed last time sanders s campaign manager has recognized the need for additional voters telling the wall street journal this week that for a sanders victory he needs a mass mobilization of people who have not voted before in a note to sanders supporters on friday the campaign s iowa state director misty rebik said they had already collected more commitments to caucus for bernie sanders than we had on january 1 2016 this week sanders returned to iowa for an end corporate greed tour through the state accompanied by his wife jane in the last several days he s also been rolling out local endorsements in multiple states and he has planned travel to detroit to appear alongside rep rashida tlaib another member of the so called freshman squad in congress with a performance by jack white and several other scheduled rallies including one with omar at events in iowa this week he often brought up the ocasio cortez endorsement as well it remains to be seen whether buzz created by such high profile endorsements will have any effect on voters weighing him as a potential candidate to support i think he s got a good line of support behind him and i think he can grow it that was actually if i had a chance i want to know from him how he plans on maybe trying to get republicans to come over and vote democratic said eva garcia 64 a waterloo resident who drove an hour to toledo iowa for a sanders town hall on friday though garcia said she caucused for sanders when he first ran for president she said she was maybe open to supporting someone else for many of his backers it s sanders s decades long commitment to a message that they point to as his strength and the reason they like him some of them also point to it as a reason for picking him over his progressive counterpart massachusetts sen elizabeth warren a close friend and senate colleague elizabeth warren is a neat person in a lot of ways but she is not bernie sanders bernie s got the track record he s been consistent all the way through said patrick bosold 70 a fairfield resident wearing a baseball tee with a young sanders on it that he picked up at a recent campaign event hosted in iowa s field of dreams on friday bosold volunteered with the sanders campaign for a press conference in newton iowa held at a maytag complex where sanders said it goes without saying he would support whomever became the democratic nominee even it it was not him i hope it s me sanders added sanders himself at events often notes how long he s been singing the same song asked at a league of united latin american citizens lulac event on thursday night in des moines how he distinguished himself from other candidates in a question specific to latino voters sanders relied exclusively on that argument what distinguishes my candidacy from the others is that i have been fighting for the working families of this country for many many decades i have walked on picket lines probably more picket lines over the years than all of my competitors have collectively sanders told an approving crowd where some supporters sat wearing unidos con bernie t shirts after facing criticism in his first run for not reaching out to minorities enough and having a largely white team the campaign has this time undertaken steps to address both in an attempt to shore up further support but it will be voters from every corner of the democratic party that he will have to convince to back him to convince me to vote for someone else other than mayor pete buttigieg would be kind of hard said nancy sund 70 a toledo resident who attended sanders s town hall there on friday sund said she supported clinton in 2016 but after hearing so much about sanders in the last election cycle she said she wanted to see for herself whether he could be the right candidate for her i was impressed sund said of sanders after the town hall i don t know if it was enough to change my mind it s early yet write to lissandra
