especially as the nation heads into a divisive impeachment inquiry while the african american senator generates impressive enthusiasm from crowds he s still polling in the low single digits at a time when many democrats are furious with president donald trump and looking for a different kind of fighter the son of civil rights activists is trying to convince them that love is in fact the mightiest weapon with which to combat the nation s challenges i was raised by parents who did not flinch in telling me about the wretchedness of life about the bigotry and hate and violence he says in a phone interview but they taught me that you don t combat that by abandoning your virtues but by doubling down on them and that that is in fact a harder way it takes a toughness and a strength but ultimately it s the best way to heal to empower to strengthen to overcome the first time new hampshire state sen martha hennessey heard sen cory booker speak he reminded her of a baptist preacher he was so love and hope she says frankly i was almost in tears at the same time she thought to herself i m not sure america is going to like this this might be a little touchy feely senator hennessey and her husband hosted the presidential candidate overnight in early summertime as part of his circuit of homestays to get to know the state when he arrived at their home in hanover she was still driving back from a late session at the statehouse it was up to her husband to figure out what to feed an ex football star turned vegan the verdict rice cakes with freshly ground almond butter the next morning as the couple s maltese poodle mixes climbed into senator booker s lap the 50 year old bachelor chatted with them and at his staff s urging told them about his new girlfriend actress and activist rosario dawson it s like he was a friend that was visiting us from college says senator hennessey but while she enjoyed the visit the new hampshire democrat who d been hoping to endorse a female nominee wasn t ready to commit in this season of political courtship many voters so far seem to see senator booker as friend material he s not the one that they have a romantic interest in sayspatrick murray director of the monmouth university polling institute in new jersey who has been following the senator since he first ran for mayor of newark in 2002 thelatest monmouth pollshows senator booker in a five way tie for 8th place among democratic candidates with 1 of the vote many democrats are furious with president donald trump and looking for a fighter to lead them one voter even asked the athletic new jersey senator to punch the president in the face but senator booker is trying to convince them to take a different approach over and over the son of civil rights activists who for nearly two decades tested his ideals in newark s grittiest neighborhoods insists that love is the mightiest weapon with which to combat the nation s challenges i was raised by parents who did not flinch in telling me about the wretchedness of life about the bigotry and hate and violence he says in a phone interview but they taught me that you don t combat that by abandoning your virtues but by doubling down on them and that that is in fact a harder way it takes a toughness and a strength but ultimately it s the best way to heal to empower to strengthen to overcome if it weren t for a white new jersey lawyer moved by the 1965 showdown between civil rights protesters and police on the edmund pettus bridge senator booker may have never become the nation s ninth african american senator that lawyer who couldn t afford a ticket to join the protesters in alabama decided instead to offer pro bono legal work for the fair housing council several years later he played a role in helping cory booker s parents buy a home in predominantly white harrington park despite the virulent opposition of the real estate agent involved from that community of relative privilege young cory was able to springboard to stanford on a football scholarship then on to oxford as a rhodes scholar and finally to yale law school but it was in newark that he found and honed his sense of mission he moved into brick towers an apartment complex in the inner city that had fallen into disrepair and was turned over to newark s housing authority several years later the elevators were often broken and the stairwells littered with drug paraphernalia and feces it was a neighbor virginia jones who helped him see the potential of the city and its residents and it was she who held him when he emerged one morning devastated by the murder of a young man whom he had tried in vain to save the previous night ms jones who years before had lost her own son to a shooting urged him through his tears stay faithful for me newark was the best proving ground because i saw just awful awful realities says senator booker the experience he says made him understand the impulse to hate or the desire to lash out but what i also realized was that in the times where the most challenging hurtful painful things come forward you actually see the greatest of human spirit the greatest of human potential i saw people who were able to ignite the best in others and that s the model of leadership that i think we need at this time in america while cory booker may talk about love he harbors no illusions about the ugly realities of life or politics he knows what it s like to have a dirty diaper thrown at him as when as city councilman he was leading a 10 day hunger strike to protest inadequate policing of drug dealers or to be called a republican and a gay slur white boy by newark s five term incumbent mayor sharpe james who also alleged that his challenger was taking money from the ku klux klan in that 2002 contest featured in the oscar nominated documentary street fight cory booker lost to mr james by 6 percentage points four years later he came back to win by the largest margin in newark s history as mayor he teamed up with republican gov chris christie to secure a 100 million investment from facebook s mark zuckerberg in the city s schools and raised 300 million more through other philanthropicefforts as much as he did to champion newark some saw his ambitions for the city and himself as eclipsing the less glamorous parts of the job it s great to paint a house but he didn t care at all about the plumbing and the electric says a democratic operative in new jersey but honestly before him nobody cared about anything in newark the city has continued to attract developmentsince senator booker left for capitol hill in 2013 but it has also become engulfed in a lead watercrisis due to corroding pipes the booker campaign has vociferously denied that he bears any responsibility noting that city water tests two years after he left still bore no signs of elevated lead levels in his book united senator booker admits he too often tried to solve things personally he famously went into a burning building to rescue a woman and shoveled residents driveways during a blizzard critics have accused him of staging such stunts for political gain but whether he was moved by ambition genuine care or both he has lived the problems of inner city america in a way that few presidential candidates have there are a lot of places cory booker could have gone to be more powerful says herb jackson a veteran new jersey political reporter who covered his senate campaigns he is motivated by these things i think sincerely now in what senator booker calls a moral moment for the country he is highlighting that experience in an effort to persuade voters that he knows best how to unite the country around shared ideals i am here right now because a white guy on a couch at a time of moral trial in our nation did not just sit there he tells a crowd in bedford new hampshire on a late september morning he did not even know that i would one day exist but he stood up for the ideals of america and why am i running for president because they re in peril our dream is in trouble over the plinking of forks at politics eggs a staple on the new hampshire campaign circuit senator booker preaches his civic gospel in thundering tones he transportsthe crowd from the colonial charm of the bedford village inn to a memorial in memphis tennessee erected at the assassination site of martin luther king jr behold here cometh a dreamer let us slay him and see what becomes of his dream reads the plaque quoting from the biblical story of joseph who was thrown into a pit by his envious brothers senator booker a baptist sees it as a metaphor for the state of the nation america we are in a pit right now he tells the crowd we are in a pit right now when we hate each other just because we vote differently some might call senator booker himself a dreamer and not in a good way with 10 days left in september his campaign told supporters he might quit the race if they couldn t raise 1 7 million by the end of the month he wound up exceeding that goal by nearly half a million dollars bringing his total haul for the third quarter to 6 million but that s still less than a third of what mayor pete buttigieg ofsouth bend indiana raised and a fourth of vermont sen bernie sanders total a message of inclusiveness and cooperation isn t something that either party wants to hear right now says andrew smith director of the university of new hampshire survey center still he adds that could change before the new hampshire primary expected to be held feb 11 as the primary draws near and more voters start paying attention he says senator booker may see his support grow because then you re getting away from the activists and getting down to regular rank and file voters some 40 of the state s voters are independents and are allowed to vote in the democratic primary nationwide only 9 of democratssay they have made up their mind jon morgan was the first new hampshire state senator to endorse senator booker we need more people like cory booker to be involved in rebuilding our country after the damage of the past several years under this current administration he says in a phoneinterview hold on one second my 1 year old is trying to kill himself he adds as wailing can be heard in the background the 2020 results are incredibly important to me but i m more worried about the trajectory that we re on for the next generation of americans my kids included he says noting the increasing animosity between those with differing political opinions in mid september senator hennessey followed suit inendorsingsenator booker she noted that hechampionsmany of the same progressive ideals as his fellow democratic presidential contenders medicare for all gun licensing and an assault weapon ban equality for lgbtq people and creating a white house office of reproductive freedom for advancing abortion rights but it was his different tone she says focusing on unifying the country rather than pouring fuel on the anti trump bonfire that clinched her support i would love to just talk about all the things i can t stand about the current administration but i m not finding it very productive says senator hennessey i need hope i need myself to believe that not only can we get all the great progressive measures but also that we can learn to think about each other again and care for each other again and somehow put hatred aside back at politics eggs as senator booker is building to a crescendo phones start buzzing as official washington begins blowing up over the just released whistleblower complaint that has prompted an impeachment inquiry against president trump undeterred the senator goes on get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox
