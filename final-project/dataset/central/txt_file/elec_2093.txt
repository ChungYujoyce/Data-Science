democrats who were initially skeptical of the prospects for a brokered convention now see it as a likelier scenario with eight candidates still battling it out for the nomination as the nevada caucuses approach strategists say it s becoming clear that none of the democratic candidates are likely to win the majority of the delegates before the convention in july democratic strategist eddie vale said he was once extremely skeptical of a brokered convention but lately particularly with the democratic party requiring a proportional allocation of delegates it s definitely seeming like it could happen one democrat who worked on two campaigns for former president obama called a brokered convention the biggest nightmare democrats can imagine if you want to see a complete shit show tune

heading for a convention fight at this rate if the number of candidates scoring in the double digits that are splitting delegates continue to do so through super tuesday and beyond it s just math unless all of a sudden a number of candidates drop out he said while campaigns say they are focused on the upcoming primaries they are quietly thinking more about building out their teams in the event that a brokered convention takes shape according to sources on various campaigns the reason most candidates seem unlikely to suspend their campaigns before super tuesday mainly because the money

has been ascending in recent polls has shown no signs of pulling back on spending with his self funded campaign another complicating factor is the calendar of nominating contests the four early voting states iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina amount for just 6 percent of the overall delegates needed to win an outright nomination more than 50 percent of the delegates come in the march contests when states like california and texas are up for grabs the longer we go without a dominant front runner the greater the likelihood of a brokered convention said democratic strategist joel payne who served as an aide on clinton s 2016 campaign payne said if the contests are split between three or four candidates including bloomberg the likelihood goes up exponentially he added that the numbers game in a brokered convention scenario would work against sanders in the long run if it s bernie or even warren on one side and three or four moderates on the other side all with delegates the odds are that the moderates would have enough delegates to team up and hold off a sanders nomination payne said in 2016 sanders battled clinton until the very end of the primary and vowed to take the fight to the convention it is virtually impossible for hillary clinton to reach a majority of convention delegates by june 14th which is the last day a primary will be held with pledged delegates alone she will need superdelegates to take her over the top at the convention in philadelphia he said at the time in other words the convention will be a contested contest but in an msnbc interview last week sanders said it would be a very divisive moment for the party if the candidate with the most delegates or a plurality doesn t get the nomination a brokered convention would pose a risk to party unity heading into the general election that of course would be wrought with a lot of risk of alienating the progressive far left segment of the party that you would still need engaged to beat trump in november he said the last time a political party came this close to a brokered convention was in 1976 when the gop split into two sides one for gerald ford and the other for ronald reagan but the tension eased by the summer heading into the convention in general pundits always like to predict a brokered situation but the primaries and caucuses have worked their magic by nomination time in the post 1960s era said julian zelizer a professor of history and public affairs at princeton university who acknowledged there s a serious possibility of a brokered convention this time around to win the party nomination a candidate needs to secure a majority of pledged delegates 1 991 but because of a new rule implemented by the democratic national committee reaching that number could be challenging for white house hopefuls the rule states that superdelegates including democratic leaders and lawmakers could vote on the first ballot at the convention helping to boost candidates who had a plurality of delegates but because of the new rule those delegates are not eligible to vote until the second round a convention fight would be tough on democrats especially with new rules diminishing the power of superdelegates because it would add to the perception of chaos and heighten already deep tensions within the party right before the general campaign zelizer said the party could still get over it because antipathy to trump is so high zelizer added but this would not be the process most democrats were hoping for in 2020 it s also not a scenario that many former skeptics were expecting earlier in the race with how crazy this cycle has been i wouldn t be surprised if another crazy plot twist is still to come vale said updated at 8 55 a m view the discussion thread the
