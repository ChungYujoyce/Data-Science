corrections and clarifications this version clarifies how many african americans are in the senate washington mike espy is traveling across mississippi talking to voters at rotary clubs churches and union halls mississippi isn t the only place he s campaigning the democrat is crisscrossing the country trying to convince donors and power brokers from new york to chicago tocontribute to his long shot bid to become the first african american senator from mississippi since reconstruction raising money out of state is crucial for many candidates but it s even more critical for espy whose core supporters in mississippi s rural communities lack the deep pockets to help him mount a robust challenge to his two republican rivals i don t have any choice but to go to those havens and those venues of people who are probably going to be democrats who are likely to find resonance with my approach and give to me politically espy said some political observers said espy has a shot butit s an uphill battle in the ruby red state andhis chances largely depend on boosting african american turnout and capitalizing on the fierce battle between his republican opponents i hate to put a percentage on it but i think it s reasonable to discuss there is a path forward for espy to score an upset said nathan shrader co chair of millsaps college political science department if he can boost traditional democratic turnout to look more like a presidential year turnout than a midterm then he s in this thing espy a former congressman and u s secretary of agriculture under the clinton administration is running in a special election to replace republican thad cochran who retired in april republican sen cindy hyde smith who was appointed tofill cochran s unexpired term and state republican sen chris mcdaniel are the other top contenders the nonpartisan contest nov 6 is likely to go to a runoff between the top two vote getters nov 27 espy said his campaign got a boost from the wins of other african american democrats in statewide races including the gubernatorial bid of stacey abrams in georgia it also helped that in neighboring alabama doug jones pulled off an upset last december to become the first democrat in 25 years to represent the state in the u s senate we re in a time when republicans can t take a lot for granted particularly because if democrats can win a senate race in alabama they can hypothetically win one in mississippi kyle kondik of the university of virginia center for politics said the race is getting attention and probably merits attention espy is taking advantage of that attention traveling to chicago and new york city for fundraisers and returning this weektowashington where he will meet with potential donors in a supporter s living room espy said it s hard to raise the money he needs in mississippi where the 19 8 percent poverty rate is the highest in the country he hopes to raise at least 3 million by the end of june he had collected 408 236 and had 281 000in his coffers according to the federal election commission hyde smith had 1 4 million and mcdaniel trailed with 156 054 espy said fundraising picked up in the past month as people see that the democrats are doing better in senate races around the country as people begin to feel the urgency of the fact that control of the senate just might depend on the results of this race espy asked jones for campaign tipswhen they crossed paths this summer i picked his very fertile brain and i learned a lot from him and i ve hired a lot of his people espy said espy s teamincludes joe trippi as media adviser and rich mcdaniel to handle his get out the vote strategy despite similarities in their campaigns espy said there are differences he saidmississippi has 13 000 more registered black voters on paper we start with a better scenario than doug jones started with in alabama he said in mississippi blacks make up nearly 38 percent of the population versus 27 percent in alabama black votershelpedjones defeat republican roy moore espy not only has to convince blacks to support him but like jones must appeal to whites espy said he talks about issues important to all mississippians including access to affordable health care it s not a hard sell because they all want the same thing whether you re african american or white or you re concerned about rural hospitals closing he said jones who spoke this year at a mississippi democratic party event said espy can win the same energy that we saw in alabama i ve seen in mississippi he said mike starts out with a really strong base it s just a question of engagement and getting folks out mississippi republican party chairman lucien smith said there won t be an alabama style upset i m about as likely to grow wings and fly as democrats are to win a senate seat in mississippi he said smith said the party will unite behind whichever republican makes the runoff we will fight till the last dog dies to make sure they win he said mcdaniel said pundits give espy far more of a chance than he really has mr espy was part of the clinton administration and that in and of itself is going to disqualify him for a majority of people in mississippi he said hyde smith s campaign got a boost in august when trump who is popular in mississippi endorsed her trump plans to stump for hyde smith at a rally tuesday in southaven mississippi if elected hyde smith would be the first woman elected to represent mississippi in congress hyde smith who served as state agriculture commissioner said her approach is full steam ahead and staying on my priorities and my accomplishments and attributes and successes some high profile democrats have campaigned with espy including former massachusetts governor deval patrick last weekend new jersey sen cory booker one of three african americans in the senate was there in july booker also stumped with jones eric holder former attorney general under president barack obama said he will help espy espy said nationaldemocrats can help by raising money i really don t need anyone to come to mississippi to generate a vote for me he said we re going to do pretty well already because i have a 94 percent name recognition in mississippi so it s better for me to try to raise money outside and that s what we re doing the congressional black caucus pac contributed 5 000 to espy s campaign we feel very good about his chances said rep bennie thompson d miss who along with booker introduced espy to the cbc he s working hard and raising the money necessary to become a viable candidate mississippi democratic party chairman bobby moaksaid the national party stepped up support we ve probably got the best line of communication with the dnc democratic national committee since i ve been aware of the mississippi democratic party he said the democratic senatorial campaign committee said it s monitoring espy s racebutwon t say how much it plansto invest jones said national democrats helped with his campaignbut noted he competed in a special election after other races were over there wasn t a lot of competition he said now you ve got 10 democrats that are up and about four or five of those are very close we got to keep those that we have apac associated with minority senate leader charlesschumer of new york contributed 10 000 to espy s campaign i m asking for more and more every day espy said of national democrats i can t make them do anything i just can be the best candidate that i can be and run the best campaign that i can run and if they re monitoring it and they feel good about it then i think that they ll do more more 2018 midterms gop sees opportunity in minnesota trump country despite an otherwise brutal house map more midterms how can election groups get out the vote when just half of americans say process is fair and open more trouble for trump poll shows midterm election edge for democrats and female candidates
