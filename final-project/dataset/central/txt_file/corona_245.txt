via getty images hide caption then president obama and then president elect donald trump shake hands during a transition planning meeting in the oval office at the white house in november of 2016 with joe biden on the ballot so is the legacy of barack obama and it appears we re about to see a throwdown between the last president and the current one and their polar opposite worldviews amid criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic president trump has been falsely laying blame on obama for leaving the cupboard bare when it comes to the national stockpile of emergency medical supplies and equipment and lately trump and conservatives have been running with allegations of potentially criminal activity by obama administration officials for their handling of surveillance that later led to the investigation and guilty plea of michael flynn trump s three week national security adviser the department of justice now wants to drop its case against flynn in the past week trump has tweeted obamagate on its own as a retweet or as a hashtag 18 times three times he s tweeted simply obamagate with nothing else obamagate neither trump nor white house officials have been able to identify a specific crime but it sure helps fire up the base obama for his part seemed to reply with one word of his own thursday vote vote and then on saturday he had more words during two virtual commencement addresses t his pandemic has fully finally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many folks in charge know what they re doing obama told graduates of historically black colleges and universities a lot of them aren t even pretending to be in charge then when speaking to graduating high school students he said do what you think is right doing what feels good what s convenient what s easy that s how little kids think unfortunately a lot of so called grownups including some with fancy titles and important jobs still think that way which is why things are so screwed up wow and a week earlier when talking to former officials from his administration leaked audio revealed that obama called trump s handling of the coronavirus an absolute chaotic disaster and an example of what happens when a what s in it for me mindset is operationalized in our government pressed about obama s remarks sunday trump said he hadn t heard them but noted look he was an incompetent president that s all i can say grossly incompetent welcome to the 2020 presidential campaign reelections are always a referendum on the sitting president but with biden obama s vice president at the top of the democratic ticket it s somewhat of a referendum on obama too and there s reason for trump to want or even need to try and take obama down a few pegs currently obama is among the most popular politicians in the country and one of the highest polling political figures besides his wife michelle it s a clear and stark choice offered up to voters and one trump seems to want front and center he even tweeted at republican senate judiciary chair lindsey graham who says he wants to hold hearings on the flynn case to call obama to testify do it lindseygrahamsc just do it trump tweeted no more mr nice guy if i were a senator or congressman the first person i would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the usa by far is former president obama he knew everything do it lindseygrahamsc just do it no more mr nice guy no more talk graham responded telling reporters he thinks that would be a bad precedent to compel a former president to testify and would open up a can of worms i understand president trump s frustration graham said before warning but be careful what you wish for just be careful what you wish for 1 coronavirus death toll approaches 90 000 about 90 000 people are now confirmed to have died from covid 19 in the united states and though new cases are slowing the country is still on pace for 100 000 deaths from the coronavirus before the end of the month that slowing of new cases is good news but with two thirds of states significantly relaxing stay at home restrictions experts are concerned about a potential resurgence loading we re seeing a decline undoubtedly that is something good to see jeffrey shaman an epidemiologist at columbia university told the new york times but what we are also seeing is a lot of places right on the edge of controlling the disease another good sign though new york gov andrew cuomo tweeted on sunday that his state now has more testing capacity than new yorkers are using and he wants not only symptomatic new yorkers to get tested but also those who have been in contact with someone with covid that s a first step in what experts say is one of the most important things to do to try and contain the virus

make a push for another relief package health versus the economy has been the tension since the beginning of the lockdowns unemployment has hit almost 15 the highest since the great depression and as deaths spiked in april 20 million jobs were lost congress has passed four relief packages the democratic led house has passed another but senate republicans and the white house have balked at a fifth major package we have not yet felt the urgency of acting immediately senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said last week on tuesday there could be more clarity on the state of the economy and what more the administration is planning to do to support people and the economy in the coming weeks when treasury secretary steven mnuchin and federal reserve chair jerome powell appear before the senate banking committee as required by the cares act 3 watching for fallout from inspectors general firings the firing of the state department s inspector general steve linick announced on a friday night which is where bad news goes to be buried in washington is raising more questions than answers linick is the fourth inspector general the trump administration has sought to remove in the past six weeks a democratic congressional aide told npr s michele kelemen that linick was looking into secretary of state mike pompeo s conduct the move triggered republican sens mitt romney susan collins and chuck grassley to question trump s motives romney said the move chills the igs essential independence and called the moves a threat to accountable democracy collins said trump had not provided the kind of justification for the removal required by law grassley pointed out that written reasons are required and that a general lack of confidence simply is not sufficient but what does the republican senate do to maintain the accountability that they say trump is threatening or not abiding by so far during the trump presidency it s done little to hold him in check 4 senate republicans move ahead
