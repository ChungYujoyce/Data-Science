updated sep 16 2019 at 10 37 am by aaron bycoffe sarah frostenson and julia wolfe if something is going to shake up the race before the iowa caucuses it s likely to be a debate so we partnered with ipsos to once again track how thursday s debate hosted by abc news affected likely primary voters feelings about the candidates the fivethirtyeight ipsos poll conducted using ipsos s knowledgepanel interviewed the same group of voters twice to capture both the before and after picture of the debate to better understand which candidates did well or poorly thursday night we plotted how favorably respondents rated the candidates before the debate vs how debate watchers rated their performance warren was one of the better liked candidates going into the debate but her performance was still rated higher than we d expect based on her favorability alone the same was true of booker buttigieg and especially o rourke interestingly klobuchar didn t get a great debate rating but it s not bad considering her pre debate favorability which was pretty neutral biden and sanders are very popular with democrats but failed to get correspondingly high scores on their debate performance while castro stands out for getting the worst debate grade even considering his relatively lukewarm favorability rating going in in terms of raw debate grades respondents graded on a four point scale higher scores are better warren buttigieg and o rourke did best booker sanders biden and harris did fine respondents could pick multiple candidates the field may be shrinking but many voters are still considering multiple candidates overall we didn t see huge shifts in the wake of the third debate but there was some movement warren got the biggest increase 2 4 percentage points in the share of likely democratic primary voters who are considering supporting her buttigieg and klobuchar each gained a little over a point in potential support 1 5 points for him and 1 3 points for her harris meanwhile saw the biggest drop in potential supporters declining 2 5 points biden s support barely budged neither did o rourke s even though the former representative got positive marks for his performance we also asked respondents to estimate each democrat s chances of defeating president trump from 0 percent to 100 percent polls show democratic primary voters are prioritizing electability but who do they think is electable as you can see in the chart above klobuchar who had one of the lower average scores going into the debate saw fewer respondents say she had zero chance of defeating trump buttigieg likewise had fewer people rate him as having no chance biden and sanders meanwhile saw a small drop in the share of respondents who said they were certain those candidates would beat trump there wasn t much movement in respondents average estimates of how likely each candidate would be to defeat trump in the general election most candidates saw their average likelihood increase but only marginally klobuchar saw the largest bump 2 1 percentage points followed by warren and yang we asked likely democratic primary voters how favorably they felt about each candidate both before and after the debate as you can see among the polling front runners biden and sanders s favorability ratings remained relatively unchanged while warren s net favorability favorable rating minus unfavorable rating jumped by a little over 4 points in fact only o rourke fared better than warren his net favorability rating increased a little over 7 points but not all candidates made a positive impression castro s net favorability for instance dropped by 10 points this time after getting a big boost in the first debate notes on the methodology all the data presented here comes from polling done by ipsos for fivethirtyeight using ipsos s knowledgepanel a probability based online panel that is recruited to be representative of the u s population for this study the same group of respondents is interviewed before and after the debate to track whether and how their answers changed an initial wave of polling was conducted before the debates began with a follow up wave after the debate the first wave of the poll was conducted from sept 5 to sept 11 among a general population sample of adults with 4 320 respondents who say they are likely to vote in their state s democratic primary or caucus for the likely democratic primary voter subset of respondents the poll has a margin of error of 1 68 percentage points the second wave of the poll was conducted from sept 12 to sept 16 among 3 473 of the likely democratic primary voters who previously responded to the first wave it has a margin of error of 1 89 percentage points of those respondents 1 465 watched the debate the scatter plot comparing candidates favorability to their debate performance was calculated by assigning a 0 to 100 score to each respondent s answer to the favorability question where very favorable is equal to 100 somewhat favorable is equal to 75 heard of no opinion is equal to 50 somewhat unfavorable is equal to 25 and very unfavorable is equal to zero scores were then averaged to create an overall favorability index for each candidate respondents who hadn t heard of the candidate were not included additional contributions by laura bronner 2018 abc news internet ventures all rights
