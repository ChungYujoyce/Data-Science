 we want to terminate health care under obamacare as a physician caring for hospitalized patients during the covid 19 pandemic i read president donald trump s words last week with astonishment astonishmentnot only at what this could mean for my patients but at what it could mean for me and the many millions of health care workers with preexisting conditions i was born prematurely in the summer of 1983 at 27 weeks gestation which gave me preexisting conditions right from the start i spent several weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit where through blood transfusions i contracted hepatitis c virus i went on to develop chronic hepatitis c infection and ultimately needed treatment for it some 27 years later my prematurity led to the development of asthma which has contributed to recurrent respiratory infections throughout childhood and now into adulthood prior to 2010 and the passage of the affordable care actor obamacare health insurance companies could legally charge me more or even deny coverage to me because of these preexisting conditions unfortunately i am not alone in the united states nearly 54 million people or one quarter of adults under 65 have a preexisting condition that could have resulted in denial of coverage before the aca almost 25 of health care workers or nearly 3 5 million people are estimated to have at least one preexisting condition as the country has been gripped by the devastating impacts of covid 19 it is those with preexisting conditions and adults over age 60 who face the highest risk from this coronavirus and its aftermath the health care workers at highest risk of all are those who fall into this category and work in a critical care unit emergency roomor like me in an inpatient unit last wednesday trump was asked about his administration s stance in the federal lawsuit brought byrepublican attorneys general seeking to overturn the the aca it was the last day the administration could change its positionbefore the case moved tothe supreme court despite the ongoing pandemic and even some dissension within his own administration trump reiterated his support for gutting the entire law although he has mentioned preserving some of the more popular aspects of the law such as guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions trump has not put forth a coherent plan to do so and over more than three years in office he has consistently supported efforts to eliminate the aca false choice protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy we can have both although it will be months before the supreme court will hear the case and even longer until the case isdecided covid 19 is expected to last into the next one to two years or more as millions of americans lose their jobs and with them their access to health insurance the economic stressors that cause many patients to delay seeking routine health care will grow the economic stress caused by loss of coverage which could be mitigated by protections in the aca especially the ability to buy insurance on the aca marketplace with subsidies available to lower income people will further exacerbate chronic health conditions that includeslong term complications from covid 19 infection itself such as lung and kidney damage or blood clots coronavirus pause people need people but it s risky to resume social activities so soon the health care system which is currently facing significant financial pressures on top of the pandemic will also be negatively impacted people without insurance will increasingly use the emergency department for routine care or preventable issues which increases costs and strains resources over 1 3 million americans have been diagnosed with covid 19 and sadly about 80 000have already died as our country continues to face risingcases and deaths what will happen if we terminate health care as we know it will those with preexisting conditions who care for others be cared for themselves dr navin vijis an academic internal medicine hospitalist and a physician scientist in delaware the views expressed here are solely his own follow him on twitter voiceofvij
