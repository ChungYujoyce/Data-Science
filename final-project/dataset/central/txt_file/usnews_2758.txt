ohio gov mike dewine is getting high marks for his no nonsense approach to the coronavirus crisis gripping the country the republican rang the alarm early didn t wait for washington to notice and took dramatic steps to shut down much of his state before the pandemic could overrun it in turn dewine seems to have headed off the worst case scenario playing out in new york and new jersey his daily press briefings have been appointment viewing for ohioans and c span aficionados alike and at age 73 the former congressman senator and state attorney general has never had such a promising a political future with even ohio democrats begrudgingly praising his command of the situation the veteran politician took a break from briefings and budget calls this past weekend to speak with time as he walked around his farm near dayton ohio with his new puppy although his state now has about 6 600 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 274 deaths dewine argues it could have been far worse had he waited any longer dewine summoned the experts and then heeded their advice even as it threatened his political popularity below is a lightly edited transcript of the conversation you were the first governor in the country to announce the entire state school system would close starting on march 16 you ve been a step ahead of us on other things advising no spectators at indoor sporting events calling on universities to go to remote instruction closing bars and restaurants did you know something other governors didn t well i have a very good health director dr amy acton she has been keeping me informed about what was coming i think that what i ve tried to do throughout this is just get the best information i could talk to the scientists talk to the medical professionals i have spent 40 years in public office and the mistakes i ve made are generally when i didn t have enough information didn t talk to the right people didn t drill down to get all the facts i think that has served me well during this because we ve just been really focused on trying to find out everything that we could and the one message i kept getting from the people i was talking to who really understood these pandemics is you have to move quickly and you have to move early that even delaying a few days can make a huge amount of difference i think also we had an event that really forced us to make a decision and that was the arnold classic and it was a tough decision to close it because i know i was not aware at least of anybody else in the country shutting down of a major event like that but again we listened to the experts talked with them and it just didn t make sense to have 60 000 people from 80 countries come into columbus for a four day event and be in close quarters we just felt it was a recipe for disaster and so we took that action it was not easy because no one had really done this before but i just weighed it out what i felt was it was a matter of life and death that we were protecting human life and we had to act and so we did that and then very quickly after that we got into the issue of the ncaa the play off games the first two nights were going to be in dayton ohio so we had to make a decision about that and we also had high school athletics tournaments going on so we just kind of went from one decision to another and tried to weigh all the facts and we came out where we did you ve signaled schools might open in may is that still realistic well i ve made it clear to everyone schools may not open at all this year right but we just wanted to not lock us in to have some flexibility as we see how this pandemic develops and so we pushed everything we kept the schools closed to may 1 we then also came in with the essential businesses until may 1 so we ll review this during the month of april and see where we go your daily briefing has zero sugarcoating on it tell me why i want people to have confidence in what we say and because i think getting through something like this it s important that the governor has credibility the first press conference we did about this we did in cleveland and i said that throughout this dr acton and i will tell you what we know when we know it that s what we ve tried to do as the modeling was changing we told them what we had we told them the information we were getting and the modeling has changed and to a large extent that is because of what the people of the state did i just felt that it wasn t the orders that i put on that were so important what was really important what people did and it was important for them to buy in and to understand what we were doing what we were asking them to do your briefings could not be more different than the ones we see at the white house with president trump any advice for him on those no i think we have different roles i think historically governors have dealt with health crises tornadoes hurricanes floods i think the president s roles are different roles i mean his is more aspirational when he says we d love to be open soon i know he s gotten some criticism but the truth is we all would like to be open soon as the president i think the more aspirational is a fine role my role as governor is just a different role and it is to take the people ohio through what we think we re going to have to do you re the governor of a state that has to pass a balanced budget and you re seeing public health costs go up as tax revenue goes down how are you handling this well we are on two year budget cycle so we ve got 15 months left but we have to balance the budget we re going to announce cuts next week which i was working on today and there s no choice but to make significant cuts as everyone knows when you have a downturn in the economy two things happen revenues go down and costs go up so we ve got to make the tough decisions are you getting everything you need from washington every time i ve asked the white house for something they have come through it was two weekends ago i called the president on sunday morning because we were just having trouble with the fda approving battelle s new process that was a big deal for us they can do up to tens of thousands of masks a day sterilizing them we ve never had the personal protective equipment that we need the same way most states just don t have it being able to get this done was very important the president picked up the phone and he got their attention and then they went through the process and we got it done that day the vice president has been helpful as we look to the future after we get through with this i think there s two big lessons for all of us one is we never want to be in a position where key things like personal protection equipment is made outside the united states and we don t have a big enough capacity to make it having essential medical equipment made outside the united states and not enough inside the united states is something we can t let happen again the other lesson is we all the states federal government everybody we have to invest more every year in public health we don t invest enough and we need to do that those are kinds of the big takeaways from this after we get through it and after we get back to where we want to be do you have access to enough kits right now in ohio and are enough people being tested no no to both although we re making some serious progress ohio state the cleveland clinic university of cincinnati their capacity has gone up dramatically our problem now is in regard to the smaller hospitals and the smaller places making sure they got the swabs that they need the tubes to put the swabs in the liquid that goes in there these are all problems that i think every state is having we re standing up some groups that are producing these ohio state and our health department have gone together and they re really starting to churn out some of the swabs and other things that we need for the testing the testing is going up it needs to go up a lot more if we re going to be able to manage our recovery it remains a challenge but it s a lot better than it was a week ago it s a lot better than it was two weeks ago we re moving in the right direction but we ve got the same problems everybody s got we could hear protesters outside your briefing on thursday april 9 folks want to reopen business how are you managing that backlash i fully understand their feelings i think the thing everyone needs to understand though is this economy is not going to come back if people are afraid to go out so no matter what order i put on or don t put on what we have to do is feed people s confidence that we can protect them and we re putting together a plan as i know other states are about how we start to reopen and it s based on testing it s based on tracing it s based on figuring out who has already had it so that s what s going to give people confidence and that s what s going to allow our economy to come back it s not like i can walk out and turn a switch on and everything comes back because even if i would walk out tomorrow and say ok all the orders no more orders do whatever you want to do that doesn t solve the problem if people fear for their life they re not going to spend money they re not going to go out to eat they re not going to go to a ball game they re not going to do all the things that we all would want to do it seems like the federal response and the state s responses haven t always been in tandem is this a time where we might want to rethink the states rights argument historically i think you look to governors to deal with the local disaster now obviously this is a worldwide disaster we re seeing this pandemic at different stages in different states it just makes sense that these decisions get made locally made by the governor we ve got 113 local health departments right we could ve let these decisions be made 113 different places it just didn t make sense to me there are still governors who haven t done statewide orders what are they thinking i can t speak for other governors they may think that people are being pretty cautious anyway and that the order is redundant but i don t know that everybody s got different circumstance i might approach it differently if i represented a different state but ohio is a state of close to 12 million people we ve got a number of major urban centers what in this crisis has left you completely gobsmacked we have had an amazing group of people who have just stepped up in ohio to do things and i guess that really doesn t shock me because i ve seen ohioans do it during floods i ve seen them do it during tornadoes we ve had for example people who have just come in who volunteered out of the private sector to help us source material i had someone come out of a previous democratic administration who had a high role in the previous governor s administration who volunteered she s done an absolutely phenomenal job every single day sourcing the things that we have to ask to buy so many people have stepped up and done what they need to do look at our teachers our teachers are all having to teach from a distance that s not easy some of them never did that and they re figured out ways to do it ohioans are resourceful they re hard working it s one of the take aways i believe from this you talk about that bipartisanship would you serve in a biden administration well i m very focused on being governor i love the job of governor i m not looking to serve in anybody s administration a lot of us have used this unexpected time to read and stream shows that we just had not seen before have you had a moment just to step away from this we really haven t what we ve done is stayed at our farm which is an hour from columbus this has been so all consuming that it s literally been seven days a week i mean the only book i ve actually read was the book written about the 1918 pandemic john m barry s the great influenza the epic story of the deadliest plague in history that s been very helpful there s a lot of lessons that come out of there write to philip elliott at philip elliott time com
