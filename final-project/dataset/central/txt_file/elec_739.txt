washington in the frantic race to turn out voters on election day interest groups are relying on new forms of public shaming to get you to the polls in alaska and colorado for instance conservative groups have sent out mailers that compare your voting record to your neighbors voting histories the alaska mailer funded by a super pac with a texas address goes further and threatens to send an updated report card after the election that will tell your friends neighbors and work colleagues whether you actually cast a ballot in oregon a coalition of unions and liberal groups is taking peer pressure to a new level with a novel app didtheyvote org that allows users to check their facebook friends names against oregon s official voting records to see whether they have voted registered voters in oregon along with those in washington and colorado already have received their ballots by mail and must return them by tuesday getting nagged to vote by your social media friends is a far more welcoming contact than someone you don t know knocking on your door said ben unger executive director of our oregon the group behind the new app that is aimed at getting young people to vote in a state with a high profile u s senate and governor s race young people are harder to reach at their phones and harder to reach at their doors unger said the facebook prod is an effective way to remind them to get their ballots in the mail as invasive as the social pressure seems the practice is legal how people vote is secret but whether they have is generally public information candidates political parties and legions of consultants long have purchased these public voter files to determine who already has cast ballots as they refine their get out the vote efforts in the final stretch to election day in oregon for instance more than two dozen individuals and groups pay to receive daily updates of the state s voter file according to the secretary of state s office just because it s legal doesn t mean everyone approves of using the data in this way paul gronke a political scientist and director of the early voting information center at reed college in portland ore said the voting app is an inventive method to reach voters and is far cheaper than rounding up hundreds of people to knock on doors but he said it does feel like big brother is looking over your shoulder it s inventively creepy and appropriate for the halloween season to be sure political parties candidates and interest groups are largely deploying traditional methods across the country to turn out the vote in north carolina alone the league of conservation voters is spending 5 million to boost endangered democratic sen kay hagan in a tossup race with republican challenger thom tillis the environmental group plans to knock on more than 640 000 doors by election day spokesman jeff gohringer said in colorado americans for prosperity a conservative group affiliated with billionaire industrialist david koch has knocked on nearly 200 000 doors said dustin zvonek the group s state director the organization however also supplemented its efforts by sending thousands of report card style mailers to conservative leaning coloradans who only vote occasionally the mailers compare their voting histories with the perfect records of some of their neighbors zvonek said americans for prosperity is not pushing a partisan message but wants to remind voters that it s an important election here in colorado the state is home to two closely watched contests the hard fought battle between incumbent democrat gov john hickenlooper and republican bob beauprez and the tight race between colorado democratic sen mark udall and republican rep cory gardner that could determine which party controls the senate in alaska home to another hotly contested senate race the opportunity alliance pac s mailing opens with this line what if your friends your neighbors and your community knew whether you voted the group s treasurer cabell hobbs declined to discuss the organization i just do the accounting and the fec federal election commission reports he told usa today it s just a policy of mine that i don t speak to the press most of its spending has targeted oregon democratic sen jeff merkley its biggest funder is a retired business executive in oregon john bryan who donated 200 000 to the super pac in may he is a major contributor to tea party affiliated pacs and supports foundations that back charter schools bryan did not respond to messages from usa today he has told the associated press that he wants republicans to gain the senate majority and said he was unaware of plans to distribute the mailers gail fenumiai director of alaska s elections division said her office has received dozens and dozens of complaints since the mailers began appearing last week two people have canceled their voter registrations in protest she said what they are doing isn t illegal but whether it s tasteful i would question that she said of the mailers it has upset voters and that s the last thing we want to see happen the language in the opportunity alliance s mailer mirrors one used in a 2006 experiment that tested whether public pressure inspired people to vote said chris larimer an associate professor at the university of northern iowa who conducted the study with two other political scientists at yale voting by those who received the mailing was 8 1 percentage points higher than those who did not the researchers found people are more likely to comply with social norms when people are watching larimer said follow fschouten on twitter
