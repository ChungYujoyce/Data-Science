8 min read manchester n h reuters enthusiasm for the democratic party is waning among millennials as its candidates head into the crucial midterm congressional elections according to the reuters ipsos national opinion poll the online survey of more than 16 000 registered voters ages 18 to 34 shows their support for democrats over republicans for congress slipped by about 9 percentage points over the past two years to 46 percent overall and they increasingly say the republican party is a better steward of the economy although nearly two of three young voters polled said they do not like republican president donald trump their distaste for him does not necessarily extend to all republicans or translate directly into votes for democratic congressional candidates that presents a potential problem for democrats who have come to count on millennials as a core constituency and will need all the loyalty they can get to achieve a net gain of 23 seats to capture control of the u s house of representatives in november young voters represent an opportunity and a risk for both parties said donald green a political science professor at columbia university in new york city they re not as wedded to one party green said they re easier to convince than say your 50 or 60 year olds who don t really change their minds very often terry hood 34 an african american who works at a dollar general store in baton rouge louisiana and took this year s poll said he voted for democrat hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election but he will consider a republican for congress because he believes the party is making it easier to find jobs and he applauds the recent republican led tax cut it sounds strange to me to say this about the republicans but they re helping with even the small things hood said in a phone interview they re taking less taxes out of my paycheck i notice that the reuters ipsos poll surveyed young voters during the first three months of this year and the same period in 2016 only 28 percent of those polled expressed overt support for republicans in the 2018 poll about the same percentage as two years earlier but that does not mean the rest will turn out to back democrats the survey showed a growing share of voters between ages 18 and 34 years old said they were undecided would support a third party candidate or not vote at all the shift away from democrats was more pronounced among white millennials who accounted for two thirds of all votes cast in that age group in 2016 two years ago young white people favored democrats over republicans for congress by a margin of 47 to 33 percent that gap vanished by this year with 39 percent supporting each party the shift was especially dramatic among young white men who two years ago favored democrats but now say they favor republicans over democrats by a margin of 46 to 37 percent the reuters ipsos poll showed ashley reed a white single mother of three in new hampshire said a teenage

the university of new hampshire in durham mindi messmer one of eight democrats running in the primary election touted her work as an environmental crusader but students in the crowd also raised many other issues notably the local economy people come to school here and then they move away because they can t get jobs said acadia spear 18 of portsmouth spear said she would likely vote for a democrat but her peers nationally are increasingly looking to republicans for economic leadership according to the reuters ipsos poll millennials are almost evenly split this year over the question of which party has a better plan for the economy with 34 percent picking the democrats and 32 percent choosing republicans that s a shift from two years ago when they said democrats had the better plan by a 12 point margin in manchester the biggest city in new hampshire s 1st district tattoo artist ashley matthias 31 said she has not decided how she will vote but will support anyone who will make her health

insurance through the government run obamacare exchange you just hope nothing happens to you she said after the bruising loss in the presidential election of 2016 the democratic party learned it needed to reach young voters on their turf including on social media and at college campuses said elizabeth renda who specializes in reaching young voters for the democratic national committee instead of having real conversations with them we settled for tv ads renda said of the 2016 failure earlier this year the dnc launched its iwillvote initiative aimed in part at registering millennials to vote

comment on the reuters poll republican national committee spokeswoman cassie smedile said the poll indicates that young voters like what they ve seen from the party in power the republican committee plans to target young voters in part through a pilot program to get out the vote at six college campuses smedile said in new hampshire eddie edwards one of two republicans running for congress in the 1st district said he pitches millennials on ways the government should help college graduates pay off their student loans he also argues that public secondary schools must better prepare students to

them involved the reuters ipsos poll was conducted online in english throughout the united states it gathered about 65 000 responses in all during the first three months of 2018 and 2016 including 16
