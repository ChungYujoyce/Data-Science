democratic election commission state and federal election officials call trump fraud claim unfounded rep terri sewell d ala called the commission a sham and criticized kobach for asking states for the sensitive information the commission s request for personal voter data should be alarming for any american who values their privacy security or the integrity of our elections she said in a statement friday handing over information on our voters to an administration that has no respect for the facts will only lay a foundation for national voter suppression efforts trump who lost the popular vote to hillary clinton by nearly 2 9 million votes has claimed that last year s election included up to 3 million to 5 million fraudulent voters voting rights groups say there is no evidence to support that claim sewell is vice chairwoman of a group set up in may by the democratic national committee to counter and discredit the work of trump s commission civil rights and voting rights advocates also blasted the letter sent to states this attempt to pull together data on a vast scale is an invitation for mischief kristen clarke president and executive director of the lawyers committee for civil rights under law said friday it s unclear what the commission intends to do with this massive amount of data myrna p rez deputy director of the brennan center s democracy program said states have to be careful about what they share voters trust that states will safeguard their information when they register to vote and to break that bond could damage voters confidence and their rights she said in a statement clarke said her group has expanded its national hotline for voters to report election concerns to five days in part because of trump s commission in the past the hotline was mostly available during federal elections at the end of the day our hope is that states will not cooperate with the commission s request she said any disclosure of data legitimizes the work of this
