as of monday the federal government has been partially shut down for 16 days making it tied for the third longest shutdown in u s history the other shutdown that lasted 16 days took place from oct 1 2013 to oct 17 2013 there have been 21 government shutdowns since congress began using the modern budgeting process in 1976 some of them have lasted just a few days or even a few hours as was the case of the shutdown last february and haven t really affected government operations but when shutdowns take place during normal workdays they mean that government functions largely grind to a halt and federal employees are furloughed or if they re deemed essential forced to work without pay the government is supposed to be funded through an annual process that involves congress passing 12 appropriations bills to fund all the different government agencies if this process is not completed by the start of the new fiscal year on oct 1 the government partially or completely shuts down congress can avoid a shutdown by passing continuing resolutions that let agencies keep spending at their current levels but lawmakers don t always reach a deal in time the current shutdown started on dec 22 after talks broke down between congressional leaders and the white house the officials failed to come to a compromise on a spending deal that president donald trump demanded include money for his wall on the u s mexico border most of the government was already funded so this is a partial shutdown but it has affected nine federal departments as well as other agencies totaling about 800 000 federal workers more than half of those have been forced to work without pay throughout the shutdown with the other half furloughed the weeks long shutdown left some workers in a tough position over the holiday season and has continued to affect millions of americans as large chunks of the government have remained closed into january the only shutdowns that have lasted longer than the current one took place in 1978 and 1995 1996 the 1978 shutdown during jimmy carter s presidency lasted 18 days this shutdown took place after carter vetoed public works legislation and a defense spending bill that included a nuclear powered aircraft carrier because he considered them wasteful the grand record holder came when president bill clinton clashed with then house speaker newt gingrich over domestic spending cuts and it lasted 21 days from dec 16 1995 to jan 6 1996 if the current shutdown extends until saturday it will tie the clinton era shutdown for the longest in american history write to abigail abrams at abigail abrams time com
