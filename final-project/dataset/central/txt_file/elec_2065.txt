polarising candidate in a crowded race and he s about to make his first appearance on the debate stage after rising to second place in the polls so who are mike bloomberg s supporters and why have they backed him recent polling by npr pbs marist puts mr bloomberg in second place behind bernie sanders with 19 of the democratic vote mr bloomberg will no doubt face questions on his political past including recently revealed comments on women farmers and minorities on wednesday when he takes to the debate stage for the first time in las vegas nevada he won t appear on any ballots however until super tuesday 3 march when some of the biggest states like california and texas hold their primary contests while liberals have attacked him over controversial policies during his tenure as mayor his billionaire status and for having switched party affiliations in the past mr bloomberg has also been a strong investor in many key causes for democratic voters he spent some 100m 77m backing democrats in the 2018 mid term elections which saw a record number of women voted to congress he founded the nonprofit everytown for gun safety group to lobby for gun control policies he has given more than 1bn to public health causes and over 278m to climate change initiatives think of a bernie sanders supporter and there s a good chance an image pops into your mind of someone young progressive possibly male but what does a michael bloomberg fan look like looking at polling data and anecdotally at rallies it appears most of mr bloomberg s grassroots supporters skew older pro bloomberg groups on social media are run by older than middle aged americans there may be some racial diversity but little when it comes to age a quinnipiac poll last week found most of the former mayor s support came from voters aged 50 and up who make over 50 000 a year here s how mr bloomberg s grassroots supporters responded to some of the biggest criticisms against him and why they say they are all in for mike 2020 for new yorker laura wagner mr bloomberg s money is far from a downside you have to be a billionaire to run and then when you are you re criticised for it she says noting how much campaigns must fundraise and that most modern us presidents have been very wealthy ms wagner a sotheby s realty associate and contributing columnist to the italian and english newspaper la voce in her 50s agrees the money plays a big factor in mr bloomberg s candidacy but that she says is not a bad thing all the power to him because he s using it in my opinion so effectively he s not going to be bartering with these big oil companies and organisations the nra national rifle association or trying to appease donald trump would like to be what michael bloomberg is in terms of the power the money all of the supporters who spoke to the bbc echoed that mr bloomberg s successful business record was a highlight not a hindrance and being the mayor of new york city for three terms is pretty close to being president of the united states ms wagner adds perhaps the biggest issue from mr bloomberg s mayoral past is this policy which allowed police to question and search individuals for weapons or illegal items most people stopped were innocent most were black or latino stop question and frisk pre dated mr bloomberg but peaked during his tenure with around five million stops over a decade analysis of the programme in the years since has suggested the random investigative stops did not have a meaningful impact on crime in 2013 a federal judge ruled the tactic was unconstitutional violating the rights of minority residents this month audio emerged from 2015 where mr bloomberg claimed male minorities perpetrate the real crime he s since apologised for the policy and the impact it had on black and latino communities sheikh musa drammeh 58 is a religious leader and community activist who has lived in the bronx and harlem neighbourhoods of new york city for the last 30 years when asked about the controversial policy mr drammeh emphasised no candidate will ever do as much for the blacks and latinos as bloomberg i am black mr drammeh continues nobody can tell me about the ravages of crime in this city i know it i live it i m a victim of it and bloomberg did not create stop and frisk but bloomberg s administration saw that you must have a habitable environment otherwise investors residents high earning individuals who will pay taxes to support social services will leave the city mr drammeh says from what he has seen as an activist working to stop gang violence people in his neighbourhoods have benefitted from stop and frisk it s not discriminatory it s life saving the lives that are being saved are black and brown not white carla shead a 49 year old from maryland told the bbc it ll take another new yorker to beat trump ms shead adds that mr bloomberg has proven himself by being a successful businessman and a successful mayor and has put his money where his mouth is when i started listening to his ads and what he had to say about building the community and what his plan was to do for the united states he is everything trump isn t and that to me is the bottom line ms shead says that the divides in this country have been around for a long time her family is from mississippi she says and many were active participants in the us civil rights movement america is looking for a saviour right now she says trump from the beginning has split the nation and has dredged up old wounds my family and other african american families are vested in this in seeing the country coming together and i think mike bloomberg is doing the exact opposite of what trump is doing what are bloomberg s key campaign issues mr bloomberg has come under fire for sexist comments he allegedly made in 1990 including reportedly telling a pregnant employee she should kill it which he has denied under oath the remarks have prompted comparisons to president donald trump but darryl morin 52 told the bbc that he does not see any similarities between these allegations of sexism i hear a lot of hearsay he says i know there s been inflammatory rhetoric but i haven t seen any smoking gun like we did with donald trump just seeing everything he s done to help people around him people of colour women i take him at him at his word mr morin says adding that mr bloomberg has elevated women within his organisation anybody who tries to say he s trying to hold minorities down i d argue vigorously he s done the opposite mr morin who lives in franklin wisconsin has also attended a number of rallies this election cycle and says while mr bloomberg has work to do when it comes to younger voters he draws a generally diverse crowd i m hispanic there s asian americans african americans non minorities it really is a more thoughtful crowd rather than just supporting a person or idea he says the rallies have been respectful and that the former mayor answers questions about policies and his past in an upfront way once people see that they realise that this is a man that really has spent the latter parts of his life trying to help everyone have equal access to that american dream despite his ad buys with instagram influencers to target younger audiences mr bloomberg s biggest support base still stems from an older crowd but joe nicoletti 53 who helps manage pro bloomberg groups on facebook says that s what campaigns are for telling your story and widening your tent mr nicoletti who lives in sandy hook connecticut told the bbc he liked the fact that bloomberg has been both a republican and democrat and the former mayor s views he added are moderate and more in line with the majority of the country according to a february pew research center analysis of the candidates supporters mr bloomberg s base is much less liberal than his 2020 rivals only 29 describe themselves as liberal with the majority saying they are moderate or conservative in this vein 79 of mr bloomberg s base say they want a candidate who will work with republicans and compromise on policies if need be there s a reason why donald trump and donald trump supporters want to face bernie sanders in the general election mr nicoletti says pete buttigieg is an impressive candidate but mike despite the stop and frisk issue has much broader support with people of colour he adds that some of the criticism levied at mr bloomberg is hypocritical when mike bloomberg used his money to help flip the house elect more women candidates push gun control legislation and help flip the virginia house i don t remember hearing them complain this is the first time the social media giant has said president trump s tweet could be misleading have you been getting these songs wrong what happens to your body in extreme heat
