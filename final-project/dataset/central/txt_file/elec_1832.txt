the stakes are high in virginia on election day as democrats seek to fend off what would be a devastating defeat in the governor s race the race has become a fierce battle in its final month as polls show republican ed gillespie gaining on democrat ralph northam a democratic victory in virginia would give the party its first major electoral win since president trump took office an opportunity to build much needed momentum as the party aims to retake the house majority in next year s midterm elections but a northam loss would be a major setback for democrats who currently hold the governorship and won the state in the 2016 presidential race the latest polls suggest that northam virginia s lieutenant governor still has a slight edge on his gop rival but republicans believe gillespie can rally their conservative base to pull off an upset the concern for democrats has to be that republicans are pretty united on some of the issues that have taken center stage in this race geoffrey skelley a political analyst at the university of virginia said citing issues like immigration and the controversial debate over protecting confederate statues if you are looking for a way to make sure more republicans turn up than expected these kinds of issues might be the ticket democrats originally expected to have an easier time keeping control of the governor s mansion thanks to trump s unpopularity in the state and changing demographics that are turning the state blue but northam s deteriorating lead and recent missteps with a series of republican attacks have democrats worried political observers following the race still give a slight edge to northam but they note that gillespie has effectively shored up his conservative pro trump base after struggling with the party s grass roots during the primary both campaigns have been working to mobilize their bases since turnout typically drops in off year elections northam and gillespie have both promised jobs and economic growth but they ve also made more targeted plays to loyal party voters who are more likely to go to the ballot box in an off year gillespie a former chairman of the republican national committee rnc echoed trump s presidential campaign messaging by taking a hard stance on culture war issues and immigration gillespie ran ads portraying northam as weak on crime arguing that his position on sanctuary cities enabled violence by gangs like ms 13 and he also condemned gov terry mcauliffe s d decision to restore voting rights for many felons misconstruing previous northam remarks to suggest he was in favor of restoring sex offenders voting rights these ad campaigns ran predominantly in areas that are friendlier to republicans including southwest virginia areas that voted resoundingly for trump democrats and northam have accused gillespie of running a divisive and fear mongering campaign but a win or even narrow loss for gillespie could serve as a playbook for future gop campaigns if this is a 50 48 northam win here this is going to be a strategy that the gop candidates in 2018 are going to turn to because it clearly has engaged trump voters skelley said if gillespie wins in particular this is going to be the new playbook law and order sanctuary cities sanctuary cities sanctuary cities still gillespie has kept trump at arm s length never asking the president to come down to campaign with him it remains to be seen if gillespie s decision to never fully embrace the president will ultimately hurt or help him but that hasn t stopped northam from trying to tie gillespie to the president northam has run ads saying that gillespie won t stand up to trump in more democratic areas of the state including northern virginia it s a move northam hopes will motivate his own base

likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more the early voting total in northern virginia which had more ballots cast than any other region as of saturday is likely a positive sign for northam s campaign more than 180 000 people voted early statewide which shattered the total from 2014 when roughly 123 000 early ballots were cast democrats are still hoping for strong voter turnout despite recent stumbles that have put northam on the defensive republicans criticized northam over a controversial ad from the latino victory fund the ad featured minority children being chased down by a truck adorned with a confederate flag and a gillespie campaign bumper sticker and it was eventually pulled after the new york city truck attack on oct 31 days after the ad was pulled northam aggravated progressives by saying he d sign a bill banning sanctuary cities if one came to his desk that prompted progressive group democracy for america to pull direct aid for the campaign while gillespie s campaign seized on what he called a flip flop northam argues he s always been opposed to sanctuary cities which don t exist in virginia given the close polls and
