democrats are bracing for a long drawn out primary season with just six weeks until the iowa caucuses some democrats say they don t expect a likely nominee to emerge anytime soon after early voting states hold their contests instead they re preparing for a bruising four way match up that could drag on for months as candidates compete for the chance to challenge president trumpdonald john

california house race more remain key contenderswho show no signs of slowing down it s going to be uglier than ugly one democratic strategist said pointing to surveys showing there is no clear winner across the first four states in the nominating process it s going to be a bloody slugfest and the thing a lot of us fear is that trump will benefit from all of it democrats have focused their efforts on electability making the case for rallying behind the kind of candidate who can topple trump some democrats say that while a progressive candidate can energize the party s base and win in the primary it would be much more difficult for that same white house hopeful to win the general election against trump julian zelizer a professor of history and public affairs at princeton university argued that because the top candidates each have strong pockets of support the primary may even lead to a brokered convention in july although people always say that this time it could be true zelizer said democrats are so desperate to defeat trump they have very different visions of how to do this and won t concede easily the party s top four candidates two progressive candidates and two moderate candidates are indicative of where the democratic party is right now said democratic strategist michael trujillo it shouldn t be a surprise you are seeing two progressives and two moderates vying for the top spot he said adding that former new york city mayor michael bloombergmichael bloombergit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process liberals embrace super pacs they once shunned 7 billion expected to be spent in 2020 campaign despite coronavirus report more is also a wild card in the primary race what is the most interesting factor here is that voters are somewhat interchangeable between biden and sanders as they are between mayor pete and sen warren i d argue it is still a jump ball in every way and that makes the race to be the democratic nominee extremely exciting trujillo added while the overall field of candidateshas shrunk in recent months it has also seen some late additions with bloomberg and former massachusetts gov deval patrickdeval

democrats were ill equipped to defeat trump voters are alsodivided resulting in a race with no clear favorite when considering the early nominating states there s still a decent amount of time left that one or two people could start consolidating support and narrow it down to a two person race said democratic strategist eddie vale but given the amount of uncertainty voters have right now about being definitely settled on their first choice and different strengths these top four have in different early states i think it s as likely we go to a brokered convention one factor contributing to a longer than usual primary season zelizer said is the strong and organized sanders warren constituency that won t disappear even though biden leads in national polls surveys are showing other candidates performing stronger in early states in iowa for example buttigieg has become the top contender in some polls the realclearpolitics average of state polls puts him in the lead with the support of 22 percent of people polled sanders ranks higher than the other candidates in new hampshire at 19 percent support according to the realclearpolitics average and biden has strong leads in nevada and south carolina the democratic strategist who predicted the primary would be a bloody slugfest said this election cycle is reminiscent of 2016 when former secretary of state hillary

coronavirus relief standoff more and sanders were locked in a bitter battle for the democratic nomination clinton emerged the winner but she was damaged from the primary the strategist said and anyone who says sanders didn t hurt her has their head in the clouds the strategist said this time around a brokered convention could only add further division at a time when we need unity most it s a bit of
