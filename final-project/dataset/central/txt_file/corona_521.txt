 president donald trump has not proved to be the bearer of reliable information when calamity threatens and people want straight answers about it that s happening again as he addresses the prospect of a coronavirus outbreak in the u s the infectious disease risks not only public health but the economy he holds up to voters for his reelection to date his comments have largely seemed intended to put a positive spin on hard information from the scientists as if he were wishing the problem away he also called the spread of coronavirus the democrats new hoax in remarks on friday comparing it to his impeachment and russia investigation he has a record on this front in one hurricane episode he displayed a map doctored to reflect his personal and ill founded theory that alabama would take it on the chin in another he dismissed the puerto rico death toll as a concoction by democrats he was fast off the mark to describe the injuries suffered by u s service members from an iranian missile attack as little more than headaches when it turned out scores suffered traumatic brain injury for their part democrats have been quick to criticize the trump administration at times too quick several presidential candidates described the federal response as hampered by trump budget cuts which have not happened and by a decimated public health bureaucracy despite the top of class scientists steering the effort here are the facts behind some of the political rhetoric on the virus trump we are rapidly developing a vaccine the vaccine is coming along well and in speaking to the doctors we think this is something that we can develop very rapidly news conference wednesday the facts no vaccine is imminent for the coronavirus a candidate vaccine for the virus causing covid 19 is approaching first step safety tests but federal experts say anything widely usable is probably more than a year away we can t rely on a vaccine over the next several months said dr anthony fauci the top infectious disease chief at the national institutes of health trump the level of death with ebola you know at the time it was a virtual 100 there s a very good chance you re not going to die it s very much the opposite you re talking about 1 or 2 whereas in the other case it was a virtual 100 now they have it they have studied it they know very much in fact we re very close to a vaccine news conference tuesday in new delhi the facts close is not correct a vaccine has already been developed for ebola the fda approved an ebola vaccine in december even before its u s approval it was being used in congo to help stem the current outbreak trump on u s coronavirus cases we re going down not up we re going very substantially down not up news conference wednesday the facts that is false assurance he s referring to the fact that most of the people he cited as having covid 19 in the u s are getting better but that is not indicative of the spread or containment of the disease since most victims by far recover cases in the u s are almost certain to increase his own officials have said repeatedly trump the flu in our country kills from 25 000 people to 69 000 people a year that was shocking to me and so far if you look at what we have with the 15 people and they are recovering the facts his remarks on the coronavirus risks are misleading scientists don t know enough about how deadly the new virus actually is and so far it hasn t infected nearly as many people as the flu flu deaths fluctuate depending on which strain is circulating and how well each year s vaccine is working but trump s cited range is in the ballpark two flu seasons ago the centers for disease control and prevention estimated there were 80 000 u s deaths the highest death toll in at least four decades this year s flu season isn t as deadly so far this season the cdc estimates there have been 16 000 to 41 000 deaths from the flu as to covid 19 an illness characterized by fever and coughing and in serious cases shortness of breath or pneumonia there are now 60 cases in the u s in addition to the ones trump cited 45 were among groups the u s government evacuated and quarantined either from china or the diamond princess cruise ship in the hardest hit part of china the death rate from the new coronavirus was between 2 and 4 while in other parts of china it was 0 7 in contrast the death rate from seasonal flu on average is about 0 1 said fauci of the u s national institutes of health that s far lower than what has been calculated so far for covid 19 but millions of people get the flu every year around the world leading to a global annual death toll in the hundreds of thousands mike bloomberg there s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing and he s defunded he s defunded centers for disease control cdc so we don t have the organization we need this is a very serious thing democratic presidential debate tuesday joe biden comparing the obama biden administration with now we increased the budget of the cdc we increased the nih budget he s wiped all that out he cut the funding for the entire effort the facts they re both wrong to say the agencies have seen their money cut bloomberg is repeating the false allegation in a new ad that states the u s is unprepared for the virus because of reckless cuts to the cdc trump s budgets have proposed cuts to public health only to be overruled by congress where there s strong bipartisan support for agencies such as the cdc and nih instead financing has increased indeed the money that government disease detectives first tapped to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional fund created for health emergencies some public health experts say a bigger concern than white house budgets is the steady erosion of a cdc grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness the front lines in detecting and battling new disease but that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates trump the broader point about there being nobody here to coordinate the response sells short what s in place to handle an outbreak the public health system has a playbook to follow for pandemic preparation regardless of who s president or whether specific instructions are coming from the white house public health experts outside government have praised the cdc s work so far and noted that its top scientific ranks have remained stable during the past three years
