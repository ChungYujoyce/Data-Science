finishes in the first two contests bernie sanders won in new hampshire with pete buttigieg in second the two essentially tied in iowa but bloomberg is skipping all of the early states and banking instead on proving his campaign s viability by doing well on super tuesday when 14 states vote on march 3 his heavy schedule of campaign events coupled with large tv ad buys will continue promoting

dishonest crooked lying cheating new york businessman is with an honest new york businessman i love amy klobuchar and i love mayor pete but i don t think either can beat president trump and that s

target of the president robert f bukaty ap hide caption despite not participating in the early contests bloomberg has already become a twitter target of the president but some who showed up were simply curious to see what bloomberg has to offer briana brady 20 was at the chattanooga event with her mother she said she was glad to have a presidential candidate coming to tennessee so early in the campaign something she couldn t recall seeing before but she s not sold on bloomberg i ve kind of changed to the warren supporting crowd but following her performance in iowa and new hampshire obviously having to reconsider for now she says she s still with elizabeth warren but we ll see what progresses over the next few weeks the sudden attention the bloomberg campaign has been getting hasn t all been positive two stories from his past broke this week one from 2015 when in a speech to the aspen institute he spoke positively of new york city s so called stop and frisk policy which allowed random searches of people on the street it actually disproportionately targeted african americans in those remarks bloomberg said that 95 of your murders and murderers and murder victims fit one m o you can just take the description and xerox it and pass it out to all the cops they are male minorities 15 to 25 bloomberg had already disavowed and apologized for promoting and expanding stop and frisk as mayor when asked about the 2015 comments this week he told reporters this issue and my comments about it do not reflect my commitment to criminal justice reform and racial equity a separate story quoting bloomberg from 2008 appeared to show him bemoaning the end of the discriminatory lending practice known as redlining in which entire neighborhoods were deemed unsuitable for mortgages and other loans in those comments he says the end of redlining led to many bad loans that contributed to the 2008 mortgage crisis campaign spokesman stu loeser told the associated press that as mayor bloomberg attacked predatory lending and that he has a plan to help a million more black families buy a house and counteract the effects of redlining and the subprime mortgage crisis the bloomberg campaign has also countered such news with a string of endorsements in recent days from prominent african american mayors and members of the congressional black caucus bloomberg has supported many of their reelection efforts in the past now he is reaping the benefits of their support because bloomberg is not on the ballot in the next states to vote nevada and south carolina his strength with voters can only be measured so far by his polling numbers he continues to flood the airwaves with tv commercials that show him calling for action on climate change and gun violence and one featuring clips of barack obama as president showering praise on bloomberg voters get to sort through it all and give their first assessment on super tuesday that s when we ll learn much more about how formidable of a candidate mike bloomberg will be npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
