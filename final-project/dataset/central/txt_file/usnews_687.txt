as the partial government shutdown approaches the two week mark thousands of federal employees and millions more americans are feeling the effects while many government functions including the military the postal service the department of veterans affairs and entitlement programs are still operating a quarter of the government lacks funding this means about 800 000 federal workers across the country are affected either required to stay home without pay or forced to work without pay during the shutdown americans are likely to notice the shutdown s consequences across a variety of areas here are some of the most notable effects most internal revenue service operations have stopped during the shutdown the agency planned to keep just one in eight employees working according to its contingency plan for december that means it won t answer taxpayer questions or perform audits until the government opens again tax season doesn t begin until later in january so if the shutdown ends soon there shouldn t be much of a noticeable effect for most people getting their tax refunds and people can still submit tax returns even if the government remains shut down but if the shutdown continues it could create larger problems for the irs the agency s contingency plan only outlined what it would do through dec 31 so the longer things drag on in january the more likely it will need to rework its plan many native american tribes have been hit hard by the government shutdown when tribes negotiated treaties with the u s government decades ago they often secured government funding for things like health care and education in exchange for land they were giving up now with the government partially shut down tribes are scrambling for funds to keep services such as food pantries and health clinics open according to the new york times but the tribes may soon run out of money if the shutdown continues and they don t know whether they will be reimbursed once the government is funded again in the meantime fewer federal workers being paid can mean that rural communities are trapped by snow in unplowed areas or that tribal citizens who work for the government don t have salaries to support their families the violence against women act expired when the government shut down in december the law which helps survivors of sexual assault domestic violence and stalking was first passed in 1994 programs already funded by grants will continue according to the washington post but the shutdown will delay payment requests for programs funded by vawa the government shutdown

trump s washington hotel maryland and washington d c are suing the president for allegedly violating the constitution s emoluments clause which prohibits federal officials from accepting money or gifts from foreign governments they claim he is profiting from foreign business at his washington hotel but because the justice department is affected by the shutdown trump s lawyers there asked a federal appeals court to postpone all filings in an appeal related to the suit according to politico the 4th u s circuit court of appeals agreed to put the case on hold in late december meaning the president will have more time to file briefs in the case once the government is back up and running a number of government agencies that deal with housing and loans have been affected by the shutdown the small business administration is closed so it can t process loan applications that small business owners and startups typically use usa today reported the department of housing and urban
