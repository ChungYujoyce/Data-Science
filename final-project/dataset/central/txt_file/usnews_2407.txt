the hardest job in washington right now belongs to a straight talking new yorker in his 70s and it s not president donald trump as trump ramps up his defiance of house democratic investigations judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler 71 is a key player in the fight nadler s committee issued the first subpoena for special counsel robert mueller s full unredacted report into russian interference in the 2016 election then voted to hold attorney general william barr in contempt when he didn t deliver it the committee will likely do the same with former white house counsel don mcgahn who failed to appear for testimony on may 21 nadler s committee may even subpoena mueller himself but nadler faces a dilemma liberals in the house democratic caucus want an impeachment inquiry into trump taking that first step they argue could help congress in its looming court battle against the white house over the legislative branch s investigative powers and would please the party s base at the same time house speaker nancy pelosi who is effectively nadler s boss has been clear about the political risks of rushing to judgment amid polls showing that centrists and independents are cooling to the idea of impeachment nadler who chairs the committee that would ultimately oversee the proceedings is caught in the middle the challenge is all the greater because of the stakes the confrontation is a test of congressional power and nadler has been incensed by the constitutional crisis he says trump s blanket defiance represents our fight is not just about the mueller report he said on may 8 our fight is about defending the rights of congress as an independent branch to hold the president accountable he s cognizant of pelosi s concerns that putting impeachment ahead of investigations could hurt democrats 2020 electoral prospects on the hill and at the white house balancing those pressures has become the biggest test of the new yorker s tenure in congress being in the spotlight is something of a novelty for nadler the son of a chicken farmer nadler came up through the state assembly before running for congress in a special election in 1992 speaking to the new york times after his victory then new york assembly speaker saul weprin categorized him as a nudnik the yiddish word for nag when he has something on his mind that he wants to get done he ll never leave you alone weprin said on his way up nadler got to know and dislike trump the pair s feud over upper west side real estate deals dates back decades and nadler makes no bones about his animosity toward trump we ve never had a liar like this in the white house he told time in december this isn t nadler s first brush with the question of impeachment either ironically his national profile rose during his opposition to president bill clinton s impeachment two decades ago but it s only recently that nadler assumed a starring role in such a drama he became judiciary chairman by surprise after his predecessor then ranking member john conyers resigned from congress amid sexual harassment allegations in 2017 few think nadler s personal history with the president or his experience under clinton would be enough to make him buck pelosi if she continues to resist calls for an impeachment inquiry but the speaker who said on may 22 that trump is engaging in a cover up is feeling the pressure too frustration among liberal house members over her deliberative approach has been growing for several weeks and is especially acute on the judiciary committee itself half a dozen lawmakers and aides tell time an increasing number of members now believe that kick starting the impeachment process with an inquiry is necessary that frustration erupted during closed door meetings on may 20 when several committee members made the case to pelosi that the party had to hold trump accountable to no avail an impeachment inquiry would get more and more people to understand trump should be impeached says representative steve cohen of tennessee who challenged pelosi nadler met with pelosi and other top leadership in a separate meeting later that night where he relayed the members case about the need for more action but she still would not budge there is a suspicion that nadler based on some of his statements agrees with us but he s in a tough spot just because of his position with the leadership says one committee member who requested anonymity to discuss internal dynamics some committee members say nadler is managing the competing pressures well the committee definitely takes into consideration members like myself says representative lucy mcbath who flipped a historically conservative district in georgia in november representative pramila jayapal a progressive who supports an impeachment inquiry says she understands nadler s political calculus he s got to make sure the whole committee is comfortable she says ultimately the democrats will need to find a unified position on impeachment but until then nadler is in the hot seat this appears in the june 03 2019 issue of time write to alana abramson at alana abramson time com
