a new sign greets travelers leaving the baghdad international airport with white on red arabic letters on a shrapnel pockmarked wall it proclaims the spot is the the site of the american crime where on january 3rd a u s drone strike killed iranian general qasem soleimani and abu mahdi al muhandis deputy leader of iraq s government sanctioned armed groups and a legendary anti isis commander among the country s majority shi ite community another sign of the anti u s sentiment in iraq the quarter to half a million iraqis who peacefully took to the streets of baghdad on friday to protest the killing and demand all american troops leave the country the gathering was a disciplined but undeniable display of the growing resentment of the u s military mission that had been welcomed in 2014 to fight isis and a clear signal of how the rising political fortunes of pro iranian iraqi politicians like march organizer shi ite cleric muqtada al sadr could hasten the departure of u s troops sadr was on good behavior today because he wants now to be known as pragmatic politician instead of molotov cocktail throwing politician one senior u s official said of the march speaking anonymously to describe the precarious security situation of u s diplomats in iraq the u s embassy in baghdad was attacked on new year s eve by iraqi militiamen who surrounded and breached the compound s gates over a 24 hour period before iraqi security forces finally intervened two iraqi officials estimated sadr s friday crowd reached 500 000 but the senior u s official put it at two hundred thousand marchers not the million he d called for nevertheless the u s official added he s still a force to be reckoned with sadr a longtime political enemy of the u s whose armed militia used to target american forces during the u s occupation of the country ordered his followers on friday not to enter the security zone housing the embassy and they listened it s part of a policy of non violent resistance agreed upon by sadr and other top iraqi militia leaders in the wake of soleimani s death the leaders met in qom iran roughly two weeks ago according to a senior iraqi official choosing to convene outside iraq partly out of fear that they too might be targeted or at the very least surveilled after the soleimani muhandis killing sadr protected iraq from iran u s rivalries and called for diplomatic means not violence for evicting the u s troops says dlawer ala aldeen president of the erbil based middle east research institute sadr also protected the u s presence indirectly by focusing iraqi popular rage into a nonviolent protest derailing other militia group s calls for blood the march shows the rising power of the pro iranian blocks in iraq despite months of violent popular protests directed against iran and the parties allied with it that led to the resignation of iraq s now caretaker prime minister adel al mahdi this gave them a boost politically to the pressure him to follow through with kicking u s troops out the senior iraqi official told time the hobbled iraqi leader has been grappling with how to enact a parliament vote demanding the exit of u s troops after the u s attack whose ouster al mahdi has publicly embraced even as he has privately slow rolled the action he fears a total american pullout will prompt the departure of western troops who have been training iraqi security forces as part of the anti isis coalition and drain the country of international investment those concerns have done little to shift opinions on the street or the demands of politicians like sadr whose political fortunes are allied with iran and its long term goal of removing u s troops from the region for now al mahdi who largely derives his political power from the iranian aligned groups has been able to delay immediate action as he does a risk assessment on how the withdrawal would affect the isis fight his hesitation has also been leavened by president donald trump s threats to sanction iraq and force it to pay for improvements the u s military made to an iraqi air base if u s troops are expelled we are happy to continue the conversation with the iraqis about what the right structure is secretary of state mike pompeo said at a state department news conference after announcing u s troops would be staying put on that front the americans and iraqis may find some common ground the status quo is unacceptable but a full withdrawal is unacceptable as well a senior iraqi official involved in the discussions says we still have a common enemy called daesh isis which we can t just forget but we need to redefine the u s role spying on iran and assassinating generals won t work he said alternatives like nato taking over the mission might appease public sentiment he suggested and restore the iraqi government s trust in american forces it s an idea that is apparently on the table in washington we re at an early stage in looking at what nato can do to expand the mission it already has in iraq amb james jeffrey u s special envoy to the global coalition to defeat isis told reporters thursday we have said that we re not interested in talking about withdrawal because we don t think we should withdraw however at the end of the day this is obviously an iraqi decision there s a lot of people who want us to stay in iraq as partners said joey hood the former deputy of the u s embassy in baghdad now the principal deputy assistant secretary of state for near eastern affairs in a friday interview on iraq s news and satire program the albasheer show he defended killing soleimani on iraqi soil it was not a choice so much as a necessity this guy was not only planning attacks on americans he had actually started carrying them out referring to the 2019 rocket attack that killed an american contractor in kirkuk and the iranian proxy attack on the u s embassy we needed to take action as soon as we could and where we could it s unfortunate that these sorts of things have to happen we don t want iraq to be a battleground for anyone contact us at editors time com
