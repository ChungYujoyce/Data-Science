mcconnell said tuesday on these protections for businesses how big are the relief packages 4 coronavirus relief packages 2 4 trillion in funding see what that means to the national debt democratshave knocked the idea arguing republicans are attempting to protect big businesses instead of families this idea of drawing red lines particularly when they re not really related to what the needs of people are particularly when they side with big corporate interests as opposed to individual workers as leader mcconnell s red line it s not productive and it s not going to work schumer said democrats have similarly highlighted funds for state local and tribal governments as theirpriority saying no bill will be taken up without additional funds for states who have seen their tax revenues devastated because of the pandemic there will not be a bill without state and local aid pelosi said late last month many republicans have expressed skepticism on this with some airing concerns that states that have mismanaged financeswill use the funds to fill budgetholes instead some have floated the option of offering more flexibility with how funds already approvedcan be used by states this is not the time for states and cities who have mismanaged their budgets over the course of many decades for them to use this as an opportunity to see you as a taxpayer in arizona as a cash cow saidsen
