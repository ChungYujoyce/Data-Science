donald trump talks a lot about his business successes but he s had more than a few failures over the years as well here s a look at some of the missteps he s made in his long career in october 1988 donald trump threw his wallet into the airline business by purchasing eastern air shuttle a service that for 27 years had run hourly flights between boston new york city and washington d c for roughly 365 million trump got a fleet of 17 boeing 727s landing facilities in each of the three cities and the right to paint his name on an airplane trump pushed to give the airline the trump touch making the previously no muss no fuss shuttle service into a luxury experience to this end he added maple wood veneer to the floors chrome seat belt latches and gold colored bathroom fixtures but his gamble was a bust a lack of increased interest from customers who favored the airline for its convenience not its fancy new look combined with high pre gulf war fuel prices meant the shuttle never turned a profit the high debt forced trump to default on his loans and ownership of the company was turned over to creditors the trump shuttle ceased to exist in 1992 when it was merged into a new corporation shuttle inc in april 2006 trump announced that after years in the real estate business he was launching a mortgage company he held a glitzy press conference at which his son donald jr predicted that
