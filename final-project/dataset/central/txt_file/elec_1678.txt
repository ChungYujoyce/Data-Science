allen for npr hide caption the 2020 election cycle might have already started the federal election commission shows that 129 people have filed to run for president in the next election there are way too many signs that the 2020 election is already beginning here s a crazy stat 129 people have already filed to run for president in 2020 as of friday afternoon in fairness in 2016 more than 1 700 filed but one of them is president trump he s not only already set up a reelection committee earlier maybe than anyone in history but his campaign released the first ad of the 2020 cycle remarkably it s touting what he s accomplished in his first 100 days there s already been a flap about stations not running it because of a falsehood in it trump s election may have been a threshold moment in presidential politics opening the door for anyone to run or at least think about it who might not have before becoming president is no longer about the ascendancy of current officerholders or lifelong public servants that experience is no longer a prerequisite now wealth power and celebrity not only have a door open for access but for the possibility of themselves being in charge it s atypical for washington and more like what s seen in hollywood or major financial centers like new york or london it s in part the evolution of decades of disengagement from the american public more interested in celebrity than the policy wonk world of washington presidential elections have become treated like reality shows giving presidential candidates outsize attention compared to the actual power they have while lower level closer to home elections and civic engagement get far less attention from voters and the media the consequences of that are not yet known but already what s emerged is activists dominating for 2020 people are already taking steps to be part of the conversation and the list below reflects the new reality it s a who s who of politics business and yes even one outright hollywood actor with no political experience facebook s mark zuckerberg was on a tractor feeding baby cows eating cheese curds holding kittens talking to cops firemen and military leaders he even ditched the hoodie for a suit in a black church he posted it all to his facebook page seriously there s been plenty of speculation about zuckerberg and campaign like writings he s done recently asked by buzzfeed if he has plans to run he said no but when pressed if he d explicitly rule it out zuckerberg did not immediately respond buzzfeed wrote he s not the only ceo being talked about disney s bob iger is reportedly being pelted with entreaties to run his contract with disney happens to expire in july 2019 perfect timing and when howard schultz stepped down as ceo of starbucks in december there was all kinds of speculation that he d run for president see here here and here in his farewell to his employees and investors he talked of rising nationalism shared values and the need to build a great and enduring america he said we re living in a fragile world there s a need for more passionate government in 2016 he told cnn never say never to a run former vice president joe biden was in new hampshire this week guys i m not running he insisted maybe he just likes the spring foliage still biden s making lots of stops that are raising eyebrows he s speaking at a florida democratic fundraiser making several commencement speeches and said at a conference in san diego i don t plan on running but everybody says because i won t commit that i will not run under any circumstances that means i m running and remember biden teased tongue in cheek in december i m going to run in 2020 for president what the hell man anyway elizabeth warren has been on a book tour she not only trash talked republicans but democrats too as for 2020 she told npr s audie cornish i don t have any plan to do that no plans ok when matt lauer told her on nbc s today show that people are printing she persisted bumper stickers she just smiled and remained silent bernie sanders was also on tour with democratic national committee chairman tom perez he was mobbed by adoring fans which he seemed to like but there were some awkward moments that show he s still not quite willing to get in line with the establishment kirsten gillibrand who replaced hillary clinton in the senate ruled out running in 2020 but is that ironclad asked about 2020 in upstate new york the new york senator said well i m dedicated to serving our state as our senator and i m running for re election so i can continue to be their senator asked if she s ruling it out she said i m focused entirely on running for senate so yes i m ruling it out what happens when or if that focus changes here s the thing she needs to win reelection in 2018 before she could even think about going public with plans to run for president she was rumored shortly after the 2016 election to be reaching out to clinton donors ohio gov john kasich is also selling books asked on cnn if he s running for president again kasich said no no no buuuut you don t close the door on anything he added sen al franken of minnesota is also part of the book club he has a book coming out at the end of the month al franken giant of the senate him running isn t as crazy as you might think and isn t a joke others have written there s already a draft franken 2020 site but he told a minnesota radio show first of all i m not running for president i think that normally what senators do is to enter the presidential race then lose very quickly and run for the senate that seems to be how it works he bluntly said no he isn t running yet his forceful questioning in hearings has raised his profile it s very clear now that he is trying to raise his profile and position himself as a leading critic of donald trump jim manley a former top aide to former majority leader harry reid d nev told the hill the rock yes the rock is on the cover of national review as the celebrity we need written by someone else who almost ran for president in 2016 and before you dismiss a celebrity actor formerly involved with wrestling look at the current occupant of 1600

no one expects she d run this week though she noted how close she was to winning michelle obama is super popular but she says no chance she s running no no no she told oprah look that s one thing i don t do i don t make stuff up i m not coy i haven t proven that i m pretty direct if i were interested in it i d say it i don t believe in playing games people don t really understand how hard this is and it s not something you cavalierly ask a family to do again ok that sounds pretty definitive chelsea clinton seems a little closer to it her twitter feed has been pretty political since trump was sworn in including this week with the passage of the house gop health care bill but she said if someone steps down or something changes i ll answer those questions at that time but right now no i m not running for public office period right now tom cotton the fiery arkansas republican has already been to iowa iowa there s nothing normal about bible believing christians being tarred as bigots because they simply want to live their faith in their day to day life he said although that was three weeks before the 2016 presidential election with trump winning he s probably more thinking 2024 at this point rep jason chaffetz r utah might be running in 2020 for governor he isn t running for reelection in 2018 but forget 2020 for president he s already thinking longer term he s already bought up jason2028 com american elections are already too long so why wouldn t it become the case that they bleed all the way into the first few months of a new presidency tv news ratings and web traffic spike in presidential years and fall off in off years and midterm elections presidential turnout rates are far higher in presidential years than in midterms on average since 1980 the u s has seen a 29 percent drop from presidential elections to midterm elections and it s been on the rise as it is the u s lags far behind other western democracies in voter participation even in presidential years but there s a danger in this the american presidency is limited by design and yet presidential elections are given outsize prominence to the detriment of policies that could affect real people s lives and important lower level elections americans just aren t as interested in civic participation as they are celebrity that means that when policies are pushed only a moneyed few with access can have quiet influence in washington and it means that activists can control the levers of power locally which trickle up to power nationally in forms like gerrymandering in redistricting politics is hard and it can be annoying but being disconnected from it has consequences and the kinds of people who could become president is one of them npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
