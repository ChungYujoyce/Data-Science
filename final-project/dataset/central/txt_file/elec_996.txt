in march when a former aide to democratic presidential nominee joe biden accused the candidate of sexually assaulting her in 1993 two people came forward to say that the woman tara reade had told them of the incident shortly after it allegedly occurred her brother collin moulton and a friend who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retribution now two more sources have come forward to corroborate certain details about reade apos s claims one of them a former neighbor of reade apos s has told insider for the first time on the record that reade disclosed details about the alleged assault to her in the mid 1990s this happened and i know it did because i remember talking about it lynda lacasse who lived next door to reade in the mid apos 90s told insider the other source lorraine sanchez who worked with reade in the office of a california state senator in the mid apos 90s told insider that she recalls reade complaining at the time that her former boss in washington dc had sexually harassed her and that she had been fired after raising concerns in interviews with insider the new york times the washington post and the politics podcaster katie halper who broke the story of the assault allegations reade has said that in the spring or summer of 1993 she was told to meet biden in a semiprivate corridor to deliver a duffel bag there she said biden pushed her up against a wall reached under her skirt and penetrated her with his fingers when she resisted his advances reade said biden expressed annoyance and said aw man i heard you liked me then she said he pointed a finger at her and said you apos re nothing to me after that she said he shook her by the shoulders and said you apos re ok you apos re fine before walking away before the alleged assault reade said she had already complained to her superiors in biden apos s office that the way biden looked at her and touched her made her uncomfortable she got no response she said and after the alleged assault was abruptly relieved of her duties managing interns she said she later filed a complaint about her treatment but not the about the assault allegation with a senate human resources office the biden camp has denied reade apos s allegations women have a right to tell their story and reporters have an obligation to rigorously vet those claims kate bedingfield biden apos s communications director said in a statement earlier this month we encourage them to do so because these accusations are false asked to comment specifically on lacasse apos s and sanchez apos s comments bedingfield referred insider to her previous statement she did not respond to a request to interview biden about reade apos s accusations insider sought access to biden apos s senatorial papers which are housed at the university of delaware to search for records that may shed light on reade apos s claims the university denied the request saying biden apos s papers will remain closed to the public until two years after mr biden retires from public life lacasse told insider that in 1995 or 1996 reade told her she had been assaulted by biden i remember her saying here was this person that she was working for and she idolized him lacasse said and he kind of put her up against a wall and he put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her she felt like she was assaulted and she really didn apos t feel there was anything she could do lacasse said that she remembers reade getting emotional as she told the story she was crying she said she was upset and the more she talked about it the more she started crying i remember saying that she needed to file a police report lacasse said she does not recall whether reade supplied any other details like the location of the alleged assault or anything biden may have said i don apos t remember all the details lacasse said i remember the skirt i remember the fingers i remember she was devastated lacasse is the first person to independently corroborate in detail and on the record that reade had told others about her assault allegations contemporaneously reade apos s brother collin moulton previously told insider that he recalled his sister saying that biden had his hand under her clothes at some point in a series of interviews with insider over the past week lacasse said she decided to speak up now at a time when reade apos s story is under intense scrutiny in the media and facing denials from the biden campaign because she believed reade apos s account when she first heard it i have to support her just because that apos s what happened lacasse said we need to stand up and tell the truth lynda lacasse tara reade apos s former neighbor says reade told her in the mid apos 90s that the democratic presidential nominee sexually assaulted her courtesy lynda lacasse lacasse 60 is a retired former medical staff coordinator and emergency room clerk for san luis obispo general hospital she lived next door to reade in 1995 and 1996 in an apartment complex near the beach in morro bay california a seaside community between santa barbara and monterey she told insider that she and reade shared a bond because they were both mothers and their young daughters swam together in the apartment complex apos s indoor pool lacasse said she would sometimes sit on her front stoop to smoke cigarettes after putting her daughter to bed and that reade would occasionally join her it was during one of these evening conversations she said that reade told her about the alleged assault we were talking about violent stories lacasse said because i had a violent situation we just started talking about things and she just told me about the senator that she had worked for and he put his hand up her skirt lacasse acknowledged that coming forward to support an allegation against the democratic presidential nominee may have repercussions for me but she said she has no political ax to grind and intends to vote for biden i personally am a democrat a very strong democrat she said and i apos m for biden regardless but still i have to come out and say this insider has verified through publicly available records that reade and lacasse were neighbors at a morro bay apartment complex in 1995 a review of lacasse apos s social media presence shows a long history of anti trump sentiments she has written approvingly of both biden and his democratic rival bernie sanders on twitter in march she shared a link on facebook to a story detailing reade apos s allegations with the message this is my good friend tara reade who was assaulted by joe biden in 1993 lacasse told insider that she and reade fell out of touch after reade moved out of their apartment complex in the late apos 90s but the two reconnected in 2016 she said when reade reached out to her on facebook in april 2019 reade told a nevada city california newspaper that biden had inappropriately touched her and made her uncomfortable though she did not accuse him of assaulting her it was after that story lacasse said that she and reade first revisited the conversation they apos d had about biden in the mid apos 90s she mentioned that she had come forward lacasse said and so i said apos oh my gosh yeah i do remember that apos then late last month in a podcast interview with halper reade made her full accusation known that biden had attacked her in a corridor shoved his hand up her skirt and digitally penetrated her after seeing how political operatives and news organizations responded to the claim the biden camp denied it outright and critics scoured reade apos s social media accounts for evidence of a purported affinity for russian president vladimir putin lacasse said she decided to come forward she didn apos t ask me to lacasse said i volunteered to do that just recently if this was me i would want somebody to stand up for me it takes a lot of guts to do what she apos s doing former biden staffer tara reade tara reade yet another source reached by insider corroborates some of reade apos s claims about her time working for biden after she left washington dc reade worked for california state sen jack o apos connell lorraine sanchez a former legislative staffer in o apos connell apos s office mentored reade and worked alongside her from 1994 through 1996 sanchez told insider that reade complained at the time about being mistreated by her former employer reade said she had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in dc sanchez said and as a result of her voicing her concerns to her supervisors she was let go fired sanchez said she does not recall if reade offered details about the sort of harassment she allegedly suffered or if she named biden what i do remember sanchez said is reassuring her that nothing like that would ever happen to her here in our office that she was in a safe place free from any sexual harassment reade said she never experienced harassment from any other employer she had during her time in washington and that the employer sanchez recalls her complaining about was biden sanchez praised reade for speaking out it takes great courage and strength to come forward sanchez said in a statement to insider it apos s much easier to keep silent however i also understand the duty we have as women to share our story regardless of who the perpetrator may be reade went on to work in the domestic violence unit for the king county prosecutor in seattle and she received her law degree from seattle university school of law in 2004 she later served as a legal services director for the snohomish county center for battered women cnn last week video emerged of an unnamed woman that reade says is her mother calling into a 1993 broadcast of cnn apos s larry king live devoted to the culture of washington dc the woman claimed that her daughter had run into unspecified problems with a us senator i apos m wondering what a staffer would do besides go to the press in washington the caller said my daughter has just left there after working for a prominent senator and could not get through with her problems at all and the only thing she could have done was go to the press and she chose not to do it out of respect for him reade had previously told the intercept apos s ryan grim that her mother who died in 2016 had made such a call but couldn apos t recall the date when grim mentioned it on a podcast twitter users dug up the transcript and video reade who has listened to the newly unearthed phone call told insider that it was indeed her mother apos s voice speaking to king it was almost a spiritual experience because my mom loved me so much and supported me reade said choking back tears i get emotional even now and i gave her such a hard time about calling larry king apos s show that i feel really bad that i couldn apos t say to her now apos thank you so much apos and give her a hug and i think the most powerful part for me was just how she crossed space and time to help me in addition to the denial from biden apos s campaign other former senate staffers have emerged to cast doubt on reade apos s accusations marianne baker who was biden apos s executive assistant for almost two decades including in 1993 issued a statement saying she never witnessed or heard of any inappropriate conduct i have absolutely no knowledge or memory of ms reade apos s accounting of events which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional and as a manager insider has reached out to other staffers who worked in biden apos s office during the time reade worked there melissa lefko at the time a staff assistant said she doesn apos t remember reade at all and that she would have been aware of any accusations of assault or harassment at the time had there been anything i would have heard about it she said an intern who worked under reade and who asked to remain anonymous said she does not recall reade discussing any allegations of assault or harassment but she does corroborate reade apos s claim that she was abruptly relieved of her duties as intern supervisor in april 1993 a move that the former intern found odd at the time earlier this month reade filed a report with the dc metropolitan police department memorializing her allegations about the 1993 incident even though the statute of limitations rendered a full investigation highly unlikely she took the step she told insider at the time for safety reasons because she had faced online harassment i also wanted to make it clear that i would be willing to go under oath or cooperate with any law enforcement regarding it because it did happen she said even if it was 26 years ago on april 20 a police spokesperson told insider that there was an active investigation into reade apos s complaint but in a statement on saturday the department said the case had been moved to an inactive status reade said she expected that outcome and said she is not backing down i apos d like to be heard in a fair and objective way she said and i apos d also like to hear joe biden apos s response which has not happened my hope is that the conversation will move forward and we will examine how i was treated when i came forward and really look at the fact that like domestic violence sexual assault and sexual harassment is not a partisan issue it is an equal opportunity offender
