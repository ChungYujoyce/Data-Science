republican senator lindsey graham lambasted democrats during his questioning of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh on thursday afternoon criticizing their handling of the sexual assault allegations against the nominee this is the most unethical sham since i ve been in politics graham said of the hearing graham attacked democrats for the time they took to bring christine blasey ford s allegations to the senate s attention and criticized democratic senators calls for an fbi investigation into the allegations of sexual assault against kavanaugh democrats led by the committee s ranking member sen dianne feinstein explained they were following ford s request to keep her name confidential ford initially shared her story with her congresswoman democratic rep anna eshoo in early july and then eshoo s office sent a letter to feinstein while feinstein knew about ford s allegations she says she honored ford s request until information leaked out and soon after ford went public still graham was not happy with the outcome if you wanted a fbi investigation you could have come to us what you wanted to do is destroy this guy s life hold his seat open and hope you win in 2020 graham said you ve said that not me graham who earlier on thursday warned democrats that they should watch our for their own future nominees addressed kavanaugh directly indicating that he believed the judge s testimony you ve got nothing to apologize for when you see sotomayor and kagan say hello because i voted for them i d never do to them what you ve done to this guy graham said this is the most unethical sham since i ve been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn t have done what you ve done to this guy after asking kavanaugh whether he was a gang rapist a reference to an allegation made by a woman named julie swetnick graham sympathized with the nominee s family i cannot imagine what you and your family have gone through graham said then returning to criticize democratic senators boy you all want power god i hope you never get it i hope the american people can see through this sham that you know about it and you held it graham said you had no intention of protecting dr ford none she s as much of a victim as you are god i hate to say it because these have been my friends but let me tell you when it comes to this you re looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend graham also lamented the impact kavanaugh s confirmation battle would have on the future this is going to destroy the ability of good people to come forward because of this crap he said emphasizing that kavanaugh had pointed out no other allegations had surfaced against him before this confirmation process toward the end of his time graham seemed to mock the allegations against kavanaugh he compared the nominee to bill cosby the comedian whom more than 50 women have accused of sexual assault and who was recently sentenced to three to 10 years in prison for one of those cases you re supposed to be bill cosby when you re a junior and senior in high school and all of a sudden you got over it graham said it s been my understanding that if you drug women and rape them for two years in high school you probably don t stop graham finished his comments by telling his own party that they should vote for kavanaugh and promising to do so himself to my republican colleagues if you vote no you re legitimizing the most despicable thing i have seen in my time in politics he said i hope you re on the supreme court that s exactly where you should be and i hope that the american people will see through this charade and i wish you well i intend to vote for you and i hope everybody who s fair minded will write to abigail abrams at abigail abrams time com
