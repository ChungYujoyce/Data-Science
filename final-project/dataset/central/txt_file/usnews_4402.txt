waiver so we are unable to comment on anything about him or the allegations made against him the register also obtained correspondence between the u s consulate in china and crapo which corroborates that harper is being held in a chinese jail we re just not sure what s going to happen villareal told the register during one of multiple phone conversations it s a very unique story the way everything is happening jeff s in china i m in idaho laws are different there s a language barrier harper was part of a tennessee connection iowa wesleyan coach alan magnani recruited to his team in 2010 it started with davis warner and continued with joe evans jeremy simmons and then harper all four attended volunteer state community college in gallatin tennessee all four ended their college careers at the mount pleasant iowa college they were all big contributors for us magnani recalled harper was the biggest the most imposing he was an impressive looking dude said magnani who coached at iowa wesleyan until 2012 he maybe came across with a scowl sometimes and maybe some thought he was the toughest guy in a room but really he s a marshmallow he would do anything for anybody it doesn t surprise me that he would go to somebody s aid that s the side villareal saw the first time they met harper was working at a youth basketball camp in the same boise facility where villareal was working as a personal trainer she was on one side of the facility while harper was on the other he came toboise during his 2017 off season after playing overseas she said he s got a teammate in boise that he played with in bolivia jeff came to stay with him and work his camps they still didn t know one another well until harper tore his patellar tendon while dunking the ball at one of the camp sessions he needed a trainer with whom to rehab he found villareal i d never really met him before that she said they dated for a year they ve been living together for three years their engagement wasn t anything super exciting villareal said it wasn t a huge occasion we weren t even going to make it public until he got back from playing in china then this happens villareal and harper speak via
