pressures on both democratic and more autocratic governments loading april 7 2020 at a time when trust in established institutions had been eroding there seems to be a renewed sense that there are some things only governments can do and in crises like the coronavirus pandemic that they must do unfamiliar demands on leaders are felt with particular urgency because of who s making them nurses and emergency workers ship captains or passengers men and women wanting assurances their needs will be met amid shortages and soaring unemployment that s forcing a rethink in many places tight pursed fiscal prudence in britain and germany for example has given way to huge aid and stimulus packages but other adjustments are more difficult democratically elected leaders championing small government face new demands for the opposite underscored for example by high ratings for many u s state governors authoritarian regimes favoring central control face a different challenge in china there has been extraordinary public criticism of early failings in russia and egypt the full impact of having to answer to the changing public mood is only starting leaders worries may be evident in recent moves to rein in or punish independent reporting of the scale of the outbreak it s the most basic of political questions but covid 19 is now moving it from the philosophy classroom into nearly every corner of every country on earth what is government for and the answer where it most matters among citizens among the governed seems to be changing dramatically at least in places feeling the worst effects of the virus there the immediate task of government has become acutely clear protect us and our loved ones and give us the information policies tools and care for that to happen that s also part of a more fundamental change at a time when trust in all established institutions had been eroding suddenly there seems to be a renewed sense that government actually matters that there are some things only governments can do and in crisis things that governments must do there s another related change despite the reach of the internet in amplifying conspiracy theories and competing versions of events we re seeing a rekindled respect and a need for expertise and trustworthy research for facts editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall whether of course such changes will prove enduring once the worst of the crisis has finally passed will take many months to answer but the unfamiliar demands on governments and leaders are immediate they re being felt with particular urgency because they re not coming only from lobbyists or think tanks they re from nurses and emergency workers imploring those in charge to get them protective gear from captains or passengers on ships where the virus has struck pleading for a place to dock from men and women old and young wanting assurances they ll have the food supplies and care they need often suddenly finding themselves without the week to week funds to afford them even in some developed countries where most of the cases or at least those publicly acknowledged are so far occurring that s forcing a rethink for britain s ruling conservatives and chancellor angela merkel s coalition government in germany tight pursed fiscal prudence has long been a political article of faith yet within days of the first stark economic impact of the covid 19 crisis both countries announced huge aid and stimulus packages with the promise of more to come similar fiscal responses are now in place or on the way in nearly all countries where citizens are feeling the impact of shutdowns of economic activity but however costly in political terms that s often proving the easiest adjustment for the people in power elected leaders championing small government for instance are facing a crisis that is prompting demands for the opposite u s president donald trump in recent days has been visibly struggling to square that circle on the one hand he has repeatedly portrayed the crisis as ultimately the responsibility of state and local leaders but sky high poll ratings for many state governors on the front line in new york or michigan washington or ohio have left no doubt of the grassroots hunger for assertive effective honest and straightforward government action the president s overall take on who is responsible is showing little sign of changing yet he did announce on friday a federal government arrangement that he said would guarantee that no american even the millions of uninsured will have to pay if hospitalized with covid 19 as not just a small government leader but a populist who has been sometimes almost flamboyantly dismissive of science president trump has also made another adjustment deferring on at least some major calls to the scientific experts in his coronavirus task force authoritarian regimes are faced with a different challenge they do believe in strong central government with pretty much everything ultimately subject to central control but the impact of covid 19 an adversary they cannot defeat by force much less by decree is being felt no less by their citizens than those in democratic countries the human response the instinctive list of things they want from their rulers has been much the same protect us give us the information and tools and care we need even in china which after initially hiding the outbreak took draconian measures to bring it under control there has been extraordinary public criticism of the early failings on the country s tightly controlled social media in other authoritarian countries like russia and egypt and even in india a democracy but one led by strongman populist narendra modi the full impact of having to answer to the changing public mood is only now beginning to hit all three of those countries seem likely to struggle with an inexorably widening number of cases india and egypt in particular both with huge populations many areas of economic deprivation and a patchy healthcare system all three have recently imposed restraints on movement and economic activity get the monitor stories you care about
