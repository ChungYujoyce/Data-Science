platform echoed that sentiment it s the core of our platform right now she said friday day acknowledged a stigma associated with single payer but said it s based on certain types of misinformation that groups like hers aim to correct the push arrives as democrats are still licking their wounds from a brutal 2016 cycle in which the republicans won control of all levers of power in washington hoping to reverse their fortunes the democrats launched a 2018 messaging agenda dubbed the better deal that aims to make inroads with the working class voters that propelled president trump into the

liberal ideals on friday sanders blasted out a fundraising email vowing to redouble his efforts for single payer there will be rallies buttons bumper stickers shirts and most importantly people organizing in their communities across the country the email reads this is not going to be a quick or easy fight sanders told the washington post last month that single payer is not a litmus test but noted that it would be hard for democrats to run for president without supporting it is this a litmus test no you have to look at where candidates are on many issues said sanders could people run sure

cosponsors more than in any of the previous years it was introduced republicans meanwhile are eager to use single payer as a weapon against democrats in both 2018 and 2020 the republican national committee rnc is already laying plans to run ads targeting not only 2020 hopefuls but also vulnerable congressional democrats in 2018 the republicans are framing single payer as a government takeover of the health care system that will erode patients choice of doctors and create waiting lists for care citing a recent urban institute estimate that put the price tag for single payer at a whopping 32 trillion they re also wondering why democrats aren t facing more pressure to get the congressional budget office to score their single payer bills if this is the rallying cry of the left they should have to say how they re going to pay for this a gop aide said friday sanders has also had to contend with the health care debate in his home state of vermont where the governor pulled a state level effort to enact single payer in 2014 after concluding it was not financially feasible recognizing the political risks house minority leader nancy pelosi d calif a long time single payer supporter has

policy consulting firm said there s no question that there s pressure and there will continue to be pressure on democrats to back single payer but he warned that it would be a terrible mistake for democrats to promise single payer on the campaign trail given the enormous headwinds facing them as they tried to follow through the democrats shouldn t allow themselves to be boxed into a rhetorical corner that then becomes a substantive corner he said noting how republicans are now struggling to explain their failureto repeal obamacare it was easier rhetorically to talk about it than to policy
