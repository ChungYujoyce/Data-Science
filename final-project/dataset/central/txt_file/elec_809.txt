washington after a tumultuous election night democrats on wednesday morning had the big prize they desperately wanted control of the house of representatives but republicans could claim bragging rights as well by bolstering their hold on the senate before the 2020 presidential campaign begins in earnest what have we learned well for starters it s too late for that because the next campaign is well underway that s lesson 1 president donald trump filed for re election the day he was inaugurated andhis campaign already has raised 100 million and begun airing tv and digital ads so it should be no surprise that trump campaigned more aggressively than any other modern president during the election midway through his term he drew thousands of supporters to hugerallies where he talked more about himself than the candidates he was there to boost some were in states crucial for his re election prospects on monday he closed the campaign with events in ohio indiana and missouri and he officially announced his 2020 slogan keep america great for democratic presidential hopefuls the campaign was an opportunity to audition a stream of potential contenders managed to make their way to iowa the state that is set to hold the opening presidential caucuses in 15 months or so senators cory booker of new jersey kamala harris of california and bernie sanders of vermont plus governors steve bullock of montana john hickenlooper of colorado andjay inslee of washington state and representatives eric swalwell of california and john delaney of maryland even stormy daniels lawyer michael avenatti some democrats saw the midterms as a testing ground for a more assertively liberal message by the party s 2020 standard bearer whoever it turns out to be you showed the country that progressives can win and win decisively in the heartland democratic sen sherrod brown of ohio sometimes mentioned as a presidential possibility told cheering supporters at his re election victory party tuesday night and you showed the country by putting people first and by honoring the dignity of work we carry a state that donald trump won by almost double digits a college diploma is the new political divide the gender gap the tendency for women to vote more democratic than men do is familiar a regular feature of american elections since 1980 now a sharp divide over education has added another dimension and opened a new breach between white voters who have a college degree and those who don t african american voters at all education levels typically vote democratic as do many hispanics a usa today analysis of counties across the country who have the largest proportion of residents with college degrees showed a significant shift since the last midterm in 2014 then theyvoted for the republican congressional candidate by 15 percentage points this time they backed the democrat by a single point the education gap is particularly yawning between college educated white women and non college educated white men going into tuesday s election college educated white women preferreddemocratic congressional candidates by 18 percentage points a marist nprpollfound while white men without a college degree backed republicans by 33 points a jaw dropping 51 point gap that helps explain both parties campaign strategies republicans focused on ousting democratic senators from interior states like indiana and north dakota where the population is whiter older and less likely to have a college degree than states on the coasts democrats aimed their efforts at defeating house republicans from suburban districts across the country where more residents have graduated from college this could signal the start of a realignment between the two major parties with repercussions for presidential elections down the road consider this 41 percent of white men without a college education strongly approved of trump one of his best showings among college educated white women 56 percent strongly disapproved one of his worst in the past two midterms no issue hurt democratic congressional candidates more than the affordable care act backlash to the law contributed to the historic loss of 63 house seats in 2010 and with that democratic control and an additional 13 in 2014 since obamacare was enacted in 2009 republicans campaigned on a promise to repealit in four successive elections despite holding dozens of votes theyfailed to do thateven after winning the white house and control of congress this time in a turnaround most of the ads that mentioned the affordable care act this time were being aired by democrats who accused republicansof undermining its protection for patients with pre existing health conditions the wesleyan media project calculated that close to 60 percent of the tv ads supporting democratic congressional candidates last monthmentioned health care fewer than 10 percent of democratic ads did in 2010 and 2014 republicans wereon the defensive about their vote last year to weakenobamacare s protections by allowing states to waive some of the law s requirements what s more republican attorneys general in 20 states have joined in a lawsuit that challengesthe constitutionality of the affordable care act and would overturn the framework that protects coverage for those with chronic illnesses by the end of thiscampaign trumpand other republicans were promising not to repeal obamacare but to preserve those protections although they offer few specifics about how they would do that in exit polls by a media consortium including abc cbs cnn and nbc four in 10 called health care themost important issue far more than the number who cited immigration or the economy or gun policy big money small money more money total spending on the electionstopped 5 2 billion the center for responsive politics estimated the biggest jump inmidterm fundraising in at least two decades republican candidates raised record amounts of money and democratic candidates raised even more there s more money in campaigns than you could have ever imagined says stuart rothenberg a veteran analyst with the non partisan inside elections who would think of spending 10 million in a house campaign this year more than 46 million was spent in the most expensive house contest in georgia s 6th congressional district and seven otherhouse races saw total spending of more than 15 million the amounts surged both because of a handful of big donors 13 contributors gave more than 10 million each and millions of small ones the huge democratic war chest made it possible for the party to finance some longer shot campaigns rothenberg predicts there will beno turning back i don t think this is going to be a unique circumstance he said it s a new reality in the 2018 midterms trump defined the emerging republican party women as candidates contributors voters and activists defined the emerging democratic party that began the day after the president was inaugurated with massive women s marches promising resistance what followed wastwo years of unprecedented activism take house races tracked by rutgers center for american women and politics 476 women filed as candidates the previous record was 298 on election day 237 were on the ballot the previous record was 167 records were broken by female contenders for every sort of office for governorships senate seats and state legislative races a record number of women donated to campaigns the center for responsive politics reported and often to female candidates women contributed 159 million to female democratic candidates 2 times the amount they gave two years ago women voters have outnumbered and outvoted men for nearly three decades so that is not a new trend to this year but what is notable this year is women stranslation of advocacy and activism into bothcandidacy and political giving said kelly dittmar a political scientist at rutgers and director of a project called gender watch 2018 this year women are claiming their seats at the table a former democrat who had never run for political office before his unlikely campaign two years ago is now the face of the republican party redefining its tenets and reshaping its coalition the midterm elections underscored how completely trump commands the gop outsider trump like contenders upset establishment favorites for the gubernatorial nominations in florida and kansas the senators most likely to criticize him bob corker of tennessee and jeff flake of arizona decided not to run again the republicans on the ballot who openly distanced themselves from the president could be counted on one hand and not using all five fingers one of the few gop house incumbents who did carlos curbelo of florida lost his bid for re election the white house was quick to take credit for gop gains in the senate frankly the candidates who have embraced the president and the president has gone in to campaign for over the last several weeks are candidates that we see doing very well tonight white house press secretary sarah sanders said in an interview on fox news the president unified the party and brought it together trump s primacy is unchallenged even though he publicly castigated such republican allies as house speaker paul ryan and privately alarmed top party officials with divisive rhetoric many urged him to focus on the strength of the economy instead the president s closing message trumpeted dire and unsubstantiated warnings about the threat from illegal immigration what s surprising to me is how sustained and intensified the support is for donald trump lawrence jacobs director of the center for the study of politics and governance at the university of minnesota said when asked what he had learned during the midterms the much predicted fall of donald trump as a candidate and as a political figure has not been the case among republicans if anything he s picked up a more intense following two thirds of voters in the exit pollssaid the president affected their vote about one in four to show their support for him about four in 10 to show their opposition trump love him or loath him defined the 2018 election as he did in 2016 andas he surely will in 2020
