former special counsel robert mueller appeared before congress on wednesday for a highly anticipated pair of hearings where he will answer questions about his investigation into russian interference in the 2016 presidential election over the course of my career i ve seen a number of challenges to our democracy the russian government s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious mueller said in his opening statement before the house judiciary committee on wednesday morning this deserves the attention of every american mueller s testimony before the house judiciary and intelligence committees marks the first time mueller has taken questions about his report and only the second time the former special counsel has spoken publicly about the investigation mueller had been reluctant to say anything further telling reporters in may that the report is my testimony while his testimony wednesday is not expected to produce major revelations the stakes are high for democrats who are expected to use the opportunity to combat president donald trump s false claims of total exoneration and question mueller about evidence in the report of several instances of possible obstruction of justice by trump read more mueller s testimony isn t expected to deliver bombshells here s why it still matters mueller declined to charge trump citing constitutional limitations on his power but he wrote that the report does not exonerate him if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice we would so state he wrote based on the facts and the applicable legal standards however we are unable to reach that judgment mueller will appear before the house intelligence committee on wednesday afternoon following his testimony before the house judiciary committee read mueller s full opening statement here good morning chairman nadler ranking member collins and members of the committee as you know in may 2017 the acting attorney general asked me to serve as special counsel i undertook that role because i believed that it was of paramount interest to the nation to determine whether a foreign adversary had interfered in the presidential election as the acting attorney general said at the time the appointment was necessary in order for the american people to have full confidence in the outcome my staff and i carried out this assignment with that critical objective in mind to work quietly thoroughly and with integrity so that the public would have full confidence in the outcome the order appointing me as special counsel directed our office to investigate russian interference in the 2016 presidential election this included investigating any links or coordination between the russian government and individuals associated with the trump campaign it also included investigating efforts to interfere with or obstruct the investigation throughout the investigation i continually stressed two things to the team that we had assembled first we needed to do our work as thoroughly as possible and as expeditiously as possible it was in the public interest for our investigation to be complete but not to last a day longer than necessary second the investigation needed to be conducted fairly and with absolute integrity our team would not leak or take other actions that could compromise the integrity of our work all decisions were made based on the facts and the law during the course of our investigation we charged more than 30 defendants with committing federal crimes including 12 officers of the russian military seven defendants have been convicted or pled guilty certain of the charges we brought remain pending today for those matters i stress that the indictments contain allegations and every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in addition to the criminal charges we brought as required by justice department regulations we submitted a confidential report to the attorney general at the conclusion of the investigation the report set forth the results of our work and the reasons for our charging and declination decisions the attorney general later made the report largely public as you know i made a few limited remarks about our report when we closed the special counsel s office in may of this year there are certain points that bear emphasis first our investigation found that the russian government interfered in our election in sweeping and systematic fashion second the investigation did not establish that members of the trump campaign conspired with the russian government in its election interference activities we did not address collusion which is not a legal term rather we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy it was not third our investigation of efforts to obstruct the investigation and lie to investigators was of critical importance obstruction of justice strikes at the core of the government s effort to find the truth and to hold wrongdoers accountable finally as described in volume 2 of our report we investigated a series of actions by the president towards the investigation based on justice department policy and principles of fairness we decided we would not make a determination as to whether the president committed a crime that was our decision then and it remains our decision today let me say a further word about my appearance today it is unusual for a prosecutor to testify about a criminal investigation and given my role as a prosecutor there are reasons why my testimony will necessarily be limited first public testimony could affect several ongoing matters in some of these matters court rules or judicial orders limit the disclosure of information to protect the fairness of the proceedings and consistent with longstanding justice department policy it would be inappropriate for me to comment in any way that could affect an ongoing matter second the justice department has asserted privileges concerning investigative information and decisions ongoing matters within the justice department and deliberations within our office these are justice department privileges that i will respect the department has released the letter discussing the restrictions on my testimony i therefore will not be able to answer questions about certain areas that i know are of public interest for example i am unable to address questions about the opening of the fbi s russia investigation which occurred months before my appointment or matters related to the so called steele dossier these matters are the subject of ongoing review by the department any questions on these topics should therefore be directed to the fbi or the justice department as i explained when we closed the special counsel s office in may our report contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made we conducted an extensive investigation over two years in writing the report we stated the results of our investigation with precision we scrutinized every word i do not intend to summarize or describe the results of our work in a different way in the course of my testimony today as i said on may 29 the report is my testimony and i will stay within that text and as i stated in may i also will not comment on the actions of the attorney general or of congress i was appointed as a prosecutor and i intend to adhere to that role and to the department s standards that govern it i will be joined today by the deputy special counsel aaron zebley mr zebley has extensive experience as a federal prosecutor and at the fbi where he served as chief of staff mr zebley was responsible for the day to day oversight of the investigations conducted by our office i also want to again say thank you to the attorneys the fbi agents the analysts and the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner these individuals who spent nearly two years working on this matter were of the highest integrity and let me say one more thing over the course of my career i ve seen a number of challenges to our democracy the russian government s effort to interfere in our election is among the most serious as i said on may 29 this deserves the attention of every american write to katie reilly at katie reilly time com
