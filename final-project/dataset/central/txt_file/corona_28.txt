customers fret over food shortages loading march 31 2020 maybe you have a local store not a national chain where you buy some if not all of your groceries you probably know some of the staff by now perhaps the store manager too if he s anything likemark mignosa who runs a bustling grocery south of boston mr mignosa likes to know his customers his competitors and just about everything about the grocery business he s in constant motion on the shop floor and in the storeroom working long days in normal times that workload keeps him busy but these are not normal times not when shoppers are panic buying employees are calling in sick and suppliers are struggling to keep up will our food keep showing up the customers ask him politely from a safe distance the fight against covid 19 is being waged on many fronts mr mignosa is fighting to keep his community and his workforce whole his day is a window into what that looks like in an american town in a pandemic the grocer gets up at 5 a m and washes his hands in the dark he dresses eats something tries to clear his mind and opens his email he begins on another day in other times this is when he would have looked at numbers order sizes maybe sales by hour prior year traffic he would have been planning imagining innovations thinking hard about customer demands and employee needs and competitor strategies he would have been thinking hard about how he might make his store better as he loves to do editor s note as a public service we ve removed the paywallfor all our coronavirus coverage it s free but today the grocer will do none of that the grocer s name is mark mignosa and right now his grocery store fruit center marketplace in hingham massachusetts could be almost any grocery store in locked down america and his story almost any grocer s story except that his store isn t any store it s mine and like anybody i need it to keep getting me food by 6 30 a m after the emailing from home about health department updates tactical questions from managers and the day s directives even more handwashing he s in the fruit center s aisles and from the moment you hit the store you re on he says the doors will open at 7 instead of 8 for a newly added hour restricted to 60 and over shoppers and away the day will race agenda get enough goods on the emptying shelves keep customers safe and calm keep employees healthy and committed and keep himself from getting sick ready set go mr mignosa knows what i m thinking because he knows everybody s thinking it will our food keep showing up sometime in the past few weeks as coronavirus cases and social lockdowns spread mr mignosa watched americans decide they could no longer trust groceries to be available when they needed them hence the hoarding almost half the stores responding to a national progressive grocer poll likened their customers to frantic prospectors in a river running out of gold the fruit center was no exception foot traffic rose between 100 and 200 and average checkout tallies doubled business still remains at holiday levels says mr mignosa which is hard to manage in the best of times and brutally hard when the holiday refuses to end of course his customers like shoppers everywhere have questions how can we expect the food system to keep working when it seems like most people don t go to work will we ever actually see toilet paper again according to supply chain analysts and grocery industry insiders as well as mr mignosa s own instincts and experience the answers are easy yes there will be toilet paper in fact there were a few rolls yesterday fred found some from an industrial paper distributor the crew we have they re veterans they can find things it sold out more s coming and yes the u s food supply chain will keep getting us food just not everything we re used to the fruit center and its sister location in nearby milton both co owned and co managed by mr mignosa and his brother michael are about half the size of average supermarkets but still need deliveries from 30 distributors and some 200 vendors supply isn t perfect mr mignosa says but honestly i m impressed by the product flow he wishes product flow were his biggest worry the morning goes both fast and slow fast because of so much work and with very short staff we re down a few people in every department employees have begged off due to illness or discomfort with the exposure or the need to care for others at home which is absolutely understandable and what you expect mr mignosa says we need people to do what s right for them slow because it s just a few weeks since the national emergency declaration and already you can see the accumulating weariness among the staff the wish for the days to hurry up and the bad dream to be over massachusetts is among the worst hit states so far with more than 5 700 confirmed cases of covid 19 in the store mr mignosa likes to move constantly circulating with short quick steps when he stops to talk his torso tilts forward a little as though to catch any words that might fall between you he s the kind of boss who wears the same outfit the clerks and stockers do if there s a sudden need for baggers at the checkout he s the kind of boss who bags before all this says mr mignosa everything about our days was completely different the whole focus would have been customer service quality freshness the personal development of employees the fruit center has 300 then there s the scramble to keep up with orders and find new sources of must have items cleaning goods and paper products remain hard to get along with backroom store supplies like bathroom soaps and sanitizers and sometimes deli meats and water like before a storm the other day there wasn t any canola oil or dried black beans a lot of comfort food is going on mr mignosa says meanwhile the store s processes and tactics are changed almost daily the salad bar is closed the soup table is closed to facilitate safe social distancing the store is metered now 50 or 60 shoppers are allowed in after that it s one in one out plastic glass barriers have been erected at checkouts and hourly wages have been hiked 2 as has become increasingly common industrywide in front of the fish counter and deli counter and checkout stations there s blue tape on the floor to keep people at a distance there are signs up by lunchtime mr mignosa has no idea how many times he has washed his hands nor how many conversations he has had with staffers with customers all centered on the same issue sometimes it feels like the conversations are all he does we re all a little frightened because we re all on the front line i don t even want to say that because i don t want to scare anybody but it s the truth in italy an infected grocery clerk has died the news reports are everywhere so he circulates and he talks it s the time you have with every individual that matters they need it they re sacrificing so much they re such pros says mr mignosa he tries to reach everybody could be three minutes 10 minutes could be a couple people could be one at a time customers too seem hungry to talk all day they ask mr mignosa and his fruit center colleagues how are you you guys doing ok the questions are repeated so often that one might imagine they grow stale when there s so much work to do no mr mignosa says no no we need people to ask us that we need to ask them how they re doing too with customers there s more of a connection now than ever because we re all going through this together it helps everyone it helps me afternoon mr mignosa is in the parking lot where there are too many cars he s traffic copping smiling directing people in his simultaneously decisive and self effacing way outside the main door shoppers are lined up in the manner we ve all now learned spread out like fence posts that got abandoned before the actual fencing went up i recognize some of them by sight if not name 20 years of patronage among others just as loyal will do that they seem calm i ask them how they re doing good they each say considering one couple christine and alden tell me this is nice nice yeah i feel better here explains christine i mean this is our store at home the news it can seem like nothing is working anywhere and the isolation she looks around the sky is gray but it s not too cold here feels normal well normal ish alden revises he changes the subject i seriously want to thank these guys for their service is that weird i say i know what he means inside the store a fully masked customer at the checkout waves his arm to indicate his filled cart and gives me a muffled this is great the skin around his eyes crinkling with a smile you can t see meanwhile people keep floating slowly through the aisles nodding to one another as they calculate just what 6 feet looks like there s still no toilet paper or flour or chicken stock mr mignosa says it troubles him because normal is exactly what he s going for it isn t normal though the shelves may look serene but the duck s feet are windmilling frantically below the surface just as they are behind the scenes at other supermarkets and food distributors and loading docks across the country mr mignosa can t get his staff to leave on time it s overwhelming the amount of load coming in for restocking he tells me the store closes at 6 p m instead of its previous 8 p m to allocate hours for sanitizing and stock handling but there s still not enough time to get the work done and they don t wanna leave mr mignosa adds i keep insisting it s important to leave you have to get rest you have to take care of yourselves does mr mignosa take his own advice sometime between 5 30 and 6 p m he goes home he has been at the store for 11 hours tomorrow he ll do it again maybe you feel about some store that s local to you the way i feel about the fruit center especially now on occasion over the past two decades i feared for it as a whole foods and a trader joe s and a fresh market came to town joining two other supermarkets already here but the fruit center just kept getting better and thrived it s the kind of store where if you ask a stocker for the location of the capers he doesn t tell you or point he drops what he s doing and takes you to them no matter how many aisles away the store is good is the thing flagrantly competent delightful to be in easy to count on you can count on it without even thinking about it you can take it for granted over the phone i tell mr mignosa about the customers who wanted to thank him and his people for their service and i hear him exhale you know he says we get a lot of that now seems ridiculous but i almost feel like a first responder or a fireman whatever it s not like we re depended on for survival or anything yet you kind of are i remind him because food people are so grateful it keeps you going and when we get that support in an email or a conversation we immediately try to blast it around the store to everyone it s like this is it this is why we can do this and of course i know they can i know they will it s a grocery store but right about now it feels a little heroic mr mignosa is home for the night his phone on always but his computer off he and his wife have three kids two in college and a high school freshman and now the whole family is back together in the lockdown my family s great they re very balanced he says his voice making it sound as though balanced might be the hardest and most precious thing in the world it s a good reset for me so he resets does he worry about how long he and his crew can keep going no i m just not at that point i don t think about that nothing past tomorrow matters there s no doubt that we can keep this going for our community so tomorrow like today he ll do the best thing he can think to do which is to do his job as well as he can do it but first he needs some rest so he ll go to bed get the monitor stories you
