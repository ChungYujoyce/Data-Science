 ken rudin forget the widespread rumor going around in recent weeks that mitt romney was going to announce his running mate this month perhaps if the persistent attacks on romney s taxes investments and stewardship of bain capital started to show sharp erosion in his numbers he would have moved up a v p announcement but that hasn t happened with polls indicating a continuous dead heat with president obama romney is about to embark tuesday on a week long trip to britain israel and poland without first naming someone to his ticket this foreign trip coincides with the summer olympics in london that last until sunday aug 12 the republican convention in tampa convenes two weeks later who will be romney s vp the naming of his running mate is likely going to come in mid august after his foreign trip and the conclusion of the olympics ken rudin collection hide caption by process of elimination romney s widely awaited announcement will probably come sometime the week of the 13th and while i ve long argued that the presidential race is always decided by who runs at the top of the ticket and not who is number two there is no question that a lot is at stake in romney s choice and that s why i m leading with this e mail question q you have touched on some of the poor choices presidential candidates have made picking a v p running mate such as sarah palin dan quayle geraldine ferraro etc could you expand on this subject i would like to hear more about the good and poor choices and how this affected the election neil herness san marcos calif a many people will argue that the most important thing in naming a vice presidential running mate is that he or she should do no harm that as long as the pick is not controversial or does not cause a distraction that is a good thing and if the choice actually helps well that s a bonus in my view not since jack kennedy picked lyndon johnson has the choice of a running mate truly affected the outcome in november lbj did after all help bring texas to the democratic fold in 1960 but the record for subsequent no 2 s is a bit mixed here s my scorecard 1964 democrat president lyndon johnson without a vice president since he succeeded the assassinated john f kennedy in 1963 named hubert humphrey the senate majority whip at the convention he said the minnesotan was best qualified to become president should something happen to him humphrey s avowed liberalism also helped soften some opposition to johnson from the left verdict plus republican sen barry goldwater may have picked rep william miller of new york the head of the national republican congressional committee who had already announced his decision to retire in 64 because as an easterner and roman catholic he would bring geographical and religious balance to the gop ticket or as goldwater said on more than one occasion he picked miller because he drove lbj nuts ultimately though miller was a non factor in the election in which the gop was buried in november in fairness nothing was going to help goldwater that year verdict minus 1968 republican it s not clear whether richard nixon even met spiro agnew before choosing him as his running mate agnew elected governor of maryland in 1966 as a liberal moved steadily to the right in 1968 especially since agnew s original choice for the white house new york s nelson rockefeller dillydallied on deciding whether to run agnew also received national attention when he directly criticized black leaders in maryland in the wake of the riots following the assassination of the rev martin luther king jr that apparently won the notice of sens strom thurmond r sc and john tower r tx who urged nixon to go with agnew which he did one day after agnew nominated him for president at the convention of course this was in the day when vetting potential vp picks was unheard of had anyone done the most cursory investigation of agnew they might have learned about his corruption and bribe taking an activity that began even before his governorship when he was baltimore county executive but agnew did provide the red meat attack dog rhetoric nixon clearly sought in his running mate verdict minus democrat sen ed muskie of maine may have been just as much of a national political unknown as agnew was but he was considered a serious and thoughtful if colorless legislator and while presidential nominee hubert humphrey took a pounding mostly from the left during that divisive general election campaign muskie won respect from both wings of the party throughout the fall verdict plus 1972 democrat if no running mate was going to help barry goldwater in 1964 the same could be said about whomever george mcgovern was going to select in 1972 still the revelation by sen thomas eagleton of missouri just two weeks after he was picked that he had been treated for depression with electroshock therapy and was hospitalized several times in the early 1960s threw the party for a loop mcgovern may have famously said he was 1 000 percent for eagleton but there was tremendous pressure on eagleton to withdraw which he did 17 days after being named to the ticket verdict minus the democratic national committee then named sargent shriver as eagleton s replacement but he was a non factor for the rest of the campaign mcgovern had tried to entice other democrats onto the ticket including sen edward kennedy but they all said no verdict minus 1976 democrat if jimmy carter was an outsider from the south with anti establishment credentials and no washington experience sen walter mondale of minnesota a big government liberal and a member of the club in good standing was the perfect counterbalance though carter was to have a strained relationship with many democrats in congress they never lost their respect for mondale he also was a clear winner in his vp debate against kansas sen bob dole verdict plus republican in choosing bob dole as his running mate and dumping vice president nelson rockefeller in the process president gerald ford did not focus on geographical or ideological balance he was looking for a take no prisoners conservative battler who would appeal to the supporters of defeated presidential hopeful ronald reagan but dole proved to be a testy campaigner and his performance in his debate with mondale was seen as a disaster notably his description of the two world wars korea and vietnam as democrat wars verdict minus 1980 republican ronald reagan may have campaigned as a steadfast conservative but in choosing george h w bush as his running mate he showed his pragmatic side bush was a conservative but in the moderate mode and the reagan bush ticket unified the party bush of course had to take back his earlier criticism of reagan s economic policies and abortion views it was the first time a gop ticket was made up of rivals for the nomination since 1944 when new york gov thomas dewey chose john bricker his counterpart from ohio verdict plus 1984 democrat walter mondale may have thrown a hail mary pass with his selection of rep geraldine ferraro of new york as his running mate the first woman in history to appear on a major party ticket but the history of the moment and the ecstatic response the choice received from feminist groups soon gave way to troubling news about the financial affairs of ferraro s husband in the end though no one can claim that the distraction about john zaccaro is what did in mondale who lost 49 out of 50 states to president reagan but a distraction it was verdict minus 1988 republican on paper vice president george bush s argument for selecting sen dan quayle of indiana made sense he was young but not jack kemp he was midwest where bush needed help but not bob dole and he had the reputation of being a giant killer having toppled democratic sen birch bayh in 1980 but just as ferraro s family finances were not properly vetted by the dems in 84 the process by which quayle joined the national guard in the middle of the vietnam war and the family connections he used to get him there became the story from day one and his performance against democratic vp pick lloyd bentsen in their debate has forever been described as a deer in the headlight moment for quayle with the bush quayle ticket winning 40 out of 50 states in november it became one of the instances in which a ticket won despite the vp candidate verdict minus democrat since the boston austin axis worked so well for kennedy and johnson in 1960 there was no reason for massachusetts gov michael dukakis to think it wouldn t work again when he picked texas sen lloyd bentsen and although bentsen won plaudits with his handling of gop rival dan quayle during his famous you re no jack kennedy debate performance some in the party felt that bentsen was a wrong fit from the beginning he differed from dukakis on many issues and he was too far to the right for many progressives in the party to accept and unlike the 1960 comparison bentsen failed to bring along his home state of texas many republicans suggested that before dukakis debated vice president bush he might have to settle his differences with bentsen verdict minus 1992 democrat bill clinton abandoned conventional wisdom when he selected sen al gore as his running mate rather than seek any kind of geographical ideological or demographic balance the arkansas governor instead picked someone very similar to himself a young moderate from nearby tennessee one way they differed while clinton had the reputation as being a draft dodging womanizer gore served in vietnam and his wife was a vocal promoter of family values and that didn t hurt either verdict plus 1996 republican plain and simple bob dole selected in jack kemp someone he didn t agree with or especially like they ran against each other for the nomination in 1988 and were on opposite sides of the deficit reduction vs supply side economics debate but dole running behind president clinton all year decided that he needed to go for broke and kemp though out of office eight years remained popular with the reagan wing of the party kemp however distinguished himself neither on the campaign trail nor in his debate with vice president gore verdict minus 2000 republican dick cheney who headed up george w bush s search committee for a running mate perhaps knew better than anyone what the texas governor lacked national security and foreign policy experience and he provided it as someone who never pined for the white house cheney s addition was more about governing than simply campaigning we can argue whether his policy pushes during his eight years in office were popular or not but no vice president played a more crucial role in determining the course of the nation than cheney verdict plus democrat al gore was tormented by how to deal with a term limited president bill clinton in 2000 the incumbent remained very popular but gore searching for swing voters who may have been put off by clinton s personal conduct seemed determined to make a statement he named sen joseph lieberman of connecticut the first jew to run on a major party ticket but more important someone who had publicly and forcefully denounced clinton s conduct in the aftermath of l affaire lewinsky but if he also picked lieberman to be an attack dog he was sorely mistaken lieberman went out of his way to be nice including during his debate with cheney and there s no telling how many voters who felt clinton was a net positive for the party were alienated by lieberman s selection verdict minus 2004 democrat to say that john edwards was not a successful vote getter during the democratic primaries would be an understatement he won only one state south carolina where he was born but he had a winning campaign style and presidential nominee john kerry despite some personal misgivings picked him to fill the ticket still edwards failed to bring in any southern state in november to the democratic column and many partisans felt he was insufficiently aggressive in his debate against vice president cheney and this negative report card does not include his later indefensible behavior in his personal life verdict minus 2008 democrat in his two tries for his party s presidential nomination sen joe biden of delaware never got very far he could be and was long winded and vain he had a habit of making embarrassing gaffes and several of his comments about barack obama articulate and clean that the white house was not the place for on the job training threatened to come back and haunt him if obama was making the case that he opposed the war in iraq from the beginning and stood for genuine change he was naming a running mate who was 65 had been in the senate since 1973 and voted for the war but biden was a great campaigner very smart and well liked and just as cheney gave the gop ticket foreign policy bona fides biden s vast washington experience and expertise in foreign affairs helped balance obama s 15 minutes in the senate verdict plus republican at the gop convention in st paul alaska gov sarah palin gave a speech that brought the house down and in doing so she helped make conservatives who never fully warmed up to john mccain suddenly get enthused and excited about the ticket that enthusiasm and palin s positive reviews didn t last long verdict minus note this answer is derived from my aug 20 2008 political junkie column with some changes updates political updates i post periodic political updates during the week on twitter you can follow me at kenrudin here s some stuff that appeared in my e mail in box q do you think the gop will win an electoral vote in maine s second congressional district in november if i remember correctly bush came within a few points of winning the district in 2000 joshua holman havelock n c a probably not yes george w bush came close to carrying the 2nd cd in 2000 which would have given him an additional electoral vote both maine and nebraska award an electoral vote to the presidential winner of a congressional district but this doesn t look like a good year for republicans in the pine tree state and mitt romney s chances are only part of that calculation the senate seat of retiring republican olympia snowe is all but gone and controversial gop gov paul lepage would find it quite difficult to win a second term if the election were held this year and speaking of the state s 2nd cd bush s father incumbent president george h w bush actually finished third in the district and the state to bill clinton and ross perot in 1992 for the record barack obama narrowly carried nebraska s 2nd cd in 2008 and thus picked up an electoral vote in the process but that s not likely to be repeated in november q i ve listened to the argument in political junkie and i still think you are wrong in insisting both sides do it regarding democrats and republicans using nazi comparisons to trash their opponents yes there were crazies on the left who portrayed george w bush as hitler but i can t think of anyone of prominence on the left saying what those on the right constantly spew out you can t compare street protests with people such as maine s governor lepage and how can you forget fox news roger ailes calling npr nazis an outlandish charge he never apologized for phyllis bernstein new york n y a i ll say it one more time my point was not to say both parties trot out this garbage equally as for whether respected people on the left have used this tactic i remember reading that al gore once referring to bush supporters as a network of rapid response digital brownshirts that sounds over the top to me i think the late sen robert byrd d wv once said something during the judicial filibuster debate about a reference to hitler look do i think we ve witnessed this kind of behavior more during the obama years than the bush years no question my only argument is that it s got to stop q i enjoyed your back and forth with substitute podcaster brian naylor in last week s podcast about the green party and when it actually was created brian should know not to question your amazing political knowledge i hope he is not banned forever from the podcast sherry krauss minneapolis minn a the only squabbles i ever have with brian is about baseball he s a mets fan enough said what he actually was remembering was covering the citizens party not the green party during its 1980 convention the pro environment party which had contempt for all three major presidential candidates that year president jimmy carter republican challenger ronald reagan and independent john anderson nominated barry commoner a writer and environmental science professor his running mate was la donna harris a native american activist and wife of former oklahoma sen fred harris the ticket was on the ballot in some 29 states in pennsylvania it was called the consumer party attracting about 234 000 votes the party also ran a presidential slate in 1984 but it dissolved not long after q have you had a chance to see the political animals show on the usa network wondering what you thought i liked it a lot d newman austin texas a i m not sure first of all who s going to believe a tv show based on a woman who runs for the democratic presidential nomination with the backing of her former president husband but loses and then becomes secretary of state how do they think up these things seriously while it s always nice to see sigourney weaver i found admittedly after one episode the writing and plot lines fairly predictable sometimes inadvertently comical and the caricature of weaver s philandering husband of course based on bill clinton is just the worst there has to be a reason why the country elected bud hammond played by ciar n hinds but you d never know it from what we ve seen he s buffoonish clownish and quite frankly embarrassing to watch but other parts of the plot as well as other characters were intriguing and so yes i plan on tuning in for the second episode political junkie segment on talk of the nation each wednesday at 2 p m et the political junkie segment appears on talk of the
