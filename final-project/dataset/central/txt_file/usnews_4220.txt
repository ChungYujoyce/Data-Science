democratic commissioners canceled it out of concerns about covid 19 which has killed more than 22 000 people in the state the commissioners argued the election was unnecessary because biden was the

deprived voters of the right to select the democratic delegates who would represent them at the democratic national convention protecting the public from the spread of covid 19 is an important state interest torres wrote but the court is not convinced that canceling the presidential primary would meaningfully advance that interest at least not to the degree as would justify the burdensome
