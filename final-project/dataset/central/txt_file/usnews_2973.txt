when justin steece ventures out of his apartment in wuhan his primary worry isn t getting sick he s more concerned that he might bring the deadly pneumonia like virus circulating the city back home to his wife and newborn baby but with supplies of infant formula getting low steece doesn t have much of a choice he s a very chill kid and doesn t cry much unless he s hungry steece 26 from lake george minn who works as a teacher in wuhan tells time my biggest fear is that i ll go out and accidentally transmit the disease to my family at 3 a m local time on wednesday a u s plane evacuated around 240

was given to staff at the local u s consulate and their families the few remaining seats were available at inflated costs of 1 000 say americans living in wuhan prompting anger among those who felt abandoned by their government for the average person that plane ticket really wasn t available says george goodwin a biology teacher from reno nev who worked for the u s center for disease control before moving to china many people were very frustrated as the announcement of the flight made it seem this is going to be the savior of all americans in wuhan except it really isn t because most of us can t go for steece the situation is complicated by the fact that his wife is a chinese national and son colm is less than one month old and so still hasn t been registered as a u s citizen chinese spouses and other family members of americans were not eligible for wednesday s flight i ve actually been a little bit annoyed at the p s poor treatment says steece who before moving to china served five years with the u s national guard why is it that american citizens have to pay 1 000 and not have our families come with us it s bulls t it s a similar situation for benjamin wilson 38 a restauranteur in wuhan from alexandria la although wilson s seven year old daughter jasmine has an american passport his wife is a chinese citizen even were there room on wednesday s flight wilson couldn t bring himself to split the family up at this difficult time it s sad when other governments are offering evacuation for chinese spouses and children as well he says while with our government we ve heard about the rumor of a plane coming i have not seen any information directly from the embassy myself but then there was not enough space for everyone the e u said it would co finance the transport costs for two aircraft to evacuate citizens out of wuhan according to a statement tuesday with the first aircraft scheduled to depart from france on wednesday morning and the second later this week other nations including south korea japan and u k will reportedly send in charters to evacuate citizens from wuhan in the coming days several americans trapped in wuhan told time they had made repeated calls to the u s embassy in beijing but only got recorded messages pointing them to out of date website posts even those who managed to secure a seat on wednesday s flight were left with the tricky task of reaching the airport themselves a significant challenge with no public transport running and private cars banned from the street to date there s no news of another flight to get americans out of wuhan as unconfirmed reports suggest the city could remain on lockdown until april those stuck in their homes don t know how they will be able to afford essential supplies with workplaces closed and no means to earn money in an email to time a spokesperson at the u s embassy in beijing said the health and safety of u s citizens including the employees of u s consulate general wuhan is our top priority we strongly encourage u s citizens in china to enroll in the smart traveler enrollment program step state gov in order to receive the latest updates on health security and any possible u s government plans to assist travelers that s little consolation for steece who is left trying to enjoy the miracle of fatherhood with the prospect of months sequestered in
