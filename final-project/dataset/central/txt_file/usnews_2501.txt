eleni kounalakis a democrat running for lieutenant governor in california is sitting on a couch in san francisco introducing herself to about one voter per second stylus in hand she s hosting a text bank with volunteers and using an app called hustle to rapid fire her platform along with appeals for support straight to voters cellphones you get my vote just for reaching out one texts back yes it s time for more women in power writes another a third is less receptive piss off you corporatist clintonite establishment neoliberal bootlicker kounalakis shrugs opt out she says tapping a button that takes the person off the campaign s contact list this is a scene playing out across america this election season as text messages become a new favorite form of outreach for campaigns in an era when the majority of u s households no longer have a landline millions of people have cut the cord on cable tv and direct mailers are quickly recycled texts can cut through the clutter as one politico explains some voters prefer it others feel it s an intrusion into one of the few sacred ad free spaces they have left campaigns are used to getting some texts back that are nsfw like it or not this is the future as businesses and nonprofits start embracing texts too i don t want to say it s inevitable says daniel souweine ceo of a text focused startup called relay but text messaging is how people communicate hustle a trailblazer in the field worked with about 100 campaigns in 2016 this year the number will be in the thousands by nov 6 says ceo roddy lindsay who once worked as a data scientist at facebook by 2020 other insiders predict texting may be one of the main ways campaigns reach out to voters the databases are already being built among hustle s clients are most democratic state parties as is the democratic national committee which earlier this year purchased the cellphone numbers of 94 million registered voters campaigns are going to use whatever tools they have to reach people says souweine whose startup is one of many that help clients send thousands of texts per hour without running afoul of anti spam laws the left has been particularly aggressive in adopting it having seen texts used to great effect by bernie sanders 2016 machine peer to peer texting says caitlin mitchell the dnc s chief mobilization officer is a consideration of every campaign this cycle the appeal of the political text is multi fold campaigns can start a conversation with voters without interrupting dinner sending a cold text is less awkward for volunteers and while many door knocks don t get answered texts are a fast low effort way to deliver a message to voters in far flung places at kounalakis text bank about a dozen volunteers sent 10 000 texts to voters across california in less than an hour swapping emojis with supporters as they encouraged people to vote early but the main reason strategists think texts are so effective is the same reason many voters are upset to be receiving them while we ve come to accept a barrage of noise in our email inboxes and social media feeds the text message has largely remained a medium for personal invited communication that s why an estimated 90 are read within three minutes of being received according to marketing firm mobilesquared with a text message you know you re firing it right into somebody s pocket says david grant a 24 year old libertarian in maine who has gotten several unsolicited political texts this year and is not happy about it i will fight to the end of the earth he says to make sure my text messages don t become my email those who see the text appeal point out that some people will be annoyed no matter what form political advertising takes whether they re complaining that phone calls are insufferable or that door hangers waste paper people would rather be communicated to in a text channel than bombarded other places says gerrit lansing cofounder of opn sesame a firm helping many republicans with their texting campaigns this year his platform uses a list of 17 words and phrases that automatically opt people out when they respond negatively you can t really talk to the tv and tell the ads to turn off lansing says the fcc has helped ensure that someone is on the other end in order not to violate anti spam rules a human being must press send on every unsolicited text by auto filling numbers names and messages that are scripted by campaigns tech firms have made quick work of the rest and an advocacy group called the p2p alliance is angling to get assurance from the fcc that the status quo will remain susan morgan a resident in california s marin county who started a chapter of the progressive group indivisible has been hosting text banks at her house to support a candidate halfway across the country beto o rourke a democrat running against senator ted cruz in texas is working with relay to operate one of the most ambitious texting efforts this season which is why it s easy to find kvetching about it online there has been pushback as they ve pinged voters on his behalf i one time got called something i had to google morgan says but they also get lots of positive responses and questions overall morgan estimates that 10 of texts start a back and forth the social norms around text messages are shifting in an institution friendly direction a 2017 survey found that 55 of teens said they d like college admissions officers to contact them via text up from just 9 two years earlier even some who are initially turned off by political texts come around in the end after democrats used hustle to turn out voters in alabama s recent special election a woman named katonya expressed weary gratitude to volunteers who had been contacting her thank you all for harassing me because without it i probably wouldn t have voted there is however a difference between a text that seeks to inform versus persuade debra cleaver founder of the nonpartisan vote org has relied on texts to prod young people to register remind voters where their polling places are and fight voter suppression by countering inaccurate information on the fly but she says she s seen the volume of political texts go up this year and the quality go down while some organizations carefully target their texts to people who might be interested others use a firehose approach as she s in the midst of expressing these concerns her phone buzzes it s a text that says it s from former house speaker newt gingrich asking for money for unnamed conservative candidates and offering an anonymized link as an organization that has actively pursued this cleaver says you wonder how much longer it will be viable venture capital firms have poured tens of millions into platforms like hustle while that s a strong vote of confidence insiders also acknowledge that consumer outcry or a change in how the fcc interprets the law could upend the golden era of political texting just as it s getting started back at the text bank one of several she ll hold between early october and election day kounalakis thanks voters for the kind words she s received and doesn t seem to sweat the others in between texts she says she herself has wondered how much people will put up with if text solicitation truly goes mainstream what happens when people just scream uncle because everyone is texting them for now she believes it s the most effective way to inform the most voters about her promises to fight tuition hikes and pursue equal treatment for women in the workplace obviously it would be better if we could go door to door she says our feeling is that this is the next best thing write to katy steinmetz at katy steinmetz time com
