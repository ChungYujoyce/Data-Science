the same day that the nation s top infectious disease expert warned that reopening the economy too quickly could bring serious consequences white house senior adviser jared kushner acknowledged that there is inherent risk in president trump pushing americans to get back to work speaking to time s senior white house correspondent brian bennett as part of the time100 talks series on tuesday kushner said there s risk in anything but the president carries the burden of the 30 million americans who have lost their jobs due to this historic effort to save lives asked about dr anthony fauci s warning to lawmakers tuesday about reopening too soon kushner said fauci is incredibly knowledgeable but that his advice must be taken alongside other factors you have a lot of policymakers like the president or the governors who were elected by the people in their states and in their country to take the input of the experts and professionals and then make decisions weighing a lot of different factors kushner said kushner spoke to time in a wide ranging interview answering questions about the delay in ramping up u s testing capacity whether he prioritized contracts from allies in ordering medical supplies for states the cares act and trump s re election prospects in the fall as of may 12 there have been nearly 1 4 million confirmed cases of covid 19 in the united states and more than 81 000 deaths more than 30 million americans have filed for unemployment since the pandemic hit the u s kushner s comments came one day after the white house held a briefing to tout its testing capacity during which trump said the u s had prevailed on testing and at the end of april kushner himself had called the u s coronavirus response a success story i don t want those comments to be taken in a way other than to contextualize how much our hearts break for the people who have passed and their families kushner said when asked about them tuesday we know that it s a terrible tragedy and one life lost as the president said is too many but faced with the magnitude of what this pandemic was and what it could have been the situation could have been a lot worse so we really worked very very hard to create a better outcome than could have been otherwise the u s has completed more than 9 3 million covid 19 tests as of may 11 according to kushner with each state on track to be able to perform almost double the number of tests per capita than south korea whose response to the virus has been lauded globally that expanded ability will be a crucial component in the country s reopening kushner said we see testing as one of the keys to unlock the opening but it s not the only key trump s son in law told time heading into the fall kushner said he hopes to see four things that will help society reopen safely a ton of tests widespread adoption of mitigation measures like hand washing social distancing and mask wearing increased hospital capacity and wide availability of personal protective equipment ppe while much of the country remains locked down congress has passed a series of stimulus measures and sent checks to millions of americans to help stabilize the economy as it suffers the worst unemployment levels since the great depression critics have noted that certain provisions in the cares act like the joint tax break in section 2304 will disproportionately benefit wealthy americans when asked if he personally stands to benefit from the bill kushner said he doesn t know how it will affect him because he doesn t manage his personal finances and has recused himself from his businesses i have no knowledge of any of this that was designed to help me personally or the president kushner said kushner also denied that the volunteer force he organized to work on procuring medical supplies kept a v i p spreadsheet to prioritize tips from political allies as the new york times had reported americans economic distress could hurt trump s re election prospects kushner himself had previously told time that trump s pitch to voters this fall was going to focus on a booming economy now trump is trailing former vice president joe biden in both national and swing state polls kushner said trump is looking forward to debating biden and dismissed the polls as inaccurate kushner said he believes the choice in the election will come down to who do you trust to build the economy back when asked if there was a chance the presidential election could be postponed past november 3 due to the pandemic kushner said that isn t his decision i m not sure i can commit one way or the other but right now that s the plan he said hopefully by the time we get to september october november we ve done enough work with testing and with all the different things we re trying to do to prevent a future outbreak of the magnitude that would make us shut down again kushner continued i really believe that once america opens up it ll be very hard for america to ever lock down
