former vice president joe biden has recorded a video near his childhood home that will launch the third attempt at the democratic presidential nomination in his long career as of midday friday the plan was for him to post the video on wednesday as has been the case with so many pieces of biden s political planning things can change quickly stall out or be slow walked for weeks however there remains an internal debate about what to do after the video posts if indeed it posts on wednesday as planned or moves to another date things as one biden adviser dryly put it are fluid the leading option is for a post video rally in charlottesville va where a demonstration by white supremacists left one dead and earned president donald trump s tacit endorsement when he said there were good people in the crowd another option is in delaware a state he represented in the senate from 1972 until his election as barack obama s loyal lieutenant in 2008 and there are still talks about him channeling rocky on the famous steps of philadelphia s art museum earlier biden has asked his senate allies to stay in town this week in case he wanted to launch in washington perhaps sensing the foolhardy idea of a campaign launch in washington where congress has a meager 26 approval rating no one stayed i ve never seen anything so half assed a former biden aide said they re improvising and doing last minute planning the guy has been running for president since 1987 and can t figure the basics out like where to stand on his first day this should make everyone very nervous added a second biden insider the guy s best day is the day he announces everything after that gets worse biden s dreams of becoming president are legendary he ran for the 1988 nomination but it was at best an uneasy effort marred by an inability to ever find solid footing as fended off allegations of plagiarism and academic fraud he tried again in 2008 dropping out after a fifth place showing in leadoff iowa obama forged a sincere partnership with biden and placed him on the ticket later in 2008 and used biden as his top adviser on all matters although obama and his inner circle were carried deep apprehension about biden seeking the nomination as obama s heir read more this is what happened the first time joe biden ran for president biden ultimately decided against running in 2016 citing in part the sincere grief he was working through after the death of his son beau after an intense fight with brain cancer obama in the oval office reviewed biden s remarks bowing out of a race he never joined but biden still harbored doubts that had he run he could have defeated donald trump the political environment hasn t become friendlier for biden in the intervening years a rise of far left activism has given hope to candidates like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren the finally realized political power of african americans especially female african americans in the democratic primary is helping candidates like kamala harris and cory booker and would be contenders like stacey abrams credibility in seeking the nomination and a desire for something other than a straight white man is opening doors for the likes of kirsten gillibrand pete buttigieg and julian castro but biden advisers say sees a pathway to the nomination via middle of the road pragmatic yet progressive policies biden is an unrivaled connector to white working class voters he should have a baked in constituency among establishment minded donors and he does enjoy solid relationships with african american leaders even if some of his loyalists worry about those links durability still biden s odds are far from certain women have come forward to say his habit of invading personal space made them feel uncomfortable biden has since apologized for his physicality there are persistent questions about how he funds the campaign he notoriously loathes asking supporters for cash and sees it as beneath his stature as a lion of his party s vanguard parts of his deep history are problematic such as his tough on crime stances now seen as racist and his handling of anita hill s testimony during clarence thomas confirmation to the supreme court biden has shown little evidence he has developed the discipline needed in today s intense media environment for instance days after he posted an apology video on his social media accounts for not respecting women s space he cracked two jokes about it at a union event with firefighters one would be biden supporter pointed to an eerily prescient passage from journalist richard ben cramer s seminal what it takes about the 1988 campaign at one point during that race biden was bleeding support as cramer began a chapter titled biden s waterloo how could he stop it his campaign was hemorrhaging amid endless challenges to his credibility it was beau biden who confronted his father and urged him to keep campaigning if you quit now people will think that all that stuff about you is true beau biden told his father in cramer s account that same argument now is being deployed by biden advisers confronting questions about his conduct with women some biden boosters also worry that even in biden s launch discussion so much of his focus is making it easy on washington based reporters to attend the launch events he will forever be an amtrak guy says a third biden insider another former aide he sees the political universe as centered in d c and you re not going to reprogram him he wants the meet the press crowd there biden allies say he has built as much of a campaign in waiting as he can without any mechanism to actually do so he lacks an active federal political machine so he is limited in how much he can commit to in the lead up to the race he has scouted campaign offices and tentatively lined up top hires but many of his would be aides are operating on handshake agreements while others grew tired of waiting for him to pull the trigger the initial plan was for a second quarter launch so he could maximize his fundraising potential that window opened on april 1 and biden has now squandered three weeks of that a biden spokesman did not
