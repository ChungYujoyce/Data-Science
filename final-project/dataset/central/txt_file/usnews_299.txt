wish to apply for an exemption to the paid leave mandate because they think it would jeopardize the viability of their business can reach out to the department of labor though the original version of the families first coronavirus response act included a permanent paid sick leave benefit that would have enabled workers to accrue seven days worth of paid sick leave the sick leave benefits included in bill that passed the house and senate will only last through december 31 2020 paid leave for all director dawn huckelbridge says she s disappointed more workers aren t eligible for the benefits but still sees it as a positive first step toward more inclusive paid leave legislation obviously it s not everything and there s more that we can and that we must do huckelbridge says we do know that this bill does leave out millions but it does still cover millions and every day that workers aren t able to stay home we re losing time and we re losing lives president donald trump signed the bill into law on wednesday night and the paid leave provisions are supposed to take effect within 15 days trump s signature was not exactly a surprise people close to the white house told time that trump s daughter and senior advisor ivanka trump was on every call with secretary mnuchin and the president that was related to the paid leave aspects of the legislation she was also in constant communication with mnuchin during the negotiation process with the house the sources say as the sick and death counts continue to rise huckelbridge urges trump and congress to keep going i think that there is an urgent need to pass this bill and there is an urgent need to keep building on it she says so we re not caught flat footed for the next crisis with reporting by alana abramson from washington write to
