we asked the presidential candidates questions about their stances on immigration and voting rights this is what they said should it be a crime to enter the u s illegally i don t believe crossing the border should be decriminalized but unlike the trump administration i will make sure that u s immigration law is enforced humanely the criminalization of border crossings does not serve public interest or safety wastes valuable government resources and taxpayer dollars and has been utilized by president trump to rip families apart and cage children do you believe there is equal access to voting in the u s if not how would you go about expanding access to voting we must expand equal access to voting in the u s by implementing measures such as automatic voter registration for every american over 18 and by making election day a national holiday we ve got to make it easier not harder for americans to exercise their right to vote regardless of their zip code or the color of their skin candidates were given the same set of questions to answer within a specific timeframe candidates that were not featured did not provide a response answers have been edited for clarity
