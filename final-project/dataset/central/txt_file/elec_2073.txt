president she said in her concession speech i hope that he will be a successful president for all americans clinton told a room of emotional aides and supporters who gave her an extended round of applause we have seen that our nation is more deeply divided than we thought but i still believe in america and always will and if you do then we must accept this election outcome she added we owe him an open mind and a chance to lead clinton s vice presidential running mate tim kaine introduced her and addressed the unique challenge the former secretary of state faced in her bid to become the nation s first female president she has been and is a great history maker he said citing her work as a civil rights lawyer first lady senator and secretary of state she has made history in a nation that is good at so many things but that s made it uniquely difficult for a woman to be elected to federal office adding that clinton had become the first female major party presidential nominee obama americans must support president elect trump he also noted that just like democrat al gore in 2000 clinton appeared to have won the national popular vote clinton made it clear thatwhile americans must cherish the constitution s democratic tradition of a peaceful transfer of power they should fight to protect its core values of the rule of law equal rights and freedom of worship these are all constitutional protections her campaign had argued were at risk with a trump presidency in closing her remarksclinton made a direct appeal to young people and women of all ages to young people she said this loss hurts but please never stop believing that fighting for what s right is worth it she concluded her concession urging the women who supported her not to lose faith in their dreams we have still not shattered that highest hardest glass ceiling but some day someone will and hopefully sooner than we might think right now she said to all the little girls who are watching this never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your dreams she added several hours earlier clinton had called trumpto congratulate him on becoming the nation s president elect however she did not make an appearance before backersgathered at the jacob k javits convention center for what was expected to be a victory party instead her campaign chairman john podesta made brief remarks it s been a long night and it s been a long campaign but i can say we can wait a little longer he told clinton s despondent supporters in the late hours of election night predictions that blacks women and millennials would not vote trump proved largely untrue outside the new yorker hotel in manhattan where clinton would deliver her concession remarks wednesday disappointed supporters many still wearing their guest badges from the previous night s campaign event tried to get in to see their defeated candidate anita broccolinosaid she wanted to getinto the event to show support for hillary to show her we love her watch hillary clinton delivers concession speech the loss was a shock to the clinton team after most major polls showed her with a comfortable lead in all of the major battleground states including pennsylvania ablue leaning statethat republicans hadn t carried since 1988 until trump s win there tuesday a few weeks ago clinton s lead was even more pronounced following the third debate in las vegas in which trump called clinton a nasty woman and would not commit to honoring the outcome of the election an abc news tracking poll showed clinton leading the gop nominee by 11 points nationally president elect trump vows to bring nation together as never before later in the month fbi director james comey announced that his agency was reviewing new emails that might be relevant to its investigation of her private email server but just two days before the election comey said the emails were either duplicates or not germane and that he was making no change in his previous recommendation against criminal charges still the move revived the one issuethat had proved most damaging to clinton s candidacy and her poll numbers began to reflect it additionally news organizations including fox news falsely reported that she would be indicted in a separate investigation related to her family s charitable foundation clinton responded on the campaign trail by shifting her message to take aim at trump even warning at several rallies that the real estate mogul stemperament risked a global nuclear war on the eve of the election clinton told supporters in grand rapids mich that there was no veto over a presidential decision to launch a nuclear weapon and that it takes just four minutes to launch one democrats will now begin a long process of soul searching during the heat of the campaign they had remained optimistic that a number of the setbacks they d encountered including the wikileaks email hack linked to russia were survivable they were wrong contributing eliza collins in new york clinton concedes ending long bid for white house
