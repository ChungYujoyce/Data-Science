 sam sanders billclinton to protesters you re defending the people who kill the lives you say matter https t co 3900s5swfp https t co sqtqnx8w7n this post has been updated at 10 a m et april 8 in a prolonged exchange thursday afternoon former president bill clinton forcefully defended his 1994 crime bill to black lives matter protesters in the crowd at a hillary clinton campaign event he said the bill lowered the country s crime rate which benefited african americans achieved bipartisan support and diversified the police force he then addressed a protester s sign saying i don t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13 year old kids hopped up on crack and sent them out onto the street to murder other african american children clinton said addressing a protester who appeared to interrupt him repeatedly maybe you thought they were good citizens you are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter tell the truth you are defending the people who cause young people to go out and take guns the clintons have faced criticism from blm activists and younger black voters for months now over that bill which they say put an unfairly high number of black americans in prison for nonviolent offenses after a protester interrupted him repeatedly bill clinton began to take on that critique directly making the claim that his crime bill was being given a bad rap here s what happened clinton said let s just tell the whole story i had an assault weapons ban in it the crime bill i had money for inner city kids for out of school activities we had 110 000 police officers so we could keep people on the street not in these military vehicles and the police would look like the people they were policing we did all that and joe biden then senator and chair of the senate judiciary committee said you can t pass this bill the republicans will kill it if you don t put more sentencing in it i talked to a lot of african american groups clinton continued they thought black lives matter they said take this bill because our kids are being shot in the street by gangs we have 13 year old kids planning their own funerals throughout the spirited defense of his policy clinton continued to be interrupted and he repeatedly seemed to single out one protester she doesn t wanna hear any of that clinton said to the protester you know what else she doesn t want to hear because of that bill we have a 25 year low in crime a 33 year low in murder rate and because of that and the background check law we had a 46 year low in the deaths of people by gun violence and who do you think those lives were that mattered whose lives were saved that mattered for several minutes the discussion of the crime bill clinton s exchange with the protester and the crowd s attempts to yell and chant over her were missing one thing any mention of hillary clinton the one clinton running for president this election cycle bill clinton did finally address her hillary didn t vote for that bill because she wasn t in the senate clinton said she was spending her time trying to get health care for poor kids referencing her advocacy for the children s health insurance program who were they and their lives mattered and her opponent bernie sanders did vote for it but i don t blame him either there were enough republicans in the senate to kill this bill and nobody wanted it to die that s what happened but she hillary clinton was the first candidate the first one to say let s get these people who did nonviolent offenses out of prison clinton continued and guess what a lot of republicans agreed they know they made a mistake clinton went on to further defend his administration referencing the financial crisis it reminds me of when the republicans try to blame me for the financial meltdown he turned back to his wife and said this election is about the future they re trying to blame her for something she didn t do so i ll tell you another story about a place where black lives matter africa the former president went on to speak of his wife s work fighting aids in africa while secretary of state late thursday night npr spoke with philadelphia resident erica mines one of the protesters at the bill clinton event i m not mad at bill clinton mines said i m not mad at him as a person he s a human being but his politics are very wrong she said of her actions yesterday i don t necessarily like the term protest because that s not what we planned to do mines said we did plan to express ourselves freely mines said after hillary clinton supporters in the crowd began interacting with her the situation became tense and words were exchanged leading to the escalation captured on camera mines said in the moment she was not focused on clinton s responses to her but after the event she read up on exactly what he said still mines says her mind was not changed i still feel the same way about bill clinton he completely beat around the bush she continued whatever policies and platform that she s hillary clinton running on now bill clinton is definitely a part of that bill clinton is a politician mines continued he did his job which was to counteract anyone who wants to talk to him or point out the truth about exactly what he did to affect our community npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
