percent and trillions of dollars in new wealth has flooded into u s households this year signs of a robust economy for which republicans have taken credit arguing their 2017 tax overhaul has played a significant role but trump s job approval rating recently plunged below 40 percent in several well respected polls following a summer in which he generated negative headlines on a wide range of issues that dip in popularity has compounded the headwinds the president s party typically faces in midterm contests most congressional republicans have remained closely aligned with trump fully aware that any sign of disloyalty would anger the conservative base with which he still remains enormously popular but a handful of endangered gop lawmakers have deliberately sought to distance themselves from

off message every day focus groups show that most voters don t care about russia but what they don t like is the president tweeting falsehoods and the general chaos that he creates every day that line of thinking has frustrated trump s political team which has argued that many gop candidates have not done enough to defend their seats sources familiar with the team s thinking who requested anonymity to speak candidly about the electoral landscape say trump s camp is upset with the fact that 56 gop incumbents were outraised by their democratic challengerslastquarter trump s political advisers also say the decision by 44 house republicans to resign seek another office or retire has helped put the party s house majority at risk for members who are seeking reelection trump s supporters say the key to their success is fully embracing the president not distancing themselves from him the incumbents haven t done a good enough job supporting the president and championing his successes they re sort of avoiding it all and i think that s a mistake said bryan lanza a former trump campaign and transition adviser lanza said gop candidates will win by turning out trump s base voters whom he said are not looking for a contrast with the president they want people who are going to implement the president s agenda he added people inside the white house dispute the notion that incumbents are running away from the president but they have also indicated the political team has no problem with members who seek distance from trump in districts where he is unpopular when the president is not on the ballot it s up to each member to win their race said a person familiar with the white house s thinking still the white house believes the onus is on house candidates to hold on to the majority saying that trump has campaigned for 10 house candidates in august and september and has headlined numerous fundraising events the president has put us in a position to overcome midterm historical challenges each member will need to match his energy in order to win the person said some republicans have privately expressed annoyance with the pro trump group america first policies saying it should have done more to promote the gop tax overhaul in order make the midterm ground more fertile for the party the outside group spent less than 1 9 million in ads touting the tax law compared to 30 million spent by the house gop aligned american action network which ran spots in key districts thanking members for voting for the law that was implemented in december unlike other tax cuts fewer americans support the tax law than oppose it according to the realclearpolitics polling average and it has provided less of a boost for gop candidates than initially hoped brian walsh president of america first policies pushed back on that criticism pointing out his group staged two dozen events this year to promote the tax measure several of which were headlined by vice president pence he said they resulted in volumes of news coverage worth millions of dollars i ve had republican operatives tell me our effort was the smartest and best use of donor dollars to support tax reform in the nation walsh wrote in an email if any anonymous critics would like to call me they know my number we welcome their input otherwise help or zip it the blame game hasn t just played out between the white house and capitol hill some in trump world have targeted the white house political office led by political director bill stepien saying it has been caught flat footed by the headwinds facing republicans heading into november and has not done enough to help candidates the white house to be honest on the political side i think is a little slow off the mark trump s former chief strategist stephen bannon said in a recent interview with the hill i don t see the sense of urgency at the campaign i don t see the sense of urgency at the white house and i think there is a huge sense of urgency others say the white house has been well aware of the dynamics and has done more than enough to help gop office seekers from what i ve seen they have anticipated as much as they can and at the end of the day you need campaigns that can execute you can only do so much said lanza capitol hill republicans point to trump s public optimism about the midterms despite evidence to the contrary as one of the main factors hurting gop efforts to help boost turnout the latest projection from the website fivethirtyeight showed republicans have just a one in five chance of keeping control of the house and a two in three chance of maintaining its majority in the senate despite a very favorable map trump who has frequently talked about the possibility of a red wave this fall told hill tv in an interview tuesday that the gop will defy gloomy predictions about the midterms i think we re gonna do much better than anyone thinks because the economy is so good and people do like the job i m doing the president said those type of comments have exasperated republicans on capitol hill if we lose the house trump will blame us if we keep it he will take credit said one gop lawmaker that s how things work now in this
