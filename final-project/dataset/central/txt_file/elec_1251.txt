hide caption hillary clinton chats with goldman sachs chairman and ceo lloyd blankfein onstage during a panel discussion in 2014 of the clinton foundation s clinton global initiative the clinton foundation and the trump foundation have similar sounding names and they ve both become political targets in this election cycle beyond that charities experts say they have remarkably little in common but the differences between them might reveal something about hillary clinton and donald trump i think they re two very different types of charities said larry noble a lawyer at the campaign legal center in washington d c one of them is very professionally run and does a lot of work the other seems to be more loosely run and seems to be more focused on donald trump the trump foundation has engaged in documented flagrant acts of violation that s really different pamela mann former head of the charities bureau in the new york attorney general s office the most obvious difference between the two foundations is scale the bill hillary chelsea clinton foundation as it s formally known is huge it has hundreds of employees and a 90 million budget the donald j trump foundation by contrast is fairly small it has no full time employees and a budget of about 600 000 during the vice presidential debate earlier this month republican mike pence argued that the clinton foundation is basically a slush fund for its founders less than 10 cents on the dollar in the clinton foundation has gone to charitable causes pence charged but charities experts say that statement is misleading it s based on a misunderstanding noble said either intentional or unintentional of what kind of charitable foundation it is the clinton foundation and concerns of favors for big donors the clinton foundation is what s called a public charity that means it mostly raises money from other people and foundations including by the way a gift of between 100 000 and 250 000 from the trump foundation in 2009 the clinton foundation spends that money on things like hiv and malaria prevention in africa it spends close to 90 cents of every dollar it gets on charitable causes and earns top marks from watchdog groups former president bill clinton speaks at the annual gathering of the clinton global initiative america part of the clinton foundation in denver in 2015 brennan linsley ap hide caption former president bill clinton speaks at the annual gathering of the clinton global initiative america part of the clinton foundation in denver in 2015 but there s another criticism of the clinton foundation one that donald trump himself has raised on the campaign trail her foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals foreign and domestic and all while she was secretary of state trump said at a rally in akron ohio in august for example it s true that the clinton foundation accepts money from wealthy donors both inside the u s and out emails between the staff at the clinton foundation and state department show that some of those donors wanted access to hillary clinton and that she did take meetings with some of them as secretary of state but there s no evidence that big donors got any special favors from the state department still noble said appearances matter because we re talking about government officials and the concern is when they get a large contribution it will influence the decision they make even if as secretary of state she did not concern herself at all with what big donors wanted people will think that it did in fact influence her and it undermines the credibility of decisions the trump foundation and concerns beyond appearances charities experts have an entirely different set of concerns about the trump foundation concerns that go beyond appearance the trump foundation has engaged in documented flagrant acts of violation said pamela mann a former head of the charities bureau in the new york attorney general s office she is now a partner at carter ledyard milburn llp that s really different the trump foundation is organized as a private foundation it was originally set up to give away donald trump s money but as reporting by the washington post shows trump hasn t given any of his own money to the foundation since 2008 instead his foundation raises money from other donors as it did at a fundraiser for veterans trump held in january that raised 1 6 million in contributions according to the trump foundation s website but that got the trump foundation in trouble because technically it s not registered to accept donations in new york state where it s based this month new york s attorney general ordered the foundation to stop fundraising in the state republican nominee donald trump holds an umbrella

umbrella while walking in the rain with florida attorney general pam bondi as they arrive at a campaign rally in tampa fla in august the trump foundation broke irs rules too when it made a contribution to a superpac supporting florida attorney general pam bondi in 2013 trump s foundation has described that contribution as a mistake and says trump paid a penalty to the irs but mann the former charity watchdog is skeptical it suggests that they re not deeply concerned with playing by the rules mann said it s unclear whether that s because they don t know what the rules are or they are willfully ignoring the rules there are also questions about whether the trump foundation has spent money on things it shouldn t have including two paintings of trump himself and a tim tebow football helmet and there s evidence that trump never delivered on his promise to donate 10 000 to help victims of the sept 11 attacks new york city controller scott stringer who supports hillary clinton told npr his office pored over audited financial records for two big charities in the year following the attacks and found no donations from trump we found no evidence mr trump contributed stringer said it s possible he gave anonymously or in other ways you d have to ask him our review found mr trump did not in fact contribute to these groups the trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment the new york daily news which first reported the lack of donations to the funds noted that trump surrogate and former new york mayor rudy giuliani said during the republican national convention this summer that trump gave anonymously but a spokesman for the controller s office told the daily news that the office did not find any anonymous donations in its review of the earlier audit all this leads noble at the campaign legal center to ask whether trump is really as generous as he claims to be it looks like he s trying to appear that he s very charitable noble said but if you pull back the curtain it s grayer than that it fits into a narrative of him using the charity for purposes of self promotion trump could clarify how generous he is personally by releasing his tax returns which would show charitable giving but he has refused to do so saying that he is under audit there is nothing however preventing trump from releasing his tax returns while under audit or releasing prior years of returns no longer under audit the clintons have released decades of tax returns going back to the 1970s those returns show much of the charity the clintons have given has been to their own foundation and of course critics argue that hillary clinton has used her family s foundation to promote her own political ambitions and noble agrees to a point but he says there s an important distinction in the clinton foundation it s really hard to deny they re doing good work noble said i do think it s fair to say they may have been somewhat tone deaf to some of the things they were doing and i think that does play into this certain narrative and it s a narrative she s had to deal with anyway about trustworthiness but noble added that it would be a mistake to treat the allegations against the trump and clinton foundations as equivalent the two charities are about as different as the candidates themselves an earlier version of this story misidentified pamela mann s
