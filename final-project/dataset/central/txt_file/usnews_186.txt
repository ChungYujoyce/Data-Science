when he launched his campaign donald trump argued that he would force mexico to pay for a border wall now he says he obviously didn t mean it i would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me believe me and i ll build them very inexpensively i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i will have mexico pay for that wall trump said in his june 16 2015 speech at trump tower mark my words like many of the claims in that speech trump did not offer specifics but as the campaign went on he said he would find the money by reducing the trade deficit that wouldn t really work convincing mexico to pay with clever deal making forcing it to pay by blocking wire transfers and visas increasing visa fees on mexican citizens or building the wall first and convincing mexico to reimburse the u s in 2016 trump even said specifically that mexico would be compelled to give the u s a one time payment of 5 to 10 billion for the wall both in a memo sent to reporters and in his campaign platform but as he prepared to fly to the southern border on thursday trump changed his tune claiming falsely that he never said that mexico would pay for the border wall and that he never meant that the country would literally hand the u s money for the wall when during the campaign i would say mexico is going to pay for it obviously i never said this and i never meant they re gonna write out a check i said they re going to pay for it they are trump said again trump did say mexico would pay for the wall and he did say that it would hand the u s money for it trump s latest comment about mexico paying for the wall came just hours after white house strategic communications director mercedes schlapp said in a cnn interview that u s taxpayers will foot the bill for the wall yes and you know what else taxpayers are paying for the financial burden of this illegal immigration schlapp said wednesday in response to a question about whether americans were paying for the wall trump s statement also comes amid a partial government shutdown designed to coerce house democrats into voting for 5 7 billion for a wall or steel barrier on the southern border as president trump has argued that mexico will pay for the wall indirectly through the u s mexico canada agreement which has not been ratified however experts say that the new deal doesn t have any provisions to use tariff funds to build a wall and that mexico would never agree to the treaty if it did that s not the way trade agreements work welles orr who worked on the original nafta agreement as the assistant u s trade representative for congressional affairs under george h w bush told time tariffs that are collected by the u s treasury would fund the u s treasury the claim that mexico would pay for the wall indirectly is at odds with the trump campaign s most specific descriptions of how it would work in a two page memo released to the washington post and other outlets on march 31 2016 trump presented a detailed plan on how to compel mexico to pay for the wall this plan would include including implementing new trade tariffs cancelling visas and increasing visa fees the memo said the first step would be to block mexican nationals who are in the u s legally and illegally from wiring money back to mexico trump wrote that this would prevent about 24 billion from flowing into mexico it s an easy decision for mexico make a one time payment of 5 10 billion to ensure that 24 billion continues to flow into their country year after year the memo said trump s campaign platform also said that the u s would take multiple steps to force mexico to pay for the wall besides impounding remittances the platform said that as president he would would also increase fees for visas and border crossing cards as well as fees at border entries we will not be taken advantage of anymore the platform concluded trump had also previously suggested other ways that mexico could pay for the wall in an april 2015 tweet trump wrote that the u s deduct the cost of the wall from mexican foreign aid write to tara law at tara law time com
