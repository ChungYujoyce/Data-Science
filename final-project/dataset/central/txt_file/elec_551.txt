new bipartisan survey shows a surge for romney in a key voter group following their first debate oct 3 the random cellphone and land line poll of 600 likely rural voters in nine battleground states oct 9 11 has romney at 59 percent among the survey s respondents obama s support is now down to 37 percent among rural battleground voters a plunge of 10 points from the actual rural vote in those states four years ago what republican candidates need to do is to rack up big margins in rural areas in order to offset smaller republican margins in urban and suburban areas says dan judy of north star opinion research the republican polling firm that participated in the survey about the survey dates oct 9 11 respondents 600 likely voters in rural nonmetropolitan counties in nine battleground

ky funder carnegie corporation of new york a public foundation polling team greenberg quinlan rosner research democratic and north star opinion research republican margin of error 4 percent method random calls to cellphones and land lines center for rural strategies survey pdf mitt romney really needs to be at 60 percent or above in rural areas to offset some of those urban and suburban margins judy adds the new survey shows he has surged into a huge lead and i think it is fair to say that his increased lead among rural voters is what is helping him in these swing states overall the nine battleground states of colorado florida iowa nevada new hampshire north carolina ohio virginia and wisconsin have a collective rural population of 13 6 million according to the census bureau it s a boon to romney says pollster anna greenberg of greenberg quinlan rosner research the democratic partner in the survey it will help him because of course he will lose urban areas by a similar margin and the suburban areas are still pretty competitive last month a similar rural survey in the same battleground states had a smaller 54 to 40 percent margin for romney greenberg and judy say the first presidential debate made the difference voters in rural areas were holding back from mitt romney for a variety of reasons ranging from more conservative voters not being very high on him to the perception of him as an elite and out of touch greenberg says the debate went a long way to making rural voters more comfortable with him in the way they were comfortable with george bush judy notes that these really are republican base voters coming home they re 85 percent white 50 percent conservative and two thirds of them attend church at least a couple of times a month the first debate made a difference to sarah sajuan 31 an assistant to a physical therapist in paulding ohio she shares romney s social values she says but was offended by the surreptitious video in which the republican presidential candidate was dismissive of what he said were the 47 percent of americans dependent on government i didn t like the negativity of the unimportant americans sajuan says before the debate she leaned toward obama believing he would do a better job on taxes rural issues women s concerns and health care i thought he was a stronger person and would stand up for what he believes in sajuan recalls but after that debate it really made me question maybe his authority romney s debate performance wowed her due to his strength his voice and just his appearance so when pollsters called her last week she told them she was casting her vote for romney she told npr though that she may still change her mind president obama speaks at a rural economic forum in peosta iowa during his three day economic bus tour on aug 16 2011 carolyn kaster ap hide caption president obama speaks at a rural economic forum in peosta iowa during his three day economic bus tour on aug 16 2011 retired veterinarian raymond shuffler 59 of union grove n c says the last republican presidential candidate he recalls voting for was gerald ford in 1976 but the first 2012 debate between obama and romney helped cement his commitment to the republican i think he s a man who can look at spending he can look at taxes shuffler says he s always been a competent manager shuffler voted for barack obama four years ago largely because he disagreed with john mccain s choice of sarah palin as the vice presidential nominee he says he kept an open mind about supporting obama again his basic philosophy sounds good shuffler says of the president and his health care initiative but his implementation of it is not working michael roby 65 a retired factory worker from logan ohio is leaning toward the president crediting him with getting the affordable care act passed at least he moved it off the starting line roby says he says the same about obama s 2008 bailout of the financial system somebody s got to do something he adds but roby admits to being persuadable he ll record tuesday night s second debate so he can go back and scrutinize it for who sounds better on maintaining and creating jobs and bolstering medicare medicaid and social security the rural voters responding to the survey overwhelmingly believe romney will do a better job with the economy with representing their views on taxes with sharing their values with saving medicare and social security with addressing the needs and concerns of the middle class and with reducing the federal deficit on the president s affordable care act 60 percent said they disapproved this is an educated voter group by and large with more than 60 percent saying they attended college earned college degrees or studied in post graduate school close to one third collect social security and or medicare benefits more than half are older than 50 president obama rated almost even when it came to addressing the needs and concerns of women he was close to even on which candidate would do a better job with women s health and which represents the respondents views on health care despite the strong disapproval of obamacare there are still issues that are contested in rural areas says democratic pollster greenberg it is possible for obama to battle back but republican pollster judy is skeptical i think that mitt romney would have to have a pretty catastrophic performance in the remaining debates to lose some of the gains we ve seen here judy says both judy and greenberg agree that obama s rural battleground plunge could hurt democrats who are seeking or trying to hold on to u s house and senate seats in those same states in these swing states there are a lot of very very close senate races judy says whoever is able to prevail in these swing states will likely bring along enough senate candidates to give his party control of the senate greenberg adds that romney s gargantuan lead in rural counties in battleground states makes it harder for democrats to win senate and congressional races in rural states it still can be done and there are lots of really solid democratic campaigns in these areas greenberg says but it obviously makes it that much harder to win in those races the survey was sponsored by the center for rural strategies a kentucky advocacy group and funded by the carnegie corporation of new york a private
