of the economy leading up to november speaking to a group of republican and democratic officials in early april politico reports jason furman who was chair of the council of economic advisers under former president obama surprisingly asserted that we are about to see the best economic data we ve seen in the history of this country as the coronavirus pandemic takes a devastating toll on the u s economy bringing the unemployment rate to the highest level seen since the great depression furman continues to predict a partial rebound on the horizon comparing the situation to the economic aftermath following a natural disaster and telling politico that you could easily have one to two million jobs created a month in those four reports before november he added and then toward the end of october we will get gdp growth for the third quarter at an annualized rate and it could be double digit positive economic growth so these will be the best jobs and growth numbers ever this assumes re

fairly lukewarm as indiewire gave it a b rating while describing it as serviceable this is carell s first regular starring role in a comedy series since his departure from the office and it comes to netflix as the streamer is set to lose the office s streaming rights space force is also the second carell starring streaming show that looked like a sure bet on paper but was met with unexpectedly
