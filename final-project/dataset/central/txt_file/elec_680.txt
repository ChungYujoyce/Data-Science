lanes such as the left liberal lane versus the establishment moderate lane comes up in the context of the democratic primary without getting too far into the weeds 1 i basically have two beefs with most of the analyses i see beef numero uno these analyses tend to treat voter preferences as being frozen in time they re about who the voter supports now and perhaps who the voter currently lists as their second choice but to the extent that lanes are interesting it s because they tell us something about the route a voter took in coming to a decision a voter who backed bernie sanders in 2016 but has since switched to elizabeth warren won t show up as a sanders supporter if you ask about her current preferences for instance but the evolution of this voter s choice of candidates would actually be evidence of the existence of a left liberal policy lane second these analyses are usually oriented around an effort to either prove or debunk the existence of a particular type of lane usually the liberal or moderate lanes but voters come around to their decisions for lots of different reasons some voters do vote on the basis of ideology or policy some vote on demographics or identity some factor in more abstract considerations like leadership or electability and some just haven t thought deeply about their choices yet when candidates are aligned along several different dimensions for instance pete buttigieg and beto o rourke have much in common in terms of their demographics and their policy platforms you can see especially strong correlations in which voters support them with one tending to rise or fall at the other s expense but most of the time it s messier with different threads pulling in different directions to extend the lanes metaphor you wouldn t expect to see a single parallel set of lanes connecting all voters in the democratic primary instead you d expect something more like a complex multi modal transportation network where some parts of the network are more robust than others but there are a lot of somewhat redundant options this doesn t mean that paths between different candidates are irrational or random any more than the choices of say manhattan commuters are but they might look chaotic in the aggregate if you don t recognize that different voters have different priorities and take different routes to get there let s think about voters who supported sanders in 2016 for instance and which candidates they might be supporting now if they aren t sticking with bernie voters four years ago might have had several reasons to prefer sanders to hillary clinton so if you run through this list you certainly do see some major highways that connect sanders and warren but there are also a lot of ways to get from sanders to biden and there are some byways that link sanders to several of the second tier or minor candidates most notably gabbard buttigieg yang and o rourke the one major candidate who doesn t have a lot of obvious connections with sanders is probably harris it s sort of like trying to get from the west village to the upper east side you can certainly do it and they aren t that far apart as the crow flies but it requires an extra transfer or two all of that might sound good in theory but is there any data on who sanders s 2016 voters are supporting now actually yes emerson college in its national polls has broken out results based on who democrats said they supported four years ago since the sample sizes are a bit small i combined the last two emerson national polls which were conducted in early and late july respectively combined results from a july 6 8 and a july 27 29 national poll source emerson college this data actually does a good job reflecting our predictions from above about how sanders s support from 2016 might map to the various candidates this year granted it s easy to make predictions when you get to see the data before making them as i did in this case start with some of the lesser known candidates gabbard and yang might not have that many supporters but the ones they do have are drawn disportionately from former sanders voters o rourke and buttigieg also do better with former sanders voters than with ex clinton ones among the major candidates there are quite a few sanders 2016 biden 2020 voters although not nearly as many as there are clinton 2016 biden 2020 voters harris gets her support mostly from clinton voters relatively little comes from 2016 sanders voters consistent with our hypothesis warren is by contrast drawing about equal shares of clinton 2016 and sanders 2016 voters maybe you re surprised that warren s numbers aren t more slanted to former sanders supporters but keep in mind that i there are plenty of connections between clinton and warren too e g in their appeal to college educated women ii whereas clinton s voters need to look around for a new candidate sanders 2016 voters have the option of picking sanders again one way to look at it is that 44 percent of sanders 2016 voters are voting for either sanders or warren this time around while just 24 percent of clinton 2016 voters are so there almost certainly is a robust left policy ideology lane in the democratic primary it s probably even one of the more well traveled routes it s just far from the only road in town this article was supposed to fall into silver bulletpoints where i offer
