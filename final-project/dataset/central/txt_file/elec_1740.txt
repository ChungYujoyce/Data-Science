whether or not to recall republican gov scott walker it s been one of the most expensive statewide races in american history and the stakes in that election could have national implications for unions for deficit hawks for businesses even for president obama s re election the vote over whether to recall walker is so important it s drawn millions in outside money and some of the biggest political stars in the country now millions of dollars are flowing in too the dollar figures that were thrown around here are just astronomical in terms of wisconsin s history wisconsin public radio s shawn johnson tells weekends on all things considered host guy raz the old record for the governor s race in terms of money raised by a candidate was about 10 million johnson says and that was set in 2010

walker wins the recall will be the best thing that ever happened to him johnson says he ll be a national figure not only because he survives but because of the issue he s running on this is an issue

hit the stump last week and louisiana s gov bobby jindal has also come through the state so has chris christie governor of new jersey and one of the most popular republicans in the country virginia s attorney general ken cuccinelli has asked his backers to donate to walker s campaign cuccinelli a rising star in the republican party is running for governor and holds a significant lead in the polls on tuesday he ll be watching wisconsin closer quite possibly than he ever has before scott walker s recall election is the second most important election in america this year he tells npr s raz the only one more important is the presidential election in november it s not just about unions cuccinelli says it s pension problems at the state level and entitlements at the federal level it s related to all these types of problems because the theme is the same we have to make painful changes in order to make sure that our country doesn t go bankrupt it is very important for scott walker to win this election cuccinelli says not just for wisconsin but for america the white house watches obama has been notably absent from the wisconsin fight he s endorsed walker s opponent tom barrett but otherwise he s been quiet but the white house is watching wisconsin closely because in many ways it s a trial run for the presidential race big money coming in from outside groups and a referendum on spending milwaukee mayor tom barrett greets former president clinton at a get out the vote rally on friday scott olson getty images hide caption milwaukee mayor tom barrett greets former president clinton at a get out the vote rally on friday i think it s like the spanish civil war was to world war ii where both sides got to try out their weapons npr s national political correspondent mara liasson tells raz this is going to be seen as a test case for the power and clout of the superpacs walker s raised tremendous amounts of outside money which he s allowed to do under the law she says so if he wins i think the message will be the superpacs have a tremendous advantage if he loses i think will mean even more she says i think it will be a huge boost to the democrats to the labor movement and it ll mean that the superpacs can t buy everything but if walker does survive what does that mean for obama the president won wisconsin by a pretty healthy margin in 2008 but republicans swept the state in 2010 but the polls show president obama still has a lead there liasson says it still is on the list of most people s battleground states the republicans believe that if walker wins wisconsin automatically becomes a gettable state for mitt romney combine that with the disappointing job numbers out last week and things don t look good for obama when you think about this election which was and is tied it s a dead heat and then you think about all of the external factors that could affect it the economy jobless rate europe wisconsin recall supreme court health care decision and put them all on a list you can only think of things that will affect this race badly for the president liasson says npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
