though it s apparent that the largest racial group in the state s democratic electorate is hardly a monolithic voting bloc loading february 26 2020 as a saturday primary vote approaches south carolina voter james morrison says joe biden is a good man but my vote is not guaranteed the jonesville resident is leaning toward sen bernie sanders of vermont with african americans including mr morrison representing a growing share of the democratic party overall south carolina s first in the south primary will offer this cycle s first real electoral test of that clout what began as one of the most diverse democratic fields in history has been winnowed to an all white group of candidates they are courting a primary electorate in this state that is two thirds african american and far from unified around any one candidate this year there are divisions of gender within the black community there are divisions by age and generation says todd shaw who studies social movements within the black community at the university of south carolina in columbia those splits aren t new he adds but with a candidate like barack obama they weren t apparent because there was consensus around his candidacy those divisions certainly emerge professor shaw says when there s greater uncertainty about which candidate could effectively challenge trump and is electable sitting on a cluster of chairs next to an abandoned softball field deacon james morrison and his after church buddies are busy sorting out the next president of the united states the group of mostly older african american men who get together every sunday in a kind of makeshift social club are united in their view that president donald trumphas drawn the nation into a kind of playground sandbox and they see him as affront to the legacy of president barack obama but that doesn t mean their support for mr obama s vice president joe biden is a given joe biden is a good man but my vote is not guaranteed says mr morrison who is leaning toward sen bernie sanders of vermont i m in nobody s pocket with african americans representing a growing share of the democratic party overall south carolina s first in the south primary will offer this cycle s first real electoral test of that clout what began as one of the most diverse democratic fields in history has been winnowed to an all white group of candidates courting a primary electorate here that is about two thirds african american and the choices made on saturday by voters like mr morrison could foreshadow as well as influence what happens just three days later on super tuesday when a slew of heavily diverse southern states as well as giants like california and texas will vote what happens here is going to reverberate through georgia north carolina alabama and beyond says harold mitchell a former member of the south carolina legislature from spartanburg south carolina it s going to start a wave for democrats concerned about the rise of the far left senator sanders south carolina could be their last chance to boost a moderate alternative vice president biden has long cast the palmetto state as a firewall for his campaign thanks to the goodwill he enjoys among the state s african american voters on wednesday he got the official endorsement of influential south carolina rep jim clyburn the third ranking democrat in the u s house of representatives i know joe we know joe congressman clyburn said but most importantly joe knows us but while most polls still show mr biden in front the race has dramatically narrowed other candidates such as billionaire tom steyer who has been pouring resources into the state have been growing their support in the wake of mr biden s shaky performances in iowa and new hampshire most notably senator sanders has risen sharply particularly after his decisive victory last saturday in nevada trounced by hillary clinton in south carolina in 2016 he now has a real shot at winning here which could make him virtually unstoppable going into super tuesday where 1 400 delegates are in play on the surface a septuagenarian democratic socialist from vermont may seem to have little in common with black voters in the south yet mr sanders advocacy for the working class appears to be resonating with many in this industrial and agricultural state where stark pockets of deep poverty abound mr morrison for one dismisses criticisms of senator sanders as a leftist radical those labels just don t stick with me he says they called martin luther king jr a communist too sanders has a strong grassroots organization legions of small donors and he has that tailwind of being the major challenger to clinton in the last election says todd shaw who studies social movements within the black community at the university of south carolina in columbia biden for one certainly underestimated the strength of bernie sanders in south carolina saturday s primary comes as african american voters have a growing voice in the democratic party they made up 19 of the democratic primary electorate in 2008 this year they re likely to reach 25 or more in south carolina they have often broken decisively for a candidate helping mr obama and mrs clinton respectively secure their paths to the democratic nomination in 2008 and 2016 but this year experts say the african american vote could splinter particularly as there appears to be little consensus around who would be the strongest candidate to go up against president trump there are divisions of gender within the black community there are divisions by age and generation says professor shaw those splits aren t new he adds but with a candidate like mr obama they weren t apparent because there was consensus around his candidacy but those divisions certainly emerge when there s greater uncertainty about which candidate could effectively challenge trump and is electable he says younger black voters in particular are evincing a broader frustration with the democratic establishment as reflected in a recent east carolina university poll which showedmore than half of older african americans supporting mr biden while those younger than 35 more likely to support mr sanders or mr steyer those trends are mirrored in the growing numbers of younger liberal voters in the south registering as unaffiliated instead of as democrats saysj miles coleman a political analyst at sabato s crystal ball at the university of virginia many of those voters did not cast a ballot in the last presidential election where black participation dropped by 7 these are voters who are not misinformed not ill educated but registered voters who in the past have made an intelligent decision from their standpoint that my vote is not important but wasted and i m not going to get involved says johnnie cordero chairman of the state s democratic black caucus some of those disaffected voters he says are not only getting involved now but becoming sounding boards for older voters i had a young lady call me in tears sharing with me that her grandmother called her and said to her baby who should i vote for says mr cordero in tuesday s contentious democratic debate mr biden insisted he was taking nothing for granted i ve worked like the devil to earn the votes of the african american community not just here but around the country he said he promised to put a black woman on the u s supreme court not surprisingly he has also heavily emphasized his ties to former president obama says mr coleman still he notes that michael bloomberg who is not on the ballot in south carolina has also been running ads that prominently feature mr obama praising the former new york mayor bloomberg in particular is trying to steal some of that nostalgic connection that biden has to obama which if successful could be very hurtful to biden in a state like south carolina he says black voters of course are united by a common history one forged by prejudice and suffering in south carolina that past is not that far in the past in 2015 150 years after the fall of the confederacy south carolina finally removed the confederate battle flag from the state grounds after a white supremacist killed nine black parishioners at emanuel ame church in charleston that summer allegations of racism have been a persistent thread in the democratic contest mr bloomberg has been attacked over the stop and frisk police tactic he once promoted mr biden has had to defend his support as a senator for an omnibus crime bill that disproportionately affected black people in tuesday s debate mr biden attacked mr steyer for his hedge fund s past investment in a private prison corporation that had been accused of mistreating prisoners they hogtied young men in prison here in this state he said mr steyer responded indignantly saying he d sold the stock after investigating and that he d worked to eliminate private prisons in california on sunday reporters asked the california billionaire about allegations he s been buying endorsements in the state something mr sanders has also been accused of doing he told the monitor that assuming african american lawmakers support is for sale is racist wearing an indian bead belt and a loose collared shirt mr steyer addressed a large crowd of mostly black parishioners at family worship center in yemassee south carolina the heart of the lowcountry we need to tell the truth about 400 years of injustice he told the crowd and there s no other way to look at economic and environmental justice other than through race get
