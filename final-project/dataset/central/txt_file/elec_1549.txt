at first glance democratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg s decision to tackle foreign affairs and national security in his first major policy address wasa head scratcher the issue isn t among the top concerns listed by most voters and so seemsunlikely to move his poll numbers significantly but political watchers say buttigieg whose campaign has been praised early in the race for its media savvy was smart to choose it over topics more pressing to most americans such as health care or the economy they think the 37 year old mayor of south bend used the hour long treatise on foreign affairs last weekto blunt criticism he s tooinexperienced to lead the united states reinforcinghis time as an intelligence officer in afghanistan in the days since he s been praised bothfor his thoughtful approach to intricate policy issues few candidates have addressed so far and for delivering it at a place like indiana university outside the gazeof the political race the strategy likelybolstered his legitimacy among voters and donors who are still deciding whom to support in a crowded field according to pundits former politicians and political donors who spoke with indystar he also saw a chance to set himself apart from a crowded field that s largely ignored foreign affairs they say interactive guide who is running for president in 2020 police shooting buttigieg cancels campaign events after fatal police shooting in south bend of the field of 24 democratic candidates only u s sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have so fardelivered speeches on foreign policy buttigiegclearly knew the subject said larry sabato a political science professor at the university of virginia who watched the speech online still he was taken by how boyish the mayor looked and suspected his agewill be a nagging problem a lot of people say he is just the mayor of south bend and there is a big world out there sabato said he is trying to show people that he knows there is a big world out there and he has a notion about how it should be run buttigieg told reporters after the speech he hoped it bridged that gap for him it s important for people to understandthe worldview that frames my work he said rather than a record of congressional votes i have a personal record of course of serving in afghanistan coupled with a view of how america ought to operate in the world count lee hamilton a former democratic congressman from indiana who introduced buttigieg to the crowd of 1 850at last week s speech among those surprised the mayor chose foreign affairs for his first major policy address hamilton made his bones in congress as a deep thinker on foreign policy and is co namesake of iu s hamilton lugar school of global and international studies he s very much aware that his experience level is limited in contrast to somebody like joe biden or warren or sanders where they have a deeper and broader experience base hamilton said pete has a limited base the mayor of south bend running for president kind of boggles the mind a little hamilton who hasn t yet backed a presidential candidate found the speech well researched and largely aligned with mainstreamdemocratic thought he put a lot of emphasis on diplomacy andallies hamilton said he advocateda combination of cooperation and confrontation with china with an emphasis on american values and goals he was quite forceful in his criticism of president donald trump s policies hamilton thought buttigieg did well at explaining how foreign policy can help americans at home something he said candidates don t always do well more from buttigieg being gay is not the only thing that defines me the young and the older 4 decades separate 2020 s presidential candidates here s what that looks like for instance buttigieg said that an unchecked china could dominate the world economy hurting american interests and businesses but he thinks tariffs are a 20th century solution that won t work a point reinforced by struggling hoosier farmers who have told indystar the u s trade war with china is hurting their profits hamilton played a larger role in buttigieg s bloomington addressthan crowd warmer buttigieg s campaign called him a few weeks back about delivering a speech at iu i said don t come here and give a political speech hamilton recalls if you come here this is a serious audience and a well informed and sophisticated audience speak on policy not a cheerleading speech for democrats and he stayed away from that for the most part buttigieg has leaned on a number of formerobama era officials to develop his foreign policy platform but experts say itsounded more like president harry truman who famously fought the global spread of soviet style communism in the cold war doug wilson who served as assistant defense secretary under president barack obama has emerged as buttigieg s leading foreign affairs adviser he s credited with leading the pentagon s communications strategies in iraq afghanistan iran and china he s also the first openly gay man confirmed by the senate to a senior level pentagon positionand played a role in the repeal of the military s don t ask don t tell policy during his address buttigieg made a point of saying he would counter russian interference in u s elections and the political and economic expansion of china with american democratic capitalism values unlike obama who launched military action in at least sevencountries buttigiegargued for u s military intervention only as a last resort promising an end to endlesswars after the speech buttigieg told reporters he chose bloomington for the speech because the heartland can think globally too i think a lot of people envision various oak paneled halls in the capitolwhere they think about foreign policy he said to reporters but part of what i m trying to achieve and part of what i talked about in the speech is that foreign policy needs to come home and it also needs to include the voices of the heartland buttigieg s campaign did not respond to multiple email and phone messages for comment pundits say thedecision on location also was smart strategically buttigieg has been campaigning in iowa first up among the democratic caucuses and primaries but they say the speech would seem too political there he could have chosen a place such as california or new york where he s been aggressively campaigning and raising money but in the most progressive college town in his home state pundits say he was sure to find a large and supportive crowd at an academic setting which plays well in news clips this was a sober setting for a sober topic sabato said removed from the immediate politics of the day buttigieghas told supporters he has raised 7 million in the first quarter and according to multiple news reports is poised to double that this quarter which endsjune 30 some donors who have been sitting on the sidelines think buttigieg was wise to tackle foreign affairs early on it s clearly a perceived gap for buttigieg saidjeff smulyan a noted democratic donor from indianapolis he s met with buttigieg and finds the mayor thoughtful but hasn t yet decided which candidateto support smulyan thinks age and experience will be among the obstacles buttigieg has to overcome that being said smulyan thinks democratic supporters who listen to buttigieg will find him knowledgeable i think contributors are looking for someone that resonates with their point of view in the world but also clearly want to know can this person break through smulyan said people are very pragmatic when it comes to writing checks money is flowing into buttigieg s campaign of course so clearly some donors have heard enough influential chicago businessman and democratic activist john atkinson was one of buttigieg s early backers atkinson is an lgbt ally he said and so immediately donated to buttigieg scampaign this winter because he felt it was important to have that voice in the conversation but as he learned more about buttigieg he decided to drive to south bend to talk to him atkinson liked what he s heard and has become a major financial backer organizing several fundraisersin addition to personally donating once folks hear and learn about buttigieg atkinson said they want to get involved atkinson doesn t think the foreign affairs addresswas a strategic move he noted buttigieg has a military background and said the mayorthinks how americaapproaches world affairs and national security is one of the most important issues facing the country linked to climate change domestic security and economic security still heconceded thespeech might helpbuttigieg with democratic activists unfamiliar with his campaign i think he s trying to make sure that he has got a well framed rationale for becoming president atkinson said if you are 37 and mayor of south bend people will question whether you can pass the commander in chief test former democratic congresswoman and indiana gubernatorial candidate jill long thompson for whom buttigieg once worked thinks the decision to take on one of the more difficult and nuanced topics fits his character it s very reflective of who he is andhow he thinks and understands issues in fine detail but also broadly how different policy areas interrelate she said i think this international policy speech that he delivered at indiana university fits very well with what his campaign should be doing i think that he deliveredthat speech because it s importantto the country he s obviouslya veteran and he s very policy oriented i think this is just who he is call indystar reporter chris sikich at 317 444 6036 follow him on twitter chrissikich
