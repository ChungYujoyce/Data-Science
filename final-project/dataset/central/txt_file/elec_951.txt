number of house members since 1928 here are pieces of legislation republicans should immediately pass in january the keystone xl pipeline president obama hates anything that helps any part of the fossil fuel industry and has sidelined this project which from a policy viewpoint is a no brainer since he took office trade unions are adamantly in favor of it such a bill wouldpass overwhelmingly perhaps with enough support to override an obama veto anti trolling patent bill the house easily passed legislation banning this abusiveandhugely expansive anti high tech practice the bill despite deep bipartisan support was bottled up by harry reid at the behest of the trial lawyers lobby which contributes mightily to reid and the democratic party reid s maneuver which had the tacit consent of the white house has enraged silicon valley two immigration reforms remove or substantially increase the absurdly low annual cap on h1b visas obama says he s in favor of that but wants this provision to be part of a big immigration bill the gop should pass it as a distinct piece of legislation at the same time republicans should enact a bill that would allow foreign students who get advanced degrees here in the stem science technology engineering and math fields to receive green cards with their diplomas repeal the medical device tax this levy on revenue is very destructive for this critical fieldandis driving companies offshore a repeal enjoys huge support from both sides of the aisle but no surprise harry reid has prevented the senate from passing the necessary legislation repeal obamacare s employer and individual mandates both are killers for economic growth allow nationwide shopping for health insurance the constitution s interstate commerce clause should be applied to this field i live in new jersey which has some of the stupidest most expensive regulations in the country why can t i buy a policy in neighboring pennsylvania where regs are saner and excellent policies far less expensive arms for ukraine the president s weird refusal to provide arms toukraine to help itresist russian aggression is dangerously feckless and may even tempt vladimir putin to take probing moves against the baltic states all of which are members of nato as a means of destroying nato democrats and republicans would support a bill to give beleaguered ukraine the means to defend itself there is no way to quickly pass major tax reform but republicans should prepare legislation for business tax reform that wouldsharply lower the corporate tax rate now the highest in the developed world such a change has widespread support including from a goodly number of democrats such abill could be ready in a few months of course despite his party s losing both houses of congress president obama may petulantly enact a sweeping amnesty for illegal immigrants republicans should be ready with corrective legislation and with a lawsuit to bar obama s unconstitutional act almost all of these bills could be passed in early 2015 at the least they would constructively set the stage for the 2016 presidential election which will be one of the most important in our history steve forbes
