washington ap in an abrupt about face hillary clinton said tuesday night that she would endorse her 2016 rival bernie sanders if he wins the democratic nomination to face president donald trump in november the former secretary of state had earlier refused to say whether she would endorse sanders in an interview with the hollywood reporter published tuesday instead telling the outlet i m not going to go there yet she had also offered a broad condemnation of the progressive candidate s style of politics i thought everyone wanted my authentic unvarnished views clinton tweeted tuesday night but to be serious the number one priority for our country and world is retiring trump and as i always have i will do whatever i can to support our nominee her initial comments ripped open the scars of the brutal 2016 primary battle between sanders and clinton just as democrats are poised to begin voting on their next nominee sanders loyalists believed the democratic establishment had rigged the primary in favor of clinton who won the nomination but ended up losing the general election to trump for her part clinton wrote in her memoir what happened after her 2016 defeat that she felt some of sanders criticism of her had helped propel trump to victory and she begrudged sanders for not backing her campaign quickly enough after she sewed up the nomination in the hollywood reporter interview she accused sanders of fostering a toxic culture in his campaign we re still in a very vigorous primary season i will say however that it s not only him it s the culture around him it s his leadership team clinton had said then referring to a cadre of aggressive online sanders backers she continued it s his prominent supporters it s his online bernie bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors particularly the women she added in the interview i really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture not only permitted he seems to really be very much supporting it sanders like other senators who are running for president was in washington on tuesday to participate in president donald trump s impeachment trial he refused to comment on clinton s critical comments saying only in a statement together we are going to go forward and defeat the most dangerous president in american history even before clinton s evening tweet her aides had sought to minimize any fallout from her comments nick merrill clinton s spokesman tweeted that we all need to work our heart out for the nominee whoever that is and hillaryclinton as usual won t be any exception still the lingering tension between clinton and sanders is evident in the interview clinton was asked about comments she makes in an upcoming documentary in which she says sanders has been in congress for years but nobody likes him nobody wants to work with him he got nothing done asked if that assessment still holds she said yes clinton s accusations that sanders fostered a culture of sexism in politics are especially sensitive now given that sanders top progressive rival in the 2020 race warren has accused him of privately telling her a woman couldn t win the white house sanders has denied that but warren refused to shake his outstretched hand after a debate last week in iowa and both candidates accused the other of calling them a liar warren has steadfastly declined to comment further but the 78 year old sanders said sunday that while sexism was a problem for candidates so were other factors like advanced age touching off another round of controversy clinton said i don t think we want to go down that road again where you campaign by insult and attack and maybe you try to get some distance from it but you either don t know what your campaign and supporters are doing or you re just giving them a wink i think that that s a pattern that people should take into account when they make their decisions she said his feud with warren has overshadowed a series of clashes between sanders and another 2020 rival biden for an op ed penned by one of the senator s supporters suggesting that the former vice president was corrupt it is absolutely not my view that joe is corrupt in any way and i m sorry that that op ed appeared sanders told cbs the op ed published in the guardian newspaper by fordham university law professor zephyr teachout claims biden has perfected the art of taking big contributions then representing his corporate donors at the cost of middle and working class americans catch up on the 2020 election campaign with ap experts on our weekly politics podcast ground game
