 ken rudin tuesday as those who follow politics probably know is election day the battle between president barack obama and republican challenger mitt romney has been contentious expensive personal illuminating ugly frustrating petty enlightening and above all long and it is expected to be close this week s political junkie column is an attempt to guide you to what s at stake on tuesday both in the contest for the white house as well as the 33 senate and 435 house seats on the ballot and please be sure to tune in to npr s live election night coverage beginning at 8 p m eastern time tuesday night we re scheduled to be on the air until 3 a m wednesday morning longer if we don t have a presidential winner president every vote counts we hear over and over again in a close election as tuesday s presidential contest is expected to be you ll be constantly reminded of the importance of casting your ballot but some votes count more than others yes voters in 50 states and the district of columbia will be going to the polls but since so many of the states are already decided in the minds of the candidates and voters states like california and new york and texas and illinois where the race for president is not considered to be in doubt the election will be decided in what is commonly called battleground states the seven or eight states that presumably are too close to call they are in terms of electoral clout florida with 29 electoral votes ohio 18 virginia 13 wisconsin 10 colorado 9 iowa 6 and new hampshire 4 democrats have been talking hopefully about north carolina 15 but by most accounts romney may have the edge there similarly the romney campaign has been talking about and spending money in states like michigan 16 and pennsylvania 20 in recent days we don t know if they see a real opportunity there are bluffing or need to have a contingency plan if say ohio is out of reach but both are considered leaning democratic the fact of the matter is every state listed above all went for obama in 2008 no state that was carried by john mccain is thought to be at risk for the republicans so the battleground will be in these seven states third parties as is usually the case the candidates representing minor parties are not expected to get any significant vote the libertarian party for example is usually on the ballot in more states than any other third party but the most votes a libertarian presidential candidate ever received was the 921 299 1 1 percent won by ed clark in 1980 gary johnson the former republican governor of new mexico is this year s libertarian party candidate he s on the ballot in 48 states he is followed by jill stein the green party candidate on the ballot in 38 states virgil goode jr the former democratic turned independent turned republican congressman from virginia is on 25 state ballots as the constitution party candidate of course the one state to watch for any meaningful goode vote is his home state of virginia where obama and romney are basically tied he doesn t have to get much of a vote to make a difference remember 2000 green party nominee ralph nader only received 1 7 percent of the vote in florida one of his weakest showings of any state he appeared on the ballot that year but that 1 7 percent translated into some 97 000 votes which many democrats insist cost al gore the state and the presidency among the other third party candidates this year include the actress roseanne barr in five states as the peace freedom party nominee and the socialist workers party s james harris in six states senate democrats including two independents who vote with them have a 53 47 majority of the 33 seats up for grabs tuesday 23 are held by the democrats republicans need to have a net pickup of three seats if romney is elected to win a senate majority four if obama wins the gop is hoping to make gains in states being vacated by retiring democrats such as wisconsin where herb kohl is leaving north dakota kent conrad nebraska ben nelson and virginia jim webb but they are also hurt by olympia snowe s retirement in maine and dick lugar s primary defeat in indiana other republican held seats to watch are in massachusetts arizona and nevada democrats are worried about sen jon tester in montana women there are a record number of female candidates for congress this year including 18 for the senate two women kay bailey hutchison of texas and the aforementioned snowe of maine are leaving but there s a guaranteed additional woman in hawaii where democrat mazie hirono faces republican linda lingle and women are at least even money to win in massachusetts and nebraska plus there are strong female candidates in connecticut nevada north dakota and wisconsin if tammy baldwin d wins in wisconsin she would be the first openly gay or lesbian candidate ever elected to the senate independents there are currently two in the senate one bernie sanders of vermont is all but assured of re election the other joe lieberman of connecticut is retiring angus king the former two term independent governor of maine is favored in his own indie bid for an open senate seat like sanders and lieberman he is expected to vote to organize the senate with the democrats and while sen ben cardin d is a clear favorite for a second term in maryland there is a possibility that a free spending independent could outpoll the gop nominee for second place house we have had three successive wave elections in the house 2006 when the democrats picked up 31 seats and made nancy pelosi speaker 2008 when the dems extended their lead with 20 more seats and 2010 when republicans had a net gain of 63 seats right now if you apportion the current vacancies to their former parties republicans have a 242 193 majority in the house thus democrats need a net gain of 25 seats some notable characters such as barney frank d mass dennis kucinich d ohio and ron paul r texas won t be returning but a kennedy joe kennedy iii d mass rfk s grandson will be in congress after a two year absence and there are some other things to watch as well mia love who is challenging rep jim matheson d in utah could become the nation s first african american female republican elected to the house and in utah of all places if republicans take the arkansas seat that democrat mike ross is vacating it would be the first time the gop won every house seat in the state s delegation if democrats defeat frank guinta and charlie bass the two republican house members from new hampshire it would be the first time in history women will have every congressional seat in a state s delegation kelly ayotte r and jeanne shaheen d are already in the senate and another woman maggie hassan is running for governor other potential milestones rep john barrow d ga the last remaining white democratic house member from the deep south is in a tight race for re election massachusetts which hasn t elected a republican to its house delegation since 1994 could elect one in the 6th district where democratic incumbent john tierney has ethics problems and the gop is running rich tisei an openly gay pro choice candidate and for the first time in 80 years a house member in this case wisconsin s paul ryan is running for both vice president and re election to his congressional seat governors just 11 gubernatorial contests on the ballot this year the best chance for a change in party comes in north carolina where gov bev perdue d is retiring after one term and the gop leads in the polls three other states where democratic incumbents are leaving montana washington and new hampshire are close ballot initiatives all eyes are on same sex marriage questions in maine maryland and washington no state has yet to approve gay marriage legislation via popular vote the ones that have such a law on the books got there either by state legislature or judicial action predictions president obama wins a second term getting 277 electoral votes to romney s 261 the swing states of iowa nevada and ohio go to obama colorado florida new hampshire and virginia go romney senate no change democrats lose montana nebraska and north dakota but republicans lose indiana maine and massachusetts house little change whichever party picks up seats it should be in single digits and it s not out of the question for republicans to wind up with say plus two seats so obama wins democrats keep the senate republicans keep the house which is exactly where we were when this whole thing started election night tick tock focusing on key states only poll closing times all eastern 7 p m polls in indiana and virginia close if richard mourdock r loses in indiana you can kiss the gop s hopes of winning a majority in the senate goodbye hard to imagine romney winning the white house without virginia if he loses watch to see if third party goode is the difference 7 30 p m all eyes on ohio both obama and romney could win the white house without this state but it would be tougher for romney he needs north carolina as well where republicans have opportunities for gains in the house 8 p m key states are florida and new hampshire romney cannot win the presidency without the sunshine state and he needs n h too house races to watch in both states as well as illinois which could be the dems best house opportunity we ll see if the gop s courting of pennsylvania was for real big senate seats in massachusetts and missouri but connecticut bears watching as well 9 p m colorado is the key presidential state the rest are mostly about senate races in arizona nebraska north dakota and wisconsin 10 p m iowa and nevada are the last presidential swing states to watch big senate races in nevada and montana 11 p m after california polls close we should get a better picture about the battle for the house political updates i post periodic political updates during the week some serious some not on twitter you can follow me at kenrudin here s one e mail that
