hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more has wrested back a clear advantage in polls over donald trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more just days before their first critical debate an nbc news wall street journal poll conducted this week viewed by some election experts as the gold standard found the democrat leading trump by 6 points nationally and while the candidates are running neck and neck in the realclearpolitics national average the nbc news wsj survey found trump has failed to meaningfully cut into clinton s significant advantages with hispanics african americans young voters women or those with a college education instead trump s recent polling strength appears to have energized clinton s supporters who now match trump s supporters in enthusiasm and clinton s ace in the hole is a battleground map that will require trump to draw a near perfect hand the gop nominee will have to run the table on states where the race is currently a toss up florida ohio north carolina and nevada among them and then pull out victory in a traditionally blue state new surveys out of new hampshire wisconsin pennsylvania michigan virginia and colorado show that clinton is the favorite and will win the white house if that blue wall holds advantage hillary said brookings institute elections scholar bill galston you can see how trump might get close but unless he can win a state that looks out of reach for him right now i don t see how he gets over the top if the election were heldtomorrow she d win he needs a disruptive event something that causes voters to break decisively in his favor trump will have an opportunity for a game changing eventon mondaywhen the candidates square off at the first presidential on long island which is expected to attract upwards of 100 million viewers clinton stumbled badly at the beginning of september as a series of crises led to negative headlines and a noticeable tightening in polls less then two weeks ago clinton made a serious gaffe in describing half of trump s supporters as being in a basket of deplorables a statement she sought to walk back two days after that she was videotaped getting helped into her van as a bout with pneumonia took her off the campaign trail for days there are still reasons to think clinton is vulnerable and a rasmussen poll this week found her 5 points behind trump nationally yet she seems to be entering debate night from a position of relative strength data guru nate silver s 538 model gives clinton a 59 percent chance of winning up from 56 percent earlier this week that is off of her highs in august of nearly 90 percent but silver still allots 286 electoral votes to clinton compared to 251 for trump in that model trump makes things interesting by hanging on in florida ohio nevada and north carolina but clinton s blue wall holds and she achieves victory by winning in michigan pennsylvania wisconsin new hampshire virginia and colorado a candidate needs 270 votes to win the electoral college according to the realclearpolitics average clinton leads by 5 points in both michigan and wisconsin a roanoke college poll of virginia released this week puts her up by 11 and a new morning call survey has clinton ahead by 9 points in pennsylvania in colorado a mesa university poll released this week also shows clinton ahead by 9 although a quinnipiac university survey puts the margin at only 2 in new hampshire clinton posted another 9 point lead in the latest monmouth university survey the university of virginia s center for politics model also has clinton running the table on blue states guaranteeing that she ll achieve at least 272 electoral votes and potentially as many 323 if toss ups north carolina florida and nevada fall into her column a frontloadinghq model run by university of georgia political science professor josh putnam has clinton taking florida and ohio and winning in a landslide 335 to 203 as putnam explains it clinton s battleground states checklist is made up of wants while trump has only needs the likeliest scenario putnam says is a near repeat of 2012 when the race was close in the battleground states and some traditionally blue states but president obama prevailed over mitt romney in all but one obama won 332 electoral votes compared to 206 for romney her cushion hasn t disappeared altogether but it has shrunk putnam said but even as things have gotten worse for her she s still winning trump needs to crack into a blue state like pennsylvania or colorado those states have proven resilient in bouncing back for clinton so far there is still opportunity for trump a victory in pennsylvania where the rcp average shows he trails by 5 wouldcompletely reshape the map he is campaigning there today but badly needs to expand his appeal beyond rural areas if he s going to triumph and pollsters are confounded by colorado where surveys have been all over the map most still believe it will go blue in 2016 but libertarian gary johnsongary earl johnsonwhere biden trump stand in key swing states amash decides against libertarian campaign for president the hill s campaign report amash moves toward libertarian presidential bid more is routinely drawing double digit support there and keeping trump in the race even as most polls show the gop nominee struggling to reach 40 percent support in the state much of the lead clinton built up after the conventions has slipped away but pollsters note that trump s momentum from those controversies has been blunted after a series of his own stumbles over the last week as clinton has quietly retreated to prepare for the debates trump stepped back into the spotlight by reigniting the controversy surrounding his past support for the birther movement which holds that president obama is not a naturally born american he squabbled with the black pastor of a church in flint mich proposed profiling to prevent terrorism and provoked outrage for saying clinton s secret service detail should disarm to see what happens to her election experts have noticed a trend between the two historically unpopular candidates whichever candidate is in the news is the one that is falling said gop pollster david winston neither has been able to make a positive case for why they should be president maybe that will change at the debate view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite
