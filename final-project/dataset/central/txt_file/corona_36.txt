 the 360 shows you diverse perspectives on the day s top stories and debates what s happening in nations around the world everyday life has come to a grinding halt as part of efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus city streets sit empty factories are shuttered planes sit idly on runways traffic on major freeways has disappeared an unintended side effect of the lockdowns to curb coronavirus has been a significant decrease in emissions air pollutants from chinese factories dropped dramatically when manufacturing in parts of the country shut down europe s greenhouse gas emissions could drop by as much as 24 percent this year one analyst found the notoriously smoggy skies over los angeles have been clear for weeks the global shutdown caused by the virus has inadvertently become the largest scale experiment ever in the reduction of greenhouse gases said an expert with the european space agency why there s debate not even the most zealous environmentalist would downplay the enormous health impacts of the coronavirus but some see opportunity within the crisis to make major progress in preventing drastic outcomes from climate change the dramatic changes in daily life that people have taken in recent weeks show that the world is capable of making adjustments needed to limit climate change some argue it s possible that many people will continue parts of the energy friendly lifestyle they ve become used to during social distancing such as teleworking or limiting food waste some green energy advocates see an opportunity to create a more sustainable global economy after the pandemic has ended governments will likely need to spend enormous amounts of money to recover from the downturn caused by the virus focusing that spending on renewable energy infrastructure could help reduce reliance on fossil fuels and provide high quality jobs for millions of workers who are unemployed some argue others say that the crisis could be a major impediment to meaningful action on climate change emissions levels aren t expected to stay low once the outbreak subsides and they may even increase afterward especially if oil prices stay low it s possible that governments will abandon environmental concerns as they put all their efforts into staving off the pandemic and reviving the economy leaders in china and europe are reportedly reconsidering carbon reduction initiatives in response to the virus on tuesday the trump administration followed through on a previously planned move to rollback auto emission standards some experts fear an extended economic downturn could cause funding for green energy projects and scientific research to evaporate optimists a bold world wide climate policy would not be like the coronavirus response in the details or objectives but the scale is about right if we can completely overhaul whole countries in a matter of days to fight off a pandemic we could do the same thing to forestall disastrous climate change ryan cooper the week with politicians newly willing to spend economic recovery could build a carbon neutral significantly stronger and fairer society and put millions to work doing it kate aronoff new republic one may argue that the pandemic is part of climate change and therefore our response to it should not be limited to containing the spread of the virus what we thought was normal before the pandemic was already a crisis and so returning to it cannot be an option vijay kolinjivadi al jazeera if there s any silver lining in this mess it s that the coronavirus pandemic is teaching us a valuable lesson about the perils of ignoring destructive processes and perhaps even larger longer term disasters that increase exponentially even if growth looks mild in the moment it will soon enough be severe in other words delay is the enemy howard kunreuther and paul slovic politico we re all learning how remote meetings panels and other events work to the extent that companies stick with these habits once we re all able to work and travel like normal again these changes could have a more lasting impact on our energy use particularly in transportation amy harder axios the pandemic has awakened us from our slumber it is letting us see the real consequences of denial that may be its most important lesson allowing us the insight strength and compassion to build a resilient and robust future adam frank for nbc news skeptics a global recession as a result of coronavirus shutdowns could also slow or stall the shift to clean energy if capital markets lock up it will become difficult for companies to secure financing for planned solar wind and electric grid projects and it could tank proposals for new projects meehan crist new york times perhaps this pandemic will teach lawmakers about the perils of waiting to act until it is too late or maybe it will simply give them a glimpse into a future where everyone and everything is endangered by a threat we will not take seriously until it is already killing us mark joseph stern slate it s possible that a lot of that money could easily be poured into high carbon industries which will mean that we could actually end up compounding the climate crisis through how we address the covid 19 outbreak clean energy advocate mohamed adow to reuters the truth is that fixing global warming will not be easy but it will not look like this it will look like cleaner technologies different sources of power wind not coal cleaner denser more walkable cities it will look like plant based diets more trees electric planes and so on it looks like carbon taxes and regulating and prosecuting of still powerful fossil fuel interests it looks like action not inaction taking to the streets not staying home john sutter cnn if the global economy crashes emissions will drop short term as we produce fewer goods but climate action will slow employment trumps environment in politics if companies are hurting they may delay or even cancel climate friendly policies that require investments up front earth system scientist rob jackson to cnbc if other global crises like financial bubbles are any indication this is but a temporary dip in emissions in fact to make up for lost money nations like china will roar back with capitalistic mania modern economies halt for no disease at least not in the long term matt simon wired our brains simply are not wired to engage with a danger that is not acutely present we are activated by threats that could come for us tomorrow or next week like this virus much more than we are moved by an inestimably greater danger that moves toward us inexorably but at a slower pace thom krystofiak des moines register is there a topic you d like to see covered in the 360 send your
