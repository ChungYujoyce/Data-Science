this around says dominique dye a stay at home mom from lexington who did not vote for mr beshear but is now a vocal fan both the coronavirus and our country s polarization every evening he begins the same way we will get through this says kentucky gov andy beshear shortly after taking the podium and we will get through this together no state has been spared from covid 19 and while governor beshear may not be speaking from one of the nation s hot spots his nightly 5 p m briefings have become a reassuring ritual for kentuckians mothers pause their dinner preparation to turn up the tv s volume and 20 somethings tune in to online watch parties members of both parties in the bluegrass state say mr beshear s daily briefings are a comforting antidote to these anxious times with more than a dozen self identified conservative kentuckians interviewed by the monitor offering unabashed praise for their democratic governor dominique dye a stay at home mom from lexington who voted for mr beshear s republican opponent just four months ago has found herself creating and sharing memes in apro beshear facebook groupof more than 180 000 some of the governor s most popular phrases from his briefings are even being marketed on t shirts and mugs with proceeds going to the state s covid 19 relief funds he isn t the only governor enjoying a surge in popularity right now a recent national poll found strong bipartisan support for state executives with almost 75 of americans approving of their governor s handling of the crisis republican govs mike dewine of ohio and larry hogan of maryland have won widespread praise for taking decisive action early some governors have hit record approval ratings such as new york gov andrew cuomo whose daily briefings have made him something of a national star mr beshear s audience is far smaller than governor cuomo s but his fans appear equally ardent editor s note as a public service we ve removed the paywallfor all our coronavirus coverage it s free every night the newly elected governor updates his state calmly and confidently but without fear mongering many kentuckians say he presents both practical advice such as how to explain the current situation to children as well as the state s detailed containment plan he announces new executive orders to make daily life easier such as pausing all housing evictions and expanding unemployment eligibility most important say his conservative supporters mr beshear is staying true to the together part of his opening statement by avoiding partisan language and blame shifting like other u s governors elected in states that lean to the opposing party mr beshear campaigned as a moderate who would reach across the aisle but locals say he s done more than that just a few months after barely beating a widely unpopular incumbent governor he s proving it s possible to effectively communicate with both republicans and democrats during a crisis he has given me hope that we can turn this around says ms dye both the coronavirus and our country s polarization ms dye says she s never voted for a democrat before but if mr beshear runs for reelection in 2024 she will not only vote for him she will volunteer for his campaign her mother deborah dye vowed she would never vote for a democrat after seeing how the party treated president donald trump but says she ll break that promise for mr beshear he s doing what i wish all politicians would do which is set aside the politics of it and focus on what s good for the country says deborah dye when reporters try to bait mr beshear with questions about the federal response or other states he typically redirects the conversation after president trump said last week that he would like the country back up and running by easter for example mr beshear was asked during his daily press conferenceif he considered the president s statement realistic the governor didn t reference the president in his answer instead saying that americans need to be prepared to sacrifice more and wait longer to protect one another i just hear a lot of trump bashing around this says cathy samuels a registered nurse from louisville who voted for president trump in 2016 and plans to vote for him again in november she didn t vote for mr beshear and if the election was held again tomorrow she s not sure she would change her vote but for now she appreciates how mr beshear seems to be looking out for all of kentucky not just his own party i appreciate the fact that beshear is not politicking this right now i m starting to question whether he s a democrat or not says ms dye laughing i m even starting to question if he s a politician and i love that of course not everyone in kentucky is happy with how their governor is handling things similar to the partisan debate happening at the national level some kentucky conservatives believe the governor s efforts to fight the pandemic have gone too far unnecessarily hurting the economy on march 19 a republican legislatorfiled an amendmentto a bill in the kentucky state house allowing residents to sue the state if an executive order adversely affects their business and mr beshear has drawn criticism from the left with some environmental advocates accusing the governor of using covid 19 as a smokescreen to signa new law criminalizing fossil fuel protests but his ability to communicate without coded language could offer a lesson for other politicians says stephen voss an associate professor of politics at the university of kentucky instead of talking about the essential role of government in protecting public health for example mr beshear is talking about the essential role of community the governor s daily briefings have become the social media version of fdr s fireside chats says mr voss blending comfort with competence get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox the lesson here is that in a crisis of this sort where people are fearful they don t look at the government the same way they do under normal circumstances says mr voss it s not about ideology right now editor s note as a public service we ve removed the paywallfor all our coronavirus
