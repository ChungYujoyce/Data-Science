and advisers have been sharply critical of trump s decision to pull out of syria some say the order could destabilize the region increase the likelihood of future terrorist attacks and result in the turkish military slaughtering the kurds longtime u s allies in the fight against isis and other terrorist groups in the region in iraq where isis once controlled large swaths of territory u s forces have aided iraqi troops in a protracted and grinding battle against the terrorist group that began under president barack obama in 2014 in december 2017 the iraqi government officially declared victory over isis after a ground war that killed thousands of iraqis devastated rural towns obliterated major cities and destabilized the government in baghdad trump has said repeatedly that isis has been defeated the terrorist group has lost roughly 99 of its territory in iraq and syria and is no longer in control of any major city on wednesday trump downplayed the possibility that a vacuum of u s military power in syria could allow isis to rebuild if we see something happening with isis that we don t like we can hit them so fast and so hard they really won t know what the hell happened he said adding that he has no plans to withdraw troops from iraq but u s military officials say isis still poses a significant security threat both in the region and worldwide in august the pentagon published an inspector general s report that estimated as many as 30 000 isis fighters in iraq and syria a united nations report published that same month made a similar assessment roughly 5 000 u s

facilities and staging areas and killed several hundred isis fighters from the battlefield trump s decision to pull all troops from syria was widely condemned by u s generals leading to the resignations of both defense secretary james mattis and brett mcgurk the u s envoy to the global coalition fighting isis with american forces leaving neighboring syria u s service members in iraq will likely take on more responsibility to fight isis in the region a new nato led mission in iraq is also working to develop security institutions and structures within iraq trump s first visit to u s
