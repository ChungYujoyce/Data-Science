from inside a dun colored domed tent on al asad air base in western iraq president donald trump answered reporter s questions on wednesday in front of senior u s military officials outlining his strategy in the region the remarks seemed at times to have been spoken by two different presidents trump began by laying out that he had no plans at all to reduce the substantial u s presence in iraq and underscored his willingness to launch more military operations in the future we could use this as a base if we wanted to do something in syria the president said if i will say this if you take isis and if we see something happening with isis that we don t like we can hit them so fast and so hard they won t they really won t know what the hell happened but nearly in the same breath trump s hawkish tone seemed to wilt it s time to get our soldiers out and it s time to get our young people out trump said sitting next to military leaders and advisors the united states cannot continue to be the policeman of the world he repeated to reporters describing a long term vision of detached isolationism embodied by his controversial decision last week to pull thousands of u s troops from syria and afghanistan trump s waffling over strategy in the middle east is partly a reflection of his own chaotic style of leadership but it s also an indication of a deeper contradiction endemic to the republican foreign policy establishment which has long attempted to balance the two strands of its dna america first isolationism and neocon interventionism in his first ever visit to troops in a combat zone trump seemed to present a foreign policy doctrine that champions a perhaps untenable middle ground call it hawkish isolationism in some ways trump s embrace of a contradictory position isn t surprising throughout his first two years in office trump has made a habit of advancing apparently conflicting stances trump s tax reform bill which he sold as a boon to the middle class overwhelmingly benefitted the very wealthy and despite promising to protect people with preexisting health conditions trump s justice department has systematically undermined the health care bill that does just that in the realm of trade trump has repeatedly demanded that china reverse decades of unfair trading practices while simultaneously undermining international institutions like the world trade organization designed to curb precisely such abuses and in u s relations with russia trump has resisted senators demands to punish russian president vladimir putin and condemn russian intervention in ukraine while succumbing to political pressure to sign sanctions against the nation the civil war within trump s foreign policy played out in real time this week in iraq on wednesday trump seemed willing to reengage militarily in syria using u s forces stationed on iraqi territory but less than a week earlier trump had embraced a nearly opposite position issuing a powerful order against the advice of his top military and civilian advisers to withdraw more than 2 000 u s troops from syria within 30 days and 7 000 from afghanistan the decision blindsided congress terrified u s allies on the ground and led to the abrupt resignations of both defense secretary james mattis and the top state department official managing the fight against islamic state brett mcgurk john bolton trump s neoconservative national security advisor who sat a few feet from the president as he spoke in iraq had disapproved of the decision trump s visit to iraq did not clarify his administration s position in the middle east so much as underscore his apparently competing desires to both withdraw from the world and to project military power and strength the men and women stationed at al asad have played a vital role in the military defeat of isis in iraq and syria trump said inside a hangar in iraq earning cheers from a crowd of uniformed troops gathered to hear his remarks because of these gains our service members in syria can now return home to their families trump said some troops leaving syria will come to al asad for a stay he added he described the u s victory over isis as nearly complete but later aboard air force one white house press secretary sanders suggested that trump was still planning a pitched fight the president and military leaders had come up with a powerful plan she told reporters that will allow us to continue on a path to total victory contact us at editors time com
