twelve years after barack obama won the white house on a motto of hope and change the four top polling democrats competing to succeed donald trump in 2020 have mined that message for parts this time hope is on one side change on the other the hopers include former vice president joe biden and south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg both of whom have staked their campaigns on a soothing promise of restoring american unity they talk about peace and forgiveness about bridging the divide and bringing white working class voters back into the fold we choose hope over fear we choose unity over division biden likes to say on the stump buttigieg who often says he s reaching out to future former republicans promises a white house that you can look at on the news and feel your blood pressure go down a little bit this week new jersey senator cory booker another hoper who has campaigned on radical love and coming together announced a new tour of iowa called lead with love the changers meanwhile include senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren who are positioning themselves as fighting for systemic overhaul their campaigns promise sweeping economic changes to benefit an american middle class increasingly beleaguered by languishing incomes mounting debt and systemic inequalities that seem forever warped in favor of the rich bernie sanders who has long campaigned on revolution recently had a viral moment when he asked supporters to promise to fight for someone i don t know warren often with a fist in the air strikes a similar tone anyone who comes on this stage and tells you they can make change without a fight is not going to win that fight she says this divide between hopers and changers is more than just messaging it s a glimpse into the emotional tension underpinning the democratic primary and that matters policy wonks and washington pundits like to describe the democratic primary as an ideological tug of war moderates versus progressives centrists versus an insurgent left pragmatic policy tweaks versus sweeping proposals but politics are more visceral than that voters are humans who make decisions based on gut and mood not white papers they may harbor preferences about one candidate s proposed tax policy over another s but they ll end up voting for the person that best reflects their vision for the future of america do they want to heal the country after trump s divisive term or do they want to burn the whole rigged system to the ground which is more important hope or change and here s the twist those emotional preferences don t always break down on predictable ideological lines just look at the 12 of sanders 2016 voters who picked trump in the 2016 general election or the 6 7 million who voted for obama in 2012 and then for trump four years later those decisions helped decide that election and they were gut decisions not policy calculations from churches in south carolina and high school gyms in iowa to old opera halls in new hampshire voters have explained to me their decisions in emotional terms not ideological ones some working class culturally conservative democratic voters are gung ho for sanders precisely because of his promise to overturn a system that feels rigged and some left leaning democrats exhausted by partisan battle told me they plan to support buttigieg precisely because they re yearning for the nation to return to relative political calm the standard washington narrative has it that moderate candidates like biden and buttigieg along with new entrants like billionaire michael bloomberg and massachusetts gov deval patrick will attempt to win by wooing independents and swing voters while progressives like sanders and warren will attempt to win by electrifying the base and driving voter turnout but if there was ever a lesson from 2016 it s not that simple now more than ever it s about emotion over ideology laura hubka chair of the howard county democrats who served as an iowa precinct captain for sanders in 2016 told me she was supporting buttigieg in 2020 not because her ideology has changed but because her mood has trump made things different she says the world looks different to me now meanwhile some republicans suggest that sanders rather than more centrist candidates is trump s biggest competition among rural voters i worry about him the most former wisconsin governor scott walker told mcclatchy describing sanders antiestablishment bonafides because i think a lot of voters particularly in the bubble forget it s more about a gut check than a policy list when i ran this taxonomy by some democratic strategists dividing the democratic field into hopers versus changers healers versus fighters they agreed that voter behavior is rarely determined by ideology alone ideology is generally a surrogate for other things democratic strategist david axelrod told me when obama was elected in 2008 he explained it was partly because of his opposition to the war in iraq but it was also more about a style of leadership that offered hope to get out of a very dark period in our politics rashad robinson president of color of change said that democratic voters preferences in 2020 are also shaped in part by their experience of the obama years if you believe that we achieved what we needed to achieve in the obama years you re a healer he said explaining that those voters are going to be more drawn to messages of hope if you had a different opinion about what we could achieve and we didn t quite get there then you might be a fighter because you recognize that the forces that stood in the way of so much of what obama wanted to do are not going to be disrupted just by bringing people together the first caucus in iowa is still is still two months away an eternity in campaign time but it s already clear that this primary season will play out at the intersection of two historical crises that could have very different implications for voters moods first never in american history has an incumbent president headed into a re election campaign under an impeachment inquiry and in times of national crisis democrats historically have tended to win with a calm hopeful message after nixon s resignation carter successfully ran on a message of returning a good and honest and decent government to the american people after two terms of george w bush s wars obama successfully ran on a message of audacious hope in fact every democrat elected to the presidency since the 1960s won on an optimistic unifying message score one for the hopers but the second historical crisis points in a different direction beyond the sturm and drang of the trump presidency americans are grappling with the most unequal economic landscape since the gilded age according to the federal reserve the top 1 of americans now own 29 of the nation s wealth that s more than the wealth of the entire american middle class combined and it s gotten dramatically worse through the obama administration in the 10 years since the great recession households in the top 0 1 have seen their incomes rise 30 while most americans have seen their modest wage increases eaten up by soaring costs while the stock market is high and unemployment is low the majority of americans are putting in longer hours working more jobs and making only marginally higher wages while paying more for everything from education child care housing and health care the middle class is exhausted underwater and pissed off that s a point for the changers so democratic voters are teed up this cycle but they re teed up for different reasons those who see trump as uniquely dangerous his overtures to dictators his administration s parade of corruption scandals his invitations to foreign leaders to interfere in our democracy believe that getting rid of him will pave the way for a hopeful future those who are furious at the structural inequalities that persisted over the last decade rampant income inequality a dying planet unaffordable health insurance crushing student debt believe that trump is merely the symptom of a corrupt system one that needs to be overhauled with major structural change so which of these two impulses will win out right now the polls are split according to a nov 1 new york times siena poll 55 of iowa voters want a candidate who will find common ground while 43 want someone who will fight for a bold progressive agenda when the question is asked a different way the answers flip 54 want a candidate who will fundamentally change america while 42 want a candidate who will bring politics back to normal either way you cut it the divide is real but other polling suggests that the truly persuadable voters are drawn to those who can restore hope according to a new york times siena college poll of voters across six competitive states more than 8 in 10 persuadable voters are looking for someone who can bring the country together over someone who will fight for a progressive agenda three quarters said they preferred a moderate over a liberal pennsylvania lieutenant governor john fetterman who supported bernie sanders in 2016 now cautions against an increasingly purist progressivism the candidate most likely to win pennsylvania voters he says is someone who embraces a muscular version of progressivism but not one that that s too extreme the one who understands that there are people who may have voted for donald trump but they shouldn t be written off the primary then is not just a contest between fifteen different candidates it s a choice between two paths forward for both the democratic party and the nation will voters pick a candidate who promises to return to a more hopeful america or will they pick a candidate who promises to fundamentally transform it write to charlotte alter at charlotte alter time com
