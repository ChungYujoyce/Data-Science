milwaukee the new coronavirus has spread like wildfire killed and spared people of all ages and all health conditions baffled doctors defied guidance and conventional wisdom and produced an unprecedented array of symptoms there s never been a virus like it this gets into every major biological process in our cells said nevan j krogan a molecular biologist at the university of california san francisco who has studied hiv ebola zika dengue and other viruses over the past 13 years at the molecular level it s something we ve never seen before and then look at what it does to the body the long list of symptoms we ve never seen that before as americans debate the reopening of businesses bars schools and other aspects of everydaylife it s important to understandthe virus weare up against andwhy it has sown so muchsuffering and confusion at first the virus was thought to be mostlya risk to older adults and people with chronic illnesses its primary point of attack the lungs then 30 and 40 years olds with the virus began dying of strokes recently a small number of infected childrenhave died of a mysterious illness resembling kawasaki disease like a war pfizer head of vaccines talks finding a treatment for coronavirus symptoms of covid 19 range from fever coughing and shortness of breath tothe lossof smell and taste andthe angry red swelling that has come to be known as covid toes studies have found that damage fromsars cov 2 the virus that causes the disease covid 19 isn t limited to the lungs itcan includethe heart liver kidneys gastrointestinal systemand bowels to understand avirus motivation why it does what it does keep in mind that it is aparasite itlives inside its humanor animal hosttaking what it needs at the expense ofthehost as long as itfinds hosts withoutimmunity and as long as its ownmutations do not weakenits ability to spread and multiply the virusthrives key benchmarks of a virus are how widely it spreads and how deadly it is to those it infects in the five months since it was first identified in wuhan china sars cov 2 has infected more than 4 5 million people across the globe killing more than 300 000 the thing that strikes me about the clinical aspect is the shear amount of transmissibility said megan freeman a virologist and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at upmc children s hospital of pittsburgh there are very few viruses that are more contagious than this one agreed mark schleiss an investigator for the institute of molecular virology at the university of minnesota a single covid 19 patient spreads the diseaseto a median of 5 7 people making it twice as contagiousasthe 1918 spanish flu according to areport in the journal emerging infectious diseases a death crisis in new jersey how one mortician races to keep up with covid 19 the rateof infection in the u s whatexperts are referring towhen they talkabout flattening the curve has slowed even so thenation is still averaging about 1 000 covid 19 deaths a day roughly twice the number of deaths from 9 11 every week thousands of theworld s best scientists have worked with remarkable speed seeking to understand the new coronavirus they deciphered its genetic code in barely a week and have produced scores of papers suggesting possible treatments and vaccines the canvas we call covid 19 was blank 16 weeks ago said gregory poland director of mayo clinic s vaccine research group we ve filled in a lot of dots but we have so much more to go we don t understand hiv that well in my opinion krogan said and we ve been studying that for decades scientistsknow somebut not all of the reasons the new coronavirusspreads so easily freeman points to several factors including one thatdistinguishes sars cov 2from the virus it closely resembles severe acute respiratory syndrome sars sars attacks the lower respiratory system whose job it is to pullin air from the upper respiratory system sars cov 2 however attacks the upper respiratory system the pathway that allows air to travelin and out of the lungs aswe breathe the upperairway is also the system involved when we cough the upper respiratory system offers a more efficient means of spreading freeman said that s why it is more transmissible when this emerged probably there was some mutation that adapted it to use the upper airway and the upper airway has made it very successful a seconddifference between sars and sars cov 2involvesthebond that allows viral cells to attach to human cells andinfect them with both viruses this bond forms between thespike protein on the virus and a regiononthe outside of the human cell called the ace 2 receptor both viruses usethis bond to enter cells but the bond is much stronger with the new coronavirus than it was with sars that is why many of the potential treatments so far are designed tounderminethat bond you always want to target the achilles heel of the virus something the virus does not have the luxury of changing too much explained maria elena bottazzi a professor of pediatrics at baylor college of medicineand co developer of a potential sars vaccine that is going to be tested on sars cov 2 althoughpublic health leaders compared the new coronavirus to seasonal flu early on coronaviruses have a special feature that separates them from other viruses likeflu theyhave their ownproofreading system that helps limit mistakes in theirgenetic code known as mutations flu viruses make six and a half times more mistakes than coronaviruses do freemansaid even as the spread of the virus slows in the united states some researchers fear what will happen if major outbreaks hitpoorer densely populated cities in africa look at the problems we ve had poland warned now amplify that through areas that have civil wars that have corruption that have scarce resources that s a humanitarian disaster in the making the virus skill at spreading poses one challenge what it does inside the human body poses another much of what scientists have learned so far about the new coronavirus suggests that it is aremarkabledestroyer at both the micro and macro levels decimatingindividual cells andentireorgans at the molecular level the virus disrupts some of the mostfundamental functions of life cell division the systemcells use to talk with one another and their abilitytomake proteins the proteins ourbodies make help uscarry out almost every human action from eating and walkingto breathing and thinking once a person ingests the new coronavirus it enters the lungs and directly infects the air sacs the microscopic workhorses that take in the air we breathe in serious cases the air sacs fillwith fluid leaving less and less room for oxygen this is a feature of what is known ascovid 19 pneumonia the pneumoniacan lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome a severe breathing condition that deprivesthe vital organs of oxygen a healthy blood oxygen level is usually between 95 and 100 below 90 is low some covid 19 patients have been found to have blood oxygen levels below 65 as the air sacs are infected and damaged this triggersthe immune system which can lead to a dangerous condition calleda cytokine storm in a cytokine storm the immune system goes into overdrive andwinds up killing both healthy and diseased cells one of the most subtle and deadlyoffshoots of low blood oxygen is a condition called silent hypoxia as described by emergency room doctor richard levitan in a commentary inthe new york times silenthypoxia allows patients to develop low blood oxygen levels without realizing the problem until it dips intodangerous territory theybreathe faster to compensate for the lack of oxygenbut are unaware they arebreathing faster levitan suggested that people can bypass long waits for coronavirustests usinga simple devicecalleda pulse oximeteras an early warning system for detecting covid 19 pneumonia the device which fits over your finger measures blood oxygen levels and can be boughtat pharmacies without prescription for about 30 unfortunately sars cov 2 does not restrictits damage to the lungs the virus also causes blood clots which haveled to people in their 30s and 40s dying from strokes and then there are the recent cases in new york and paris of childrenwith covid 19 who develop symptoms closely resemblingkawasaki disease the diseasebegins with a rash and fever inflames blood vessels andeventually can damage the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart what is it about covid 19 that it produces kawasaki disease said schleiss at the university of minnesota who estimates he has seen more than 1 000 kawasaki cases in his medical career i don t think sars cov 2 is a cause of kawasaki disease but it is the cause of something very similar every few weeks sars cov 2 seems to reveal new and disturbing oddities a recent studyfrom china published in the journal jama network open reported finding the new coronavirus in the semen of six of 38 infected men raising concern that it may be possible to transmit the virus through sexual contact the virus also hasbeen found in patientstool samples and untreated wastewater the centers for disease control and prevention has reported that standard methods atwastewater treatment plants should be effectiveenough to protect workers such discoveries however raisefundamental questions as we try to return toour old lives have we yet determined all of the ways the virus can spread from one person to another are there activities that may poserisks we have not anticipated at the university of california san francisco krogan said it will be important to examine the genetic scripts of both those who suffer severe cases of covid 19and those who getmild or no disease at all there are 30 year olds and some of them are asymptomatic and others are on respirators what the hell is that all about follow mark johnson on twitter majohnso
