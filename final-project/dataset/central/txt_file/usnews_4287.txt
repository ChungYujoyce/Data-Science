conclusions about whether birx sinfluence has been diminished she remains one of the major public faces of the administration s coronavirus response it is a role that sbrought herpraise for hercommand of public health minutia as well as criticism for appearing at times to fail to run sufficient interference ontrump s mixed erratic and often incorrect messages about the outbreak birx 64 who is the

according to two white house aidesnot authorized to speak publicly on the matter the president s aides saidthat while trump doesn t like to be corrected by anybody he respects birx s knowledge and takes her advice seriously one illustration of the regard trump has for birx her name has surfaced as a potential replacement for health and human services secretary alex azar azar s standing within the white househas been a source of speculation after reports he tried to warn trump about thedangers of the coronavirus in late january only to be told he was being alarmist trump has dismissed suggestions azar s job was in perilas fake news even though trump has ended regular televised briefings with the task force birx has continued to do tv appearances sitting for an interview on fox news sunday and participating in a cnn town hall this month when trump said may 5 that he would start winding down the task force there was speculation that he was sidelining her and other medical experts including dr anthony fauci the administration s leading infectious disease specialist trump reversed himselfon the task force only a day later saying it would continue pandemic protocols how plans vary from the white house to the supreme court as trump pushes reopening white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany told reporters tuesday that birx remains a key adviser i don t know when in this capacity you will see her but i talk to dr birx regularly mcenany said in response to a question about the doctor s whereabouts she said birx also had signed off on the phased reopening guidelines that trump approved for states overthe past few months birx has informedthe public about where the u s is with testing about different types of face masks transmission rates potential treatments and hospital capacity she has calmly detailed the myriad painful but necessary disruptions to u s daily lifefrom a disease that has killed more americans than the vietnam war and sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks combined in these appearances birx has oscillatedbetween technical remarks about antibody testing and disarmingly personal anecdotes about how because of social distancing measures she was notable to treat her 10 month old granddaughter who one weekend had been running a high fever birxreassures the public one minute then the next scolds millennials for going to the beach devastatingly worrisome dr deborah birx decries scenes of u s protesters not practicing social distancing amid deadly coronavirus outbreak when the associated press reported that adecision to shelveadvice from the centers for disease control and prevention the nation s top disease control experts for reopening communities during the coronavirus pandemic came from the highest levels of the white house birx had an explanation the guidelines were still being edited when i watch the press briefing dr birx is one i want to hear from said katy talento a trump health policy adviser who left the white house last year talento worked with birx on implementing and then continuing president george w bush era legislation known as pepfar president s emergency plan for aids relief she saidbirx has shown anability to wield scientific expertise while sidestepping trump s more outlandish coronavirus comments she s doing as well as anyone in her position could ever do talentosaid trump can live with birx s disagreements the two white house aidesnot authorized to speak publicly said because she has couched them in a respectful manner during meetings and television appearances birx has done a good job of managing trump the aides said showing him deference and briefing him in a way that makes him comfortable trump thinks birx does well on television an important gauge for him the aides said coronavirus precautions white house adopts new safety steps as coronavirus moves closer to trump s inner circle birx is one of two obama administration appointedhealth officials working fortrump the other is francis collins director of the national institutes of health fauci s boss most americans have heard of fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases who delivered high profile testimony to the senate this week warning of avoidable suffering and death if the country reopens too quickly fauci who has been america s top infectious disease expert for decades was a mentor to birx earlier in her career nih chief collins on covid 19 best response one people would find too drastic faucihas openly contradicted trump tamping down the president s talk of rapidly reopening the u s ora quick fix coronavirus cure the white house aides said trump believes that fauci is a little too eager to voice his disagreements with the presidentand that some of his comments are political in nature birx is not like that in trump s view and their relationship is such that trump can joke with her in public when hespoke with an iowa health official about appointing her to the coronavirus task force he joked i m only going to do it if i have dr birx s permission trump s admirationfor birx is also informed by the fact that one of her biggest champions is vice president mike pence who brought her into the administration the aidessaid fauci s lengthy track record may affordhim a certain political insulation from the white house according to morrison the clinton era public health official straight talking dr anthony fauci the voice americans want to hear right now whileit s not ultimately clear if such protections extend to birx shehastaken pains to defend trump saying in a fox news interview that aired on april 25 that trumpmeant no harm by inquiring in a white house briefingaboutultraviolet light and disinfectant as possible coronavirus treatments treatments involving ultraviolet light and disinfectant are unproven and dangerous when he gets new information he likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue birx said and so that s what dialogue he was having jen kates director of global health andhiv aidspolicy at the kaiser family foundation a san francisco based nonprofit that focuseson u s national health issues said birx is trying to stick to the science and data and public health prerogatives while working in a highly politicized environment that s the case more generally when you work with the white house but in this particular case it s really striking just how difficult that is she added kates has worked with birx as part of the latter s job as u s global aids coordinator and u s special representative for global health roles birx took up in 2014 and has retained since being appointed to the white house coronavirus task force the position is run out of the u s state department where birxalso oversees pepfar the president george w bush era legislation pepfar has provided at least 90 billion in funding for hiv aids treatment prevention and research around the world since 2003 making it the largest financial commitment by any one nation to address a single disease in the world pepfar is credited with saving millions of lives and effectively helping to alter the overall trajectory of the global hiv aids epidemic before joining thestate department in 2014 birx directed the global hiv aids division at the u s centers for disease control and prevention dr birxwas a very prominent and well known figure internationally within global public health circles but now she isfront and center with the american public on a daily basis suddenlyeverybody knows her and she s having to adjust to that katessaid in remarks at her 2014 swearing in ceremony as u s global aids coordinator and u s special representative for global health titles that give birx ranking ambassador level status within diplomatic circles then secretary of state john kerry told a story about the birth of birx seldest daughter according to a transcript of his speech it s not entirely clear what kerry sstory is intendedto illustrateabout birx grit determination medical knowledge foresight presence of mind maybe all of the above at the time birx was about to embark on her career as a military trained clinician focusing on the burgeoning field of hiv aids vaccine research it was the spring of 1983 birx was in labor at the walter reed national military medical centerin maryland a place she would spend the next 25 years helping increase the efficiency of the u s military s hiv aids response through collaborations across the department of defense she had lost a lot of blood during the delivery and the obstetrician ordered a transfusion kerry saidin his remarks in front of birx s parents her brother donald and various members of the diplomatic corps but debbie had read a report weeks earlier about a new disease no one knew much about but the risks of a blood transfusion were very very clear to her and literally just before she passed out from pain debbie screamed do not let them give me blood her husband at the time refused the transfusion birx probably saved her own life the hospital learned later that that the blood of her blood type that they would have used was contaminated with hiv kerry said birx s brother donald 67 describes a pennsylvania childhood for his sister and another brother danny who died in a plane crash in 2000 as a semi rural idyll the family grew up outside philadelphia but moved tocarlisle about 30 miles outside harrisburg the state capital when birx was in high school we had to do a lot of things for ourselves because both of our parents worked we would bike into school each day and we had to go over some really rough roads to get there he said this meant we had a lot of time for exploration experimentation and just roaming around and looking at things in different ways he said my sister likes to say we used to run wild donald birx is now president of plymouth state university in new hampshire theirmother adele taughtnursing their father also donald was an electrical engineer after high school birxmajored in chemistry at houghton college in western new york she earned her medical degree from penn state college of medicine in hershey birx has two adult daughters devynn and danielle from a previous marriage last year she marriedpaige reffe a clinton administration aide who has worked on various democratic presidential campaigns including kerry s doctors covid 19 patients wrong to think breathing tubes synonymous with death her brothersaid the woman people see next to the presidentis outgoing protective supports group dynamics especially when they advance public health for women and deeply cares for and develops the people she works with eric goosby her predecessor as u s global aids coordinator said birx came of age as a doctor in the 1980s when 100 of thepatients doctors engaged with succumbed to the disease he said it was a time when doctors became overwhelmed with death and dying debbie was in the middle of all that he said yet goosby said that while birx brings a deep clinical background to coronavirus policy discussion in the white house she is equally immersed in how to set up complex health delivery systems for surveilling storing and acting on key medical information one of the hivachievements birxis credited with helping to highlight according to bruce richman founder ofprevention access campaign is that people with undetectable viral loads cannot transmit the virus that causes aids she comes into meetings with 100 slides it s like she has two calculus computing brains said dr paul zeitz an epidemiologist and former obama and trump administration health official who worked for birx at the state department she s always ahead of everybody in understanding where things are going and has a clear vision of how to get there added zeitz referring to what he described as birx s reboot of a u s global hiv aids program that has required sensitive dealings with senior officials world leaders activists administrators and patients all over the world she knows how to deal with intergovernmental squabbling all the backstabbing that goes on turf wars in the white house i can see her as a powerful leader in rooms full of conflicting egos opinions organizational battles she can transcend all that he said in a march 25 interview with cbn a christian tv network birx said she believes trump like her has beenattentive to the scienceand data around coronavirus i think his ability to analyze and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues because in the end data is data she said in the interview birx declined to be interviewed for this story the trump administration aides said that there is no doubt birx is much more cautious than trump about reopening the country but they saidtrumproutinely solicits views fromhis advisers including members of his coronavirus task force and the resulting disputes are rarely personal none of these people are shy about their positions on these issues an official said the media s ridiculous and repeated efforts to create distance and tension between the president and his top health experts including dr birx is textbook fake news said white house spokesman judd deere in a statement provided to usa today president trump has relied on and consulted with dr birx and many others as he has confronted this unforeseen unprecedented crisis he said how to cope working from home during the coronavirus pandemic in an exchange with reporters on may 8 trump was asked about how often hemeets with birx fauci and the other medical experts on the coronavirus task force i listen to them very very intently trump replied a lot many of the white house briefings where birx and fauci appeared were two hour marathon sessions featuring combative exchanges between trump and reporters along with slide presentations and discussions of data by the medical experts there also were quieter moments of poignancy such as when birx told a story about her how grandmother lived with a lifetime of guilt after catching the flu at schoolin the 1918 influenza epidemic and broughtit home to her own mother who died from it she never forgot that she was the child that was in school that innocently bought that flu home birx said of her grandmother leah on march 25 trump in arizona his most extensive trip since start of coronavirus pandemic ambassador doctor scientist mom grandmother military veteran public health expert at home birx often goes by the name of colonel according to herbrother this is not intendedas a pure reflection of her military rank but as a term of endearment that speaks to her character disciplined professional direct measured it s also in recognition of the fact that birx won the title at a time when women rarely achieved high ranking positions within the military pandemic in the military branches were set to cut nearly 18 000 medical workers coronavirus brought that grinding to a halt on april 28 as trump clashed with a reporter who challengedhim on whether the u s has tested more people for coronavirus per capita thansouth korea anotherside to the colonel was on display deferring to birx trump sat quietly as she explained how u s testing is focused on concentrated outbreaks across the country later in the meeting she returned to the issue with updated numbers that supported trump s claims are you going to apologize yahoo trump snapped referring to the reporter s outlet you oughtto get your facts
