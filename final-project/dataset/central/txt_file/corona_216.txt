played out he added we re going to work very hard to get this done tomorrow schumer noted that he had been meeting with ueland and mnuchin throughout sunday mnuchin late sunday night told reporters they were this close to an agreement holding up a thumb and a finger approximately an inch apart we are making progress we re getting closer and closer and i m very hopeful that we can get a bill in the morning schumer told reporters as he left the capitol around 12 30 a m on monday we re making progress in the areas of concern schumer said i m more optimistic than i was this morning that we will get something done democrats have outlined a laundry list of objectionable provisions arguing that the bill does not expand paid sick leave and actually caps how much employers have to pay and walks back an agreement sens ron wyden d ore and chuck grassley r iowa had reached on expanding unemployment insurance a source familiar with the gop bill text also said republicans are refusing to add strong worker protections and have included language requiring companies keep employees to the extent possible democrats worry the language is vague enough that corporations could take federal help and still fire workers democrats also wanted strong restrictions on corporations who take federal help but the source said the gop bill included very weak stock buyback restrictions that could be waived by mnuchin the gop bill according to the source also increases a corporate bailout fund to 500 billion senate banking committee chairman mike crapo r idaho had pushed to increase the 208 billion proposed in the original gop plan to ensure distressed industries have access to capital if they aren t able to reach a deal in the morning mcconnell has vowed to hold a vote after the senate comes in at noon to try for a second time to advance the stimulus package democrats blocked the bill technically a shell that the coronavirus legislation will be swapped into arguing that they had not made enough progress maybe there will be some coming together tonight i hope so mcconnell told reporters as he left the building around midnight if not we will now be voting at noon view the
