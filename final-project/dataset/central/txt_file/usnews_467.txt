 washington some of president donald trump s top economic advisers emphasized on sunday the importance of states getting more businesses and offices open even as the pandemic makes its way to the white house complex forcing three members of the administration s coronavirus task force into self quarantine the president and governors who will decide when to reopen their states are facing competing pressures more economic activity and travel will likely lead to more people contracting covid 19 but tight restrictions on which businesses can operate are causing millions of people to join the ranks of the unemployed decisions about how fast to reopen come with a general election less than six months away and trump and other incumbents facing the prospects of seeking another term in the midst of a public health and economic crisis if we do this carefully working with the governors i don t think there s a considerable risk treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on fox news sunday matter of fact i think there s a considerable risk of not reopening you re talking about what would be permanent economic damage to the american public another 3 2 million u s workers applied for jobless benefits last week bringing the total over the last seven weeks to 33 5 million as states restrict activities to slow the spread of the virus mnuchin said the jobless numbers are probably going to get worse before they get better but he expected the economic numbers to improve in the second half of 2020 and that next year would be a great year gov mike dewine r ohio announced this past week that his state s bars and restaurants can fully reopen in two weeks on may 21 with outside dining allowed a few days earlier barbershops hair salons nail salons and day spas will also reopen this coming friday he said he wished the number of coronavirus cases were going down but the state needs to come back very carefully we ve got to try to do two things at once and it s you know no one is
