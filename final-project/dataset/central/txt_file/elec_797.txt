a plan b there s not a plan c evers said earlier monday joe biden already has a commanding delegate lead over bernie sanders and the wisconsin results aren t likely to slow his march to the democratic

requests and thousands of voters who requested them will not have received their ballots by tuesday the court s order i fear will result in massive disenfranchisement she wrote as of monday nearly 1 3 million absentee ballots had been requested but only about 57 of those had been returned it s unclear how many of the outstanding 539 000 ballots will be in voters hands by tuesday to meet the april 7
