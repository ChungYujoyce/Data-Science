the detroit democratic presidential debates are in the books joe biden showed some fight elizabeth warren and bernie sanders defendedtheir similar liberal worldviews from low polling moderateswho warned of fairy tale promises and wish list economics and author marianne williamson while still a fringe candidate earned plenty of kudos and google searches for some of her answers on reparations for slavery and the environment here is what else we learned from two nights of the detroit debates from the moment he stepped on stage wednesday biden seemed intent on sending the message that he was ready to tussle biden at times looked like a deer in the headlights at the miami debate last month coming under blistering attack by sen kamala harris for his past opposition to federallymandated school busing and his relationship with two segregationist lawmakers with whom he served in the senate the former vice president and leader in democratic polls made it clear from the get go in detroit that this time he understood it was going to be a knife fight tonight i think democrats are expecting some engagement here biden said in his opening statement and i expect we ll get it he went after harris early onover her version of medicare for all that would be rolled out over a 10 year period the senator s had several plans so far and anytime someone tells you you re gonna get something good in 10 years you should wonder why it takes 10 years biden said if you notice there s no talk about the fact that the plan in 10 years will cost 3 trillion you will lose your employer based insurance medicare for all let s talk about math biden and harris spar over healthcare he also appearedready when sen kirsten gillibrand came after him about a1981 editorial in which he wrote that expanding the child caretax credit and allowing more women to work would subsidize the deterioration of the family in his response to gillibrand bidenreminded herthat she was full of praise for his dedication to equality at a 2015 syracuse university event to raise awareness about campus sexual assault i don t know what s happened except that you re now running for president biden fired back gillibrand vs biden mr vice president you didn t answer my question kirsten gillibrand digs in with joe biden at democratic debate but he was less steady in his tough exchange with sen cory booker who went after biden for his role in advancing the 1994 crime bill that is widely cited as a prime factor in the mass incarceration of african americans biden tried to turn the tables on booker taking aim at him for the newark police department embracing stop and frisk policies when booker was mayor more go easy on me kid joe biden s line to kamala harris gets reaction from her campaign if you want to compare records and frankly i m shocked that you do i am happy to do that booker retorted there s a saying in my community you re dipping into the kool aid and you don t even know the flavor but inthe end biden showed he could both throw and take a punch it s skill he ll need to keep honing as long as he s the democratic front runner and will need to perfect should he win the nomination and get to the debate stage with president donald trump throughout both nights candidates sought to bolster their chances by connecting their stances and policies to former president barack obama montana gov steve bullock noted on the first night of the debate that his opposition to decriminalizing unauthorized border crossing was the same stance as obama s department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson harris noted that obama health and human service secretary kathleen sebelius endorsed her health care plan and biden didn t miss a chanceto remind voters that he s the guy obama picked to be his vice president more you re dipping into the kool aid and the other top moments from wednesday s spirited debate the obama connection cut both ways on the second night of the debate new york city mayor bill de blasio questioned biden on whether he supported the obama administration s wide scale deportation of undocumented immigrants biden demurred i was vice president i was not the president biden responded i keep my recommendation in private protestersinterrupted the debate shouting while biden spoke and referringto obama s history ofdeportations the former president s legacy is a badge of honor for manybut has also seen criticism from some onthe left and it could be a talking point as the campaign rolls on for months booker has been treading water in the polls unable to crack into the top tier of candidates but on wednesday he landed some of the toughest blows against biden and in the process breathed some much needed oxygen into his campaign his sharpest exchange with biden came as the two debated their records on criminal justice since the 1970s every crime bill major and minor has had his name on it booker said this is one of those instances when the house was set on fire and you claimed responsibility for those laws as booker and biden went back and forth biden misspoke and calledbooker the president and then called him the future president booker embraced the unintentional endorsement first of all i m grateful that he endorsed my presidency already booker said with a laugh minutes after the debate ended the booker campaign was already selling stickers featuring a smiling photo of the new jersey senatoradorned with the future president quote from biden the winnowing of the unwieldy democratic field is inevitable half ofthe contenders who made the stage in detroitnow face a steep climb to meet tougher polling and fundraising requirements the democratic national committeehas set for next month s debate in houston for debates scheduled for september and october candidates will have to hit 2 in four qualifying polls and tally at least 130 000 individual donors according to the dnc guidance for the first and second rounds of debates the

seven candidates biden booker harris warren sanders south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg and former rep beto o rourke say they have crossed the threshold minnesota sen amy klobuchar and entrepreneur andrew yang are on the cusp it s going to be tough sledding for the rest of the field more than half of the candidates are routinely polling at less than 2 and none had a real breakout moment in the debatesthat might have catapulted them into voters minds so this may have been the last time you saw the likes of jay inslee or john hickenlooper on the debate stage the good news from the first night of the debates cnn drew more viewers about 10 million than the season finale of abc s the bachelorette 7 2 million according to preliminary nielsen media research numbers the bad news viewership was way down from last month s miami debate which drew 15 3 million viewers prominent politicos groused during the first night of the debate that the format left them unsatisfied too many candidates too little time for cogent answersand too many big issues not getting enough attention with fewer candidates expected to qualify for the september and october debates some of the gripes could be alleviated media critics and sanders also groused that the cnn moderators seemed intent on framing the questions in a manner to ensure conflict on night 2 of the debate yang waxed during his closing statement about the absurdity of the theater of the event instead of talking about automation and our future including the fact that we automated away 4 million jobs away hundreds and thousands right here in michigan yang said we re up here with makeup on our faces and rehearsed attack lines playing roles in this reality tv show it s one reason why we elected a reality tv star as our president
