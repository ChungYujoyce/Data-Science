the candidates various health care proposals and how they plan to pay for them might get special attention after warren released her plan to pay for medicare for all in early november the 20 5 trillion plan has received significant attention and could be an opening for others to attack her the usual democratic issues of taxes immigration and gun control will likely come up again like the october democratic debate expect to see tension between the more moderate wing of the party biden buttigieg and klobuchar and the more progressive wing with warren or sanders warren and biden still

rep seth moulton california rep eric swalwell ohio rep tim ryan and new york city mayor bill de blasio on nov 1 former texas rep beto o rourke also dropped out his campaign had struggled with fundraising and he hadn t yet qualified for the fifth democratic debate an all female panel will moderate the debate according to the post it will be only the second time a major political debate is moderated by all women the moderators are as follows rachel maddow host of msnbc s the rachel maddow show nbc s chief foreign affairs correspondent andrea mitchell nbc news white house correspondent kristen welker and ashley parker a white house reporter for the washington post maddow and mitchell have both moderated debates in the past maddow moderated msnbc s democratic debate back in june as well as a debate in 2016 mitchell also moderated a debate in 2016 political scientists and analysts tell time that the house s impeachment inquiry into the president will likely come up especially since the impeachment hearings will continue into the week the fact that a senate impeachment trial could occur shortly before or even during the early presidential primaries and caucuses might be important seth masket a professor of political science at the university of denver writes over email the candidates who are in the senate could be asked what they d do in that situation health care will almost certainly come up again especially since warren released her 20 5 trillion proposal for medicare for all in early november the plan would impose massive tax increases on billionaires and businesses but not on the american middle class warren had previously been evasive when asked how she d pay for medicare for all as john hudak a senior fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution explains i thought elizabeth warren s responses to the question of how to pay for medicare for all in the last debate was by far her weakest moment in all of the debates and she can t have many more of them but now that warren has released a concrete answer she may be on more even footing hudak points out that voters have responded to sanders and warren in part because they ve managed to avoid sounding like slick politicians and having a straightforward answer on medicare for all could help warren maintain that image however masket points out that the medicare for all plan could also present an opportunity for other candidates to attack warren and also for her to defend her proposal hudak predicts that racial and social justice will also come up especially because the debate will take in atlanta harris and biden might then have to defend their history of supporting tough on crime criminal justice policies which critics argued exacerbated mass incarceration david barker the director of the center for congressional and presidential studies at american university also writes that given that environmental policy was not discussed at all during the last debate i think there will be an emphasis on it this time relatively speaking immigration could get more attention given the current case before the supreme court on whether or not the trump administration can end the deferred action for childhood arrivals daca program jaime dominguez a professor of political science at northwestern tells time there will likely be ongoing battles between warren and biden who are emerging as the leading candidates from the moderate and progressive wings masket writes as o mara of washington university points out warren and biden have recently clashed in the media and that could continue onto the stage warren called biden s recent decision to accept super pac money disappointing and biden said warren is condescending toward voters but given the rise of buttigieg in recent polls this could be an opportunity for some further scrutiny of his candidacy masket continues as buttigieg rises in the polls his background specifically his time as a consultant for mckinsey might also face some scrutiny barker writes in an email barker predicts that biden will to continue to go on the attack now that he is pretty consistently behind in iowa and will especially focus on warren or sanders barker also says warren and sanders could take fire from other moderates on stage like buttigieg or klobuchar who have framed themselves as alternatives to the far left wing of the party barker explains that harris in turn might go after klobuchar or buttigieg given that they are standing directly in her path as the next in line after the top three where she used to be hudak tells time he also predicts more infighting within ideological groups than in previous debates warren might go after sanders or buttigieg might go after biden he says warren is not going to win the nomination because she flips a ton of biden voters hudak explains i think it s because she flips you know sanders voters probably some yang voters the recent additions of deval patrick and michael bloomberg might also cast a shadow over the debate o mara says you have mike bloomberg and deval patrick coming in as perhaps the kind of centrist alternative to what s clearly a progressive surge by warren she says the question of electability could be raised especially after a new york times and siena college poll found that biden and even sanders did better than warren against trump in crucial rust belt states of michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin the threat of bloomberg and patrick could also affect more moderate candidates on stage o mara says that centrists like buttigieg harris or klobuchar may try and convince voters don t give two thoughts to someone like mike bloomberg or deval patrick you already got us here there has been some movement in the polls since the last debate warren has gone down while sanders and buttigieg have gone up biden has regained a little steam just about everywhere except iowa barker writes american university professor of government james thurber also writes in an email that viewers should watch buttigieg he is going up in the polls nationally in iowa and there is excitement in new hampshire thurber says here are the polling averages of the candidates in the debate according to realclearpolitics polling average on nov 16 correction nov 17 the original version of this story misstated that tim ryan had not qualified for the november democratic debate he dropped out of the race in october write to madeleine carlisle at madeleine carlisle time com
