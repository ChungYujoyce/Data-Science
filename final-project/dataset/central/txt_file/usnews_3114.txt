donald trump broke yet another political tradition when he followed up his victory speech on super tuesday by taking questions from reporters in a freewheeling back and forth trump touched on his wins in multiple states and some recent issues in the presidential race here is the full transcript trump chris thank you very much i appreciate it this has been an amazing evening already we ve won five major states and it looks like we could win six or seven or eight or nine applause it s really been it s really been great i want to congratulation ted on the winning of texas he worked hard on he i know how hard he worked actually and so i congratulate ted cruz on that win that was an excellent win we re going to make america great again folks we re going to make it great again and you know i watched hillary s speech and she s talking about wages have been poor and everything s poor and everything s doing badly but we re going to make it she s been there for so long i mean if she hasn t straightened it out by now she s not going to straighten it out in the next four years it s just going to become worse and worse she wants to make america whole again and i m trying to figure out what is that all about make america great again is going to be much better than making america whole again so i just want to say that this was an exciting evening it s so great to be in florida it s so great to be at mar a lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody applause i know it was a very tough night for marco rubio he had a tough night but he worked hard he spent a lot of money he is a lightweight as i ve said many times before but you know what we re going to go to florida we re going to spend so much time in florida we ve got about a 20 point lead i know that a lot of groups a lot of the special interests and a lot of the lobbyists and the people that want to have their little senator do exactly as they want they re going to put 20 million or 25 million into it over the next two weeks from what just came over the wires and frankly i think that s fine as far as i m concerned it s fine and if he wins they ll have totally controlled total control but he s not going anywhere anyway but we ll see what happens but we re going to spend a lot of time in florida the virginia one was just a great win because it s a place that is just spectacular and a place that we have big investments in as we have in florida remember we have thousands of employees in florida all along miami doral and mar a lago and so many other places and it s been an amazing place to invest it s been amazing to have so many wonderful employees so many of whom are here tonight really urging us on and you know i have thousands of employees all over the country actually all over the world but for purposes of tonight we ll just say all over the country and it s been just so beautiful to watch this company grow and to watch it grow so strongly recent articles came out talking about how great a company we built and now we want to put that same ability into doing something for our nation i mean our nation is in serious trouble we re being chilled on trade absolutely destroyed china is just taking advantage of us i have nothing against china i have great respect for china but their leaders are too smart for our leaders our leaders don t have a clue and the trade deficits at 400 billion and 500 are too much no country can sustain that kind of trade deficit it won t be that way for long we have the greatest business leaders in the world on my team already and believe me we re going to redo those trade deals and it s going to be a thing of beauty you look at countries like mexico where they re killing us on the border absolutely destroying us on the border they re destroying us in terms of economic development companies like carrier air conditioner just moving into mexico ford moving into mexico nabisco closing up shop in chicago and moving into mexico we have to stop it folks i know how to stop it we re going to create jobs we re going to create jobs like you ve never seen we re going to lower taxes i have a plan that larry kudlow and so many others think is the best plan they ve seen we re going to lower taxes substantially for the middle class the middle class has been forgotten in our country it really helped and really probably was the predominant factor in making our country into a country that we all love so much and we re all so proud of but we ve forgotten the middle class so we re going to lower taxes we re lowering taxes on business you look at all the companies that are moving out when you see pfizer moving to ireland and you see so many other companies constantly now they re leaving they used to move from new york to florida or they d move from new jersey to someplace else chris but now they re moving from here laughter not that many people are leaving new jersey but chris understands the problem fully understands now they re leaving from places that they used to move to into other parts of the world we can t let that happen we ve lost our manufacturing jobs we ve lost our manufacturing millions and millions of jobs thousands and thousands and thousands of plants manufacturing plants warehouses i mean we are losing so much we can t let it happen i tell the story often about a friend of mine who is in the excavation business and he always orders caterpillar and recently he ordered komatsu tractors from japan because they ve cut the yen they ve devalued the yen to such an extent that it was virtually impossible for caterpillar to compete and i don t want that to happen that s not going to happen they shouldn t be allowed to do it we have tremendous power over everybody because we are really the source we have great great power the problem is we have politicians who truly truly truly don t know what they re doing so we re going to work very very hard i m so honored by this evening if you would ve told me on june 16th when i was with my wife melania and we came down the escalator in trump tower and it looked literally well a little bit like this you have a lot of cameras here tonight applause it looked literally like the academy awards i never saw so many cameras in my life and it takes courage to run i ll tell you what it takes a lot of courage to run for president i ve never done this before i ve been a job producer i ve done a lot of things but this is something i ve never done but i felt we had to do it when you look at the incompetence of the iran deal where we give 150 billion we get absolutely nothing when you look at all of the problems our country has and you look at our military which is really being depleted rapidly depleted we re going to make our military bigger and better and stronger than ever before and nobody nobody nobody is going to mess with us folks nobody applause so it s just an amazing honor to have you with me tonight and if you want press i think we told you before we d be okay if you want to ask a few questions yes go ahead question mr trump you said that your campaign is focused on uniting no dividing trump yeah right question inaudible would suggest you re dividing not just the country but your party there s been a lot of pressure recently to either support or reject you within the republican party specifically some strongly worded statements coming out in recent days including one from the senator from nebraska ben sasse said if donaldtrump ends up as the republican nominee conservatives will need to find a third party option what do you say trump well they can always do that and then they ll then they ll just lose everything and that would be the that would be the work of a loser but let me just explain something if you ve seen what s happened whether you go to south carolina where i had a huge victory where we had a tremendous victory in new hampshire tremendous in nevada you look at what s happened and tonight of course is the best of all i mean right now they re projected i guess six but we could be seven eight nine and major states it s georgia alabama massachusetts cheers tennessee virginia and you know these are amazing states and we re going to probably get a lot more in fact we re projected to have some pretty good additional numbers but i will say this look we have expanded the republican party when you look at what s happened in south carolina and you see the kind of numbers that we got in terms of extra people coming in they came from the democratic party or the democrat party and they re democrats and they re long time democrats and they were never going to switch and they all switched and they were independents and we ve actually expanded the party look at the number of votes we had in that area as an example four years ago they had 390 000 or so votes we doubled it we were almost 800 000 whereas the democrats went down there s much less enthusiasm for the democrats so i look i m a unifier i know people are going to find that a little bit hard to believe but believe me i am a unifier once we get all of this finished i m going to go after one person that s hillary clinton on the assumption she s allowed to run which is a big assumption i don t know that she s going to be allowed to run and i think that s frankly going to be an easy race you see the polls i beat hillary in many polls i know one thing i don t think marco is going to be able to beat her i don t think in all fairness i think ted s going to have a very hard time but ted at least has a shot because at least he s won a little bit so i just tell you this we are going to be a much finer party a much we re going to be a unified party i mean to be honest with you and we are going to be a much bigger party and you can see that happening we re going to be a much bigger party our party is expanding and all you have to do it take a look at the primary states where i ve won and just look we ve gone from x number to a much larger number that hasn t happened to the republican party in many many decades so i think we re going to be more inclusive i think we re going to be more unified and i think we re going to be a much bigger party and i think we re going to win in november ok yeah applause question inaudible the republican nominee and along those lines inaudible planned parenthood trump right question are you trying to inject your tone into a more general election inaudible trump i m just doing what s right look planned parenthood has done very good work for some for many many for millions of women and i ll say it and i know a lot of the so called conservatives they say that s really because i m a conservative but i m a common sense conservative but millions of women have been helped by planned parenthood but we re not going to allow and we re not going to fund as long as you have the abortion going on at planned parenthood and we understand that and i ve said it loud and clear but and we ll see what happens but planned parenthood millions of people and i ve had thousands of letters from women that have been helped and this wasn t a setup this was people writing letters i m going to be really good for women i m going to be good for women s health issues it s very important to me very important to me applause and maybe that s not a perfect conservative view but i can tell you one thing i m more conservative than anybody on the military on taking care of our vets on the border on the wall on getting rid of obamacare and coming up with something much much better and certainly getting rid of common core and bringing education to a local level so that you re going to have good education for our children who are being absolutely starved for proper education so sarah i mean you know you can call it what you want but i am a truth teller and i will tell the truth ok yeah go ahead finish it question off mike trump i feel awfully good i mean i m watching your people i m watching your people on and i m going to be very nice i m going to be very nice i m watching your people on cnn and i m watching the fox people and i m watching the msnbc people too ok see i m becoming diplomatic laughter and they are certainly being very nice to me tonight i mean you know they re being very strong and they are they re declaring marco rubio the big loser of the night which is true he didn t win anything he hasn t won anything period and by the way and i have to tell you and he was very very nasty i ve never heard a person get up and speak on an evening like this and be so nasty but he s got a right to be nasty he hasn t won anything and he s not going to win very much but i do congratulate ted because i know how hard ted worked on texas and it s a big get now i also did very well in texas i came in second and one of the things my son eric told me which i didn t even realize is that not only did i win most of the states and some are coming in and i m expected to win them but i came in second i came in no worse than second so it wasn t like i won and then i disappeared the worst i had was a second so i m very very honored by the turnout ok yes go ahead question mr trump in washington today paul ryan speaker of the house and majority leader mitch mcconnell felt it necessary to suggest that you had not been clear enough or critical about the role of hate groups kkk trump right question inaudible trump right oh they re totally wrong look i disavowed i disavowed when i in fact chris is my number one chris gave me the honor of joining the campaign he called me he said donald what you ve got is a movement we spoke today in kentucky you ve never seen a crowd like that that had to be 20 000 people inside this massive convention center and it was incredible and every place we re speaking if we have 10 000 people it s like a small group we had 35 000 people the other day in alabama and when chris called he said this is a movement this is something like i ve never seen and in all fairness to the press a lot of the press have said the same thing they ve never seen what s happening right now they ve never seen anything like it and i m just honored by it now when chris joined we had a news conference and they asked me the exact same question i said i disavow now right after the program that we re talking about and i thought it was clear but you know we re talking about groups groups groups i do have to know the name of the group because who knows i mean they have to give me the name of the group but right after when i reviewed it i put out a tweet and i put out on facebook that i totally disavow now everybody knew i did that but the press refused to look at that it was right after and i disavowed then i disavowed today on abc with george stephanopoulos i disavowed again i mean how many times are you supposed to disavow but i disavow and hopefully it s the final time i have to do it but if you look at facebook and if you look at twitter right after the show i put out a statement because i want everybody to be sure yes go ahead question mr trump you call yourself a negotiator a deal maker is this campaign just the start of a negotiation for you taking extreme positions in order to move toward the middle trump no it s not but there is always going to be some negotiation and it s going to be a good negotiation not a bad negotiation it s going to be a negotiation where we ll start at certain levels and hopefully i will make a great deal and lots of great deals for the american people so you know look you can t go around just signing our little notices that the president signs all the time executive orders he s done executive order executive order it s almost like i don t even know does he ever go a deal with congress anymore does he ever speak to the senate does he ever speak with congressmen and get them into a room and get things done you know a good example of this in all fairness is something that i is very very important to me corporate inversion carl icahn who s a friend of mine who endorsed me great businessman he it bothers him so much he calls me about it all the time where we re losing companies and we re losing for two reasons we re losing for a lot of reasons but the taxes are too high we have the highest we re the highest taxed nation in the world and very importantly they have trillions for companies trillions of dollars outside of this country the democrats agree it should be brought back in the republicans agree it should be brought back in everybody agrees it should be brought back in i could sit in a room or the oval office for a period of literally a half hour and i really believe i could get everybody every single you know it s one thing they don t agree on health care or they don t agree on common core or they don t agree on other things and they ll fight here s something every single i mean almost everybody agrees these trillions and trillions of dollars should be brought into the country the president can t make a deal the reason is he doesn t know how to make a deal probably doesn t work at it probably doesn t care but you re talking about tremendous number of tremendous amounts of money so when you have something that everybody wants and you can t make a deal there s something going on that s really wrong and what it means is you have the wrong leader yes question inaudible is immigration negotiable trump well look everything we are going to have a wall i can tell you we are going to have a wall i watched the ex president of mexico the arrogance of this man and i get along great with hispanics you saw in nevada i won in the poll the hispanic vote i have thousands of people that work for me right now that are hispanic i ve had thousands and thousands over my lifetime these are great people the mexican leaders are too smart for our leaders and you saw it vincente fox first of all he used a word that you should never have if i ever used that word you folks would ve never ever ever let me get away with it nobody even talked about the word he used and this is the ultimate word but he was angry at the concept of somebody saying that they were going to pay for the wall mexico is going to pay for the wall we have a trade deficit with mexico of 58 billion a year 58 billion the wall is going to cost 10 billion it s so easy i ve had these guys that i m on the stage with go you don t really mean mexico is going to pay for the wall one as sure as you re standing there 100 percent mexico s going to pay 100 percent applause and the reason is i m a businessman i know how to do this politicians are all talk no action it s not going to except for chris christie of course laughter it s not look it s not going to happen it s not going to happen with these people so when you think of it and then they say you ll never be able to build a wall well it s 2 000 miles but we really need 1 000 miles the great wall of china built 2 000 years ago is 13 000 miles folks and they didn t have caterpillar tractors because i only want to use caterpillar if you want to know the truth or john deere i buy a lot of equipment from john deere i love john deere too but they didn t have tractors they didn t have cranes they didn t have excavation equipment the wall is 13 000 miles long we need 1 000 miles and we have all of the materials we can do that so beautifully and this is going to be a serious wall this is going to be high wall this is going to be a very serious wall we re going to stop drugs from coming into new hampshire you know when i won new hampshire those people were so incredible to me and when you go you wouldn t believe it because it s so bucolic so beautiful you look at the fields and you look at everything it s so beautiful and yet you go to a meeting in new hampshire their number one problem their number one problem is heroine the heroine is pouring in and they have so many of their young people and other people addicted and i told them i m going to stop it i m going to stop it we re going to have a strong border and i mean strong and by the way speaking of people people are going to come in and they re going to come into this country but they re going to come in legally ok question inaudible trump i have a lot of respect for rick scott i don t know about his endorsement but he s a friend of mine i have a lot of respect for rick scott yeah question off mike trump i ve got to find out what s going on we ve got a big problem we have a big big problem i ll tell it like it is we have a big big problem we ve got to figure it out we re going to figure it out radical islamic terrorism big big problem not only for us you take a look at germany you take a look at sweden you take a look at brussels you look at some of these places it s like a disaster and we re not going to allow people to come into our country who we have no idea who they are we have no idea where they come from they have no paperwork they re young and they re strong you look at that migration line they re young they re strong they re powerful and you say why aren t they back fighting for their country now with all of that being said i feel strongly i have a bigger heart than anybody we re going to build a safe zone it s going to be in syria and i m going to get the gulf states who have more money than anybody we ve got to loosen up their wallets a little bit we re going to get but they re not accepting people we re going to get wait wait wait we re going to get the gulf states to pay for it because they should question inaudible trump you heard what i said i gave you a good answer you heard what i said yes go ahead question mr trump if you are indeed the nominee who versus hillary clinton in the fall what are you going to do to bring back some of these inaudible your campaign so far such as the muslims trump oh we re going to bring them back we re going to bring them back look i m telling you you know how i m going to bring them back first of all we re going to do great with the african americans and you see that in the polls where i had in one poll where i m 25 percent and one of the commentators who i think is standing right at the back of the room in the corner said you know if donald trump gets 25 percent of the african american vote this election is over you watch and the reason i m getting that and i m going to do great with the hispanics i m going to do great with virtually every group the reason is i m going to bring jobs back i m going to get apple to start making their computers and their iphones on our land not in china how does it help us when they make it in china applause so i m going to create jobs go ahead question if marco rubio cannot win florida is it time for him to get out and do you plan to spend the 25 million that inaudible trump well look i always liked marco until about a week ago when he decided to go hostile he decided to become don rickles ok but don rickles has a lot more talent honestly i did i always liked him but he became you know somebody told him you re losing very badly the only way you can possibly win take the hail mary they called it a hail mary the folks in the back and go hostile it s hurt him in fact one of the newscasts tonight said he went down 15 or 20 percent it s really hurt him but look i m not going to tell him what to do i m not going to tell anybody what to do you have to run he had a bad night according to cnn fox i watched their broadcasts they say the loser of the night was marco rubio and it s true he didn t win anything he hasn t won i mean at least you can say that ted has won something and you know marco has not won you ve got to be able to win you can t talk you know these politicians all talk no action you ve got to be able to win something he hasn t won anything and he actually hasn t come very close so we ll see what happens yes go ahead question mr trump inaudible this question earlier it was about working with congress you criticized president obama for not working with congress but dismissed the criticism from speaker ryan and from senate majority leader mcconnell inaudible about this issue would be trump i wasn t equivocating let s not ask it again how many times do i say listen who are you by the way who do you where are you with question inaudible sirius xm trump ok very good good job look i don t want to waste a lot of time i ve disavowed ok i m going to get along great with congress ok paul ryan i don t know him well but i m sure i m going to get along great with him and if i don t he s going to have to pay a big price ok ok question inaudible trump yeah go ahead go ahead on the right go ahead yes question off mike trump i m going to be a good president for the world but we have a country that s in big trouble our infrastructure is going to hell our roads our highways our schools our hospitals our airports i go throughout the world i mean you go to qatar you go to some people say qatar but you go to qatar you go to any of so many places you go to different places in china different places in asia different places in the middle east you look at some of the airports they have you look at the roadways they have you look at the transportation systems they have and the trains they have we re like a third world country so i am going to be very good for the world i m going to get along with the world you re going to be very proud of me even you will be very proud of me as a president but we have to rebuild our country our country is going to hell and people don t understand that and hillary clinton doesn t have a clue she can t do that she s talking about i mean one of the things that has really bothered me i think one of the reasons i have such great support is that people you take a look people in the middle income groups are making less money today less money than they made 12 years ago and in her speech she just said they re making less money well she s been there with obama for a long period of time why hasn t she done anything about it practically everything that she was complaining about she s picked up what i say the difference is she s been there for a long period of time why haven t they done anything about it then you look at her record as secretary of state it s abysmal you look at what s going on with syria you look at what s going on with everything it s a disaster so we re going to have an interesting period of time i don t know that she s going to be allowed to run what she did is a criminal act if she s allowed to run i would be very very surprised but if she s allowed to run honestly it ll be a sad day for this country because what she did was wrong and what she did cheers let me just tell you what she did was wrong and other people have done far less than her and they paid a very very big price ok one or two more questions yeah go ahead jeremy question you talked about how you plan to deport all the undocumented immigrants living in this country and yesterday you said that everything is negotiable that your immigration plan is potentially negotiable trump where did i say that where did i say it jeremy where where where tell me where tell me where cross talk i didn t say that yeah i ll negotiate if the walls going to be 50 feet i ll take two feet off the wall you didn t listen jeremy question inaudible and would you consider allowing the people who you ve said you would bring back into the country would you allow them to stay in the country without having to leave the country trump at this moment absolutely not no we either have a country or we don t we have a country or we don t we have borders or we don t have borders and at this moment the answer is absolutely not ok how about one or two more questions david go ahead make it a nice question david please question we re hearing some suggestions including some from a few of your former aides that some people inside the republican national committee are considering monkey wrenching with your delegates at the state level trying to clear you away inaudible trump i think you know david i ok go ahead question at the end of the night you may very well have maybe sewed up 10 of the 15 states at this point is that enough of a inaudible that the rnc should just commit to honoring their agreement with you or inaudible trump well look i don t expect i have a lot of respect for reince and for the group and i like the rnc and i don t know that i ve been treated fairly or not i really don t know i can t tell you that but i can tell you that i do respect them what i really have is a great number of people i have millions and millions of people and when i was watching this broadcast just a little while ago before i came in here because i wanted to see exactly where we were before i started speaking i was amazed at the kind of numbers the republicans have tremendous energy the democrats don t they don t have any energy their numbers are down our number are through the roof and people are making the statements they ve never seen in modern times a party that was so energized i think if somebody is doing as well as i m doing and i m not just speaking for myself whether it be me or anybody else but if i m going to win five i ve already won five but maybe it could be six seven eight nine it could be nine could win nine states tonight if i m going to win all of these states with tremendous numbers and if i m going to come in the worst is second in the two or three that i might not win i think you know we re a democracy i think it s awfully hard to say that s not the person we want to lead the party right you know it s very hard but i really think that i think it s a great question david because i really think that one of the biggest things that everybody is seeing happening and everybody is the republican party has become more dynamic it s become more diverse we re taking from the democrats we re taking from the independents we have a lot more people we have a lot more people i mean take a look at south carolina look at the numbers look at the numbers from four years ago when nobody even wanted to waste their time and vote and then you look at i was there and you had lines that went a mile long and it was virtually more than doubled so we have a very very dynamic party and i think we re going to be able to unify the party i hope to be able to get along with everybody i don t know paul ryan well but i hope to be able to get along with him i do know mitch mcconnell a little bit but i hope to be able to get along with him but remember this i have millions and millions and millions of people this isn t like it s a close match i mean it s only too bad that winner didn t take all because if winner took all this thing is over we re just having a celebration applause you know we re having a celebration so anyway i would like to look i just want to end by thanking everybody this has been an amazing period in my life my wife just called and ivanka as you know is going to be having a baby very soon and she s a special person and it s going to be great and we look forward to that she s back in new york she wanted to be here they all wanted to be here but they re with ivanka now and that could be certainly within the next week but this this has been an amazing period of time it s been amazing for me even from an educational standpoint and i think honestly we ve done something that almost nobody thought could be done and i m very proud of it and i just want to leave you with this i am a unifier i would love to see the republican party and everybody get together and unify and when we unify there s nobody nobody that s going to beat us thank you very much everybody thank you applause thank you very much thank you contact us at editors time com
