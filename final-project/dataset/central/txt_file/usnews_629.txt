16 million in loans stephen calk the founder and longtime chief executive officer of federal savings bank of chicago pushed through the high risk loans despite numerous red flags prosecutors said in an indictment unsealed on thursday he also sent a document to manafort ranking the administration positions he desired in return they said from secretary of the treasury on down to 19 ambassadorships topped by the u k and france the indictment is the latest to target a trump campaign associate and indicates that prosecutors are aggressively pursuing offshoots of special counsel robert mueller s probe into russian interference in the 2016 election in addition to manafort former trump aides michael cohen and michael flynn have been convicted of federal crimes a former u s army helicopter pilot calk 54 faces a single count of financial institution bribery at a hearing in federal court in new york he pleaded not guilty and was released on a 5 million bond calk has done nothing wrong and is going to be exonerated at trial his lawyer daniel stein told reporters outside of court the loans made to mr manafort by the federal savings bank were good loans they were over collateralized at high rates of interest and those loans simply were not a bribe for anything manafort isn t named in court papers but the description of the high ranking campaign official who received the loans matches him calk s name came up several times during manafort s criminal fraud trial last year as a lender seeking a post in the administration the indictment includes references to unnamed officials of donald trump s presidential transition team a further indication that people inside trump s circle may face pressure from prosecutors in new york manafort approached the bank in the spring of 2016 seeking to refinance loans issued by another lender on several real estate projects involving him and his son in law according to the indictment during a subsequent meeting that july calk said he was interested in participating in the presidential campaign manafort said he d get back to him the next day on july 28 2016 calk and two other members of the bank s credit committee conditionally approved the loan calk then sent his resume to manafort and was appointed on aug 5 2016 as one of 14 members of trump s economic advisory council a relative unknown among business titans like thomas barrack of colony capital and steven mnuchin who would become treasury secretary manafort left the campaign later that august amid news reports about his foreign lobbying around that time his loan approval ran into problems as bank officials learned of his trouble repaying another loan an inability to verify his income and a 300 000 credit card delinquency according to the indictment on oct 7 2016 manafort asked that 1 million be added to the loan i look to your cleverness on how to manage the underwriting manafort wrote in an email to calk the next day manafort emailed calk again i also want to again thank you for fixing my issue it means a lot to me the loan was rejected later that month by federal savings bank but after trump was elected in november 2016 calk prompted the bank to reverse course and approve a 9 5 million loan prosecutors said on nov 14 2016 calk emailed his professional biography and the list of white house positions he wanted are you aiding in the transition in any type of formal capacity calk wrote in a nov 14 email to manafort according to the indictment total background but involved directly manafort replied awesome calk wrote the bank closed on the 9 5 million loan two days later after the first loan was approved calk pushed for the bank to approve a second set of loans for manafort totaling 6 5 million even though he knew manafort needed additional money to avoid foreclosure on properties owned by him and a relative according to prosecutors any sense of a schedule the clock is ticking and we are getting pressure on a number of fronts manafort wrote to his loan officer and calk on nov 30 2016 in order to enable the bank to issue the loans without violating legal limits on lending to a single borrower calk authorized a maneuver never before done by the bank prosecutors said using the holding company which calk also controlled to acquire a portion of the loans from the bank manafort had recommended that calk be considered for secretary of the army to two unnamed trump transition officials without mentioning his relationship with federal savings after the 6 5 million loans closed calk interviewed for under secretary of the army calk didn t get the job calk is on a leave of absence and has no control over or involvement with the bank federal savings bank said in a written statement it described itself as a victim of manafort who admitted but wasn t charged with lying to the bank calk s brother john calk is vice chairman and ceo of the bank after a newspaper disclosed the manafort loans in march 2017 federal savings bank s primary regulator the u s office of the comptroller of the currency contacted calk and the bank to ask about them calk lied to regulators by saying he wasn t aware that manafort s property was in foreclosure and by saying he never wanted to be hired for a position in the trump administration according to the indictment in july 2017 the occ downgraded the credit quality of the manafort loans to substandard
