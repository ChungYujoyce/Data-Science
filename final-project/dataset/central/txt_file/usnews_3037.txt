chinese society at purdue university tells time that there are about 116 million protestant christians in mainland china in 2020 it is almost certain that by 2030 there will be more christians in

leaders believe they have cause for concern willy lam adjunct professor at the chinese university of hong kong s center for china studies says underground churches are spreading like wildfire in rural areas of china he says the chinese government is afraid that more people including less educated people are turning to the church for their spiritual needs and not to official nationalism and patriotism underground churches which have not registered with the government and are sometimes called house churches because gatherings are often held in members homes have reported increased repression since the introduction of new regulations in 2018 that effectively banned unauthorized religious teachings and required religious groups to report any online activity wang known for being

separation of church and state he believes the party state apparatus should not intervene in the church lam says china is officially atheist but its constitution guarantees its citizens freedom of religious belief for normal religious activities the chinese government officially recognizes five religions buddhism taoism islam catholicism and protestantism more than a dozen religious and spiritual groups including falun gong are branded evil cults and banned in china even in official churches cctv cameras and other surveillance equipment are installed in every church so that the state knows what the pastor or the priest might be talking about in their sermons lam says some activists say that wang s harsh sentence may be a warning for the leaders underground churches to fall into line the government wants to force all churches to register with the officially sanctioned church so that they can be completely under government control patrick poon a researcher at amnesty
