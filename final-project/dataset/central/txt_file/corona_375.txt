candidates cancelling events and politicians scrambling to come up with a response the coronavirus outbreak is casting a long shadow over us politics but some trump supporters say the growing crisis is largely the work of a familiar villain the us media conservative radio host and three time congressional candidate dan bongino had a message for the almost 2 000 donald trump supporters gathered in an airport hotel convention room in the toney town of palm beach florida on tuesday night the president he said had made stopping the spread of the coronavirus his highest priority he had the finest minds in the world working on it 24 hours a day seven days a week vice president mike pence charged with heading the virus task force was focused like i ve never seen him before in my life despite these efforts bongino acknowledged the president s power had limits and that the virus was very dangerous and highly contagious he s not the messiah he said he can t just wave a wand and make this go away that the president is not an omnipotent political deity who leaves adversaries human and viral alike trembling in his wake was perhaps an unusual admission in a room full of supporters decked out in donald trump gear surrounded by vendors hawking donald trump hats t shirts hot sauce and posters of a beaming trump family that proclaimed god life trump less surprising however was that bongino placed the blame for the growing crisis at the feet of the mainstream media which he said engaged in a pathetic disgusting pile on to damage the president s political standing by making it appear that his administration was not doing enough to combat the spread of the virus and help those infected just when i think we ve hit a new low they impress me again with their depravity he said they blast right through the damn floor and they reside in the basement bongino ended his remarks on an up note however saying the us had been through wars revolutions the spanish flu and hippies and survived we ll get through this he said we ll fix it after bongino concluded his presentation and retired to a table to pose for photographs and give his autograph to those who paid 30 23 in cash for a copy of his new book people present echoed his sentiments content is not available donald trump is a brilliant guy said mike huey of palm beach gardens he knows how to surround himself with brilliant people and i m sure he s doing every thing he can to control the situation huey who runs an online disaster preparation and survivalist gear company said he has 100 confidence that the president is doing the right thing despite those efforts trump hasn t found a way to arrest the steep drop in the stock market over the past few weeks however given that the president has frequently boasted about market gains over the past three years this reversal of fortune threatens to undermine what would have been a key selling point for his re election campaign in the autumn maggie vandenberghe a california filmmaker in town for an event at trump s nearby mar a lago club said the president s enemies in the press were to blame for the scope of the hysteria maybe it s a little conspiratorial but i would not be surprised if the media was drumming up this hysteria in part to shake things up ahead of the election she said the one thing donald trump has really been able to run on time and time again regardless of how you feel about his other policies is the economy and if they can destroy that ahead of the election they might have a better chance of electing a democrat dan ray who goes by the nickname deplorable dan also blamed the media as well as the left and its marxist mentality for what he called the goofy virus scare ray cited a series of statistics including fatalities in the us from auto accidents and the seasonal flu to suggest that american fears were overblown one hundred ten people die in america every day from car accidents he said those are human beings and they re lives but that doesn t stop me from driving coronavirus could the us do what italy has done as for economic and health concerns ray is not personally worried he said he jams soft soap under his fingernails to keep germs at bay and has been stocking up on silver dollars and survivalist gear for years just in case of a breakdown in civil order the stock market doesn t affect people like me he said i haven t had a bank account since 1984 i don t have a credit card if i m going to buy something i ve got to have cash recent opinion polls suggest the coronavirus sentiment at the palm beach event hosted by a group that bills itself as the president s largest independent fan club reflect the larger views of republicans across the us and that america is once again sharply divided along partisan lines according to surveymonkey 62 of republicans think the seriousness of coronavirus is generally exaggerated versus only 31 of democrats a quinnipiac poll found 63 of republicans were either not so concerned or not concerned at all about the virus while for democrats that number drops to 31 as for the president s handling of the response to the virus 87 of republicans approve while 83 of democrats disapprove dawn rofrano of singer island agreed that the president was handling things the right way like many americans she said she is carrying hand sanitiser and being careful not to touch her face but for the most part i m not scared i m looking at the facts said rofrano who works as a health coach at a natural medicine clinic that s what i need to do as for the economy and the political risk to the president i m not worried about that either she said it will come back when you are on the side of truth i know that it will always prevail health secretary matt hancock
