des moines it s iowa snightmare scenario revisited an extraordinarily close count in the iowa caucuses and reports of chaos in precincts and computer glitches areraising questions about accuracy of the count and winner this time it s the democrats not the republicans even as hillaryclinton trumpeted her iowa win in new hampshire on tuesday aides for bernie sanders saidthe eyelash thin marginraised questions and called for a review the chairwoman of the iowa democratic party rejected that notion sayingthe results are final the situation echoes the events on the republican side in the 2012 caucuses when one winner mitt romney by eight votes was named on caucus night but a closer examination of the paperwork that reflected the head counts showed someone else pulled in more votes rick santorum by 34 votes butsome precincts were still missing entirely like republican party officialsin 2012 democratic partyofficials worked into the early morning on caucus night trying to account for results from a handful of tardyprecincts but at 2 30 a m tuesday iowa democratic party chairwoman andy mcguireannounced thatclinton had eked out a slim victory based onresults from 1 682 of 1 683 precincts after voters from the final missing democraticprecinct tracked down party officials tuesday morning to report their results sanders won by two delegate equivalentsover clinton in the final missing precinct des moines precinct no 42 the iowa democratic party said the updated final tally of delegate equivalents for all the precincts statewide was clinton 700 59 sanders 696 82 that s a 3 77 count margin betweenclinton the powerful establishment favorite who early on in the democratic race was expected to win in a virtual coronation and sanders a democratic socialist who few in iowa knew much abouta year ago sanders campaign aides told the register they ve foundsomediscrepancies between talliesat the precinct level and numbers that werereported to the state party the iowa democratic partydetermines its winner not based on a head count like in the republicans straw poll butbased on delegate equivalentstied to a math formula and there was enough confusion and untrained volunteers on monday night that errors may have been made we feel like that there s a very very good chance that there is said rania batrice a sanders spokeswoman it s not that we think anybody did anything intentionally but human error happens team sandershad its own app that allowed supporters and volunteers to send precinct level results directly to the campaign at the same time caucus chairs sent their official results to the state party either over a specially built microsoft app or via phone sanders aides hopeto sit down with the state parties and review the paperwork from the precinct chairs batrice said we just want to work with the party and get the questions that are unanswered answered she said mcguire in an interview with the register said no the answer is that we had all threecamps in the tabulation room last night to address any grievances brought forward and we went over any discrepancies these are the final results she said mcguire in her 2 30 a m statement said hillary clinton has been awarded 699 57 state delegate equivalents bernie sanders has been awarded 695 49 state delegate equivalents martin o malley has been awarded 7 68 state delegate equivalents and uncommitted has been awarded 46 state delegate equivalents we still have outstanding results in one precinct des moines 42 which is worth 2 28 state delegate equivalents we will report that final precinct when we have confirmed those results with the chair team clinton quickly embraced that news and flatly stated that nothing could change it clinton s iowa campaign director matt paul said in a statement at 2 35 a m hillary clinton has won the iowa caucus after thorough reporting and analysis of results there is no uncertainty and secretary clinton has clearly won the most national and state delegates statistically there is no outstanding information that could change the results and no way that senator sanders can overcome secretary clinton s advantage mcguire repeated that tuesday afternoon saying the reporting app had a built in failsafe to prevent volunteers from reporting more delegates than were assigned to each precinct clinton who saw her expected iowa win slip away in 2008 grasped theprize tuesday i can tell you i ve won and i ve lost there and it s a lot better to win shesaidat a rally in new hampshire the state that votes next on the presidential nominating calendar clinton on iowa it s a lot better to win but that didn t quell doubts back in iowa politics is a contact sport with few referees so torturing your opponents with questions about the transparency of an election can be very harmful and damaging said steffen schmidt a longtime political observer and professor at iowa state university in ames discrepancies can occur in official elections and caucuses are not even official election events run by the secretary of state s office noteddennis goldford a drake university professor who closely studies the iowa caucuses the caucus system isn tbuilt to bear the weight placed on it he said there aren t even paper ballots in the democratic caucuses to use for a recountin case something doesn t add up democrats have never released actual head counts and mcguire said they would not be releasedthis time either determining a winner based on state delegate equivalents rather than head count is a key distinction between how the democrats conduct their caucuses versus conducting a primary she said new hampshire and iowa are generally careful to maintain such distinctions as part of their effortto preserve their status as the first caucus state and first primary state there were reports of disorganization and lack of volunteers monday evening party officials reported a turnout of 171 109 far less than the record of 240 000 seen in 2008 democratic voters reportedlong lines too few volunteers a lack of leadership and confusing signage in some cases people waited for an hour in one line only to learn their precinct was in a different area of the same building the proceedings were to begin at 7 p m but started late in many cases the scene atprecinct no 42 the one with the final missing votes was chaos monday night saidjill joseph a rank and file democratic voter who backed sanders in the caucuses none of the 400 plus democratswantedto be in charge of the caucus so a man who had shown up just to vote reluctantly stepped forward as joseph was leaving with theuntrained caucus chairman who is one of her neighbors i looked at him and said who called in the results of our caucus and we didn t know elections 2016 usa today network the impromptu chairman hand delivered the results to polk county democratic party chairman tom henderson tuesday sanders won seven state delegates clinton won five ames precinct 1 3 started caucusing two hours late at 9 p m because the crowd was so big and the check in line so slow saidpeter d myers a finance major and member of the student government at iowa state university who caucused for the first time there wasn t a clear person in charge myers said capacity at the caucus site heartland senior center was 115 but 300 people turned out myers said at one point they considered moving to the parking lot of the hy vee grocery store it was so chaotic that we ended up making the building work even though capacity was doubled he said myers said he registered to vote in august but was alarmed to find out i wasn t on the list so i had to go to the back of the line the gentleman in front of me has caucuses the past three cycles and he wasn t on the list either no one was there to lead the caucus so a pregnant lady took charge and counted the bernie supporters and a hillary captain took the small group to a corner and counted the supporters he said sanders ended up with four delegates and clinton one he said hillary s new hampshire nightmare jill lawrence an indianola precinct that gathered in hubbell hall at simpson college had a discrepancy between the number who checked in and people counted in the first vote the chair and secretary knew the count was off but proceeded anyway said paige godden a reporter for the record herald and indianola tribune we did the final count at least three times people were very frustrated by the end new voters made up nearly 40 of the caucusgoers 207 of 521 at democratic precinct no 59 on at des moines central campus organizers said the precinct ran out of voter registration forms and had to print more when the caucus began the one by one head count discovered 58 more people voting than had checked in organizers asked anyone who had not signed in to do so and then recounted iowa attorney general tom miller a clinton supporter who lives in the precinct stepped in to help with the recount the precinct s caucus chair mark challis wasn t sure if the counts were accurate but changes wouldn t have affected the final vote tally which had sanders substantially ahead iowa turnout record setting and surprising democrat mary ann dorsett of des moines told the registerthat492 voters turned out in her precinct but there were only a handful of people assigned to check people in it was a very large room so clearly they expected a large turnout dorsett said the lines snaked through the corridor and out the door it took over an hour to check in republicans in the same precinct were seated long before this and already listening to speeches dorsett thinks the one by one head counting system is a real head scratcher in terms of the possibility of inaccuracy as well as time wasted if all the smartphones were eliminated it could have been 1820 and we were re enacting the roles of a bunch of farmers sitting in a church hall counting heads is this the 21st century she said this may well be my last caucus unless the democratic party cleans up its act meanwhile republican party of iowa officials are doing a review they re comparing the app results for each candidate with what the precinct chairs jotted down on their e forms on caucus night when you re counting thousands of votes you ve always got to be careful iowa gop spokesman charlie szold said microsoft one of the premier tech companies in the world had developed websites to deliver results in real time but both the democratic website idpcaucuses com and gop website iagopcaucuses com struggled intermittently throughout the night crashing for periods of time and locking out the public from access to the results mcguire said theapp system the volunteers in the precincts used to file their numberswas never down they microsoft had plenty of capacity for our results she said microsoft spokeswomanangela swanson henry said national interest in the iowa caucuses was high and some who attempted to access websites may have experienced delays which were quickly addressed contributing tony leys and kevin hardy the des moines register follow jennifer jacobs on twitter jenniferjjacobs
