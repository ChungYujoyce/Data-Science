results trickling in appeared to be breaking in sanders s direction and there s still a chance he could win both the popular vote and a plurality of delegates sanders s allies believe he was deprived of valuable momentum he should have had coming out of iowa and progressives are livid viewing the fiasco as endemic of a party that s been run by establishment figures whose unchecked power has bred incompetence and laziness adding to the frustration is the fact thata handful of former hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life

are obviously wrong this can be explained by rank incompetence sroka continued but progressives are winning despite one hand often being tied behind our back when they can t even run a caucus properly the calls for change could never be more obviously needed sanders s supporters are also fuming at buttigieg who has been on a victory tour to tout his top finish in the caucuses with 97 percent of precincts reporting sanders led the raw vote total by about 6 000 on the first alignment although the vagaries of the caucus system likely mean that he and buttigieg will end up splitting a plurality of the delegates buttigieg far exceeded expectations in iowa and in the days since the caucuses he s popped in the polls of new hampshire it s clear that in the first and second round more people voted for sen sanders than any other candidate said terry tucker a democratic national committee dnc member from colorado who backs sanders the partial release of data and the app fiasco that led mayor pete to declare an early victory cannot change the ultimate result or the facts adding fuel to the fire the buttigieg campaign raised concerns with the state party about how delegates are being

government social programs triumph of hope over evidence labor s wasteful spending and mismanagement at workers comp more has called for a complete recanvassing after the state party recalled some results due to reporting errors it is curious that dnc chair perez is calling for a recanvassing when it appears that sen sanders is winning the iowa caucuses said jeri shepherd a dnc member from colorado who supports sanders the cynic in me wonders if recanvassing would be called for if another candidate were in the lead again we are having to respond to dnc happenings we learn about through twitter or other social media other sanders allies are going further demanding that perez step down the debacle in iowa should bring about the swift resignation of tom perez said jonathan tasini a progressive strategist and sanders ally he can t fulfill the most basic operational task of ensuring the presidential nomination process is fair and sound which only feeds the lingering feeling among many of us that at best the party leaders are deeply incompetent and at worst some are maneuvering to eventually undercut the will of the voters the dnc did not respond to a request for comment it has said the debacle in iowa is unacceptable and that it will not use the failed app to report any further results perez vented frustration with the state party on thursday as he called for a recanvass saying enough is enough in a speech in manchester sanders vowed to overhaul the process if he wins the white house and his allies take control of the national party that will not happen again if i

further fuel to sanders s supporters who are energized by his promise totear down what they view as calcification and stagnation within the national party obviously making the dnc out to be the bogeyman is good politics for him said one former dnc official but i never thought i d see the day where bernie and biden were in lockstep about the horrible workings of a state party their complaints
