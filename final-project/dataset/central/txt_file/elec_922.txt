former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more for republicans have high disapproval ratings you have two historically unappealing candidates in clinton and trump that a majority view unfavorably so a lot of voters are looking for alternatives he said there s a willingness to look at the third party candidates this cycle but it hasn t hit critical mass yet so unless trump and clinton dramatically tank it s going to be hard to get into that first debate winston said johnson the former republican governor of new mexico has approached the 15 percent mark in several surveys reaching as high as 12 percent in a fox news poll released this week johnson s campaign has so far relied heavily on pushing digital content over social media and media coverage to get his message out johnson and running mate bill weld the former republican governor of massachusetts have participated in two prime time town hall events on cnn the first which was a let down to many libertarians received fewer than 1 million viewers the second which took placewednesday was cheered by johnson weld supporters and reached 1 6 million viewers making it the most watched cable news program in its time slot now the campaign is looking beyond the press to more traditional campaign activities johnson and weld will hold their first rallies of the cycle this weekend in nevada and utah additional rallies in colorado and new mexico are expected later the campaign is also set to release a national radio ad soon and a national tv ad is in the works weld has embraced the role of fundraiser for the campaign boasting in the cnn town hall about having secured 1 million in commitmentsin one day that would nearly match what the campaign had raised in the first half of the year and campaign manager ron nielson said small dollar fundraising is also picking up he said the ticket raised 500 000 in grassroots donations over a two day stretch this month the johnson weld campaign has more than 40 paid staffers now and nearly as many full time volunteers nielson is cautiously optimistic about their chances of making the first debate we think we re moving up right now he said we see a lot of support we feel good we think we can get above 15 percent stein

presidential debates cpd challenging the polling threshold johnson still has a separate legal challenge against thecommissionoutstanding the nonpartisan agency which declined to comment for this story could come under pressure as the debates near if johnson or stein are climbing in the polls nielson of johnson s campaign lashed out at the agency in a statement with governor johnson consistently polling in double digits we continue to believe that the cpd should make the right and fair decision to invite him to participate in the upcoming debates nielson said there is clearly an unprecedented desire for alternatives to the republican and democratic nominees and voters deserve an opportunity to see and hear that there are in fact other credible serious choices he continued the cpd could act today to end the two party stranglehold on the debates and that is precisely what they should do pollsters interviewed by the hill are doubtful either candidate will make the debate stage i think it s unlikely unless both major party candidates start leaching base support said monmouth university pollster patrick murray while third party candidates are set to do better this year than in most cycles the 15 percent threshold is too high a hurdle if they miss on the first round there will be a vice presidential match up in october and two more presidential debates that month view the discussion
