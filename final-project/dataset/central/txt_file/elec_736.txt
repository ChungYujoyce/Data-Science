many say they want a candidate who will look out for the common man but plenty of iowans still don t know who he is loading august 19 2019 a son of the heartland and a graduate of harvard mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana combines a folksy manner with intellectual firepower that elicits chuckles and cheers since bursting out of the gate this spring with a flood of media attention after a town hall appearance went viral hehas lately been polling in the single digits but he has been highly successful at fundraising which means he has the resources to make a strong showing in the crucial iowa caucuses last week he made a swing through half a dozen iowa counties that had voted in favor of barack obama but flipped to support donald trump in 2016 mr buttigieg the gay midwestern wunderkind would like to woo those voters back perhaps what most sets him apart from the large democratic field is the way he invokes values like faith freedom and patriotism that have come to be seen as the province of conservatives american values are not values that belong to one party he tells a crowd in ottumwa they re values that belong to all of us but that i also believe point in a very progressive direction when we take them seriously gary kupferschmid managed to snag the autographs of five presidential candidates in just three hours at the iowa state fair this month adding to a hefty collection that includes jimmy carter george w bush barack obama hillary clinton and donald trump the last of whom got his vote in 2016 now mr kupferschmid is back in his hometown standing on the dimly lit porch of the port of burlington as the mississippi river flows by waiting for a signature from the latest candidate to roll through but mayor pete buttigieg is hard to get to he is mobbed everywhere he goes in iowa supporters press in standing almost nose to nose with him waiting for their turn to exchange a few words i m so nervous you re such a rock star gushes one woman a man sporting a boot edge edge t shirt that doubles as a pronunciation guide urges the mild mannered mayor from south bend indiana to do a kamala harris in the next debate referring to the california senator s more combative approach stand out in the middle of it all a little girl looks up at the youngest of the presidential candidates and says i hope you get to be president i hope so too he responds bending down toward her on a swing through more than half a dozen mostly rural counties after an appearance at the iowa state fair last week all but one of those counties share a common characteristic they voted in favor of mr obama but flipped to support mr trump in 2016 mr buttigieg the gay midwestern wunderkind would like to woo them back we lost an election in 16 because i believe we didn t hear that very clear message from rural people says democrat patty judge a former lieutenant governor and secretary of agriculture for iowa they thought that donald trump was change was an opportunity for them of course that was not true they are going again to be looking for that opportunity and change she hasn t endorsed a candidate yet but calls mr buttigieg s new plan for rural america very strong and indeed he is positioning himself as a son of the heartland who s on a mission to reclaim quintessential american values like faith freedom and patriotism as not solely the province of the gop at the same time he is deliberately redefining those values in progressive ways he refers to trump voters as our friends and speaks of the pain of rural america and the importance of seeing it as part of the solution on everything from the economy to climate change since bursting out of the gate this spring with a flood of media attention after a town hall appearance went viral mr buttigieg has lately been polling in the single digits but he has been highly successful on the fundraising front which means he has the resources to lay the groundwork for a strong showing in the crucial iowa caucuses six months from now his campaign sees southeastern iowa as especially fertile territory says senior communications advisor lis smith they are hoping toconvert trump voters like mr kupferschmid the message is essentially look donald trump talked a good game he said he was going to go out there and fight for you but he hasn t says ms smith following the buttigieg media mob at the state fair as he heads over to flip pork chops with the iowa pork queen it s not about saying that they re complicit in a crime or that they re horrible people for voting for him it s just saying now is your chance and we will actually fight for you but first he has to get on more people s radar screens despite the intense cohort of fans who seem to follow him everywhere plenty of iowans still who have no idea who he is as mr buttigieg and his entourage stroll around the fairgrounds in des moines they leave in their wake many puzzled expressions who is that asks one onlooker pete buttigieg replies someone nearby and who is he asks a third looking confused i have no clue who that is says a boy no clue agrees a woman next to him go trump yells someone else from the bowels of the beer tent someone recognizes him yelling i got your book one supporter offers him half a plastic cup of beer an aide says no thanks it s only mid afternoon another insists on handing him a limp chocolate chip cookie a staffer discreetly throws it in the next trash can mr buttigieg dressed in a white shirt and jeans takes it all in stride never seeming ruffled or impatient no matter what the question antifa brexit climate change the hong kong protests israel s annexation of the golan heights tensions in kashmir or his favorite subject in grade school english he delivers an articulate answer with almost machine like precision after traipsing all over the fairgrounds he honors a promise made to a mother who asked him during the q a of his soapbox talk will you ride the slide with my son of course i ll ride the slide with your son he told her i don t know what it means but i ll do it and he does high fiving the little boy at the bottom then fortified by all manner of pork he heads off to trump country burlington iowa has been dubbed the backhoe capital of the world and when shearer s is making chocolate chip cookies the whole city smells amazing it boasts its own minor league baseball team the burlington bees and was the hometown of conservationist aldo leopold and astronaut jim kelley it features hilltop victorian mansions that can be purchased for 225 000 but shootings are up and the population is down the lowest it s been in nearly a century employers complain that they can t find good help the rate of kids on free and reduced price lunches has risen from just a few percent to more than 50 in the past few decades though burlington itself narrowly supported mrs clinton the county as a whole went for mr trump up the river in muscatine it s a similar story mayor diana broderson sitting in the front row of an outdoor house party waiting for mr buttigieg to arrive says she wants someone that s looking out for the common man last time around some supporters of sen bernie sanders upset that he had lost the nomination to mrs clinton backed mr trump instead i m hoping that everybody has learned that our party has to be united says ms broderson a great number of people in our community agree that trump is not the answer kelcey brackett the democratic chairman in muscatine county says he believes some trump voters could go for senator sanders if he became the democratic nominee other candidates such as sens cory booker of new jersey and amy klobuchar of minnesota could also win them over by setting a tone of bipartisanship i do think that s important says mr brackett adding that there is also high enthusiasm for mr buttigieg who drew 225 people to the muscatinehouse party on a weekday afternoon otherwise the pendulum is just going to swing harder in the lush backyard mr buttigieg is introduced as being among other things maltese american left handed and a didgeridoo player as at nearly every campaign stop he receives a standing ovation before he even opens his mouth a harvard graduate and rhodes scholar mayor pete combines intellectual firepower with a folksy manner that elicits chuckles and cheers over even the driest topics basically i want to marie kondo the bureaucratic process he says referring to the bestselling japanese decluttering expert who has encouraged millions to empty their closets of anything that doesn t spark joy tongue in cheek he describes his own memoir shortest way home featuring a daring young mayor who has a vision for the future of his community it s sorta how we re paying off the wedding bill so i d be very grateful if you d pick one up says mr buttigieg who married his husband last summer and carries household student debt in the six figures forbes recently ranked him as the poorest presidential candidate with a net worth of 100 000 but he has 23 billionaires backing his campaign the most of any candidate he has 60 full time staffers in iowa campaign finance is one of my favorites he says in response to a question boiling the issue down to a simple equation it s not a democracy he says if dollars can outvote people if citizens united the landmark 2010 supreme court decision can t be overturned he adds congress should pass a constitutional amendment to tune up our democracy and speaking of democracy he suggests counting up all the votes in a presidential election and letting the person with the most win with such seductive logic he doesn t need to even mention the electoral college or get into a messy debate over how and why the framers of the constitution sought to prevent america from devolving into a tyranny of the majority everyone is already cheering but perhaps what most sets mr buttigieg apart from the large democratic field is the way he invokes values that have come to be seen as the province of conservatives i believe in american values that are not values that belong to one party they re values that belong to all of us but that i also believe point in a very progressive direction when we take them seriously he tells a crowd in ottumwa take liberty he says it s not just about freedom from regulations or onerous taxes it s about freedom to choose how to live freedom for women to choose one of his biggest applause lines to get quality health care or to marry whomever you want regardless of what a county clerk thinks he and his supporters know such positions can be a hard sell in iowa where religious conservatives hold significant sway when i enthuse about you people say america isn t ready to elect a gay man president a man tells mr buttigieg at a campaign stop ireland has a gay prime minister and south bend seems to have gotten over it he continues how can i convince them mr buttigieg responds by sharing his own decision to come out after serving as a navy reserves intelligence officer in afghanistan and returning to his job as mayor he won reelection several months later with 80 of the vote god does not belong to a political party he is fond of saying adding that the bible shouldn t be used as a cudgel to tell people they don t belong he cites scripture about feeding the hungry and caring for the stranger and accuses the trump administration of violating such tenets he hopes he tells the crowd in muscatine to make it ok for those who are guided by faith to know that they don t have to be pushed into the arms of the religious right whose latest political decisions betray not only our values but also their own and what about those whose deeply held convictions religious or otherwise do differ from his he would like to persuade them he says but acknowledges that i won t convince everybody and that s ok he adds however that people who think a lot about freedom conservatives and libertarians should pause at a moment like this and ask if this isn t a chance for resetting the entire spectrum in a way that will make americans better off back in burlington as the last of some 500 attendees trickle out someone with the buttigieg campaign approaches mr kupferschmid to return the baseball he had hoped mayor pete would sign hi gary i apologize profusely says the young man that s ok it s better than kamala harris says mr kupferschmid who at least got his pete buttigieg for president button signed and he seems more genuine get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox he says though that with a lot of his money in the stock market he ll probably vote for mr trump again next year if it keeps doing well but he implies that calculus could still change as he ambles into the warm summer night he peers into a trash can and pulls out a pete sign link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription
