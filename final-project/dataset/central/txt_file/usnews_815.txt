for grassroots candidates running for the u s senate one big national endorsement can make or break an entire campaign that s why the democratic senatorial campaign committee a powerful washington based organization that spends tens of millions of dollars each cycle supporting democratic candidates wields such outsized clout an endorsement from it is in effect the establishment s stamp of approval for the party s biggest donors to cut checks but that s also why the dscc s pattern of endorsing candidates early in their primaries has sown resentment among some grassroots campaigns and progressive activists in a handful of crucial states including iowa colorado and north carolina i think there s a general feeling that we would put forward better nominees as a party to defeat republicans if we let voters decide candidates as opposed to trying to divine from within the confines of the beltway who we think is most likely to win over say kentucky or colorado karthik ganapathy a progressive strategist told time the dscc should embrace a role as sort of intermediaries and arbiters as opposed to kingmakers he adds at a time when the democratic party is increasingly split between its moderate clintonian wing and a more revolutionary progressive left represented by the rise of presidential candidates bernie sanders and elizabeth warren dscc endorsements also carry weighty implications for the future of the party some progressive critics argue that the dscc mostly endorses moderate candidates their style seems to be to choose candidates who can stay on the phone all day to call big donors do very few press events and then put all of their money on television said rebecca katz a progressive strategist of the dscc it s their playbook republicans can be criticized on similar grounds she says who should be time s person of the year for 2019 cast your vote in the reader poll a dscc spokesperson says the organization endorses the most viable candidates as part of a broader national strategic effort if we re going to stop mitch mcconnell from gutting access to affordable health care confirming partisan judges to lifetime appointments on the federal bench and supreme court and attacking reproductive rights then we need to win senate seats stewart boss a dscc spokesperson told time in an email we re working with candidates who will do exactly that and help democrats take back the senate in recent years some dscc recruits have pulled out unexpected wins including sen kyrsten sinema in arizona in 2018 the democratic primary in iowa where at least four candidates are vying for the nomination to run against republican sen joni ernst is one example of where this tension is playing out that race won t heat up until after the iowa presidential caucuses in february and the field is still wide open one october emerson poll showed no clear front runner yet the dscc has already endorsed a candidate theresa greenfield the president of a des moines real estate business greenfield s opponents accused the dscc of anointing a winner from afar we shouldn t rig elections retired admiral michael franken who is also running against greenfield told time and that s a tough word rig but generally speaking the operatives in washington dc do not have a track history in this state of choosing the most viable candidate kimberly graham who is also running against greenfield said the dscc s endorsement came too early why not let the candidates who are going to get in the race get in give them six months or whatever amount of time and see what happens see what they do she said in an interview with time if we really want a democracy then maybe we should back off a little bit and let the iowa voters decide who is the best person to represent them early dscc endorsements rankled outsiders in other states u s senate races this cycle too in north carolina the dscc backed army veteran and former state senator cal cunningham to take on republican sen thom tillis despite the fact that another democrat state senator erica smith is leading in polls smith has been running since january in a statement after the endorsement smith dismissed cunningham an an heir apparent and accused the dscc leadership who she said she met with directly of interfering in the democratic process ultimately the voters of north carolina will decide who their next united states senator will be not a handful of dc politicians making back room deals in windowless basements smith wrote a similar dynamic has played out in colorado in august the dscc endorsed former colorado gov john hickenlooper just two days after he joined the race after his failed presidential bid some of the democratic candidates who were already running to challenge republican sen cory gardner attacked the dscc s decision democrats this is a moment of decision do we want dc to dictate our choice and buy this election before any ballots are even cast or do we believe voters still matter tweeted andrew romanoff one of the candidates running to the left of hickenlooper a moderate meanwhile former obama era ambassador dan baer who had raised almost 1 4 million for his campaign for that seat ended his bid when the dscc weighed in baer later endorsed hickenlooper in his first fundraising quarter in the race hickenlooper raised 2 1 million both hickenlooper and cunningham have a slew of endorsements in addition to the dscc s in iowa in particular many dscc critics say the issue is not whether theresa greenfield is the right candidate it s that they believe voters should have been given time to consider each candidate s merits before the dscc weighed in greenfield received the dscc s backing just three days after entering the race alongside an endorsement from emily s list she has since banked more endorsements from both national organizations including naral pro choice america and local ones including afscme council 61 and several other unions a number of current and former iowa elected officials including u s representatives abby finkenauer and dave loebsack have also endorsed greenfield jordanna zeigler greenfield s campaign manager did not respond immediately to questions about the dscc s early endorsement but described broad backing for her candidate we re proud that theresa s earned support from across the state including endorsements just this week from labor unions representing nearly 12 000 hardworking iowans she said in a statement her hard work and the growing momentum for her campaign are how theresa outraised joni ernst last month and why she ll flip this senate seat in november in the last fundraising quarter greenfield pulled in more than 1 1 million slightly out raising ernst the dscc sees that as a success its endorsement can help make candidates competitive in fundraising against powerful incumbents but graham greenfield s more progressive opponent says it has given some of the voters she s spoken with the impression that chuck schumer and the dscc put their thumbs on the scale dscc endorsements have broader implications at a time when the democratic party pushed left by the rise of popular liberal candidates is in a period of self reflection and reinvention many progressives complain that the dscc s tendency to select more moderate candidates fails to reflect an increasingly liberal democratic base which they argue might translate to electoral wins with the support of the party according to one recent des moines register cnn mediacom poll a combined 40 of likely democratic caucus goers in iowa are planning to caucus in the presidential primary for one of the two top moderates joe biden or pete buttigieg but nearly a third a combined 31 planned to caucus for sanders or warren the poll had a margin of error of 4 4 percentage points linn county supervisor stacey walker who endorsed sen bernie sanders for the 2020 primary noted that a dscc endorsement or the lack thereof affects who enters the race in the first place he considered running in the senate race himself but decided against it on the grounds that the primary was orchestrated by washington elites instead of being left up to the voters i don t have the privilege of challenging institutional forces on this scale without incurring significant damage to my political career walker wrote in a post announcing he wouldn t run for the senate and at the end of the day this fear won out over my courage and i m not proud about that walker has since endorsed graham penny rosfjord a former iowa woodbury county chair dismissed concerns about dscc s effect on state elections i think that people are reading too much into it i think that anybody can run for the senate she told time i think this is a nonstory for me but ganapathy the progressive strategist argued that a dscc endorsement can distort who gets into a race who rises and who receives fundraising dollars the whole idea behind a primary is just that we re going to get better nominees if we actually let voters decide he said in an ideal world the dscc would play a broader role don t direct resources to any single candidate and if you re going to help a candidate help all candidates equally he said in 2016 katz another progressive strategist worked for progressive senate candidate john fetterman in the pennsylvania primary fetterman lost to dscc backed katie mcginty but mcginty went on to lose the general election two years later fetterman ran for lieutenant governor and won the state race iowa state sen rob hogg argues that because the dscc is a national organization it often fails to identify the candidate most appealing to in state voters in 2016 he emerged as a formidable primary opponent against dscc backed patty judge who was ultimately defeated soundly i believe to this day that that was a mistake by the democratic senate campaign committee to intervene in that race hogg said in 2014 the dscc endorsed bruce braley who ran what most democrats agree was a bad campaign he too lost to ernst i don t think iowans have much confidence in the ability of the dscc to pick candidates hogg told time describing dscc endorsements as meddling in state primaries unquestionably people want the dscc to stay out of our primary he added hogg has not endorsed in the current primary bryce smith the chair of the iowa dallas county democrats defended dscc support as important to statewide candidates but added that iowa voters who are used to using a very personal caucus system are particularly sensitive to the notion of washington selecting a nominee i definitely feel as though it kind of rubs against the grain he told time in my personal view and what i hear from people is that that help comes once the nominee has been picked by democratic voters he added i think that s kind of the hurdle that s being skipped by the dscc eddie mauro who like greenfield unsuccessfully ran for iowa s third district nomination in 2018 and also entered the senate race this year said that in conversations with schumer and sen catherine cortez masto the chair of the dscc in the spring he was also told that they did not want a primary we talked about the prospects of me running for the us senate he told time they were concerned about having a primary they preferred not to have a primary at all in june time reported that senate minority leader chuck schumer also attempted to dissuade j d scholten the candidate who nearly beat rep steve king in iowa s fourth district in 2018 who was at the time considering jumping into the 2020 senate race from running for senate in an attempt to clear the way for greenfield we don t need a primary schumer told scholten according to a source familiar with the situation scholten eventually chose to run in the fourth district again greenfield ran in the iowa third district primary in the 2018 cycle a seat now held by democratic us rep cindy axne but dropped out after a campaign staffer faked signatures for her petition paperwork the staffer later publicly apologized in an ad in the des moines register what s clear is that democrats have their work cut out for them in 2020 arizona colorado north carolina and maine are among the most competitive races although some democrats argue that iowa is within reach the state voted for trump by about 10 points and the nonpartisan cook political report rates the 2020 race as likely republican but president barack obama won the state twice and it wasn t so long ago that democratic sen tom harkin represented the state and as the saying goes democrats have to fall in love write to lissandra villa at lissandra villa time com
