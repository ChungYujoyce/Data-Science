will close its theme parks in california and florida and its resort in paris from this weekend through the end of the month due to the global outbreak of coronavirus the company said on thursday reuterssee our prior coverage of coronavirus here and here the flip sideboth sides are optimistic about the public s response and stress the importance of social distancing even as they lament the absence of sports and other social events to entertain and bring us together for all the foreboding about the novel coronavirus foreboding that is justified it is heartening to see the american people responding in ways reminiscent of the frontier spirit most people are doing what they have to do to survive a clear and immediate threat to their lives and communities given the scale and costs of voluntary mitigation underway the moment has arrived for the relevant authorities in washington to inform the american people more precisely about the purpose and parameters of social distancing mr trump should assemble his specialists prominently to describe the realities and goals of all these voluntary closures they ought to explain the math behind minimizing person to person transmission of the virus the so called reproduction number or why it s important to suppress infectious spread before the onset of detectable symptoms we no longer live on the frontier science may not fully understand this virus yet but it knows a lot about the reasons for dislocating a nation s social and economic life it s time for leaders to explain this to a worried but resilient american public editorial board wall street journal the big dilemma in managing an epidemic is that if you wait until the caseload is massive it s too late so it s imperative to take action early even if it may seem premature at the time this isn t a case of just the risk to an individual as in when a person decides to do an extreme sport such as base jumping if somebody goes to a large event and gets sick he or she could then transmit that disease to somebody else because of the long 14 day incubation period and mild symptoms in a lot of people those with coronavirus may walk around infecting other people without even knowing they have it researchers estimated the potential growth of coronavirus in the coming weeks in two washington counties that have been hardest hit by the virus what they found was that if business continued on as usual there would be 25 000 cases and 400 deaths by april 7 with a 25 reduction in contacts among people those numbers drop to 9 700 infections and 160 deaths if contacts are cut in half infections drop to 4 800 and deaths to 100 and if there were a more dramatic 75 reduction there would be 1 700 infections and 30 deaths philip klein washington examiner in 1918 in philadelphia health officials ignored calls for social distancing and allowed a world war i victory parade to proceed within three days all the hospital beds in the city were filled within a week roughly 45 000 people were infected within six weeks 12 000 were dead the prospect of a repeat of that kind of mass manslaughter is frightening especially when you consider that the 1918 influenza had a fatality rate of about 2 5 percent compared to the 3 4 percent fatality rate for the coronavirus estimated by the world health organization we can learn a lot from history s tragedies but also from its triumphs the plague that terrorized my generation aids was subdued by the same kind of public education cultural flexibility and medical advances we need today back in the 1980s when aids awareness tipped from denial to panic our salvation didn t come from a lab but from a pamphlet that piece of paper understanding aids was mailed to almost every american home in 1988 thanks to the pamphlet along with a nationwide education offensive on safe sex my generation learned that nothing including love was free we adapted then we can adapt now max brooks new york times when the sun is shining and kids are at the park and no one you know is sick it can be hard to imagine how one sick person becomes seventy sick people let alone a thousand or tens of thousands or millions it can be hard to grasp why something that may only be experienced as a mild illness by many people must be treated with such drastic measures but this is how epidemics work and short of a vaccine or a cure which will not be here very soon social distancing is how they are slowed down it is among the best of human impulses to unify in times of trouble and sports are a powerful mechanism for bringing people together sustaining and strengthening weary spirits it is one of the worst aspects of this crisis that coming together can itself be a source of harm louisa thomas new yorker i can deal with postponed work events limited social gatherings and work from home mandates but depriving me of baseball absolutely not obviously mlb is making health and safety a priority and it s the right decision but for we poor souls who start the countdown to opening day as soon as the world series ends there s no respite every other sport is canceled or suspended even the japanese and korean leagues are postponed so we can t look to foreign leagues for our fix there are no good options should we simply rewatch the glory days of the washington nationals s world series run do we get a video game version of baseball and pretend it s the real thing is there a way to play fantasy baseball that fantasizes as if the season has gone on uninterrupted nicole tieman washington examiner sports at their best are a miracle of collective imagination they are a miracle of joint hysteria for many of us millions of us sports are a sort of natural frame of reference a mutually agreed on alternative calendar we can divide our lives in the context of vince carters and tom bradys and ken griffey jrs at a time when we are becoming increasingly isolated both physically and spiritually sports are something we can share even when it means yelling at each other from opposite sides of a rivalry or a debate about how elite joe flacco is or whatever dumb thing and i guess to me that is the greatest thing about sports and sports fandom the dumbness is shared in the absence of sports i am going to try to channel the energy i would have spent watching and thinking about say lebron s first title as a laker into my community i am going to try to focus on helping i am going to try to appreciate the miracle of the internet as a means for us to mutually support one another and express our solidarity instead of whining about how it brings out the worst in us sports only matter because we give them meaning and in their absence and in the midst of a perilous global moment we can give meaning to something else we can give it to one another eric nusbaum slate economists and politicians worry about the economic costs as everything shuts down but the coronavirus shutdown will hurt america on a far deeper level it will exacerbate our most acute preexisting condition the cancer of loneliness and alienation we do not belong to as many things as we used to we go to church less we join fewer clubs we volunteer less we also know our neighbors less get married less and have children less tough times usually bring us together trial catastrophe or tragedy make it most clear that we need others that we need to belong to little platoons that we need to reinforce our understanding of ourselves through our relations with others that s what makes the coronavirus doubly cruel while most crises require us to come together this one seems to require us to go apart timothy p carney washington examiner according to former us surgeon general vivek murthy loneliness causes stress and long term or chronic stress leads to more frequent elevations of a key stress hormone cortisol it is also linked to higher levels of inflammation in the body this in turn damages blood vessels and other tissues increasing the risk of heart disease diabetes joint disease depression obesity and premature death no one quite knows how the isolation enforced by an epidemic disease will affect those at the highest risk but even those who avoid the worst consequences will see their quality of life degrade local clubs religious services and time with family bring social structure and joy to many of our lives but they are particularly important touchpoints for those who don t work or can t go out on their own due to age or health conditions if older and sick people have to refrain from these activities for months on end their lives will be worse and the rhythms and relationships that once sustained them may prove hard to rebuild as with so much else in the coronavirus pandemic the response here will depend on the level of social solidarity we feel and the degree to which we re willing to look out for each other ezra klein vox here s how families can self quarantine without
