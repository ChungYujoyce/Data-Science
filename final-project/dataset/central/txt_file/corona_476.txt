crisis it could also uncork solutions to a chronic housing shortage after the pandemic is over loading april 2 2020 california has the nation s largest homeless population staying in shelters or in cars and parks they are more likely than residents living in permanent housing to have underlying health problems that puts them at heightened risk during a pandemic putting additional strain on medical and city services local officials are scrambling to move thousands of homeless people into converted shelters and locate hotel rooms to quarantine the most vulnerable people and those who may already have covid 19 it s proving an immense challenge still the crisis is also clearing away barriers that would normally hinder progress resources are being freed up regulations eased and communities are pitching in how california responds now to the needs of homeless people may shape long term thinking about what has been missing so far in its response to its housing crisis people who work with the homeless population hope this spirit can be extended after the crisis abates as bad and unfortunate and uncertain as this pandemic is it s renewing a sense of crisis response and urgency that we have been looking for across the whole system saysheidi marston of the los angeles homeless services authority propelled by the novel coronavirus california is rushing to shelter thousands of its most vulnerable residents homelesspeople who live outdoors and can t stay at home to protect themselves and others from covid 19 day one of that unprecedented effort in los angeles revealed the daunting struggle that lies ahead across the state by dinnertime on a recent friday a shuttle bus had dropped off only four homeless people at a community center that was being turned into a shelter in the echo park neighborhood the four clients sat on the curb waiting to be checked in but the nurse had yet to arrive cots had not been delivered one of the four a distraught older woman in gray sweatpants kept repeating food food when a helper tried to escort her to a restroom across the street to wash up before eating she would not follow eventually she wandered off and could not be coaxed back it s tough admits los angeles mayor eric garcetti we ve never moved this many people ever editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall in a matter of weeks the city is trying to voluntarily move 6 000 unsheltered people into 42 community and recreation centers that are being converted into shelters those who are especially vulnerable though not showing symptoms of covid 19 as wellas those who need to be quarantined will be sent to hotels motels or care centers but the mayor and others deeply involved in this issue are also looking ahead to after the crisis whenever that comes and how california responds to the needs of homeless people during a pandemic particularly the unsheltered may well shape thinking about what is still needed to address a vexing complex problem that was a crisis long before the coronavirus hit it s certainly something we re thinking about now mayor garcetti told a press briefing what can we do to get the homeless not just out of this crisis but off the streets california is ground zero for america s homelessness crisis about150 000 people are homeless here living in shelters on sidewalks in tent encampments canyon washes and under bridges in the golden state often in highly unsanitary conditions many are older and in poor health which heightens the risk of an explosion in severe virus cases that could further strain medical and city services before the coronavirus hit democratic gov gavin newsom had made homelessness his first priority devoting his entire state of the state speech to the subject it polled as the top issue among voters as well now covid 19 has added even more urgency to the issue underscoring what people who work with the homeless population have known all along that the challenge is not only in tackling a housing crisis but also a health one to slow the growth of the virus the governor in a march 18 executive order directed 150 million to localities to help with shelters and hotel and motel rooms the state also purchased more than 1 300 camper trailers for people who might need to be quarantined so far the effort has been intense but spotty accompanied by a debate about whether to move people into shared shelters or individual motel rooms as of april 1 los angeles had converted 13 community centers to shelters with 565 beds the shelters are 95 full more shelters as well as hotels motels and 1 000 quarantine beds are expected to come online in the next few days 900 are already available so far five cases of covid 19 have been identified in the homeless community some homelesspeople are skeptical about the safety of shelters in a pandemic we re safer out here than in a shelter says ayman ahmed who sleeps in a tent at echo park lake voicing a common sentiment still the crisis is clearing away barriers that would normally hinder progress resources are being freed up regulations eased and eviction moratoriums declared in an all hands on deck response that people who work with the homeless population hope can be extended after the pandemic ends as those who are unsheltered enter temporary accommodation even gathering data about them could be helpful in the long term because so little is known about this population we don t know how many people are disconnected from homeless and health services we don t know the length of time the unsheltered have been on the streets both are predictive factors that show how hard or easy it may be to stably house someone says gary painter an expert on homelessness at the university of southern california in los angeles meanwhile community support for emergency sheltering instead of resistance has been pretty fantastic says heidi marston interim executive director of the los angeles homeless services authority as bad and unfortunate and uncertain as this pandemic is it s renewing a sense of crisis response and urgency that we have been looking for across the whole system bay area community services based in oakland runs programs that provide short term and permanent housing for homeless residents with an emphasis on seniors and those with physical or mental health conditions outreach workers have fanned out across the san francisco bay area to educate those living on the streets and invehicles about the coronavirus what we ve seen is that a lot of people don t know the severity of the crisis says jamie almanza the group s executive director as workers attempt to shepherd people into shelters and other temporary housing she adds the question is how to capture this moment and this sense of urgency we re seeing governor newsom s emergency order has sliced through red tape that can slow down efforts to house those who lack permanent shelter a pair of hotels in oakland will provide housing for almost 400 people living in encampments and in san francisco officials have identified some 8 500 vacant rooms in 30 hotels where they will seek to place homeless individuals and families in the days and weeks ahead as cities and counties work with state and federal agencies ms almanza says public officials are releasing emergency funds and relaxing rules on existing spending on homelessness to locate available housing officials are relying on local nonprofits ms almanza hopes the increased cooperation and trust will last beyond the pandemic given that with or without the threat of covid 19 those living on the streets and in shelters face a daily life or death struggle it s becoming crystal clear during this crisis that the nonprofit organizations are the front line first responders she says and what this could mean for the long term is a better understanding by government funders of what can happen when we all really come together the 2007 08 housing market crash contributed to a rise in california s homeless population as banks foreclosed on homeowners and large encampments sprouted in cities across the state in 2008 officials in fresno embarked on a 10 year plan to reduce homelessness funneling more funding and resources into rapid re housing permanent housing and supportive services by 2017 the city s homeless population had fallen almost 60 according to the u s interagency council on homelessness a much steeper decline than seen elsewhere in california the numbers have climbed again over the past few years as fresno like the state as a whole contends with an acute shortage of affordable housing but city officials assert that in the same way they learned lessons from the housing crash the pandemic response can inform policies for aiding the homeless population now and in the future this is a crisis within a crisis says h spees director of strategic initiatives for fresno mayor lee brand you have the homelessness crisis being enveloped by the covid 19 crisis and with that you have the opportunity to leverage short term responses into long term solutions last week in the span of 72 hours the city opened up 300 new shelter beds in a vacant hotel and two other buildings and began housing homeless residents the swift action could serve as a template for the city long after the pandemic passes we don t have all the answers mr spees says but we are seeing waves of public and private resources come together to speed up the street to home transition and it s demonstrating that moving people off the streets can happen quickly when we have collective effort in east palo alto south of san francisco the rev paul bains laments that it has taken a pandemic to bring greater urgency to the cause of ending homelessness at the same time as the president of wehope a homeless shelter and supportive services provider he recognizes that the coronavirus response presents an opportunity there is so much attention right now on getting people off the streets and out of the elements and giving them a chance to get healthy he says barriers are being removed because people are realizing what the risks are for someone who doesn t have a place to live in the past week mr bains has secured 230 000 in funding to expand wehope s fleet of mobile shower trailers and purchase 15 000 face masks to distribute to homeless individuals outreach workers and emergency responders he credits local officials and governor newsom for creating momentum to prioritize initiatives on homelessness what we re seeing is that with community collaboration and strong leadership we have the wherewithal to address these systemic issues mr bains says but it s not just a spirit of collaboration that will be needed says margot kushel director of the center for vulnerable populations at the university of california san francisco it also takes a serious sustained financial commitment homelessness is a catastrophe she says it requires a level of response that is not going to be free and is going to cost money but is absolutely essential to preserve health get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox that money could be harder to find as the u s goes into a recession that will sap state budgets california has a substantial rainy day fund but it is likely to be drawn down rapidly in a deep economic downturn dr kushel believes that hotels could perhaps play a larger role in a long term solution to homelessness in california when the crisis is over some of the high end hotels will go back to being hotels she says there might be others who believe that having full occupancy brings more value to their properties link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your
