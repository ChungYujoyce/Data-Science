going to grow more crucial in future elections political scientists say loading june 8 2016 garner jarrett never used to care much about politics the massage therapist and actor who is in his late 20s had been an indifferent voter at best and never before voted in a presidential primary but the promise of change that democratic candidate bernie sanders brought to the national stage and the access to information about him that the internet made possible moved mr jarrett enough to not only cast his vote at his neighborhood polling station in koreatown on tuesday it also propelled him to reevaluate his view of the american political process he says this election changed the way i participate on a deeper scale he says i started seeing stuff about a candidate i cared about it inspired the hope that things could get better jarrett s remarks articulate in part the attitudes that are coming to define millennial voter concerns and behavior those attitudes first emerged in the 2008 presidential election a tendency to lean toward liberal values a drive to champion social justice issues and call for change in established processes and a reliance on the internet and social media for information communication and political mobilization as the generation comes into its own already millennials match baby boomers in their share of the us electorate those perspectives will more heavily inform the issues and processes that determine future elections political analysts and generational experts say what has grown more pronounced since 2008 and 2012 and which senator sanders s campaign underscored is a push away from even the perception of being part of the establishment whether it s washington or wall street such a drive if sustained could have lasting influence on the way millennial voters engage in elections and the kinds of issues toward which they steer conversation says jan leighley a professor who specializes in political behavior at american university in washington the likely consequences of millennial support of a bernie candidacy is that a you may have mobilized a generation more than they would have otherwise and b you may just have pulled hillary to the left she says tuesday hillary clinton made history as the first woman to top a major party ticket by securing the number of delegates she needed to clinch the democratic nomination even before the last six states went to the polls according to the associated press three of the states new jersey new mexico south dakota have been called for her while she holds a commanding lead in the night s biggest delegate prize california tonight caps an amazing journey a long long journey mrs clinton said in her victory speech thanks to you we ve reached a milestone the first time in our nation s history that a woman will be a major party s nominee sanders who won in montana and north dakota refused to bow out vowing to fight on until washington d c goes to the polls june 14 while he has been mathematically eliminated his success in galvanizing young people like jarrett speaks to the value of a politician s ability to verbalize millennial concerns in a passionate way sanders struck a chord that this generation is receptive to says michael hais a veteran market researcher and co author of three books on millennials more and more he notes leaders will have to speak in a language and communicate using methods that this generation understands as the senator has done they ve had these basic attitudes and that s going to persist mr hais adds they are going to shape the policy of the future despite their numbers only 46 percent of millennials 18 to 34 year olds are likely to vote they make up just 17 percent of likely voters in california that s not unusual as voters tend to participate more in elections as they grow older baby boomers today have higher rates of voter turnout than millennials but boomers came out to vote at about the same rate as millennials when they were the same age according to data from the center for information and research on civic learning and engagement a nonpartisan research institute at tufts university in boston the reality is youth are very small percentage of the vote says professor leighley that s true even in presidential election years and even under the most generous assumptions still millennials did show up at polling stations across los angeles on primary day making it more likely that they will vote again the biggest predictor of participating in a future election is if you participate in a previous one says jeff gulati a political science professor at bentley university in waltham mass and those millennials who spoke with the monitor echoed jarrett the koreatown resident when it came to their hopes for and expectations of a leader and the reasons they came out to vote this election makes me want to be more aware says serenity self 26 as she walks out of bellevue recreation center which served as a polling station in l a s silver lake neighborhood bernie bringing up delegates and superdelegates made me question thewhole electoral process i think finally people are seeing the light this is the most active i ve ever been in a campaign says david hemphill 33 a children s book publisher who spent primary day canvassing for sanders in boyle heights in east los angeles he gave a voice to things that i have felt for a long time and haven t really heard someone speak to i m looking at our power structure in this country through a different lens than i was a year ago he adds elementary school teacher angelo gonzales 28 says he wavered between mrs clinton and sanders but ultimately chose the latter because of his bold vision i guess i wanted to make a statement he says ten years ago i would ve scoffed at bernie sanders i would have said he wanted too much change but change is good it s a powerful thing we want someone to step up some political analysts are wary of making definitive statements about the long term impact of this election and of sanders s campaign on millennial attitudes and vice versa though the senator did manage to energize a large swath of the demographic professor gulati says not all millennials are sanders supporters or democrats for that matter they re also young and therefore still developing their views and political stances says professor leighley at american university you re talking about individuals who don t have firmly held attitudes and don t have much experience she says the issues that they re raising are issues that every other age group are raising economic security jobs some aspect of maybe the role of government in allowing or helping individuals to get ahead that s not much different from what elections usually are about another enduring effect of this election analysts say is the role of the internet and social media not just in terms of how candidates are reaching potential voters as they did for obama during his campaigns but also how voters are informing themselves about the candidates and their issues they are says hais the generation expert the best way of appealing to millennials more than anything there s so much information out there video editor andrea otto 27 says you can look into the money of campaigns you can be better informed you don t have to take what mainstream media outlets are telling you i think this election is unique in that social media is coming to be huge adds jarrett from koreatown you can take a person nobody knows about and through social media he s able to become an important candidate mr hemphill the children s book publisher goes a step further get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox we re the most educated connected generation in the
