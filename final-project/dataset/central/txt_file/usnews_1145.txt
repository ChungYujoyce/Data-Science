the story behind this photo is very unusual in 2005 president george w bush had asked both his father and bill clinton to work together on a fund for hurricane katrina relief in new orleans clinton of course had beaten bush back in 1992 they weren t supposed to be friendly during that campaign i had covered president george h w bush i honestly don t think he had a high regard for clinton at the time because it was a tough loss for him i remember his face during election night in houston he really thought he would be re elected i went on to cover clinton s presidency and i rarely saw them together over the years except at formal ceremonies i saw them at richard nixon s funeral and at the white house for the official unveiling of bush s portrait but new orleans was the first time i ever saw them together like this quietly away from other people they were doing an interview with time s michael duffy after announcing 90 million in hurricane relief grants we were in an empty room in a library at the university of new orleans it wasn t an ideal place to take a picture there was overhead neon light it was pretty drab i thought how am i going to show what kind of a relationship these two people have developed i just didn t have any idea i had heard that they had become good friends over the years and i wanted to see if it was true i kept watching them and all of a sudden bush put his hand on clinton s shoulder i thought oh my god wow there it is that s the picture every so often there will be a gesture a touch a movement that shows you something you re always looking for it as a photographer and there it was a lightly teasing affectionate pat on the shoulder friends indeed i thought they really do like each other you don t touch someone like that unless you care about them they were telling funny stories clinton had gone to visit the bushes in kennebunkport maine mrs bush had sort of looked askance at the idea of clinton coming but she ended up so fond of him she was asking him to come again they joked about the speedboat they talked about playing golf they appreciated each other and it was just a joy to see diana walker was time s white house photographer from 1984 to 2001 her most recent book is hillary the photographs of diana walker contact us at editors time com
