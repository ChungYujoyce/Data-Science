vermont sen bernie sanders one of the leading 2020 candidates has been off the trail for a week since he suffered a heart attack on oct 1 in his absence his campaign has been on autopilot they ve dispatched surrogates to early states on his behalf they ve rescheduled an ad buy in iowa that was postponed in the wake of the medical emergency they ve announced a new policy plan to get money out of politics they ve sent supporters to a climate strike with greta thunberg they pushed out the news that sanders plans to participate in the upcoming democratic primary debate was out the strategy is to show that this campaign continues to have momentum and energy and enthusiasm says rep ro khanna a national co chair to the sanders campaign sen sanders built the campaign khanna says explicitly on a premise that this is not about him that it s about all of us the plan now is for him to rest while the movement carries it forward but that plan is also a test sanders aides are declining to say when he will be back on the trail full time and with his return date uncertain and his poll numbers sagging a question hangs over the campaign how long can the 78 year old s movement maintain momentum without him sanders told reporters tuesday outside his home in burlington that whenever he does return he will have to change the nature of his campaign probably not doing four rallies a day sanders answered when a reporter asked him what he meant his allies are trying to put the best face on the situation khanna who was a surrogate for sanders in iowa over the weekend says that the events he attended there had high turnout partly i think people were coming out to show their support in light of what happened with sen sanders political watchers are turning their attention to next week s primary debate where the expectations for sanders are high if he doesn t show up at the debate next week and perform very well there s going to be a rising crescendo of people telling him to step down if only for health reasons said a longtime democratic strategist this is going to be nagging him sanders who is resting at home in burlington vt on tuesday morning told reporters outside of his home that in the past couple of months he d started feeling fatigued more than usual i must confess that i was dumb sanders said in a video by cnn i should have listened to those symptoms i should have listened to those symptoms so if there s any message that i hope we can get out there it s that i want people to pay attention to their symptoms it remains unclear when sanders will return to the trail outside of the campaign s commitment that he ll participate in the oct 15 debate asked if any decisions had been made on timing of his return or what other events sanders would participate in a campaign aide did not answer the question but sanders has some leeway by all measures he has established himself as a top tier candidate who is in the race for the long haul not only was he himself campaigning at a relentless pace prior to the heart attack but he consistently comes in the top three in polls raised the most money in the third fundraising quarter and has qualified for both the october and november primary debates despite being the oldest democratic candidate running sanders is often spotted playing sports while out on the trail or walking briskly around capitol hill people close to him have noted his personality does not mesh well with being sidelined this is everything he hates all at the same time a former aide to sanders 2016 campaign said noting that sanders personality likely has him wishing more attention would be paid to the policy rollout his campaign made monday morning rather than to his health and age of how this will affect voters perceptions of sanders the former aide who requested anonymity to speak candidly said my sense is most people don t really care because even if you re drawn to bernie you re not drawn to him because he gets on a skateboard my sense is it won t really bother his supporters the initial instinct in the campaign was to relay little information after they announced sanders had experienced chest discomfort and needed two stents inserted to address a blocked artery the campaign would not confirm details about the senator s well being while he was still in the hospital and did not say whether he d had a heart attack until after he d been dispatched days later but since his release sanders has been spotted multiple times out in public sanders tweeted a video of himself standing alongside his wife and close adviser jane sanders in las vegas after he d been released from the hospital on friday thanking well wishers reporters saw the couple taking a walk around their burlington neighborhood on monday in a video by cnn of the exchange he had with reporters sanders said he d be back on the trail soon i think over the next week or two people are going to be a little skittish about his health says patrick bourgeacq pinz n a staff member at drake university who endorsed sanders in august but as soon as they realize that he s just as or more energetic than he was before i m sure people will realize that this was nothing write to lissandra villa at lissandra villa time com
