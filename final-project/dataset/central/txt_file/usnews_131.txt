president donald trump sat down for an interview with time in the oval office on june 17 for a story on his re election campaign during the 57 minute conversation he discussed his democratic rivals his unusual approach to the 2020 campaign and his first term accomplishments as well as his thoughts on iran china and mexico and domestic issues like abortion and the economy read more fact checking time s oval office interview with donald trump at various points during the interview the president asked to go off the record and time is honoring those requests below is a lightly edited transcript of the interview between trump and time editor in chief and ceo edward felsenthal washington bureau chief massimo calabresi senior white house correspondent brian bennett and white house correspondent tessa berenson time i wanted to begin in the news iran overnight said it was considering enriching uranium at levels that would violate the 2015 nuclear agreement you ve been very clear that you won t let iran get a nuclear weapon trump yeah i think they d be making a big mistake doing that time are you considering more military action trump i wouldn t say that i can t say that at all it would be inappropriate but they would be making a big mistake if they enriched time are they calling your bluff on this or how do you see it trump time will tell only time will tell time i mean in your campaign you promised to get the u s out of unnecessary foreign wars with your trump that s true well i have we defeated isis the caliphate we ve taken back the caliphate that doesn t mean one of the crazies doesn t walk into a store all bombed up but we ve taken back 100 i wish i could show you the maps of what it was before and what it was after sarah maybe you could ask somebody to bring me those maps the isis when i got there and isis when i left right now there is no isis isis has the entire caliphate is down remember when it was 99 gone and i started moving people out they said he didn t finish the job anyway so time with this confrontation with iran i mean are you watching another trump well look i also said iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon you know which is very important as you know in afghanistan when i got there it was 16 000 people it s now 9 000 people and some good things are happening there frankly no i d like to get out of the middle east we should have never been in the middle east we should have never been there and i d like to get out time it does look as if you re getting drawn in rather than pulled out especially with regard to the tankers are you concerned about iran s attacks as trump well one of the things that seems to be rather ridiculous also shea do me a favor will you get the information i had yesterday the people that benefit from the straits the companies countries that benefit from the straits just i want to show you something china gets 60 of their oil there japan 25 of their oil so many of the other places get such vast amounts of oil there we get very little you know we have made tremendous progress in the last 2 1 2 years in energy and when the pipelines get built we re now an exporter of energy so we re not in the position that we were in that we used to be in in the middle east where we needed you know we were there some people would say we were there for the oil time so does that mean that strategically you would go to war over nuclear weapons but not over passage through the strait of hormuz trump well i wouldn t even want to say that but i would certainly go over nuclear weapons and i would keep the other a question mark shea ask them to bring in the documents i saw yesterday time how much of the challenge trump to an aide i m talking about through the straits the oil that comes in by country i had it yesterday who would have it maybe bolton would have it or somebody which is a pretty shocking thing you look at china it s a big beneficiary they don t pay anything japan is a big beneficiary they don t pay anything many other countries they don t pay anything indonesia many other countries come they don t pay anything and we re there keeping the world as you know we re there keeping the oil flowing right and the amazing thing is we re now an exporter so in theory we re a beneficiary of oil problems but i don t view it that way time do you believe the evidence the intelligence community is says that shows iran is launching attacks on oil tankers trump well i don t think too many people don t believe it i think people say they don t believe it because they don t want to get drawn in but they don t they don t uh they don t believe it time is it proving challenging it sounds as if from your description of the other countries as if you re finding it challenging to get other countries to help the u s apply pressure trump well we re just starting that process but other countries are a bigger beneficiary of that part of the world now than we are far bigger time do you think there s a credibility problem in trying to get them on board both because of iraq intelligence but also because of your own criticisms of the u s intelligence community over the years trump no i don t think we have any problems i have a good group of people now i have people that i want and we have some terrific people and no that s not a problem but what is a problem is that the united states takes care of the world and the world doesn t take care of the world the world doesn t want to take care of itself there are some countries as an example that benefit greatly and they re rich countries these are very rich countries in some cases and they don t make contributions and they haven t for many many years and at some point you know look i ve done a lot about that if you look at nato if you call up secretary general stoltenberg you ll see that he said over 100 billion has been contributed over the last very short period of time by other countries who were not living up to their 2 commitment and the 2 should be more than 2 by the way and over 100 billion has been paid and if you look at a chart of nato it s gone go back 15 years it s gone literally the contribution down here and then it went up like this when i became and i told them i said look the united states cannot continue to be i mean they re not paying they re literally not paying we re protecting nations and they re not paying and it was very unfair but secretary general stoltenberg was terrific he tells it like it is big difference time a criticism on the other side of that is that to use the word your critics use the confrontational approach to europe is now costing you in the attempt to put pressure on iran because they re less willing to believe you and feel less aligned trump no europe looks at me as a double i guess first of all my relationships with europe are very good you saw that with my recent trip to number of trips frankly but my recent trip with france where normandy was a tremendous and beautiful thing to behold it really was incredible but i have very good relationships in europe the prime minister of u k the queen of england we had a great time we had a great time we have very good relationships in europe i would say our relationships are far better now than under the obama administration but they respect us more because they got away with things that were very unfair like as an example europe the european nations if you look at what s happening on trade o k it was really unfair what s been happening on trade they we lost over the years on average 150 billion a year on trade with the european as a group the european nations it s very unfair then on top of it we protect them from nato in the form of nato and nato if you take a look at it nato probably a lot of people would dispute this number but we were paying 70 to 80 of nato that s unfair time so just continuing on this idea of america s role on the world stage what is your message to the demonstrators in hong kong right now trump well look my message is that they re obviously having a big impact because it s been pulled back and it will be pulled back further and i think that they ve been very effective in their dealings with china by the way i have a very good relationship with china just that they ve treated us unfairly with respect to trade for many years since the wto we ve been treated unfairly we ve helped create china i give them a lot of credit but we ve helped create china you look at what s happened over the last period of time and china wants to make a deal they actually had a deal with us we were very close to having a deal and then they pulled back on three major points that were just unacceptable to me so i m very happy now collecting 25 on 250 billion which is what we re doing but china wants to make a deal and i don t blame them because companies are leaving china by the hundreds because they don t want to pay the tariffs so china s going to want to make a deal time do you support the demands of the protesters against the extradition bill trump well i ll tell you what i m going to let the protesters speak for themselves i have our own argument with china and i think it s going to work out successfully but i m going to let china and the protesters work out their own problem it looks like it s going to be worked out time a lot of republicans were critical of president obama when he wasn t by their account sufficiently supportive of protesters in iran after the election in 2010 are you taking a similarly realpolitik view trump no i would view it differently i would view the iran situation differently i think that things could have happened that iran would have been a much different country today when i took over iran when i took over as president when i became president and then took over jan 20 iran was a much different country 2 1 2 years ago they were unbelievably hostile they were truly a nation of terror they were all over the place we had 14 points of confliction and they were behind every single one of them now it s a different country they have tremendous problems problems that nobody would have ever thought they had and that was not a time to make the deal the deal that president obama made that was a horrible deal so i terminated that deal did other things including sanctions and iran wants to make a deal also i will tell you right now they don t talk about it although sometimes they do but iran wants to make a deal and it s the smartest thing they could do is to make a deal time have you gotten any messages from iran trump president asks to go off the record trump look when i first one of the first meetings i had was with the pentagon and we were talking about the middle east which i was always against going in you know people always like to say oh maybe he was too i wasn t i was always i was against going into iraq it was a terrible going into the middle east was a terrible decision we re into the middle east for 7 trillion many lives and if you look at both sides you know unbelievable numbers of lives because i look at both sides i don t just look at the one side i look at both sides it was a terrible decision to go in it s quicksand always has been always will be and we re doing just fine we did isis we re doing fine in terms of afghanistan we re down to half we ll soon be down to about 8 000 soldiers time are you going into direct talks with iran and what would you ask for what do you want trump well you know i m open whenever they re ready let s see we have a long way to go before we get there but i m open when they re ready but if you remember sometimes it s hard to place yourself back in time but if you go back 2 1 2 years we had an absolute disaster going on it was iran was causing problems like nobody time but how do you explain the current attacks against shipping and as pompeo laid out allegedly trump well so far it s been very minor and so far if you look at the rhetoric now compared to the days when they were signing that agreement where it was always death to america death to america we will destroy america we will kill america i m not hearing that too much any more and i don t expect to by the way i don t expect to a lot difference rhetorically you understand time yes trump look at when they were signing the agreement they were all screaming death to america as they re signing the agreement what s that all about they picked up the seven sailors and the only reason the sailors the 10 sailors the only reason the sailors were let go is that we started making massive payments to them the following day otherwise the sailors would still be there under president obama time i want to talk about some of the big themes of your campaign i ve been to a lot of your rallies here are signs that say promises made promises kept at the current rate it s very unlikely that your wall will be built by the time election day comes around trump no we ll have we ll have over 400 we re building the wall right now people don t understand we are building the wall right now it is under major construction read more fact checking time s oval office interview with donald trump time there s 654 miles you have 61 miles trump well there s 550 miles 550 is max time of fencing and barriers trump and we will have over 450 miles built by the end of next year we re also renovating tremendous amounts of wall we re renovating and fixing we re putting areas that didn t have wall we re putting temporary walls in we re doing a great job and the job we did with mexico nobody could even believe time why are the numbers of people coming across now at a 13 year high then trump because they re trying to come in because the economy is so good we have 3 5 unemployment the economy is you could make the case it s never been stronger than it is now and the people are trying to come up for the economy they re not coming up for asylum they re coming up for money time either way i mean you can t expect us as a policy matter to make our economy bad to stop them from coming trump no no i m not going to make it bad i m just saying it wasn t good the economy wasn t very good and it was weak under president obama now it s the strongest economy we ve probably ever had time so how do you deliver on the promise trump even look at the first quarter we re at 3 2 nobody expected that they thought it would be one you know the first quarter is always very low we re at 3 2 the economy is so strong that people are coming up now what i did with mexico is mexico i don t know if you ve seen but the numbers are way down since they started last week and they haven t even they re putting their they re starting to move the 6 000 soldiers in tomorrow and i think they re working very hard president asks to go off the record time would you consider reinstating the family separation policy trump so let me tell you about that it s very interesting president obama had separation i m the one that brought it together i was the one and what that did is it made more people come up because i didn t like separation any more than you did but if you look at those cells where they were showing all these cells they looked like jail cells or cyclone fence but they look like jail cells they were built in 2014 by obama i think you people had one of those pictures actually you said look at these cells it turned out they were built by obama they were built by people that i know very well people that want to come into the administration but if you look at the separation policy i had that policy and then i m the one that put the families back together when you put the families back together you have more families come up it s a very simple time on your watch sir trump no but you understand what i m saying time yeah there were trump i inherited separation time on your watch there were families whose parents were separated from the children they were deported the children were left behind and the agencies trump well they had that under obama s watch too time and the agencies didn t keep good records and have had a hard time reuniting trump many of those records were obama records and they had separation and they had the exact same thing during the obama years the difference is because our economy is so strong more people came up plus they learned how weak our laws are now the laws hopefully are going to be changed but they learned how weak the laws are but you know if mexico does the job they have very strong policy they have very strong immigration policy if mexico does the job there should be very few people coming up through mexico and mexico can do the job and i believe they will do the job but if they don t do the job we re going to put tariffs on and they understand that and the tariffs are very significant time what other measures are you considering if the numbers continue to grow trump i don t think they will continue to grow i think they re starting to go down now time do you know how many immigrant kids were separated from their parents under your administration do you have a number trump well they have lists they have very accurate lists actually but you have to understand they were separated with president obama they were separated with president bush i didn t change the policy and the policy had been changed it was i m the one that ended separation just so we understand and when we ended separation and i was not surprised to see this more families came up because now they re not going to be separated read more fact checking time s oval office interview with donald trump time so would you consider reinstating the policy trump i don t know i don t like it i don t like the concept of separation i d rather keep them from coming up it would be a lot easier because i don t like it but i m it s crazy i got such a bad rap on that i inherited separation time but it was the enforcement trump you do know this right sarah sanders yes sir trump these were the laws president bush had them president obama had them i had them and when i had them everybody went wild about separation nobody talked about separation before but obama president obama is the one that built the jail cells as they called them and they said look at these cells isn t this terrible i said wait a minute and we didn t know that and then they stepped forward those pictures were perhaps in your magazine in 2014 that was long before i became president all of those cells were built in 2014 and before and they made it sound like i did it look just so we understand separation has been there for a long time when i got there i ended separation i knew what would happen more people would come up but i didn t like the concept of separation it was bad now what we re doing if this works with mexico there will be a trem look they re putting 6 000 soldiers on their southern border that s a game changer we are now bringing people back into mexico president asks to go off the record time it does feel to me a little bit mr president as if you feel you re vulnerable on immigration in 2020 trump no i don t i think i m good i think they re vulnerable no i think the democrats are totally vulnerable i think we re doing a great job on immigration time do you sense that your supporters who voted for you and heard about how you re going to crack down on immigration and reduce illegal flows are disappointed trump look i m building a wall despite the fact that the democrats don t want a wall built they have fought every we just won a lawsuit on the wall i don t know if you saw that a big one a very important one against nancy pelosi in the house they sued us and we won a lawsuit last week a very big one we re building a wall the wall is going up as we speak we ve already renovated vast amounts of wall taking inferior product and making it very good very strong we had walls we built walls in san diego time painting and barbed wire on many sections sir but trump no no we fixed walls and in some cases we have added massive amounts of barbed wire because the walls were not effective the way they were and we used the walls as a structure for the barbed wire and now that the barbed wire is up nobody is coming across they can t come across the walls have become very effective and they were very ineffective before you could climb them you can t climb them now but we re also building large numbers of new wall if you want i can get the army corps of engineers to tell you exactly what we re building but we re building we will have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year time the money isn t coming from congress trump and that s despite the no that s right that s despite we re taking some from the military we re taking some from the drug enforcement we re taking we have different pockets where we re taking it time on north korea sir the remains trump north korea time on north korea the remains have stopped coming back the pentagon is no longer in discussions with the north koreans about the remains trump but they will be look we ve gotten remains back that will start up again we have gotten our prisoners back we had four prisoners got them back president asks to go off the record trump we got our prisoners back we don t have nuclear testing we don t have any testing we don t have other than short range missiles which they did a couple of like every other countries test short term these were standard short term missiles there are no ballistic missiles being tested there s no nuclear tests and we have a very good relationship time are you in talks trump uh yeah will you show me that letter the birthday letter do you have it get it for me i ll show it to you time i want to jump one question back to trump yes please time one question back to the border and then we can go back to north korea or other topics just to point blank ask you because may was the highest number of immigrants coming across the border illegally in 13 years trump in 13 years time so we re trying to reconcile the promise of versus the reality trump o k here i ended separation which obama had which bush which everybody had i ended separation one thing but the biggest thing is the economy is so strong and the democrats the only reason we have this is because the democrats won t fix the loopholes the loopholes are terrible and they won t fix asylum we could have them fixed in 15 minutes but they refused to fix it the only reason we have a problem at the border and with that problem comes the fact that people learned about their legal rights on the border the democrats could fix the asylum problem and the loophole problem in 15 minutes if they did that everything would immediately stop the border would be 100 secure now when you add mexico to it and then you fix then you really have a great secure situation but i think mexico will solve most of the problem by itself but the democrats have to fix these asylum problems i mean we have asylum we have an asylum situation that is so ridiculous we re the only country in the world with the things that we have to do and the democrats could easily fix it but they want open borders which means crimes it means drugs time the promise was that mexico was going to pay for the wall president asks to go off the record trump this isn t over this is a negotiation don t underestimate the fact and the other thing is in the trade deal which assuming it gets approved mexico s paying hundreds of billions of dollars over a period of time more than they were paying previously i mean can that count for a wall that s a fraction of the numbers you re talking about you know in the u s m c a that deal is in other words that deal is much more lucrative for the united states than nafta here s the isis maps you probably have to look at them together so here i ll show you that s where i took over that was halfway through and this is like now or something yep time try to go in order here trump that would be pretty impressive i assume you want them i assume you re going to put that in your front page so this is isis time we ve run this graphic we ve run it practically every week mr president trump have you seen this no seriously time i have seen it yes trump but here you have nothing the caliphate is gone this doesn t mean you don t have crazy people around that you know and bombs i m not saying any fighting is finished because with these people you never know they re totally they re stone cold crazy but there s isis there it is a year later and there it is now not bad not bad not bad time jumping back to the campaign trump i hope you re going to write it do you want to keep them can we give them sanders yeah they can keep them trump do you want something to drink folks time sure thank you sir trump ok sanders we ve got a few more minutes trump that s all right let them have it if we do maybe i ll get my first good cover of time since i got elected the first story was great the first story when i won the election that was written by a gentleman with like a french name time michael scherer trump who time david von drehle trump no french is there like a french name read more the making of president donald trump time do you bet i have forgotten whether you bet or not trump do i bet time yeah trump my whole life is a bet time do you have a bet for who will be the democratic candidate trump well i don t have a bet i think that biden is not the same biden something s going on there o k i would say that probably a progressive wins look when a progressive gets out another progressive is going to take 100 of the vote so it s time meaning if bernie drops warren picks it up trump well yeah i think they pick up close to 100 i think they pick up much of that vote i think that harris has not surged as they say i think that bernie is going in the wrong direction i think biden is going in the wrong direction he s dropped a lot he s come down a lot if you look at our friend pocahontas she is doing pretty well she s doing pretty well they forgot that she s a fraud she s doing you know she s the one that s doing it seems the best in terms of that i don t believe mayor pete has a chance i never did i don t see it time why is that trump here s a letter o k now i m going to show you this letter so this was written by kim jong un it was delivered to me yesterday by hand president asks to go off the record time and why don t you think mayor pete has a chance while we look trump i just don t feel it time is there a candidate time it s all instinct when you get into politics politics is all instinct right time who do you think your toughest opponent would be sanders you can t take a picture of that sorry time ok trump what was that time so who do you think your toughest opponent would be in the general trump uh i don t know look i think i ve done so much could you bring the list of things please give me four of them i ve done more in 2 1 2 years than any president in the history of this country and when you look at the things i m going to give you a list nobody s approved what we ve approved nobody s gotten through whether it s the vets and choice and accountability both two things you could never get approved they could never get them approved you look at the tax cuts you look at anwr you look at the individual mandate i ve had a lot to do with healthcare you look at right to try add right to try with the individual mandate time what is the individual mandate trump the individual mandate of obamacare we ended it that s where you had to pay for time yeah right trump you had to pay not to pay for insurance to pay a fortune for the privilege of not paying one of the most unpopular part we ll get great healthcare after if we win back the house and keep the senate keep the presidency time here s a list we just made a this is relatively new right aide it s for today trump that s pretty new here s a list of the things each spot each line is another thing nobody has done this these are all between bills and things i d like you to keep it take a look time your own campaign polling is showing a disconnect people who are feeling the benefits of the economy but not giving you credit is there a way you trump i agree with that i don t think i think i m getting credit but i m not getting the full credit if the democrats had won the 2016 race instead of being up 3 1 i think it would be down 5 i think we would actually be down because what what i i had the largest cut in regulations in the history of the country in two years i cut more regulations than any other president no matter how long their term was that was a big factor in terms of what s happened with the country with the thing with the whole with the whole success that we ve had if the democrats got in they wouldn t have done that and they would have put more regulation on and you would have been in you would have seen a real mess here s that do you see what i m saying with that letter it s pretty good right i mean this is pretty good read more fact checking time s oval office interview with donald trump time at the same time that he s launching short range missiles trump short range extremely short range and no different than anyone else tests and launches et cetera can i have that letter back you have time we have the bullet points time going back to kind of a health care question do you support the alabama abortion law that was recently passed trump i i m i have the exceptions and i ve always been for the exceptions and i think that s very important time what about fetal heartbeat bills like in georgia which do have those exceptions trump we re studying it all i mean it s a very evolving topic but i am for exceptions time even when it bans at six weeks trump it has to be that way i have been very strong on that sanders guys we have time for maybe one or two more questions trump go ahead time i have some mueller questions sir your former chief of staff white house counsel deputy campaign chairman deputy national security advisor staff secretary communications director among others all testified under oath at risk of prison time that in the words of the mueller report you tried to influence and control the mueller investigation trump i don t think they did that time they did i can give you the citations sir i have them right here trump i don t think they i don t think they did that and frankly i could have ended that mueller immediately under article ii if i wanted to article ii we don t even talk about article ii because there s no reason to talk about it but i could have ended mueller immediately i could have done that i decided not to do that i had the power to do it if i wanted to do it so there has never been a president that s been as transparent as i ve been 1 5 million pages of documents i gave 300 or 500 people testified i allowed many people including white house counsel to testify hundreds of subpoenas in fact i think thousands of subpoenas i said i didn t exert presidential prerogative i didn t use presidential prerogative in any way shape or form time you did try to limit mueller s russia probe to only future election meddling why did you do that trump let me tell you this i could have ended the whole thing very quickly very easily i said let it play out and the bottom line was no collusion and subject to a review of the documents no obstruction by the attorney general after he reviewed the documents he found no obstruction that result has driven the democrats crazy crazy these people have gone absolutely insane time for the record sir the report does say this report does not exonerate you trump on obstruction you mean on a no crime you mean there was no crime so there was no crime taken and time everybody knows that you can obstruct justice without there being an underlying crime trump well here s what i don t i ll go a step further it was a crime committed by the other side not only was there no crime on my side and he found no collusion and he found no conspiracy right do you agree with that no conspiracy no collusion no nothing time but he found multiple examples of members of your staff interacting with the russians trump no and he also excuse me what did he say he said in fact there was pushback he said they pushed back our staff pushed back read more fact checking time s oval office interview with donald trump time some people did some people didn t but the point is mr president trump no no no he said there was pushback time the american people had a right to know what russia was trying to do to the core exercise of their democracy and that s what the russia probe was about you attempted to influence and control it trump president obama in september was told by the fbi about russia he did nothing hillary clinton went out and paid a man who went to russia and used russians and paid russians they did nothing a lot of the bloggers that you read about o k you read about these bloggers they were on hillary s side and trump s side the so called was it 24 numerous and you re talking about she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising and facebook and everything else time but didn t the american people trump they spent a tiny amount of money just so you understand and as the report makes very clear there was no collusion there was no conspiracy time but why would you try to limit the investigation only trump i didn t limit the investigation time you dictated a letter trump excuse me time to corey lewandowski telling him to tell former attorney general jeff sessions to limit the investigation to future russia meddling trump i could have told sessions myself if i wanted to under section ii time he testified under oath trump excuse me time under threat of prison time that that was the case mr president trump excuse me under section ii well you can go to prison instead because if you use if you use the photograph you took of the letter that i gave you time do you believe that people should be trump confidentially i didn t give it to you to take photographs of it so don t play that game with me let me just tell you something you take a look time i m sorry mr president were you threatening me with prison time trump well i told you the following i told you you can look at this off the record that doesn t mean you take out your camera and start taking pictures of it o k so i hope you don t have a picture of it i know you were very quick to pull it out even you were surprised to see that you can t do that stuff so go have fun with your story because i m sure it will be the 28th horrible story i have in time magazine because i never i mean ha it s incredible with all i ve done and the success i ve had the way that time magazine writes is absolutely incredible tell them five seconds read more the story behind president donald trump s 29th time cover aide o k trump with all i ve done with the tremendous success i ve had that time magazine writes about me the way they write is a disgrace o k let s face it it s a disgrace and some day within the next 20 years maybe you ll pick me as man of the year o k big deal but with all that we ve said now go back to the mueller report you have 18 people who hated donald trump who were angry democrats many of whom supported the democratic party financially right you have bob mueller who was conflicted totally conflicted you know my feeling on that comey was his friend i had a nasty business dispute with him when he was in private life a very nasty business dispute right you know about that right time if you want to provide us details trump no i don t want to provide you details there s no reason to what difference you won t write it the way it s proper anyway but i had a nasty business dispute with comey and you know the other disputes also we had and he sat see that chair you re in he was right in that chair wanting the job to be the fbi director and i said no o k that s a conflict of interest despite that he said no collusion first chapter no collusion no conspiracy push back push back so now they have a phony crime and they say i tried to obstruct a phony crime but you see but i didn t i didn t and more importantly under article ii i could have done whatever i wanted i could have fired mueller if i wanted but i didn t because if anybody checked out richard nixon that didn t work out so well alright but i could have i could have fired i had the right under article ii to fire robert but i didn t and i didn t want to i figured let him finish his report let s see the report came out no collusion collusion being the biggest thing meaning conspiracy or whatever they want to call it and the report was very clear on that and remember take a look there was actually in fact push back do you agree with that sarah they actually had push back from our people not only didn t they accept but there was push back and then phase two they set up a crime what about hillary clinton s 33 000 emails what about the fact that she paid christopher steele for a fake phony dossier tremendous amounts of money her and the dnc if you guys wrote the real story you d end up doing very well you d end up with pulitzer prizes i ll tell you there are people that should get pulitzer prizes but they aren t the ones that got em the ones that got em should hand em back because they called this thing very wrong sanders maybe one last question and we ll wrap here time a campaign related one time what are the new goals you want to take up in your second term trump so we re rebuilding the military which is creating jobs we re doing some really good things in health care we re doing some tremendous things in health care you see what s happening with some of the policies that we re coming out with we got rid of as i said we got rid of the individual mandate which was by far the most popular thing in obamacare we re managing obamacare much better but obamacare is a very it s very bad and if we win i will do healthcare if we get the house if we get back the house you can t do it without the house if we get the house we get the senate we get the presidency we will have a great health care plan we will have tremendous healthcare but we re doing a good job on that anyway doing a very good job our military is strong we are withdrawing if you look from the middle east end we may have a problem with iran that could happen a thing like that could happen absolutely but it could also be that things work out if iran does the right thing it would be a very good thing for iran but i don t know that they ll do the right thing i have a feeling they probably will time your ability to be in the middle of the news is seen as a big asset for the campaign they are running facebook ads whenever you have a big news cycle they will generate trump right right time like when you said you were going to close the deal with mexico are you able to coordinate have you been talking with the campaign about what issues resonate trump sure i am we all have our meetings but i generally do my own thing like for instance they had the stephanopoulos interview and i said you know let me watch this and then it said both things did you see that where i said yeah i d do both i said where s the dispute here where s the dispute it was made up by the fake news media i said i ll do both then i also said i would report them i m not talking about the fox friends a day later i m talking about just if you go by that interview but for the most part they didn t put the i ll do i d do both i said yeah i d do both nobody wanted to hear that time what would you do if a foreign power launched a propaganda effort to halt a democratic opponent trump well i ve said you know what i ve answered it so many different ways i answered it in stephanopoulos i answered the same question on fox but number one i don t think they d do it with me because they know i love the country time we were asking about if there were an effort to help an opponent the democrat trump you mean if they helped the opponent time yeah trump look if this was reversed where the republicans did this to a democrat every one of them would be in jail for years already o k if they did if this was reversed where i did to them what they did to me the repercussions would be enormous the press is protecting the dnc the democrats crooked hillary they re totally protected by the press they re partners let s face it they re partners look at time magazine i read a couple of stories in time magazine that were so bad it was unbelievable it was unbelievable president asks to go off the record trump bad coverage though i should get good coverage i built one of the strongest economies i built probably the strongest economy certainly one of them but the strongest i mean you could go by many go by unemployment african americans asians hispanics the strongest they ve ever had more people working today almost 160 million by far more than we ve ever had working you know you could make the case this is the greatest economy we ve ever had i built that if hillary would have gotten in it would have been decimated instead of being at 3 2 we d be at minus 5 or minus 6 it was going bad if you look at the numbers from the end of the obama it was crashing it was crashing and here s the good news we have tremendous potential maybe it depends to a certain extent on what happens with some trade deals but we ve already done the deal with north korea it s totally done it s really good i took a bad deal i terminated it and i made it a good deal got the 25 on trucks on small trucks et cetera et cetera which was terminated which is frankly very interesting you ought to look at this sometime the chicken tax it s the most successful vehicle built in the automobile industry in america today i was able to do it but we did the deal korus you know the deal with north korea the deal with south korea we did pretty much everything i ve set out to do is either done or on its way to being done now when you look at that list and you go point by point by point by point you say does this gentleman ever take it easy time there are some political analysts looking at the 2020 election who say your strategy of focusing on base issues makes sense given your politics there are others who say broadening it to try and reach some of the voters who you didn t get last time and some who you need to try and keep from last time is important do you have a strategy to reach out beyond your base trump i d love to broaden it i think i have one of the greatest you know there are those who say i have the greatest base in the history of american politics because it always stays at 45 46 47 i mean it s been today it s at 51 wasn t rasmussen 51 51 and i ll tell you you know rasmussen you know it s respected they got the election the best that s why i say rasmussen because they got the election the most right los angeles times rasmussen and i think it was business insider believe it or not three polls got it very good but rasmussen was good that s at 51 but i have a base of 45 46 that is a phenomenal base trump to aide i ve got it thanks i got it trump i have a base that s a phenomenal it s just a phenomenal base it s a very loyal base and i m loyal to them also with that being said the thing that i have that s different because based on the economy i should be up 15 or 20 points higher it should be just based on the economy you know it s the economy stupid right based on the economy i should be at much higher numbers than i am and the thing that i have that nobody s ever had before from the day i came down the escalator i have had a phony witch hunt against me and not long after that day you understand from the day and you look at the insurance policy by crooked fbi agents where they talked about the insurance policy just in case hillary clinton should lose the insurance policy we lived the insurance policy if that s what it was this was spying on a campaign this was what happened to me as president should never happen to another president again and i m honored to have gone through it there are those that say that very few people that they know could have taken it i spoke with lindsey graham he said you know what there s not a person i know in the world that could have taken what you ve taken and you ve come out stronger for it but i really believe that there are very few people who could have taken it from day one it s been a phony witch hunt with a phony dossier with phony fisa court the whole thing was a phony deal it was a fraud it was a woman that deleted 33 000 emails after getting a subpoena from congress and she had no problem doing it if i ever deleted one email if i did one email and deleted it i d have nothing but serious serious problems it is a partnership between the media and the democratic party and it s a shame it s really a shame nobody s gone through and nobody has been treated as unfairly as donald trump and almost everybody admits that time in your estimation that s costing you 15 points trump i think it s cost me yeah and it s phony and i think that will turn around because it s been proven to be phony the whole thing impeachment impeachment for what nothing was done wrong impeachment for what there was no collusion nothing was done wrong you know there are those that say alan dershowitz wrote a piece the other day that it s illegal to impeach him there s nothing done wrong you can t impeach time do you think impeachment would actually help you as pelosi clearly worries trump it might i mean a lot of people say it would most people say it would i don t know i really don t know but i think it s inappropriate when somebody wins the only thing i did wrong was winning an election by winning an election i made them so angry i ll tell you what winning an election and building a great economy and by the way doing all those things on the pages that i gave you i mean it s just it s so many different things and nobody ever thought even anwr so anwr is among the biggest oil finds in the world in alaska ronald reagan tried to get it approved everybody tried to get it approved nobody got it approved i got it approved they are starting anwr shortly i got anwr approved it s as big as saudi arabia they say in alaska i got it approved nobody else got it approved ronald reagan tried couldn t do it bush tried everybody presidents even democratic presidents tried they couldn t get it approved i got it approved so the only thing i m guilty of is that i happened to win an election that some people thought i shouldn t have won look we re going i don t know if anybody s going tomorrow but i m going to an event tomorrow where we have 116 000 people sanders i think it s closer to 120 now trump 120 000 people have requested tickets we have the big orlando basketball arena with the floor it holds 25 000 people it sold out in the first day it sold out in the first hour and we have 120 000 people i went to texas to help ted cruz we had 106 000 people we had to take ads asking people not to come tomorrow what we did is we put big screens up television screens because the arena is so these are big arenas this is the size of madison square garden i think it s slightly larger it s where the orlando magic plays it is packed we ll have thousands and thousands of people outside o k that s one now joe biden sleepy joe he goes to a high school gymnasium that holds 300 people and they can t get 88 people or he has 88 people show up i don t get it where s the magic where s the magic so we re going to have 25 000 people tomorrow we re going to have 120 000 requests for seats many of those people you ll probably have 20 30 000 people outside the arena and biden goes he can t fill up 100 seats so i think we re going to do very well time where will you spend most of your time campaigning in the next few months what states trump well look it starts as of tomorrow but for the first eight or nine months it ll be very much more limited probably one rally every two three weeks and then it will get tighter and then you know i did six or seven a day toward the end of the campaign that was one thing i never i went to michigan we had 32 000 people that final night right hillary was there the day of the day i was there i actually bled into the election day i started speaking at 1 o clock in the morning we had 32 000 people she got there four hours earlier which is primetime she had 500 people show up and then i said why am i going to lose michigan and i didn t you know i didn t so we have a lot of things going and i ll tell you one interesting thing you may focus on the witch hunt has made our base stronger it s made our people more resilient and the witch hunt has done a lot of things it s told it s told the story of the dishonesty and a lot of the problems you know the swamp all of the things that we ve talked about but i think we have more energy than the democrats do by far you don t hear that as much i have never seen energy like i see right now time well traditionally you have no opponent the democrats each have 22 you could reach out some beyond the base and maybe get more credit for that economy trump that might happen no it might happen but i think my base is so strong i m not sure that i have to do that but i d like to do it just as president i d like to do it not for political reasons i d like to do it as president the russian hoax that they ve put us through has hurt our country and it s made our country much more divided than it should have been if i didn t have that situation happen which is totally and by the way now we ve been exonerated by the mueller report again these are people that hated donald trump how do you pick all people who are opposed to me and i still got a great report had we not had that the country would have been much more united than it is that was a very bad thing for the country what they did with the phony witch hunt was a very bad thing and it s bad now what they re doing you know when they try to keep they want a do over the mueller report was a disaster for the democrats they want a do over time it does sound as if you re wrestling still with it that it s very much something that you feel is a political liability or that is something that it s trump no i think it s turned out to be an asset because it s really energized our base like i ve never seen before time we learned a lot of detail about how russia is trying to make contacts with your campaign sanders we re going to have to interrupt here time we learned a lot of detail about how russia was trying to make contact with people around you trump yeah but they do with every maybe they do and by the way i would be surprised if it was only russia time going forward are you ready to do things to prevent that trump i know but i would be surprised if it s not china and if it s not other countries i think it s much more time so how do we protect against that if we don t learn the lessons of the past trump oh we do well we ve done things that obama didn t do when the fbi went to obama in september and they told him about this he did nothing because he thought hillary clinton was going to win and he didn t want to rock the boat read more fact checking time s oval office interview with donald trump time famously dianne feinstein brought a stack of time magazines with putin on the cover and dropped them on mcdonough s desk in october 2016 to say that something was happening and more needed to be done so you won t read more how russia wants to undermine the u s election trump thank you time so you won t find disagreement with that trump no good thank you but the truth is obama whatever was going on obama knew about it long before i ever heard about it and he didn t do anything about it and then his statement to the president of russia about hey i ll see vladimir after the election is over look folks it s been a very unfair period of time but we ve gone through it and we ll do very well i think we re going to do very well in the election i think we re going to have a big success and if i win it again i might even make the time magazine cover again maybe i doubt it but maybe you know read more the story behind president donald trump s 29th time cover time so you have a good shot this thursday for a start time we come out on thursday trump oh do you come out on thursday time yeah president asks to go off the record trump anyway thank you all very much time
