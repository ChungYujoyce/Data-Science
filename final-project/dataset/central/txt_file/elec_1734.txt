 oct 16 2019 at 3 32 pm by laura bronner and maddie sach filed under 2020 election last night 12 candidates duked it out in westerville ohio in the fourth democratic debate sen elizabeth warren built on her past debate successes receiving high marks from both voters who care more about defeating president trump and voters who care more about a candidate whose positions they agree with but she was not the only winner in the fivethirtyeight ipsos poll conducted using ipsos s knowledgepanel mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana and sen amy klobuchar had strong performances too and used the debate as an opportunity to push back on whether warren and sen bernie sanders s progressive policies are realistic we will be keeping an eye on the polls to see if warren s solid performance will help her pull ahead of former vice president joe biden or if buttigieg and klobuchar will manage to shore up more support but for now here s a look at how the candidates performed summed up in six charts first we wanted to see which candidates impressed the viewers we surveyed to do this we compared each candidate s pre debate favorability1 to debate watchers rating of their performance to see if any well liked candidates disappointed during the debate or if any less liked candidates received good ratings by this metric klobuchar and buttigieg were the two candidates who exceeded expectations given their pre debate favorables though warren still received the highest debate grade overall in our poll about two thirds of democratic voters said they value a candidate who has a good chance of beating trump over someone who agrees with them on the issues and that didn t change after the debate so with electability central to the election thus far we wanted to see whether there was a difference in debate performance evaluations from respondents who said they cared about electability and respondents who said they cared about issues differences were small but there are a few things that stand out first even though warren has pitched herself as the issues candidate and she did do well among voters who care about the issues her performance also appealed to respondents who said they prioritized defeating trump in fact they rated her performance higher than that of any other candidate sanders also got high ratings from both voters who care more about defeating trump and voters who care more about the issues which means candidates making more issued based appeals can still do well among voters who care about defeating trump but it s a tricky balance buttigieg and biden for instance did not do quite as well among voters who cared about the issues but they did almost as well as warren among voters who care about beating trump how well debate watchers thought candidates performed in the fourth democratic debate by which type of candidate they prefer from a survey of 3 360 likely democratic primary voters who were surveyed between oct 7 and oct 14 the same people were surveyed again from oct 15 to oct 16 712 responded to the second wave and said that they watched the debate source ipsos fivethirtyeight we also wanted to see how viewers opinions of the candidates changed as a result of the debate so to see who made a positive or negative impression we calculated the candidates net favorability favorable rating minus unfavorable rating before and after the debate although both buttigieg and klobuchar were on the attack their net favorability increased by 2 6 points and 3 2 points respectively that said even with her modest bump klobuchar is still not viewed as favorably as candidates like buttigieg sen cory booker and sen kamala harris and not every candidate made a positive impression former rep beto o rourke lost the gains he made in the last debate and rep tulsi gabbard s return to the stage did not impress viewers either change in net favorability for candidates in a fivethirtyeight ipsos poll taken before and after the fourth democratic primary debate from a survey of 3 360 likely democratic primary voters who were surveyed between oct 7 and oct 14 the same people were surveyed again from oct 15 to oct 16 1 761 responded to the second wave warren got her first taste of being the race s front runner and spent much of the debate deflecting other candidates attacks she spoke almost 3 700 words more than any other candidate and 600 words more than the second most prolific talker biden this is a notable change from the september debate when warren was third in words spoken behind both biden and booker impressively o rourke and klobuchar who were both near the bottom for words spoken in the last debate clocked in at third and fourth in words spoken respectively they surpassed booker who after being second in words spoken last time spoke the fifth most words last night number of words candidates spoke in the fourth democratic debate source debate transcript via abc news we also compared the number of words candidates spoke to their polling average to see if higher polling candidates spoke as much as expected or if lower tier candidates managed to steal the mic the polling average is based on nine debate qualifying polls released since the third debate on sept 12 o rourke and klobuchar way outspoke their lower polling averages warren buttigieg and harris also outperformed their averages but not by as large of a margin on the other hand sanders and biden held the floor less than we might expect considering their standing in the polls in addition to tracking who spoke most we also counted how many times the candidates mentioned the president by name how often trump s name was mentioned by candidates in the fourth democratic debate source debate transcript via abc news as a group the candidates mentioned trump s name almost twice as often as in the previous debate perhaps because the first question asked about impeaching the president once again though harris mentioned trump the most candidates who barely mentioned the president by name in the last debate like klobuchar 0 buttigieg 1 and andrew yang 2 name dropped trump more often too trailing only harris in number of mentions after saying trump s name the second most number of times in the previous debate former cabinet secretary juli n castro dropped to the bottom of the group the candidates who held the floor the longest such as warren biden and o rourke didn t mention trump as much as the other candidates who spoke less while the september debate the first one night event was watched by about 15 3 million viewers preliminary ratings indicate that this debate drew just over half of that a mere 8 3 million people despite featuring two more candidates interest may be dropping but the debates will go on the next debate is scheduled for nov 20 and so far eight candidates have qualified we will be here live blogging and analyzing the debate so stay tuned pre debate favorability was calculated by assigning a 0 to 100 score to each respondent s answer to the favorability question where very favorable is equal to 100 somewhat favorable is equal to 75 heard of no opinion is equal to 50 somewhat unfavorable is equal to 25 and very unfavorable is equal to zero scores were then averaged to create an overall favorability index for each candidate respondents who hadn t heard of the candidate were
