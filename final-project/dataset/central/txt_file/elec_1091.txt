the candidates flubbed claims on vaccines immigration hillary clinton and more by factcheck org posted on september 17 2015 the republican presidential candidates met for their second debate on sept 16 this one hosted by cnn at the ronald reagan presidential library and museum in california we found they strayed from the facts on numerousissues including several candidates made false or misleading statements about vaccines donald trump told a brief story linking vaccination to autism but there is no evidence that recommended vaccines cause autism trump just the other day 2years old 2and a half years old a child a beautiful child went to have the vaccine and came back and a week later got a tremendous fever got very very sick now is autistic the fact is the link between childhood vaccinations and autism has no scientific basis a point that was made by one of trump s rivals dr ben carson who said there have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism a link was first suggested by a paper published in 1998 in the journalthe lancetandretracted in 2010 its author andrew wakefield had his medical license in the united kingdom stripped in fact an investigation by thebritish medical journal found that wakefield perpetrated an elaborate fraud many studies have since examined a potential link between the measles mumps rubella vaccine on which wakefield s paper focused and found no such connection in 2011 theinstitute of medicine released a report summarizing vaccine safety in general and found sufficient evidence to reject the link between the mmr vaccine and autism trump began his point by saying that a utism has become an epidemic though diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders has indeed risen recent research has pinned the blame for this on changes to diagnostic and reporting criteria and not to vaccines or any other medical therapy we covered related vaccine issuesin february when sen rand paul claimed that he had heard of many children that developed profound mental disorders after receiving vaccinations paul a physician by training again erred on vaccine science during the debate paul trump and carson said that vaccines should be spread out more or that parents should have a choice to do so suggesting it would be safer paul so i m all for vaccines but i m also for freedom i m also a little concerned about how they re bunched up my kids had all of their vaccines and even if the science doesn t say bunching them up is a problem i ought to have the right to spread out my vaccines out a little bit at the very least paul is right that the science doesn t say this is an issue there is no evidence that thevaccine schedule recommended by the centers for disease control and prevention actually raises risk of any complications earlier this year university of california professor of pediatrics and vaccine expert james cherry told us this idea of spreading out vaccines is stupid t hat will allow these illnesses to occur several studies have addressed this issue one found that there is no increased risk of autismspectrum disorders with increasing exposure to the compounds in vaccines another found that there were no adverse neuropsychological effects in children who were vaccinated according to the cdc schedule and in fact those who had delayed vaccinations performed worse on some measures another similarly found that delaying the mmr vaccineincreasedthe risk of seizures in a spirited back and forth between former florida gov jeb bush and trump bush claimed that trump donated generously to his campaign for governor in order to get bush to change his mind about casino gambling in florida trump did not contest that he had raised money for bush but denied that he ever tried to get casino gambling in florida a former state senate president once testified that trump did the one guy that had some special interests that i know of that tried to get me to change my views on something that was generous and gave me money was donald trump bush said in the debate he wanted casino gambling in florida i didn t trump said yes you did bush said totally false trump said you wanted it and you didn t get it because i was opposed to casino gambling before during and after bush said and that s not i m not going to be bought by anybody had he wanted it trump said i promise i would have gotten it bush reiterated the point moments later saying when he asked florida to have casino gambling we said no wrong trump interjected we said no and that s the simple fact the simple fact is bush said don t make things up jeb don t make things up come on trump said despite trump s protestations cnn reported on sept 1 that in the late 1990s trump had hoped to build a multimillion dollar casino with the seminole tribe of florida in 2005 bloomberg business reported that a former state senate president mallory e horne was hired by trump to lobby to increase the types of gambling allowed in the state something bush opposed in a court affidavit obtained by bloomberg horne testified that after bush s election in 1998 he told trump that state officials wouldn t budge on the issue and trump replied that s the end of it cnn noted that trump hosted a fundraiser for bush s gubernatorial campaign in 1997 and that he donated 50 000 to the florida republican party in 1998 all at the time trump was pursuing the casino project cnn added however that it was not clear that trump s political contributions were aimed at needling bush and republican lawmakers toward a more flexible posture toward the gaming industry and a bush aide told cnn that trump did not personally lobby bush on the gambling issue so whether trump s fundraising efforts were an attempt to change bush s mind on casino gambling cannot be settled definitively but trump s denial that he was ever interested in bringing casino gambling to florida is contradicted in a legal affidavit by a former senate president who says he was hired by trump to do just that at the outset of the debate former arkansas gov mike huckabee made an inaccurate remark about an ongoing investigation into hillary clinton s personal server and her use of a personal email account while secretary of state huckabee made his comment while favorably comparing the republican candidates to the top two candidates for the democratic nomination clinton and sen bernie sanders huckabee none of us are a self professed socialist none of us on this stage are under investigation by the fbi because we destroyed government records or because we leaked secrets clinton is not being investigated because she destroyed government records as we have written clinton had more than 60 000 emails on her personal server and she determined about half of them were work related so she turned them over to the state department at the department s request she deleted the rest which she described as personal but the justice department said in a recent court filing that she had the authority to delete personal emails in a sept 11 story the new york times quoted from the court filing there is no question that former secretary clinton had authority to delete personal emails without agency supervision she appropriately could have done so even if she were working on a government server the filing said under policies issued both by the national archives and records administration and the state department individual officers and employees are permitted and expected to exercise judgment to determine what constitutes a federal record huckabee is referring to a security referral that was made to the justice department by i charles mccullough iii the inspector general for the intelligence community after he discovered that some of clinton s emails contained unmarked classified material the inspector general stressed that it was not a criminal referral the referral was made to determine if there were any potential compromises of national security information mccullough said trump twice made an unsupported claim that the cost of unauthorized immigration is 200 billion annually trump i will say this illegal immigration is costing us more than 200 billion a year just to maintain what we have and again a few minutes later trump as i said we are spending 200 billion we are spending 200 billion a year on maintaining what we have we cannot find any support for trump s claim quite the opposite it could cost taxpayers 137 billion or more to do what trump proposes deport all of the estimated 11 million immigrants who are currently in the u s illegally based on the current 12 500 cost of deporting a single individual back in 2009 we debunked a false but widely circulated chain email claiming that those here illegally cost exactly 338 3 billion annually that was clearly wrong the cited numbers didn t even add up to the claimed total the most extreme estimate we found was a 2010 study by the federation for american immigration reform which lobbies for less immigration it estimatedthat the net cost of illegal immigration on the federal and state and local levels was 99 billion a year half the sum trump claimed a more neutral source is a 2007 report by the nonpartisan congressional budget office which examined 29 reports on state and local costs published over 15 years andconcluded that while it is difficult to obtain precise estimates of the net impact of the unauthorized population on state and local budgets the impact is most likely modest cbo didn t put a number on such costs nationwide saying no agreement exists as to the size of or even the best way of measuring that cost on a national level and it should be noted that these areestimates for costs of keeping the status quo granting legal status to immigrants living in the u s illegally potentially would bring some benefits to the economy such as increasing the workforce and the number of taxpayers in 2013 the cbo estimated that a bipartisan bill to do just that for many who lack legal status which passed the senate by a vote of 68 to 32 only to die in the house would have boosted economic output by 3 3 percent in 2023 and by 5 4 percent in 2033 compared with current projections taking that into consideration cbo estimated that the legislation would decrease federal budget deficits by 197 billion over the 2014 2023 period and by roughly 700 billion over the 2024 2033 period that s the opposite of what trump claimed asked about his opposition to birthright citizenship donald trump repeated the incorrect assertion that mexico does not have such a policy it does trump also said almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn t have a birthright citizenship policy while the majority of countries do not have such a policy at least 30 of them do including canada and a number of other countries in central and south america trump argued that the 14th amendment which holds that all persons born or naturalized in the united states and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the united states and of the state wherein they reside does not guarantee birthright citizenship to immigrants in the country illegally and by the way mexico and almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn t have that trump said referring to birthright citizenship we re the only ones dumb enough stupid enough to have it as we noted when trump made a similar claim at a rally in alabama in august the u s and mexico use different terminologies but the two countries policies are actually very similar according to article 30 of the mexican constitution the mexican nationality is acquired by birth if someone is born within mexican territory whatever their parents nationality might be technically according to the mexican constitution people don t become citizens of mexico until they turn 18 at which point they can vote be elected to public office and join the military that s true even of babies born in mexico to mexican parents as for trump s claim that almost every other country anywhere in the world doesn t have a birthright citizenship policy it s true that america s policy is in the minority in the international community according to a 2010 analysis by the center for immigration studies a think tank that advocates for lower immigration at least 30 of the world s 194 countries grant automatic birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants in the country illegally the u s and canada are the only ones among those 30 countries that have advanced economies as defined by the international monetary fund outside north america most of the 30 countries that have birthright citizenship policies are in central and south america no country in europe has such a policy carly fiorina spoke out against planned parenthood regarding the controversial videos released over the last few months the scene she described though does not exist in any of the videos fiorina i dare hillary clinton barack obama to watch these tapes watch a fully formed fetus on the table its heart beating its legs kicking while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain we are aware of no video showing such a scene the videos released by the center for medical progress beginning on july 14 have focused on fetal tissue being collected for research and have shown some aborted fetal tissue as we wrote before the use of donated fetal tissue has been important in several areas of scientific research fiorina s descriptionmatches up with one of the videosin a series the center for medical progress has called human capital but only with regard to how an interviewee describes her experience holly o donnell an ex procurement technician for stemexpress a company that procures fetal tissue from planned parenthood clinics relates a story of an intact fetus she says that a planned parenthood doctor taps the heart and it starts beating and then instructs her to remove its brain for collection the video does contain images of what appear to be intact fetuses but they don t fitfiorina s description in one where a fetus does appear to move there is a caption saying that the footage is from the pro lifegrantham collection and center for bio ethical reform there is no indication as to where the footage was shot in the other it was revealed after the video s release that the image was of a stillborn baby rather than an aborted fetus though we cannot verify if partor all of o donnell s story is true thescene fiorina dares others to watch is not present in any of the planned parenthood videos trump boasted at one point that he is number one in every polls sic by a lot not in every poll at least not lately trump has held a double digit lead in the national polls for several weeks but a cbs news new york times poll released sept 15 shows trump and carson are in a virtual tie trump leads carson by 4percentage points 27 to 23 but that is within the margin of error also carson pulled even with trump in iowa according to a monmouth university poll released aug 31 in a sharp exchange between trump and wisconsin gov scott walker the billionaire businessman falsely claimed that wisconsin under walker has a huge budget deficit trump so look we brought it out you were supposed to make a billion dollars in the state you lost 2 2 you have right now a huge budget deficit that s not a democratic point that s a point that s a fact that is not a fact as we have written before wisconsin had a projected 2 2 billion shortfall based on budget requests submitted by state agencies but those budget requests were pared back and walker signed a two year balanced budget into law on july 12 wisconsin like most states requires that the governor submit and the legislature pass a balanced budget carly fiorina repeated one of her standard talking points about her rocky tenure as ceo of hewlett packard fiorina who was fired in 2005 after nearly six years as head of the company said w e doubled the size of the company we quadrupled its topline growth rate we quadrupled its cash flow we tripled its rate of innovation sheneglects to mention that the increase in revenue or size came after hp acquired compaq and was accompanied by a decrease in net earnings and she uses a different time frame to come up with a quadrupling of the growth rate and cash flow we wrote about these claims in may fiorina compares the fiscal 1999 revenue of 42 4 billion with the fiscal 2005 revenue of 86 7 billion though fiscal 2004 80 billion would better align with fiorina s time at the company that s close to a doubling but a controversial merger with compaq in may 2002 was a major reason for the increase hp s revenue in 2001 was 45 2 billion and compaq s was 33 6billion in the first full fiscal year after the merger 2003 hp s revenuetotaled 73 billion it s worth noting that while revenues doubled net earnings declined over fiorina s time at hp from 3 1 billion in 1999 to 2 4 billion in 2005 the same time period fiorina used for her claim on revenues fiorina has repeatedly touted aquadrupling ofthe growth rate specifically saying in the past that it went from 2 percent to 9 percent she s talking about revenue but instead of using fiscal 1999 and 2005 as she does for the size of the company her super pac told us it compared the second quarter of 1999 to all of 2005 using the same comparison as fiorina s doubled claim we see the growth didn t come anywhere close to quadrupling instead it went from 7 5 percent in 1999 to 8 5 percent in 2005 plus the revenue growth in 2005 was only 6 percent on a constant currency basis which is an adjustment due to foreign currency fluctuations over her six years revenue growth year to year fluctuated significantly fiorina again uses a different time frame to claim a quadrupling of cash flow her super pac told us she was comparingcash and short term investments from oct 31 1998 to oct 31 2005 but the figures increased by 150 percent more than a doubling if we use 1999 as the starting point as she did for her doubled revenue claim finally fiorina said hp tripled its rate ofinnovation and there s support for that in terms of the rate ofobtaining patents in 1999 compared with 2004 but the compaq merger again had an impact on that as it did for other financial indicators florida sen marco rubio said that u s policies to combat climate change would do absolutely nothing though the u s acting alone would have a relatively small effect on rising temperatures and sea levels rubio went too far rubio we are not going to make america a harder place to create jobs in order to pursue policies that will do absolutely nothing nothing to change our climate to change our weather because america is a lot of things the greatest country in the world absolutely but america is not a planet rubio is correct that america is not a planet of course but that does not mean that policies at the national level will have absolutely no effect on the climate when we covered this issue in january an expert told us that u s emissions alone if left unchanged would cause about half a degree celsius of warming by the end of the century efforts to cut these emissions including the recently released clean power plan which would limit emissions from power plants and other policies such as fuel efficiency standards will have a small but non zero effect on that temperature change and related sea level rise furthermore many experts say that u s leadership on climate is important in convincing other nations to also cut their carbon pollution in both senses rubio is wrong that cutting emissions will do absolutely nothing to fight climate change we found some missteps among the four republican presidential candidates who didn t make the cut for the prime time debate and insteadparticipated in the so called happy hour debate by eugene
