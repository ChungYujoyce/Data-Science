presidential election libya had planned to hold elections this year as part of a un sponsored roadmap to heal divisions that have plagued the country since the 2011 nato backed revolt that ended moammar al qaddafi s four decade rule that initiative has been upended since eastern based commander khalifa haftar launched a military assault to capture tripoli in april haftar himself has presidential ambitions and is fighting to seize the capital from the united nations backed government led by prime minister fayez al sarraj which carried out the arrests the offensive has descended into a proxy war with each side accusing the other of inviting foreign interference haftar is supported by the u a e and egypt and had received russian assistance though russia has also tried to cultivate other partners in libya including saif al islam as it looks to expand its role in north africa and build its geopolitical might saif al islam s aides have previously said he had the clout to rally disparate libyan tribes with a promise to restore stability others say his influence is over stated in a country where the rebels and dissidents who ousted his father now vie for power russia is
