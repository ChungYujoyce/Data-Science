it has been widely acknowledged that upon swearing the oath of office president donald trump would be in direct violation of the foreign emoluments clause of the u s constitution never heard of the foreign emoluments clause you re not alone it s tucked away in article i section 9 of the constitution it s clause number 8 it states in pertinent part no person holding any office of profit or trust under the united states shall without the consent of the congress accept of any present emolument office or title of any kind whatever from any king prince or foreign state this clause was included in the articles of confederation and later in the constitution itself it was borne out of the framers obsession with preventing in the newly minted united states the sort of corruption that dominated 17th and 18th century foreign politics and governments characterized by gift giving back scratching foreign interference in other countries and transactions that might not lead to corruption but nonetheless could give the appearance of impropriety where trump runs afoul of the foreign emoluments clause is that first and foremost he is a businessman with significant financial interests and governmental entanglements all over the globe indeed as norman eisen richard painter and laurence tribe stated at the brookings institution never in american history has a president presented more conflict of interest questions and foreign entanglements than donald trump moreover trump s businesses dealings are veiled in complicated corporate technicalities and lack transparency the trump organization does or has done business in argentina azerbaijan bermuda brazil canada china egypt georgia india indonesia ireland israel panama philippines qatar russia saudi arabia south korea st martin st vincent turkey united arab emirates united kingdom and uruguay and while serving as president trump through his interest in the trump organization will continue to receive monetary and other benefits from these foreign powers and their agents examples of existing business arrangements that constitute violations of the foreign emoluments clause include china s state owned industrial and commercial bank of china is the largest tenant in trump tower and the state owned bank of china is a major lender to trump trump s business partner in trump tower century city in manila philippines is century properties which is run by jose antonio who was just named special envoy to the united states by the president of the philippines further many trump organization projects abroad require foreign government permits and approvals which amount to substantial financial benefits that also constitute foreign emoluments related stories politics trump s war on watchdogs politics mar a lago club is partially reopening this weekend presidents and public officers often utilize blind trusts so as not to violate the foreign emoluments clause a truly blind trust involves an arrangement wherein the public officer has no control whatsoever over the assets placed in the trust that means no communications with from or about the trust and no knowledge of the specific assets held for his benefit in the trust in the case of trump s ownership in the trump organization this could be achieved only by a complete liquidation of the assets with the proceeds to be invested by an independent trustee without trump s involvement or knowledge trump s decision to continue the business of the trump organization continue to maintain his substantial ownership of the organization and turn the management of it over to his children is woefully inadequate in addressing the emoluments clause worse taking the position that the foreign emoluments clause doesn t even apply to him trump has stated that i can be president of the united states and run my business 100 percent sign checks on my business and the law is totally on my side meaning the president can t have a conflict of interest to address this unprecedented corruption of the oval office and this threat to our constitution and our democracy we believe congress must move forward now with an impeachment investigation of president trump more than 575 000 people from across the country have already called for this joining a new campaign launched moments after president trump took the oath of office the president s possible
