washington tim kaine describes himself as boring mike pence calls himselfa b list republican celebrity no one expects tuesday s debate between thetwo vicepresidential nominees kaine ademocratic senator from virginia and pence the republican governor of indiana todraw the record breaking 84 million people who watched the first faceoff between presidential candidateshillary clinton and donald trump but viewers who do tune in could be rewarded with a clearer sense of the differences between the two parties than could be gleaned from the clinton trumpdebate clinton trump debate sets ratings record the vice presidential debate will be two competent politicians discussing issues said elaine kamarck an expert at the brookings institution there won t be the distraction that trump especially brought to the presidential debate voters may have another reason to watch to learn something about the men vying to become secondinline to the presidency each of whom remains unknown to many americans neither kaine 58 nor pence 57 had large national profiles when they were selected as vice presidential candidates and both have been overshadowed by their well known and polarizing running mates as a result polls show more than one third of voters don t know enough about either to form an opinion to some extent this is still their introduction to a big part of the public joel goldstein a vice presidential expert at the saint louis university school of law said of tuesday s debate clinton and trump have clearly been the focus and kaine and pence are less captivating less exciting figures both running mates have long records in government and extensive public speaking experience although this will be their first nationally televised debate we ve got a sitting united states senator versus a former house member who spent years as a radio talk show host said jim manley a democratic strategist and former aide to senate minority leader harry reid d nev as far as i m concerned they re coming into the debate pretty even both are articulate and think well on their feet analysis hillary clinton goes with her heart in choosing tim kaine as her running mate analysis for trump pence pick is all about conservatives both are also well matched in temperament kaine and pence are affable with low key sunny demeanors they re known as nice guys even by those on the other side of the aisle but despite the value they place on civility they re not pushovers he s a consummate gentleman but that doesn t mean he isn t tough wayne turnage who served as kaine s gubernatorial chief of staff said of his former boss tom rose a close friend and adviser to pence called indiana s governor a gracious man who will be very respectful but he can throw an uppercut too rose said at the debate pence likely will be more focusedthan trump wasin attackingclinton s vulnerabilities including her use of a private email server while secretary of state her comment that half of trump s supporters were a basket of deplorables and allegations that the clinton foundation was part of apay to play scheme throughout the campaign pence has been the more disciplined messenger as well as a clarifier in chief for some of trump s controversial remarks pence is much more of a normal politician than trump is kamarck said i think pence will be sort of steady and try to calm people s worries kaine likely will challengepence on trump s comments aboutwomen his business practices and his refusal to release his tax returns i m looking for sen kaine to find new and creative ways to try and make pence defend all sorts of trump s controversial comments manley said pence undoubtedlywill be asked about trump s recent criticisms of former miss universealiciamachado s weight gain and his tweet that people should check out a sex tape of her there s noevidence such a tape exists asked how pence will address the issue spokesman marc lotter said the indiana governor is focused on the clear choice the election offers between trump s and clinton s visions for the future kaine could repeat criticisms he s made on the stump about the controversial religious freedom law pence signed as governor kaine who focused on civil rights cases while a lawyer in private practice has called pence s record on lgbt issues anti civil rights pence told conservative radio talk show host hugh hewitt he s ready to respond i don t believe in discrimination against anyone because of who they are or who they love and anyone who knows me knows that to be the case pence said monday pence though could have trouble pivoting to a general election audience when one of the assets he brought to the ticket was a record that appeals to social conservatives in recent weeks pence has made several appearances before social conservative groups touting his opposition to abortion and his long standing fight against planned parenthood trump didn t do much in his debate against clintonto appeal to independents particularly women and pence might not be able to help said mitchell mckinney who teaches political communication at the university of missouri i don t see that pence is able to make appeals to that segment of the slice of the electorate that maybe trump really needs to work on mckinney said he s not the messenger to do that tim kaine plays harmonica parodies veep on the late show kaine who personally opposes abortion but has said it s a moral decisionfor people to make for themselves has gotten mixed reviews from reproductive rights groups over the years pence has gotten debate advice from house speaker paul ryan r wis who faced off against joe biden in a vice presidential debatefour years ago and he s been running through practice debates with wisconsin gov scott walker playing the role of kaine walker playing kaine in mock debate rose said pence has focused on mastering the policy positions of both campaigns in order to present a clear contrast the challenge at that level for any candidate not just gov pence is more comfort and poise and delivery and presentation than it is canned policy answers rose said he s very comfortable conveying his philosophy the clinton campaign did not respond to requests for comment about kaine s debate preparation robert barnett a prominent washington lawyer who played the role ofvermont sen bernie sanders in clinton s primary debate prep has portrayed pence during kaine s debate practice while kaine has a lot of debate experience he told cbs it s new for him to take the stage to promote and defend someone else s record thisis a different one because it s not really pence v kaine he said turnage said kaine is a policy wonk but his years as a litigator also honed his skills for explaining things to the average person you will see his sincerity you will see his intellect and you will see his depth of knowledge on public policy on full display turnage said tv viewership for vice presidential debates which began in 1976 is typically at least 20 smaller than for presidential debates but vice presidential debates have produced memorable moments there s lloyd bentsen s you re nojack kennedy putdown of dan quayle bob dole s 1976 comment that all the wars in the past century were democrat wars and ross perot running mate james stockdale s rhetorical who am i why am i here comment but it s rare that a vice presidential debate or the running mates themselves affectthe outcome of a presidential election it s not going to be a sarah palin year mckinney said referring to the 2008 vice presidential debate that was unique for drawing more viewers than that year s presidential debates there s the personality of these candidates from vanilla to milquetoast that doesn t mean kaine and pence won t feel the pressure a palin aide suggested she try to calm herself before the 2008 debate by imagining hair plugs on biden biden meanwhile got loose before walking on stage by stretching his quads and rolling his neck before pence s big speeches or rallies he usually gets a squeeze of the hand and a kiss on the cheek from his wife karen and they share a moment of reflection and prayer according to lotter pence s trademark unflappability comes from being deeply religious and his belief in an ultimate purpose and destiny for all of us rose said plus rose added pence jokes that as he sgotten older he s discovered the shortest distance between two points is a nap when 9 10 30 p m edt oct 4 where longwood university farmville va who democratic sen tim kaine and republican gov mike pence format
