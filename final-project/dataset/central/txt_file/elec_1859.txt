washington as a high school senior pete buttigieg won a national essay contest extolling bernie sanders as a profile in courage for daring to call himself a socialist and for being a powerful force for conciliation and bi partisanship on capitol hill i like to say i m like a hipster buttigieg said when asked about that essay in a 2017 podcast interview i like to say that i knew about sanders before he was cool now the two are top rivals for the democratic presidential nomination with buttigieg warning the opposite that the vermont senator is a divisive figure who insists on ideological purity that essay is just one reason the ongoing battle between the topfinishers in iowa and new hampshire is unusual it also pits the oldest candidate 78 against the youngest 38 president trump weighs in calls bernie sanders is the democratic frontrunner a democratic socialist is competing against a more nuanced progressive democrat who has long studied ways to reclaim from republicans terms like freedom and security sanders is the favorite of the youngest voters buttigieg s earliest fans were the older voters sanders argues he s the best general election candidate because of the enthusiasm of his base and an appealto new younger voters including voters of color buttigieg says he s demonstrated the broadest coalition including winning the votes of moderates and republicans turned off by president donald trump as trump did in 2016 sanders is running as an outsider candidate and a combative populist who appeals to those wanting to shake things up buttigieg is running as a calming figure who often talks about the need to heal a divided country after trump sdefeated but the two have a long history starting with that 2000 essay which buttigieg hinted at after coming in a close second to sanders in new hampshire tuesday i admired sen sanders when i was a high school student buttigieg said before congratulating sanders on his victory i respect him to this day later in his remarks however buttigieg alluded to sanders when he asserted that the politics of my way or the highway is a road to re electing donald trump vulnerable americans do not have the luxury of pursuing ideological purity over an inclusive victory he said in sanders victory remarks he took a jab at buttigieg for accepting campaign contributions from wealthy contributors we are taking on billionaires and we are taking on candidates who are funded by billionaires he said we are going to win because we have the agenda that speaks to the working people of this country sanders had not been buttigieg s first choice for the subject of his entry for the contest sponsored by the john f kennedy library foundation but after nearly finishing an essay on carolyn mccarthy a new york democrat who had run for congress after her husband was shot and killed on the long island rail road buttigieg realized shortly before the deadline that mccarthy had been the subject of the previous year s winning entry so he turned to someone he found even more interesting if a little more edgy politically in the essay that beat out more than 600 others buttigieg wrote that it may seem strange that someone so steadfast in his principles has a reputation as a peacemaker between divided forces in washington nevada showdown labor union warns workers about bernie sanders health care plan but that is what makes sanders truly remarkable buttigieg continued his energy candor conviction and ability to bring people together stand against the current of opportunism moral compromise and partisanship which runs rampant on the american political scene the high school senior didn t meet sanders when he traveled to boston wearing his first ever suit to receive his prize but buttigieg did get personal congratulations from sen ted kennedy who offered him a summer internship in his washington office i felt like i had been handed a ticket to the major leagues buttigieg wrote in his memoir shortest way home sixteen years later when buttigieg was mayor of south bend indiana he had to choose between backing sanders or hillary clinton for the party s presidential nomination he chose clinton but he describes in his book how at the campaign event he helped organize at a local humvee plant he was struck by what seemed a fatal lack of enthusiasm for clinton among the factory workers by contrast campaign stops in south bend by sanders and trump had an almost party like atmosphere buttigiegobserved after clinton s loss to trump buttigieg wanted to lead the democrats efforts to recalibrate he entered late the race to head the democratic national committee that was being dominated by former labor secretary tom perez a favorite of the barack obama and clinton camps and minnesota rep keith ellison who had the backing of sanders and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren the contest was seen as a replay ofthe 2016 interparty battle between clinton and sanders buttigieg attempted to squeezeright through the middle of that establishment vs insurgent divide at one point sanders called buttigieg to unsuccessfully urge him to drop out to make room for ellison perez won and buttigieg went on to run for president in that contest warren s poor performance in iowa and new hampshire has made sanders the undisputed leader of the most liberal wing of the party he could also be unstoppable for the nomination if buttigieg or another center left candidate is unable to coalesce that larger segment of the vote their next battlefield is nevada where buttigieg is betting his more gradual approach to expanding health coverage will win over the state s powerful labor unions whose members might be worried that sanders medicare for all proposal wouldn t deliverhealth insurance as good asthey have now sanders hopes the extensive outreach his campaign has made to latino voters since 2016 will give him a second straight victory when nevadans caucus on feb 22 sanders has said he likes buttigieg calling him a smart guy and a nice guy some of his supporters however have taken a more aggressive approach to their rival including booing and chanting wall street pete when television screens tuesday night showed buttigieg s post primary remarks for his part buttigieg says he stands by his old essay even if he emphasizes the passages about sanders courage of his convictions instead of the praise he had for sanders ability to work with others what i really admired about senator sanders and still do is his consistency and willingness to say exactly what he believes buttigieg said when asked about the essay at a cnn town hall in new hampshire last week and i think everybody left right and center ought to come into the public square making the case for what we think is right the calendar when are the 2020 presidential election primaries 2020 candidates on the issues a voter s guide to where they stand on health care gun control and more
