the fiery speeches against iran by president donald trump and his top advisers at the u n general assembly have intended to demonstrate tehran s growing isolation from the world community instead the opposite has proven true as divisions have been exposed between the u s and its closest allies the latest broadside against iran came wednesday while trump hosted a u n security council meeting where he launched into a diatribe that repeated many of criticisms against the 2015 nuclear accord officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action this horrible one sided deal allowed iran to continue its path towards a bomb and gave the regime a cash lifeline when they needed it the most trump said they were in big big trouble they needed cash we gave it to them the jcpoa brought iran s nuclear program under tight international controls but freed it from heavy sanctions tehran has stayed in accordance with the agreement despite the u s pullout while also trying to salvage a deal with the remaining stakeholders russia china germany britain and france the trump administration announced implementing new economy crippling sanctions against iran in may with more severe measures to follow in november targeting oil sales trump promised these actions would be tougher than ever before however once trump finished speaking french president emmanuel macron took the floor to say the u s approach was inadequate it can t boil down to just sanctions and containment we need to have the space for new negotiations he said the serious crisis of confidence was opened by the imposition of extraterritorial sanctions by the united states but tehran keeps abiding by its nuclear obligation macron said then british prime minister theresa may agreed as did dutch prime minister mark rutte chinese foreign minister wang yi and others attending the meeting it was the trump administration s latest failed attempt at swaying the international community s commitment to the multilateral nuclear deal with few exceptions foreign nations have opted to defend the agreement rather than join america s outbursts against it iran has emerged as the administration s bogeyman repeatedly this week as the u n assembly took place in new york on tuesday trump said iran s leaders sow chaos death and destruction so other nations should join his economic pressure campaign later his national security adviser john bolton warned iran there would be hell to pay if it harms american citizens he added the murderous regime and its supporters will face significant consequences if they do not change their behavior then the state department tried to rally support against tehran by publishing a 48 page report called outlaw regime a chronicle of iran s destructive activities which examines its support for terror groups missile program illicit financial activities and other issues the u s also recently unveiled plans to create an around the clock farsi channel that promotes western propaganda on television radio and social media iranian president hassan rouhani told the u n general assembly that all of these initiatives have led him to believe the trump administration is pursuing a strategy of regime change in his country it is ironic that the u s government does not even conceal its plan for overthrowing the same government it invites to talks he said tuesday the trump administration s central issue with iran is its pursuit of ballistic missile technology and support of proxy militias in war torn places such as yemen and syria both of those actions which other nations agree is deeply destabilizing are not covered under the jcpoa to ensure that the country is in compliance to its commitments in the agreements the international atomic energy agency routinely checks iranian nuclear facilities it has so far passed those examinations that is why russia china germany britain and france signed a deal this week on the u n sidelines to set up legal entity to circumvent u s sanctions yet another sign trump s efforts may have backfired still the u s wields great power even on its own even though european governments are sticking with iran many of their companies are not french energy giant total danish shipping giant ap moller maersk and french carmaker peugeot are among the growing number of companies to flee under the threat of u s sanctions no one expects a full return to the level of international sanctions that were in place prior to the 2015 nuclear deal a prodigious nearly global and ultimately successful effort aimed at forcing iran to the negotiating table european nations were far more willing to participate in washington s no holds barred approach toward iran during the obama administration when tehran was widely perceived to be racing toward a nuclear bomb secretary of state mike pompeo has maintained that u s policy is not to overthrow the government in tehran rather the goal is is to rein it in but in order to do that the u s needs allies help i was disturbed and indeed deeply disappointed to hear the remaining parties in the deal announce they re setting up a special payment system to bypass u s sanctions pompeo said tuesday in new york this is one of the most counterproductive measures imaginable for regional and global peace and security by sustaining revenues to the regime you are solidifying iran s ranking as
