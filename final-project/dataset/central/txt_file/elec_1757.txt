sinking bloomberg for the second consecutive debate warren looked to deliver the knockout blow against bloomberg the late to the race billionaire and former republicanwho progressives loathe warren went after bloomberg for past remarks in which he blamed racial minorities for the 2008 financial collapse she ticked through all of the republican candidates he s supported financially including her own challenger in 2012 former sen scott brown r mass warren returned to the issue of nondisclosure agreements alleging that bloomberg oversaw a toxic workplace for women and demanding that he release them from the nondisclosure agreements they d signed and she hammered bloomberg for not having released his tax returns likening him to trump i don t care how much money he has the core of the democratic party will never trust him warren said he s the riskiest candidate standing on this stage bloomberg was not blindsided this time around as he was in las vegas he disputed allegations that he supported the practice of redlining and denied that he ever told a woman who worked for him to kill it when he found out she was pregnant but warren s attacks are landing and it s notable that she

candidates frantically searching for attention votes before super tuesday with the south carolina primary on saturday and super tuesday only 72 hours later it s desperation time it s possible that this was the last debate for one or more of the seven remaining candidates on stage and that desperation showed over the course of the unruly two hourdebate in charleston long stretches of time were eaten up as the candidates shouted over one another the cbs moderators completely lost control at points during the debate which became a free for all benefitting whichever candidate outlasted or shouted loud enough over his or her rivals that led to some frustration among centrist democrats and progressives alike who feel their candidates didn t get a fair shake debate will raise fears about negativity among the candidates the las vegas debate last week was an all out war the charleston debate may have matched it for its level of negativity the candidates are not just fighting to win there is clear animosity and bad blood between some of them klobuchar appears to truly dislike buttigieg warren s attacks on bloomberg are blunt and cutting progressives will squirm watching sanders and warren criticize one another centrist democrats will again throw their hands up wondering why the moderate candidates continue to tear each other down instead of focusing solely on sanders if we spend the next few months tearing our party apart we ll spend the next four years watching donald trump tear this country apart klobuchar warned tuesday there will be plenty of time for democrats to unite but fears of a divided and bitter base could persist fora whileafter a brutal nominating process view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500
