restrictions she said in a statement more chinatown is not part of china trump s tweet at pelosi is met with criticism online the focus on china however seems to have occurred simultaneously with a shift in public opinion onchina and chinese people a poll released last week by pew research center showed about two thirds of americans have an unfavorable opinion of china the highest ever proportion since pew started asking the question in 2005 and a poll published tuesday by the center for public integrity and ipsos showed about 3 in 10 americans in the poll sample blaming china or chinese people for the pandemic university of california san diego professor of political economy victor shih told usa today the criticism of china follows a broader negative trend towards china in american politics things already were trending in a negative direction even before the coronavirus shih said noting the ongoing trade war between the united states and china but the ongoing china bashing was doing real harm to the status ofasian americans overall but especially americans of chinese descent pew research associate kat devlin told usa today it was just within the last two years that pew had witnessed such a negative change in its data lining up with the ratcheting up of rhetoric about the trade war between the two countries devlin noted that a partisan shift had happened in their data too in the past republicans had expressed more negative views of china but in the last two years we re now seeing majorities of democrats and independents who lean democratic also holding these unfavorable views the attacks from both the trump and biden campaigns have not been without some criticism trump s ad includes an image of former washington gov gary locke who is chinese american prompting criticism of the trump campaign locke accused the trump campaign of fanning hatred and the biden campaign called for the ad to be taken down biden s ad received positive reviews from some on the left who praised biden for punching back but others particularly from the progressive left and some asian american groups disagreed with the biden campaign s messaging and the focus on china from both campaigns aclu lawyer cecillia wang responded to the biden ad on twitter saying biden was trying to out trump trump christine chen executive director of asian and pacific islander american vote called the biden ad a misstep and the trump ad irresponsible for including locke i understand the instinct for a campaign to respond directly to an opposing campaign s ad chen said and while i do not believe the biden campaign meant to be xenophobic the ad was still a misstep rep judy chu d calif the chair of the congressional asian pacific american caucus told usa today there was space for a conversation criticizing the chinese communist party but making china as a whole a centerpiece of a political campaign and doing so in a way that blames china for our problems is only going to encourage more anger and xenophobia at a time when both are dangerously high i encourage all parties to refrain from anti china broadsides that put asian americans in harm s way she said
