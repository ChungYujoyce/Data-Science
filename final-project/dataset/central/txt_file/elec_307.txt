voters resemble joe biden older centrists in new hampshire voters say his calls for unity resonate in a deeply divided country loading may 15 2019 what is the appeal of joe biden a two time presidential candidate who is going for his third try at 76 put more bluntly how could an avuncular white man who talks about consensus building be whupping all 21 of his rivals at a time when liberals put such emphasis on freshness diversity and progressive ideals for new hampshire voters who came out to see him this week it s pretty simple he s tough enough to go toe to toe with president donald trump but is also someone who can help bring america together again one thing i like about joe biden is he has this red blooded american demeanor that might appeal to trump voters who couldn t bring themselves to vote for hillary in 2016 says lisa cot an aclu volunteer who attended a campaign event at manchester community college on monday night carol miller sees another side of him we need to bring back humanity we need somebody who brings kindness not brutality says ms miller who says she cries when she watches the news every night mr biden is definitely the unifier a full hour before joe biden is scheduled to speak at manchester community college the only parking spaces left are way in the back of the lot behind the welding shop the neon letters on the school s electronic sign trumpet through the darkness and drizzle welcome to new hampshire joe biden inside the gymnasium is overflowing with checkered plaid shirts and fleece jackets with teachers and geologists bikers and firefighters and people who drove an hour and a half from republican enclaves where they don t dare reveal their democratic leanings as mr biden steps up to the mic ear piercing whistles ricochet around the gym you know in your gut this is the most important election you ve ever voted in he tells the crowd three african american teenagers in the back zoom in on him with their smartphones for these teens it will be the first election they ve ever voted in and they can t wait to cast ballots for the former vice president who served alongside barack obama being a person of color i d definitely like to see someone like kamala harris win but there will be a time says layla mohseni of boston who remembers watching president obama s inauguration when she was 7 and still has an obama biden sticker on her smartphone why not senator harristhis time i think mr biden is the guy she says simply though adds that it would be ideal if ms harris became his running mate a suggestion that has beengaining momentumamong some democrats as a way to combine experience and freshness continuity and diversity electability and possibility since announcing his candidacy late last month mr biden has skyrocketed in the polls to the surprise of washington pundits many of whom had predicted his first day on the trail might wind up being his best his front runner status can be attributed in part to the strongsupport he s getting from african american voters but it s not only that while it may have seemed that candidates like sens bernie sanders and elizabeth warren were pulling the democrats inexorably to the left mr biden s calls to unify a deeply divided country appear to be resonating with many voters whose no 1 priority is ending what they see as a dangerous presidency that is corroding american democracy one thing i like about joe biden is he has this red blooded american badass grandpa demeanor that might appeal to trump voters who couldn t bring themselves to vote for hillary in 2016 says lisa cot an aclu volunteer even though she personally has reservations about mr biden she says it s going to come down to people who didn t vote or who regret voting for trump the 2016 election came down to fewer than 80 000 votes in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania where donald trump eked out razor thin victoriesthanks in part to the support of blue collar democrats who surprised many by throwing in their lot with the new york billionaire before mr biden entered the race skeptics wondered if there was any room left in the democratic party for someone like him someone who s been in washington longer than mayor pete buttigieg has been alive with a long list of controversial positions in his past from his opposition to busing in the 70s to his role chairing the clarence thomas hearings in the 90s even though he had been vp under the country s first african american president he was too middle of the road too willing to work with republicans too out of touch with the woke millennial masses and the party s progressive transformation and yes a bunch of people thought he was too touchy feely to survive in the era of metoo but mr biden s rise in the polls over the past few weeks suggests they were wrong he was already the most popular democratic candidate when he entered the race on april 25 but he has since more than tripled his margin of advantage over his closest competitor senator sanders from 4 points to 20 points according tomorning consult that likely reflects the fact that the party s voters as a whole are not nearly as left wing as its most activist standard bearers in ajanuary poll democrats were offered a variety of labels and allowed to choose up to three the most popular label obama democrat with 25 only 7 chose socialist or democratic socialist mr biden who grew up in scranton pennsylvania is banking on the votes not of liberal elites in washington but of average people who yearn not only for more comfortable financial circumstances but also a deeper sense of dignity and pride in the manchester gymnasium on monday night hestarts to roar as he talks about restoring the working class in america you built this country he bellows american workers are three times more productive than in asia he says we have more great research universities and labs than any other country and you own them you pay taxes for them says the former vice president who once described the united states to china s xi jinping in one word possibilities what are we doing we re walking around with our heads down like woe is me he said sending the crowd into wild cheers the only thing that can tear america apart is not another country it s america itself so get up and let s take back this country you tell em joe whoops a well dressed man in the back accompanied by more whistling it s dick swett a former new hampshire congressman and ambassador who sees in mr biden a youthful enthusiasm that belies his age if we re going to win this election we ve gotta be enthusiastic mr swett says afterward we need wisdom that comes with age we need energy that comes with attitude not just youth many voters who came out to see mr biden brushed off concerns about the fact that if elected hewould be the oldest president ever inaugurated at 78 years old senator sanders would be 79 he also would bring more experience in government than any other president elect according to acnn analysis i have a lot of friends in their late 70s and early 80s and they are still vigorous active bright says carol martell who showed up the next morning for a biden house party in nashua new hampshire mr biden doesn t think old still a recentgallup pollfound that voters were more comfortable voting for a muslim a gay or lesbian an african american or a woman just about anyone except a socialist than they were for someone over the age of 70 some voters notice that he sometimes trips over his words or interrupts himself and doesn t finish his sentences maybe it s the result of a campaign aide s mandate to stop rambling they muse or maybe it s just the miserably cold drizzle he looks better today says mike marsh who also saw him in manchester last night close up from just under the teleprompters there s more color in his face he and his friend robert schepis who saw mr biden monday morning in hampton both agree his performance today was better everybody knows who trump is we gotta know who we are booms mr biden his voice carrying out into the new hampshire woods where damp oak leaves still lay compressed from the winter snows and the new buds were barely beginning to unfurl in bright greens and reds we choose hope over fear we choose truth over lies we gotta choose unity over division more than 200 people turned out despite the wintry weather with cars lining both sides of the neighborhood s streets for nearly half a mile and boots tromping all over the hosts beautifully landscaped backyard there were immigrants and bernie supporters and a woman in a blue headscarf and a man in a blue knitted kippa longtime new hampshire residents who had never come to such an event and a high school student who asked what mr biden would do to keep him and his sister safe from school shootings then grabbed a hug in front of the whole crowd before he had to dash back to school for english class as people started trickling back to their cars chris miller was glowing get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox we need to bring back humanity we need somebody who brings kindness not brutality says ms
