after the japanese bombed pearl harbor in 1941 president roosevelt s executive order 9066 signed two months later authorized the relocation of people of japanese heritage most of whom were u s citizens to designated camps nationwide one of those 10 camps was heart mountain in wyoming and one of the internees was a boy named norman mineta perhaps surprisingly that experience did not leave him with lasting bitterness or rancor toward the united states rather it inspired him to pursue a career in public service that career is the focus of a new pbs documentary airing monday night norman mineta and his legacy an american story mineta went on to become the first asian american mayor of a major u s city san jose calif as well as the first japanese american from the contiguous u s to be elected to congress representing california from 1975 to 1997 and the first asian american to serve in a presidential cabinet as secretary of commerce under president bill clinton and secretary of transportation under president george w bush despite all that his family went through in the camp described in the exclusive clip above mineta says he made a conscious decision to mentally process that time in a way that allowed him to keep loving america in japanese there s a phrase shikata ga nai which means things happen over which you have no control try to make the best of it and the second one is gaman meaning to endure mineta now 87 tells time i was raised in a family that thought of the glass as half full not half empty you try to make the most of a bad situation for him becoming a public servant was a productive way of channeling that experience because as he puts it i wanted to make sure that something like this would never again i would speak for those who are underrepresented in government or have no representation at all the below clip shows how his life came full circle when 45 years after his family was sent to the camp president ronald reagan signed into law the civil liberties act of 1988 which paid out about 20 000 in reparations to surviving internees reagan said the law will right a grave wrong a wrong that the law defined as racial prejudice war hysteria and a failure of political leadership the legislation was a bipartisan effort and one of its sponsors was alan simpson mineta s best friend and then a republican senator from wyoming the two had first met 45 years prior when simpson visited heart mountain as part of a group of boy scouts that kind of friendship doesn t exist today mineta says one time we were having dinner and someone came up to us and said senator simpson you re a conservative republican and he s a liberal democrat what s the biggest difference between the two of you alan thought about it and he said well i wear size 15 shoes and he wears a size 8 and a half mineta says a lack of such friendships across party lines is one of the biggest changes in the way congress works since his time in office we used to fight in sub committee fight in full committee fight on the house floor over legislation and then we d slap each other on the back and say c mon let s go have dinner let s go have a drink members don t do that today there are exceptions but it s not the rule part of the reason he says is that many members of congress spend less time in d c than their predecessors did today many spend more days in their districts both to show their constituents they are present and to visit their families because they didn t move them to d c that whole schedule works against the potential ability to have friendships and have relationships that would be beneficial he says another thing that s missing in politics today he says is bold action on important issues and more taking the perspective of the most vulnerable constituents he recalls that when he first became mayor of san jose a man who d worked on his campaign and who used a wheelchair due to childhood polio challenged mineta to spend the first week of his time in office using a wheelchair too when i got to city hall i couldn t get up on the curb to get onto the sidewalk couldn t get into city hall because the doors were pulling the wrong way couldn t make a phone call in a phone booth couldn t go to the bathroom he recalls as a result of that experience he made sure san jose took steps like adding curb cuts to sidewalks and his continued interest in disability rights led him to help develop the transportation component of the americans with disabilities act 1990 as for today s members of congress who have set their sights on higher office he s not ready to make 2020 predictions yet some of the candidates i ve seen i don t see a plan how they re going to accomplish what they re talking about i do like vice president biden he s an old friend of mine but right now it s too early for me to decide what i want to do as for whether he thinks trump will be re elected next question the pbs documentary norman mineta and his
