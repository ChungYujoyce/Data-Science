former supreme court justice john paul stevens the third longest serving justice in history died on july 16 2019 at the age of 99 he passed away peacefully with his daughters by his side the supreme court said in a statement stevens survived by two daughters died at a hospital in fort lauderdale florida after suffering a stroke on july 15 stevens sat on the supreme court for 35 years surpassed by only two other justices in history it s not a particularly interesting achievement stevens said with characteristic modesty in a phone call with time in may 2019 but he quipped justice field stopped working full time a couple months before he retired so maybe i should be put in second place over the course of his long career stevens would have a role in shaping most areas of the law influential in majority opinions and firm in his dissents marked by a practical jurisprudence and an increasingly liberal sensibility stevens was nominated to the supreme court by president gerald ford in 1975 after the country was rocked by the watergate scandal you re coming out of such turmoil my understanding is the objective of president ford and his staff was to find somebody who was as apolitical as possible and above reproach in terms of integrity says jeffrey fisher who clerked for stevens in 1998 1999 those were the justice s two calling cards all the way through his career indeed stevens was known for being unfailingly courteous to his clerks his colleagues and to the lawyers who came before him often asking them politely if he could interject with questions in oral arguments born to a privileged family in chicago in 1920 stevens had a very midwestern style says eduardo pe alver who clerked for the justice in 2000 2001 he s just incredibly plainspoken and down to earth and it lulls you into a comfort and then he ll dazzle you with something that displays his intellect that intellect and apolitical stance as described by fisher led stevens to evolve over the course of his more than three decades on the bench from being nominated by a republican president to being considered a leading liberal justice at the time of his retirement stevens former clerks say would argue that he didn t change so much as the court became more conservative around him as the court shifted to the right pretty dramatically over the course of justice stevens career he kind of intuitively shifted a little bit just to try to stabilize the court says pe alver but stevens own views did move on key issues in particular on affirmative action and capital punishment he became more in favor of affirmative action during his years on the court and more opposed to the death penalty this is a guy who very clearly learned and processed information and processed ideas over time says gregory magarian who clerked for him in 1994 1995 stevens was never one to write sweeping opinions but he helmed the majority in crucial cases during his time in 1984 stevens wrote the majority in chevron u s a inc v natural resources defense council inc establishing the principle that when federal law is ambiguous or silent courts should defer to federal agencies interpretations of the meaning chevron deference as it is now known has become increasingly controversial and the trump administration has sought judges skeptical of the doctrine stevens told time in may that he thinks chevron was his most significant majority opinion in his 2019 memoir the making of a justice stevens cites 2000 s apprendi v new jersey as what he views as another of his most important majority opinions in apprendi stevens held that any fact that could increase a defendant s criminal sentence needed to be found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt in terms of consequences for the legal system especially the criminal justice system i think that might have had the most reverberations of any criminal law opinion certainly that he wrote says fisher while stevens was collegial and not prone to stinging dissents or a sharp tongued writing style he was known for a few dissents in cases that had an enormous impact on the country in the 2000 decision in bush v gore that resulted in george w bush winning the presidency decided 5 4 along ideological lines with stevens joining the liberals stevens wrote in dissent although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year s presidential election the identity of the loser is perfectly clear it is the nation s confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law read more john paul stevens on the worst decision of his 34 years on the supreme court and in his final years of life stevens became increasingly vocal about what he viewed as the court s gravest error during his tenure the 2008 decision in district of columbia v heller which held that the second amendment protects an individual s right to bear arms stevens dissented as history has demonstrated in recent years the tragedies are multiplying one after another he told time of the decision and the decision of the court in heller has contributed to that stevens was a tennis player and a licensed pilot who was never caught up in the washington d c social scene after retiring from the court in 2010 stevens kept busy even when he could no longer fly or be as physically active he spent five years writing a more than 500 page memoir published in 2019 after he was inspired to reflect on his life when his wife threw him a 94th birthday party by the time he was 99 he told time he occupied his time by remaining an avid reader there continue to be good books to read he said and i continue to try to find the best but when asked to reflect on his nearly century of life and what legacy he hoped to leave from his 35 years on the supreme court stevens signature humility reined i just tried to do my best all along he said that s a goal that every judge should seek to achieve write to tessa berenson at tessa berenson time
