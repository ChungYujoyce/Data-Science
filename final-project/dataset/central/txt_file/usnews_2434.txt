president donald trump s daughter ivanka trump said on thursday that the separation of immigrant families at the border was a low point that was a low point for me as well the 36 year old trump who serves as an advisor to her father s administration said at an event in washington hosted by axios i felt very strongly about that i am very vehemently against family separation and the separation of parents and children so i would agree with that sentiment immigration is incredibly complex as a topic illegal immigration is incredibly complicated her comments come as the family separation crisis at the u s southern border is waning but not altogether mitigated since a court ordered july 26 deadline to reunite families was put in place the government has reunited the majority but not all of the more than 2 500 children who were separated from their parents or guardians this is not the first time trump s eldest daughter has taken a critical stance on the separation of families in a june tweet ivanka trump called on congress to now act find a lasting solution that is consistent with our shared values at the washington event ivanka trump also said she disagreed with her father s perspective that the media is the enemy of the people no i do not think that she said i ve certainly received my fair share of reporting on me personally that i know not to be fully accurate so i have some sensitivity around why people have concerns and gripe especially when they sort of feel targeted but no i do not consider the media the enemy of the people contact us at editors time com
