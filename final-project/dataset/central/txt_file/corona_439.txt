loosening of coronavirus restrictions yet the general mood was one of cautious excitement loading april 27 2020 for starters the restaurant will have about 300 seats not the usual 700 plus the breezes that blow through the screened in windows will hopefully offer plenty of circulation and all the servers of course will have masks and gloves but make no mistake the crab shack is preparing to open monday after georgia gov brian kemp said businesses could start to reopen this weekend the peach state offered a taste of what america might look like when it emerges from its coronavirus lockdowns i m excited and yes i m nervous says the owner of the crab shack capturing the atmosphere around savannah others are more cautious alonzo wright jr knows georgia has not yet met the guidelines laid out by the white house to safely lift stay at home orders the state isn t even close really and so when the decision to reopen his beastmode fitness came he had a realization he would clean he would expand to create more space for social distancing but he wouldn t reopen not yet we closed down for a reason and i haven t seen enough change yet to reopen one day the parking lot of nottingham plaza off skidaway road was empty as it had been for nearly five long weeks of a pandemic lockdown then the next day on friday at 11 13 a m cars appeared lots of them like a regular summer day one shopkeeper observed this weekend georgia began rolling back stay at home coronavirus restrictions in hopes of restarting the u s economy and nottingham plaza zys hair studio owner lazharia morris could palpably feel the stakes for her customers for her stylists and for a thriving business she grew from the ground up as appointments flooded in ms morris scrambled to manage expectations and check off a list of requirements put out by the state cosmetology board hand washing and mask wearing would be required importantly customers are being asked to sign a hold harmless waiver so that

customers flocked in she realized she needed more waivers more posters more information ms morris harried morning offers a glimpse into how america might begin to reemerge from isolation hair askew facing a world where the barber makes you sign a contract and where sit down diners will for the foreseeable future be greeted by servers in masks and gloves the question is how quickly it should happen in beginning to reopen georgia defied white house guidelines which call for among other things declining covid 19 cases for 14 days and a robust testing system georgia has neither but there are signs of restlessness in some parts of the country in the south other states are beginning to reopen an anti lockdown protest brought thousands to madison wisconsin this weekend and in southern california some beaches were crowded in coastal georgia the mood was one of buzzy excitement for ms morris this weekend marked a return to clarity and purpose after weeks of wandering through a kind of fog my boyfriend is an entrepreneur too he owns a recording studio and he was begging me not to reopen but i told him i ve got six ladies here who have mouths to feed and rents to pay i m not going to say the governor is stupid we needed this this virus isn t going away we have to learn to live with it at some point we ve got to do what we ve got to do the decision is a controversial one among some here and certainly in other parts of the united states the concern is that the desire to return to something like normal could undo the gains made by social distancing indeed health officials say that until there is a vaccine or an effective means of treatment social distancing is the only viable medical path a study by the institute for health metrics and evaluation at the university of washington suggests georgia should begin reopening after june 22 the ethical issue here isn t a question of right and wrong as it usually isn t but how do you balance two competing rights asks paul root wolpe a bioethicist at emory university in atlanta referring to health and economic welfare we have to decide which one we re going to favor and when those choices are playing out on both sides at nottingham plaza from the outside it s just another nondescript l shaped strip mall on an urban fringe in america but behind mirrored shop doors whole worlds are coming back to life at 11 33 a m on friday all eight chairs are occupied at fatou s an african hair braiding shop in the tattoo shop next door a fifth of ink the owner is cautiously reopening by appointment only at first but already with customers in chairs yet as his plaza colleagues rush to open alonzo wright jr raises his head as the front door opens at beastmode fitness his gym we re closed you got my number call me he s in touch with six local gym owners and only one opened friday after preemptively closing his gym in march mr wright newly married moved into a new house the idling hours were spent painting walls and otherwise nesting the gym benches began gathering dust and for weeks he didn t care but when gop gov brian kemp threw his curveball last monday announcing that businesses could reopen friday mr wright returned to the gym and had a realization he knew georgia remained far behind on testing and setting up contact tracers to track the spread of the virus he knew the tension between mr kemp and federal guidelines and the deadlier impact the virus has had on working class african american communities he had soaked up every news detail of the pandemic mayors governors and the president were openly bickering over a way forward and here he was faced with the question of reopening the country by opening his gym welcome to life as a lab rat he thought as he looked around at the well worn green carpeting he saw what he must do his trainers were already using zoom and facetime to do one on one workouts i realized that this is something else it requires bigger thinking so he called in his trainer crew the muscle to start moving equipment around the carpet is coming up a deep clean commencing and shortly after noon that day mr wright s attorney appeared to start discussions about expanding the gym into a soon to be vacant unit next door each person has to do what they think is right knowing that you can t be mad at any one person says mr wright i also think that this is part madness but if i m speaking only for myself we re not opening the gym because we re just not ready we re not ready we closed down for a reason and i haven t seen enough change yet to reopen he adds such personal deliberations in part of savannah point to similar deliberations nationwide polls released in recent weeks say americans are wary of reopening too soon but many american also say they can be responsible if shown a little more trust this is us playing out over and over again the inherent tension in the american psyche of not really being good at understanding and balancing collective sacrifice says dr wolpe yes we do it in war and extreme situations but what makes this so interesting is that we re not sure how extreme this is some 20 miles from nottingham plaza beneath sprawling canopies of live oak power washers roar glasses clink in dishwashers people shout across parking lots and lean into truck windows to talk it is saturday at 10 33 a m two days before the region s largest restaurant the crab shack resumes dine in service after nearly six weeks of being laid off one server waves and grins as she reports for a deep clean shift i am ready to work she shouts for all to hear plus i can t take my wife anymore thirty years ago capt jack flanigan an offshore charter fisherman turned a weekend crab boil at his fish camp dock on chimney creek into what became a 728 seat institution the crab shack serves mounds of low country boil old bay infused new potatoes shellfish sausage corn hunks amid moss draped sunsets and clacking marsh hens it is as general manager justin fowler points out an experience as much as a meal but what experience can the crab shack offer as he readies to open at noon monday mr fowler has halved the number of seats to about 300 given that the restaurant is essentially a massive screened in porch with breezes from the creek we re hoping that will make people more comfortable he adds servers will be in masks and gloves mr flanigan says he knows the importance of this decision get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox i m excited and yes i m nervous he says in one way it feels like all of
