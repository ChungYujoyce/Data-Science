diversity if elected mr buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana would be the youngest president ever on inauguration day vermont sen bernie sanders former vice president joe biden and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren would all be the oldest and just as mr buttigieg and senator sanders are decades apart so are many of their supporters mr sanders 2016 primary campaign famously saw the rise of bernie bros the passionate young supporters who feelthebern and are once again fueling the almost octogenarian s candidacy meanwhile grandparents such as ms mccue are flocking to mr buttigieg s campaign much of it has to do with ideology the bold policies and uncompromising style of mr sanders a democratic socialist are in line with the views of many young people today who lean further left than their elders mr buttigieg by contrast has tried to define himself as a more centrist figure and projects a calm thoughtfulness on the stump that older voters say they appreciate at the same time many specifically point to qualities in candidates that complement rather than mirror their own young voters praise mr sanders life experience and time tested commitment to ideals and are less concerned about his health and stamina despite his heart attack this fall older voters wax enthusiastic about mr buttigieg s youthful vigor and dazzling intellect and aren t as worried about his relatively short r sum you might think people my age would automatically choose someone our age but i feel like we are ready for a new generation to lead says ms mccue his age is not a problem for me it s an asset there is this idea for fresh new hope coming from him many buttigieg supporters like linda and bob ofner both retirees point out that his youth means he has skin in the game compared to the old men in washington mr buttigieg will actually be alive long enough to feel the long term effects of his policies says ms ofner from her kitchen table in bettendorf iowa as the couple s two dachshunds bark to be held most important she adds mr buttigieg understands that the country needs to stop fighting and come together more than anything we need a uniter says ms ofner i think a lot of boomers feel that way nestled between christmas pillows in her living room in iowa city ms mccue expresses disappointment that she would have to miss an event with mr buttigieg because it coincided with her oldest granddaughter s fourth birthday and nana had promised to be there she too highlights his ability to bring people together suggesting it comes from a willingness to admit when he is wrong that kind of humility and open minded approach to problem solving is refreshing in a politician she says and reminds her of her years as a teacher when she encouraged her students to act in a similar way he s how you hope all young men will grow up to be truthful trustworthy responsible no put downs says ms ofner at one of his first events people were saying like oh i wish he were older i wish this i wish that but then by the time he was done talking everyone was cheering and crying a civiqs and iowa state universitypoll last monthof likely democratic caucus attendees found that 25 over the age of 65 say they will back the young mayor more than any other democratic candidate while mr buttigieg s lowest levels of support are among those between the ages of 18 and 29 the opposite is true for mr sanders the poll found that 35 of young iowa democrats say they ll support the vermont senator more than any other candidate while just 9 of the oldest cohort favor him for most of these voters the candidates main selling points are their policies says stella rouse an associate professor of politics at the university of maryland this whole idea of we want someone from our generation to represent us is overblown and over simplistic she says millennials see sanders energy and his politics and they are drawn to that there is a huge cross generational appeal mr buttigieg casts himself as a centrist which baby boomers like ms mccue and the ofners see as a good thing they miss the old days when compromise was still possible in washington they also oppose free everything which they believe other democratic candidates are promising the candidate who comes in second place with this age group mr biden holds similar positions on these issues and is selling himself as able to win over moderates and anti trump republicans as well as those who feel nostalgic for a past america conversely mr sanders calls for a 21st century economic bill of rights a reassessment of the country s vast income inequality free college and medicare for all these proposals resonate with america s youth says ms rouse co author of the politics of millennials having come of age in the shadow of the 2008 economic crisis millennials now find themselves the best educated generation in american history and the worst paid agallup poll from 2018found that 51 of americans between the ages of 18 and 29 have a positive view of socialism the largest percentage of any age group while just 45 have a positive view of capitalism the smallest percentage of any age group waving a bernie poster
