 scott detrow voters in pennsylvania oregon nebraska and idaho on tuesday will decide primaries that will set up fall contests pennsylvania alone has 5 seats that democrats are hopeful about picking up rachel martin host there is another round of primary elections today elections that could have a big impact on the battle to control congress voters in pennsylvania nebraska idaho and oregon will choose their candidates for the fall pennsylvania alone has five seats that democrats are hopeful about picking up in november and if they pick candidates who can win over republicans and independents that could go a long way in getting them the votes they need to take back the house npr congressional correspondent scott detrow is here for more hey scott scott detrow byline good morning martin so republicans are on defense in the state of pennsylvania what s made this state so important in 2018 detrow pennsylvania s always pretty close and the philadelphia suburbs were being viewed as a key battleground because democrats feel like they can make a lot of gains in the current political climate in the suburbs going after higher education higher income voters who are turned off by president trump but otherwise might typically vote republican so this was already a focus then a couple of things happened to make the state way more competitive first of all is a lot of the republicans representing pennsylvania in congress have decided to retire for one reason or another leaving a lot of seats vacant martin right there was also this gerrymandering case in detrow yes martin pennsylvania that s created new districts no detrow yes it was quite the frenzy over the last few months the state supreme court threw out the map that had been drawn by a republican legislature and signed by a republican governor they said it was too unfair too gerrymandered in favor of republicans the state supreme court is controlled by democrats and the map they produced much more favorable to democrats and made a lot of these districts on the eastern part of the state especially more competitive or a slight edge to democrats and as a result you have democrats very excited about the chances here a lot of them running in one of these suburban philadelphia races that s been vacated you have 10 democrats martin whoa detrow in today s primary martin that s a lot of people laughter anything else you think is particularly notable in the primaries detrow yeah i think the most interesting house primary to flag in pennsylvania is the democratic primary in the 7th congressional district this is allentown the lehigh valley it s being vacated by charlie dent a moderate republican you have a whole range of the democratic party in this primary you have a conservative candidate you have a candidate backed by bernie sanders several others so that ll be interesting to watch to see which of these candidates has the momentum and then there are some bigger picture trends as well we ve seen in a lot of earlier primaries this year that house republicans are not doing so well when they try to run for statewide office so pennsylvania s senate primary on the republican side lou barletta has been criticized for running a lackluster campaign he s running against a state representative who hasn t been able to gain too much momentum either but if barletta has a hard time winning that primary that might say something martin also in idaho there s an interesting race raul labrador he s been kind of this firebrand tea party type of guy in congress he s running for governor how s that race looking detrow yeah in your home state it s an interesting same trend labrador is running against the lieutenant governor brad little and then tommy ahlquist who s a former physician a real estate developer who s saying i m the outsider in this race so some of the similar dynamics that you saw in last week s primaries the west virginia senate primary and the indiana senate primary so the question is if labrador is another house republican who makes a hard sell of saying hey look at my credentials in congress as i try to move up martin right detrow then we might be getting a sense that maybe voters are not in love with congress this cycle martin yeah so before i let you go there was news about the first lady melania trump she had some surgery detrow yeah she underwent a procedure it s actually the most serious procedure that a first lady has undergone since nancy reagan to deal with a kidney issue she ll be in the hospital for the rest of the week but president trump visited her yesterday says she s in good spirits she s doing well a lot of positive signs from the white house in terms of her recovery martin all right npr congressional correspondent scott detrow for us thanks
