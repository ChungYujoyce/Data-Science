 the iowa democratic party said monday night that results from the state s first in the nation caucus were indefinitely delayed due to quality checks and inconsistencies in some reporting ap newsincumbent president donald trump won the republican caucus with 97 of the vote iowa gopboth sides criticize the reporting failure and the caucus model in general at a moment when public faith in american institutions is declining what could be more fitting than a colossal screw up in counting the votes for the very first election of the new presidential election cycle allahpundit hot air as early as 8 48 pm eastern time the new york times was already reporting that problems with the app were giving rise to conspiracy theories a viral tweet suggested without evidence that the app was being used to somehow rig the process against bernie sanders it s really hard to imagine that the democratic party would alter the results in such a blatant fashion but many of sanders s supporters bear a grudge against the party from the 2016 primary and in the absence of a clear explanation for what s happening it s likely conspiracy theories like these will continue to spread that s really bad for the public s faith in the fairness of the process in an emotional and heated election against the backdrop of a process that many sanders fans thought was unfair in 2016 and a president who constantly accuses his opponents of cheating it s important that the us electoral system seem functional the iowa delay seems to be so far a step in the wrong direction zack beauchamp vox caucuses are a terrible way to pick a nominee there is no secret ballot so every nosy neighbor and busybody who prefers another candidate knows who you re supporting there is no access for those who work nights or need babysitters and this year democrats have a fairly arbitrary 15 percent threshold no delegates for anyone who falls below that line the two rounds of reallocation meant that supporters of those below the viability line started trying to form alliances out of survivor attempting to block delegates for other candidates apparently many democrats believe the electoral college is some sort of unfair menace but they re just fine where neighbors are trading snow shoveling or chocolate cookies in exchange to join their faction one group of supporters of unviable candidates decided to back cory booker who quit the race on january 13 this is the best day for his campaign in weeks pete buttigieg won a delegate on a coin toss and now apparently the results are being held up for quality checks jim geraghty national review the caucuses especially in this cursed year demand hours of commitment this limits the number and kind of people who can attend despite iowa democrats allowing satellite caucuses this year many people who work at night still cannot attend people who care for children or other relatives cannot attend people who have other commitments cannot attend those who cannot attend tend to be lower income of course and those people are supposedly the base of the democratic party it s madness to effectively exclude them from the caucus process it s time for a change jeffrey toobin cnn nothing could have more effectively underscored the ultimate irrelevance of iowa than a non result allowing everyone not named john delaney to claim a victory of sorts express their sense of optimism going forward and otherwise ignore the question of who actually won the message people are likely to take away from monday s contest is that the caucus is the worst of both worlds an ill understood antiquated anti democratic mess that systematically excludes parents working class people the shy and the otherwise socially well adjusted that has been taken over by well meaning tech consultants matthew walther the weekother opinions below this was not the first time the iowa caucuses have gone awry in 2012 republicans never truly knew whether rick santorum or mitt romney had gained more support and four years later confusion about the close gap between clinton and sanders led iowa democrats to reform their process with the hope of providing a more precise picture of which candidate had won the most votes and which candidate would receive the most delegates as monday turned into tuesday that picture had yet to emerge and iowa democrats will have to regroup yet again to figure out what went wrong whether they get another chance to get it right four years from now is another question entirely russell berman the atlantic it s worth noting that dozens of caucus sites reported little or no biden support and there were suggestions he may even finish in fifth place behind amy klobuchar this is probably because his ground game is weak and the argument for his candidacy is based on fear of trump rather than genuine enthusiasm his campaign was reduced to limply complaining about process to distract from the epic loss it s not a coincidence that both of biden s previous campaigns for president were disastrous flops for the moment everything is coming up bernie ryan cooper the week for six months some of president trump s most implacable foes have invested great hope in two republicans former rep joe walsh and former massachusetts gov william weld who are challenging the president for the gop nomination could they do some damage to trump s re election prospects tonight in iowa that hope was put to a first test it failed trump won 97 16 percent of the vote to walsh s 1 08 percent and weld s 1 27 percent others write ins of various people totaled 0 47 percent it was a striking show of strength for the president beyond that turnout was high for a year in which an incumbent president is assured of re nomination the last time there was a non competitive gop caucus that is a caucus with an incumbent president was in 2004 when president george w bush was in the white house that year about 8 000 republicans showed up for what were essentially meaningless caucuses this year the turnout was 32 004 byron york washington examiner only one candidate was truly able to declare himself victor on monday night big win for us in iowa
