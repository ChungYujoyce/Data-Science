president trump hosted correspondents from time for a nearly 100 minute wide ranging discussion on monday may 8 over a four course dinner in the blue room of the white house joined by vice president mike pence and two senior administration officials trump weaved between topics and frequently went off the record excerpts from his conversation with time editor nancy gibbs washington bureau chief michael scherer and white house correspondent zeke miller are below i find the job very natural for me i find it s a very big job obviously there s no job big like this no job is important like this but i think some of the i just think it s something that works for me it feels very natural to me and all i said the job it is it s a difficult job but it s a job that i find to be i love doing it i love helping people mike pence is doing a fantastic job he fits it so well i mean we have a great team he and i guess they say we re somewhat opposite and that works to be a very good combination more read time s cover story donald trump after hours it s never different i think it s never different it s always the same you have to know your subject and that would be the misconception of misconceptions for that i mean it s not that i look i always had health care for my company but it s not that i it was just something that wasn t high on my list i had people that negotiated for my company but in a short period of time i understood everything there was to know about health care and we did the right negotiating and actually it s a very interesting subject i think it is it could be my fault i don t want to necessarily blame but there s a great meanness out there that i m surprised at i mean i m surprised no i d like not to be but the only way you survive is to be combative i ll read stories in the new york times that are so one sided hey i know when i m successful i know victory okay i don t quite get it if i m going to do a job with the lowering taxes better health care take care of people take care of hospitalization all the things we re doing because there s no plan now you would think that people would like that and they don t i used to get the credit in business but they want to belittle everything you do business is easier because you put something up it s good whatever but the politics is tough when japanese prime minister shinz abe came from japan first thing he said to me when i first met him he walked out thank you thank you i said for what f 35 you bought you saved us one hundred million dollars because they re part of the group that buy the ninety planes it s a lot we get they get different allies but i saved japan a hundred million bucks took me probably an hour if i added up all the time but i will be saving when we put that out over two the two thousand five hundred planes billions of dollars nobody ever wrote a story about that but they said the f 35 program is now straightened out and the costs are way down they re down because of me then boeing when the f 18 i mean i must have got thirty five million of each plane off you know they had the f 35s they had thirty five of them fly over japan when defense secretary general james mattis was there and they were not detected by the radar they flew over and everyone said where the hell did they come from that s stealth it s pretty cool right thirty five of them flying at a high speed low and they were not detected they flew right over the top of the deal nobody knew they were coming pretty cool right you know the catapult is quite important so i said what is this sir this is our digital catapult system he said well we re going to this because we wanted to keep up with modern technology i said you don t use steam anymore for catapult no sir i said ah how is it working sir not good not good doesn t have the power you know the steam is just brutal you see that sucker going and steam s going all over the place there s planes thrown in the air it sounded bad to me digital they have digital what is digital and it s very complicated you have to be albert einstein to figure it out and i said and now they want to buy more aircraft carriers i said what system are you going to be sir we re staying with digital i said no you re not you going to goddamned steam the digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it s no good i ve done a lot with vice president mike pence where we have a meeting in the roosevelt room we ll have a lot of different people labor unions workers we had harley davidson up i ll say anybody ever see the oval office nobody s ever said they ve seen the oval office president obama was different he didn t not a lot of people invited in me i invite people in and it means something the oval office it means something to them i m telling you i ve had big people some of the biggest business people you ve seen it they go in they re like they can t believe it and i ve seen them cry it s weird i ll tell you i used to watch sports i don t watch i m now consumed by news and business i like the business stuff see there wasn t a second attempt there was only one attempt there was a mistake was we set a date now had we not set that date we would have had one time what we did was we started off and it changed until three or four days ago when it got passed but we set a date and when we didn t vote everyone said trump fails with health care the thing that surprised me is i said i m not stopping and everybody not one person said that was going to pass which was sort of surprising to me nobody thought it was going to pass everyone said and i d go to vice president mike pence i said remember i said they re talking like we don t have a chance of passing i ll tell you it was a great thing it was a great process because those two hundred plus people in congress i got to know almost every one of them and i developed a bond with many of them that you can only develop under fire and it was a great thing and again somebody wrote an article where they said this is one of the greatest learning experiences because donald trump has gotten to know every you know i was with them for eighteen hours a day calling you know what s interesting i m getting very good marks in foreign policy people would not think of me in that light i m just saying and you read the same things i read i m getting as and a s on foreign policy and nobody thought about it great relationship with german chancellor angela merkel one of the best in fact so good she invited my daughter over she loves ivanka ivanka was over there and did great but no i have a very good relationship with all of them including australia you saw that the other night right you know they all said i hung up and i slammed the phone on him i didn t do that i mean it was a little testy for a while because obama made a ridiculous deal but that wasn t australian prime minister malcolm turnbull s fault but we have a very good relationship with australia and him which i think the other night showed i get back former egyptian prisoner aya hijazi nobody could have done that nobody else could have done that they could have negotiated how tough is egyptian leader abdel fattah el sisi right nobody else could have done and he s a great guy nobody else could have gotten her back she would have been in jail for twenty eight years and that s not twenty eight years you re going away for one that s twenty eight years meaning twenty eight years i ve been doing this in all fairness when i first came into the office the first night you weren t here but they say sir we re ready to go i said where they had some people in a certain country yemen where they had them surveilled and they needed the go ahead to kill to kill them but in other words they wanted the right to go so they re telling me this and this happened for two or three weeks four weeks and they keep coming to me at weird times too i don t care about that and they re in parts of the world that most people have never even heard about they were in cities that nobody every heard about or towns and in some cases they re isis or al qaeda and so they say sir we have a situation we d like to be able to go and they tell me what then after about four or five weeks i said wait a minute by the time they get to me and i get back to them usually it s over anyway it s gone they re gone they couldn t fire you know under the obama administration they get back to them three or four weeks later and say it s okay to go they say okay to go they left three weeks ago so i said to myself i m a believer in professionals these people over there whether it s in iraq or in yemen or anywhere libya they went to west point or wherever annapolis they went to air force academy i said to the general i said how good the lieutenants the captains their majors their colonels they re professionals they love doing it they know every inch of the territory right i say why am i telling them so i authorized the generals to do the fighting you know you know i have a lot of respect for president xi jinping i have great respect for him i think we have a very good mutual liking of each other and i told you we had tremendous dialogue at mar a lago and mar a lago is a great place for the dialogue because there s a warmth to mar a lago that you just don t find anywhere else you can sit down in a chair and just talk for hours where in some places you don t have that and this is great i mean it s very different but you don t have that here it s not the same it s great in a different way we ve never had the relationship that we have now now in all fairness to president xi he loves china he loves his people and he is representing the people of china he s not representing the people of the united states so we ll see how that all turns out i think we have to be a strong nation i think we were being laughed at by the world they re not laughing anymore when i saw that i thought it was incredible and then he called them child actors and that was even that was just a terrible disrespect i mean when he actually said they were child actors who would even think of that but i felt something had to be done and the interesting thing is a friend of mine who s very much a warrior and a person over there a general said you know when they hit a barrel bomb right in the middle of a town the kids are more brutally damaged and people you have arms and legs and everything else laying all over the town where it is a real problem too but you know it just seemed when they start using gases it s something that is just terrible but honestly barrel bombs are incredible when you see the damage done by these my friend said to me that he said you know it s interesting he said you hit them because of the gases but the barrel bombs are worse he said what they do to people is unbelievable you have arms and legs laying two hundred yards away and despite that there was something about the gases it s just terrible and i guess it was also that he violated the deal that was done with obama he s got gas all over the place he s got gas all over the place we have to humiliate the enemy and if we don t humiliate them we re going to have our kids continuing to go and fight for isis we have kids leaving this country because they re so damned good at the internet isis they re better at the internet than google you know it s a smart enemy believe it or not and these kids are going over and fighting you know we ve gotten billions of dollars more in nato than hat we re getting all because of me i mean it s not like a bragging thing i m just saying if hillary clinton would have gotten in she wouldn t even know that we re getting screwed by everybody but we have gotten billions of dollars more coming in and coming in i asked one simple question i says is everybody paid up an they bring their chart and these countries haven t paid for years haven t paid a fair amount for years billions and billions and billions and billions of dollars and we re paying we re paying for it and they pay 2 and we pay close to 4 and in all fairness it s better for them than it is for us it s wonderful but its better for them and i get along great with merkel i got along great with all of them i said folks you gotta pay you gotta pay terrible incredible and terrible they re so brave i mean their legs are blown off their arms are blown off their faces their spirit s amazing it s incredible one guy had his leg blown off in afghanistan handsome guy really good looking guy and he was with his girlfriend his leg was blown off high you know all he can do because now they let them go back was with the prosthetic if you can it works out okay all he wants to do is go back it s amazing the spirit is so incredible i always say the president has a gift for hospitality i think people sense when they re around the president an open door a hospitality a graciousness i think it s i ve had more people tell me that it was the memory of a lifetime and it s just because of the kindness that he s shown large and small groups with his time and attention contact us at editors time com
