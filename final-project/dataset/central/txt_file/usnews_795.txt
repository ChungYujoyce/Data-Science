those activities sessions responded i have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and i didn t have did not have communications with the russians and i m unable to comment on it the senate confirmed sessions as attorney general by a vote of 52 47 the washington post reported that sessions had spoken twice in 2016 with russia s ambassador to the united states which he had not disclosed during his senate confirmation hearing in what trump would later view as the original sin according to former chief of staff reince priebus sessions recused himself from any justice

continue to serve as attorney general as long as that is appropriate trump also tweeted about sessions multiple times that month with insults such as this trump tweeted that sessions handling of surveillance abuse allegations was disgraceful angered by the fact that sessions had asked the inspector general to review potential fisa abuse instead of ordering an investigation but this time
