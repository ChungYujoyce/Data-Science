of whatdefines the nation america firstor an increasingly diverse population the character of our country is on the ballot declared former president barack obama back on the stump in miami if you don t want america to be overrun by masses of illegal aliens and giant caravans president trump warned at a rally in missouri you better vote republican since his inauguration two years ago the president

term and set the landscape for the re election campaign that already is underway more election day is almost here here s what you need to know before you cast your midterm ballot also here are the candidates poised to make history nov 6 related these democrats could make trump s life miserable if they win the house in the midterms calamitous language isn t exactly new to american politics and the assertion that just about everyelection is crucial has become a political trope but the 2018 midterms have been the most combustiblein more than a generation the arguments are fiercer and the lines more sharply drawn than even those marked by clashes over war vietnam in 1966 iraq in 2006 and scandal watergate in 1974 impeachment in 1998 one electorate has its hair on fire and thinks that donald trump is a threat to the republic lawrence jacobs director of the center for the study of politics and governance atthe university of minnesota said of democrats for republicans there s an ominous warning about chaos that the resistance movement will be the breakdown of law and order both sides see cataclysmic scenarios jacobs said one sign of this year s high passions is the rise in early voting instates from arizona to wisconsin by early sunday political scientist michael mcdonald of the university of florida had counted a record 34 3 million people who had voted by absentee or mail ballotor at early voting stations in the last midterm election in 2014 20 5 million voted early this year s total may be close to double that in an incendiary closing argument trump spotlighted a web video created by his campaign that accused democrats ofcomplicity in the deaths of two california sheriff s deputies who were killed by an undocumented mexican immigrant who isshown mocking police in court who else would democrats let in the ad asks court records show his case was handled primarily by republicans critics accused trump of exploiting the nation s racial divisions exaggerating the threat from undocumented immigrantsand misusing the powers of his office by vowing to ban birthright citizenship byexecutive order and by dispatching thousands of military troops to the southern border to repel the immigrants caravan which traveling on foot is weeks away from reaching the usa rep bennie thompson d miss in line to chair the homeland security committee if democrats win control of the house of representatives called the president s threats a political stunt aimed at whipping up fear and xenophobia just days before the election the election returns will direct but won t dissipate the nation s political heat if democrats win a majority in the house as nonpartisan analysts and strategists on both sides predict they will gain the authority to launch vigorous congressional oversight of the trump administration in general and the president in particular democrats hopeto win governorships held by republicans inrust belt states that were key in electing trump michigan ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin a half dozen other states that have gop governors have competitive contests from swing states such as florida and iowa to traditional republican strongholds in georgia and kansas victories in state capitols will have repercussions forcongressional redistricting after the 2020 census and during the 2020 campaign when presidential nominees could benefit from friendly governors statewide standing and their political organizations one thing at stake in this election then is the next one more midterms races for governor statehouses will help decide control of congress for a decade trump and other republicans are increasingly optimistic that the gop will maintain control of the senate perhaps even bolsteringits 51 seat majority i know we re doing well in the senate trump boasted though on friday he acknowledged for the first time that republicans could lose the house it could happen he said at a rally in huntington west virginia ten democratic held senate seats on the ballot are in states that trump carried in 2016 some by double digit margins that has put democrats on the defensive in indiana missouri montana and north dakota and it has made winning senate control an uphill struggle in contrast many of the most crucial house battlegrounds are in suburban districts where many college educated voters especially women have been repelled by trump s disruptive rhetoric and his hard line policies toward immigrants and others democrats need a net gain of at least 23 seats to take control the split decision if democrats flipthe house while republicans hold the senate would give each side bragging rights gop partisans would focus on the senate outcome as a huge validation of trump charlie cook of the nonpartisancook political report predicted and democratic partisans would argue thatthe house takeover was a huge repudiation of him everybody wakes up the next morning happy because they heard what they wanted to hear cook said up

will beheld in 27 of the nation s 100 biggest cities among them louisville kentucky nashville tennessee newark new jersey phoenix reno nevada san francisco and washington more young voter turnout in midterm elections is often dismal this year could be different the power to probe democrats will get more than a gavel if they win control of the house they d gain the ability to set the agenda and the authority to convene hearings call witnesses and issue subpoenas many of the prospective new chairmen already are making plans at the judiciary committee rep jerroldnadler d n y saidhe wouldinvestigate corruption accusations against trump and allegations of sexual misconduct and perjury against newly confirmed supreme court justice brett kavanaugh rep elijah cummings of maryland the ranking democrat on the oversight and government reform committee said he wouldpursue alleged fraud and abuse at the white house and in agencies including the environmental protection agency rep adam schiff d calif in line to chair the intelligence committee said he wouldrevive the investigation intowhether the trump campaign colluded with russians who interfered in the 2016 election a senate safety net maintaining republican control of the senate would make it easier for the white house to win confirmation of judicial nominees and officials in the cabinet where turnover is likely it would make it harder for democrats even if they ruled the house to pass legislation that republicans didn t support or that putthe white house on the spot in the most cataclysmic scenario for trump if the house considered articles of impeachment against the president a gop controlled senate could be a backstop in a trial over whether to remove him from office the demography of democracy the midterms have broken ground in the gender race religion and sexual orientation of candidates mostly democrats among the competitive races georgia could become the first state to elect an african american woman as governor kansas and new mexico could send the first native american women to serve in congress michigan and minnesota are poised to elect the first muslim women to congress an unprecedented number of women have been nominated by the major parties for office this year in part spurred by opposition to trump and by the metoo movement rutgers center for american women and politics reportedrecords at every level 23 female nominees for the senate 237 for the house 16 for governor though women are partisans to be sure some academic studies found that female officeholders tend to govern differently than male ones if the number of women in office significantly increases they could change the issues that get traction and the way some political coalitions are forged more 2018 midterms

bill clinton s chief of staff through the democrats catastrophic midterm election in 1994 and joined president obama s cabinet in 2009 heading the cia then the pentagon the debate in the country today feels ominous to him in his view a test of the need to restore checks and balances on the president in the past while there s been a lot of the politics and the ugliness we see today i always felt it was in the end about the future of the country and what needed to happen panetta said this one lacks that sense of where this country needs to go in the future and it s more about trying to tear down the institutions that are there it gives you the feeling that this country in many ways is at a real turning point a studysponsored by the baker center for leadership governance at georgetownuniversity found that americans view even basic institutions through a partisan lens democrats tend to trust the fbi and the news media republicans don t republicans tend to trust the executive branch democrats don t with a republican in the white house more than three of four republicans say they are satisfied with how democracy works fewer than half of democrats agree and there s this one thirdof democrats and of republicans say they believe members of the opposing party are a very serious threat to the united states and its people though some of the findings simply reflect the state of hyper partisanship political scientist joshua tucker of new york university said the risk is that common touchstones are being eroded and the basic bargain of democracy that it s acceptable and to be expected that the other side will sometimes prevail is being challenged the percentage who think the other party never has the interests of the country at heart at all he said that is going to translate to making it harder to govern that would be after election day
