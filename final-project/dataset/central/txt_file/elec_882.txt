encouraged him because of how she felt after she prayed she felt like that the lord said you know what he s capable you stick behind him because he can do it a fire and ice relationship today ann romney has gone from a massachusetts first lady most voters wouldn t recognize to practically a co candidate often the warm up act before her husband takes the stage and just as often headlining events on her own i think of ann romney as the fire in the fire and ice relationship between her and mitt says former massachusetts state treasurer joe malone a republican who has known ann romney since 1994 when her husband first ran for u s senate she has gone from the wife who was happy to be supportive of the husband and just keep him company in the car says malone to an opinionated woman who s highly valued and then on top of that someone who s a very effective communicator for the campaign dynamic down to earth and poised on the stump mrs romney learned the hard way she was most known in the 1994 race for her stumbles for example when she said she and her husband were so poor as students they had to sell some of their stocks or that she d never in her entire marriage had a fight with her husband today savvier and more experienced she s much more careful says donna sytek former new hampshire house speaker and chairwoman of the new hampshire republican party i remember standing with her at the polls and i was saying something mildly critical and she said watch out for the microphones they are very sensitive they have booms be aware sytek recalls mrs romney also

her senior year of high school cranbrook schools ap hide caption ann davies in a 1967 photo from her senior year of high school but her real passion and focus has been raising her five sons my career choice was to be a mother she explained on fox news after she was criticized by a democrat for not working a day in her life romney explained as she often does on the stump that both she and her husband believed her work at home to be most important he was making money and he would come home and say ann my job is temporary but your job is a forever job that s going to bring forever happiness by all accounts mrs romney was a hands on mom she barely hired the nannies or domestic help she certainly could have according to wheelwright her friend from church they painted their own house they worked in their yard sweating and dirty wheelwright says and they just both felt so strongly that we don t have someone in there cleaning their bedrooms and doing the dishes for them because that s what they should do romney did volunteer work in the community and for her church such as teaching an early morning seminary for high school kids she taught the old testament and then the new testament and then the book of mormon says wheelwright whose own sons attended the classes those kids every morning at 6 15 were there for 45 minutes and the kids loved her finding her faith ann romney herself was brought up with little organized religion by her welsh immigrant father and her mother whose family goes back to the mayflower she started learning about mormonism in high school while dating romney and decided as a teenager to convert gov george romney tutored her and baptized her while mitt was doing missionary work in france and she married mitt shortly after he returned her mom and dad were not happy about this at all says romney biographer and distant cousin r b scott ann romney may be traditional but she s always been willing to buck convention and her parents he says one example was when her mother a fervent believer in zero population growth objected to the romneys ever growing family her mom began to complain about you ve drunk the kool aid the mormon kool aid you re having a big family you re destroying the earth ann apparently said ok mom i want to maintain a relationship with you but if this continues we re not going to have a relationship it is perhaps a testament to her sway that ann romney s two brothers both converted to mormonism shortly after her and so did even her mother shortly before her death when she decides something i don t think anything stops her wheelwright says a dark hole and it s also how ann romney approached the biggest challenge she s faced when she was suddenly diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998 those were scary horrible hard hard years recalls wheelwright there s no doubt they were afraid romney talks about it openly now she described to abc what she called the dark hole she was in i can t stand to even be reminded of how sick i was she said it wasn t just the feeling sick it s the unknown of where is this taking me and how long is this going to go on and is it going to drag me down so much that i have nothing left in life at all eventually through sheer will and some alternative therapies romney beat her ms into remission and built herself back up to the point where she became a champion equestrian romney says dressage a sport sometimes referred to as horse ballet saved her life democrats point to the arcane pursuit in which riders in top hats prance and pirouette on horseback as proof that romney is elitist and out of touch but it s a contention romney vigorously denies look maybe i haven t struggled as much financially as some people have she said recently on fox news but i can tell you and promise you that i ve had struggles in my life and mitt and i have compassion for people that are struggling a ferocious defender republican presidential candidate mitt romney and his wife ann greet supporters during an illinois primary victory party in march scott olson getty images hide caption republican presidential candidate mitt romney and his wife ann greet supporters during an illinois primary victory party in march romney says her priorities as first lady would be helping to find a cure for multiple sclerosis and breast cancer which she also survived and she says she would continue her work with at risk children and against teen pregnancy romney has said publicly that she doesn t agree with her husband on every issue but wheelwright says she can t imagine romney trying to get mixed up in policy decisions she would certainly be willing to share any of her feelings if mitt asked her but she s a smart lady i think she knows her place that is as a trusted adviser on everything from strategy to selecting a vice president she is so much a part of the team she speaks in terms of we and she couldn t be more passionate about her role promoting and protecting her husband as she was recently when condemning the obama campaign for a strategy she said was centered on personal attacks we heard what their strategy was it was kill romney she told cbs news in july and i was like not when i m next to him you better not she is ferocious about defending mitt says malone the former massachusetts treasurer i think it s very much like nancy reagan where she would put her antenna up and watching the vibe and i think ann romney is very in tune with what s going on around mitt perhaps her most important role is just being there mrs romney says her family calls her the mitt stabilizer her husband would be the first to agree that he s better when she s with him if i m away from ann for longer than a week or so i get off course he told cnn s piers morgan she has to bring me back and moderate me down a bit if you watch him when he goes into a room he is always looking around to see where ann is asking where s ann says scott the romney biographer there is this connection between the two that is intense and she provides the anchor and the confidence that he needs more than 45 years after they started dating he still introduces her as my sweetheart given where she s come from she calls it nothing less than a miracle to be out on the stump hoping her high school sweetheart will also be the next president npr thanks our sponsors become
