the clintons 2015 tax returns the couple earned 3 1 million from book advances and royalties donald trump has described himself as really rich but by just about any standard that label fits both the republican presidential nominee and his democratic rival hillary clinton in an election year characterized by populist energy over economic concerns like jobs and trade the gap is striking clinton s newly released tax returns show that she and her husband former president bill clinton made more than 10 million in 2015 trump is under pressure to follow suit but he has yet to release his returns he says he s a multi billionaire but his refusal to release the documents has led to speculation that trump may not be as rich as he claims what s clear is that both trump and clinton earn vastly more than the income of the typical american household around 54 000 per year so it s no surprise the candidates have been trying and sometimes struggling to connect with average voters money money money

her speech to the democratic national convention last month clinton said in the rodham family no one had their name on big buildings my family were builders of a different kind clinton talked about her grandfather working to build a better life by working in a lace mill in scranton pa and her father s experience running a small business of course clinton grew up in an upper middle class suburb of chicago and her father did well as the owner of a drapery business trump too has tried to demonstrate that he understands the lives of regular people speaking to the national association of home builders in miami thursday trump reminisced about his father also a builder touring some of his construction sites my father would go and he d pick up the sawdust and he d pick up the nails the extra nails and he d pick up the scraps of wood he d use whatever he could use and recycle it in some form or sell it and it was a constant process trump said and he did a beautiful job at a campaign rally

they want you to say what you mean and mean what you say despite trump s massive wealth his willingness to say just about anything to just about anyone at any time has strengthened his credibility luntz said with working class people who are tired of being talked down to but luntz added that trump s slipping poll numbers over the past few weeks suggest his style may be turning off the upper middle class voters the republican party has long relied upon npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
