pretty good relationship senate republican aides expect a deal to emerge this week even though mcconnell hasn t signed off on anything and passing legislation during a pro forma session scheduled for thursday would require consent from every senator that is a very tall order there s already the uncertainty about this program and it s discouraging people from applying the closer we let it go to banks not accepting applications the worse it gets there s a sense of urgency it s just a matter of what s going to be demanded to get it across the finish line said a gop aide if trump endorses the deal however it would be tough for any republican to stand in the way especially since the add ons requested by democrats are 100 billion more for hospitals 150 billion more for state and local governments and a 15 percent increase in the supplemental nutrition assistance program ford o connell a republican strategist said democrats think they have leverage on the president because they re going to say he s in charge of the economy at the same time if you re trump and you bow to all of their demands their demands are only going to get bigger he added the white house would like to get it resolved as soon as possible the white house doesn t want to wait until may they want to get a good deal done he said the democrats feel that they have so much leverage that they have the republicans over a barrel and they re waiting for the republicans to blink some gop staffers warn that schumer and pelosi may be forgetting that mnuchin doesn t speak for republican senators and can t guarantee that they will be on board with any deal he and the president agree to mcconnell said last week that he would favor providing more money for hospitals and health care providers down the line but talk of adding hospital funding to the 251 billion for the small business administration will set off a battle among senators who want to tweak the formula and get special benefits for their home states

soon as thursday at the present run rate we re going to be out of money kudlow told fox business network the small business administration s economic injury disaster loan program a direct lending
