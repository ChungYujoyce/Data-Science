on sunday the new york times published the article examining tara reade s sexual assault allegation against joe biden it followed up monday with an interview in which dean baquet the executive editor explained why the story was published 19 days after the initial allegation new york timeson tuesday former president barack obama endorsed joe biden this followed senator bernie sanders s endorsement of biden on monday ap newslast thursday biden proposed a plan to lower the medicare eligibility age to 60 and forgive student debt for low income and middle class individuals who have attended public colleges and universities medium the left is divided about reade s allegation and biden s plan there have been a number of sneering columns accusing liberal feminists of hypocrisy for not championing reade as fervently as they did christine blasey ford who claimed during brett kavanaugh s supreme court nomination fight that he d sexually assaulted her when they were both in high school the truth is if blasey had been so inconsistent in telling her story feminists might still have believed her but they likely wouldn t have made her a cause c l bre and democrats on capitol hill never would have invited her to testify publicly advocates for victims of sexual harassment and assault would worry that using such an ambiguous case as a political weapon would undermine their cause it would be easier to know what to do with tara reade s accusation that joe biden sexually assaulted her if her tale were more solid or if it were less michelle goldberg new york times the times article attempts to address the inevitable calculus voters will have to make in november by providing a thorough accounting of the pattern of behavior laid out by the more than 20 women who ve accused trump of sexual harassment or assault indeed before they describe reade s allegation in any detail lerer and ember write that the allegations against trump go far beyond the accusations against mr biden it s not wrong to consider how a sexual assault allegation might affect a political candidate s chances but lerer and ember chose to forgo any informed political analysis in favor of a simpler comparison whose sexual assault allegations are worse there s a reason why trump brought bill clinton s accusers to a 2016 presidential debate by reminding voters of another set of sexual abuse allegations trump sought to minimize and deflect from his own there may well be voters who ll choose their vote for president based on who has drawn a longer list of sexual assault allegations and they should feel free to compare biden and trump by that measure but journalists should know better than to engage in this obfuscating exercise of relativity christina cauterucci slate regarding biden s plan critics note that biden s response to the young people demanding a better health policy is to offer a policy that won t help any of them for decades and to understand just how pitifully stingy this concession is remember that dozens of democratic senators including plenty of moderates have already endorsed lowering the medicare eligibility age to 55 you can find an op ed in forbes not exactly the democratic socialists of america newsletter suggesting 50 would be a better age bill clinton proposed 55 in 1998 and hillary clinton advocated 55 in 2016 biden s plan is not nothing but it s about as close to nothing as a policy can get without literally being nothing and it shows that biden isn t serious about courting the left nathan robinson the guardian others however point out that in state after state young voters enthusiasm for mr sanders failed to translate into cold hard votes fair or not their inability to deliver on his behalf will not go unnoticed in political circles and going forward candidates will be that much more hesitant to pin their chances on this demographic sitting this election out for whatever reason would not serve young voters interests in the short or long term they need to show up and be counted like never before even if only to write in a protest candidate once they establish themselves as a reliable force they won t again have to beg and bargain with politicians to take them seriously editorial board new york times regarding sanders s endorsement endorsement events typically follow one of two scripts either they re grudging affairs in which the vanquished competitor admits defeat for the good of the party or they re obsequious events in which the vanquished competitor angles for a future position or favor this wasn t either of those the closest analogue was what you see in multi party systems where one party wins the election and absorbs its nearest competitors into a governing coalition by giving them substantive influence over the agenda and key staffing appointments one concern liberals and leftists have long had with biden is his instinct for cutting deals means he ll sell them out to the right to win republican votes maybe so but what biden is proving in this campaign is he s just as willing to cut deals with the left and his coalitional approach to politics is an opportunity for them to influence him as well rhetorically biden has run as barack obama s vice president harkening back in his service in the last democratic white house but biden s approach to politics was formed in the senate and substantively that s the approach that s come to define his campaign for all that biden has talked about governing like obama he s winning very much like himself ezra klein vox the right is critical of the times coverage and biden s policies the right is critical of the times coverage and biden s policies do you recall the times searching the twitter feed of kavanaugh s accuser christine blasey ford or spending weeks digging up dirt that could make her seem a flake as the lerer ember story does with reade reade is making charges about events in 1993 when she was in her 20s and biden was 51 ford s claims were even older about events in 1982 when all involved were in high school unlike reade ford had no one confirming she d told the same story at the time indeed everyone she cited as a witness said that nothing like the party she described had ever happened yet the times and ideological allies at other publications as well as in politics played up every allegation against kavanaugh pumping up their apparent credibility exactly as it seeks to undermine reade s credibility now editorial board new york post the times attempted to explain its long silence in an interview between executive editor dean baquet and media columnist ben smith no coherent excuse was found in this attempt at transparency baquet suggests that kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way as if joe biden isn t and flip flops on whether contemporaneous corroboration which ford did not produce is necessary for reporting an assault allegation worse than that baquet appeared to acknowledge that he edited out a reference to other accusations against biden at the behest of the biden campaign tara reade s account of biden s alleged assault has once again exposed the fact that people tend to put their moral principles on hold when their partisan interests are at stake if that is true of voters and parties it is equally true of the new york times jonathan s tobin national review regarding obama s endorsement the voters who still need to be convinced the far left bernie sanders supporters will not be convinced by obama or his charisma even the vermont senator has been unable to sway some of his supporters including his own press secretary so there s little chance that obama whose ideology and policies align with biden s would be more influential besides obama s past endorsements haven t been worth much it s not that obama isn t popular quite the opposite actually but he s never been able to generate the same kind of enthusiasm for other democratic candidates that he s earned for himself indeed one look at his track record suggests his endorsements might have actually hurt these candidates throughout his tenure democrats lost dozens of congressional seats control of both congressional chambers and 10 governorships despite obama s attempts to energize his base kaylee mcghee washington examiner regarding biden s student debt plan the problem it seeks to solve unaffordable tuition at public universities is extremely overstated free college supporters argue that tuition at these public institutions the only colleges covered by biden s plan has risen to unaffordable levels especially for students from low and middle income families but this claim is usually based on published sticker prices at universities rather than the net prices that students actually pay after their financial aid is applied in other words free college advocates measure college affordability before factoring in existing policies meant to make college more affordable this radical new approach to the issue proposed by biden and sanders is a solution in search of a problem jason delisle national review finally one of trump s great successes has been in strengthening the u s military after a multiyear investment drought under the obama administration that drought weakened the u s military s readiness and reduced u s deterrent power biden calls for defense cuts but simultaneously attacks trump for weakening western security if he wants to be both realistic and persuasive what biden should be saying is that he ll provide for a military which deters adversary aggression and if necessary ends it to deter china and russia we need more than ships satellites missiles intelligence networks bombers electronic warfare units jets marines and maneuver enabled soldiers we also need vast logistics chains experienced noncommissioned officers and capable commanding officers that costs a lot of money but it s the price we pay for an international order that favors individual freedom the rule of law and free movement and trade biden should add that even as we should show greater respect to our friends so also must we ask them to provide greater support for the defense of our common interests that would be the foundation of a defense policy that makes sense biden s current approach isn t credible tom rogan washington examiner people are loving the adventures of this hedgehog and its bengal best friend bored panda
