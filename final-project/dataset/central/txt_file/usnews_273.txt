president donald trump says states should seriously consider reopening their public schools before the end of the academic year even though dozens already have said it would be unsafe for students to return until the summer or fall trump made the comments monday in a call with governors discussing how to reopen their economies among other topics some of you might start thinking about school openings because a lot of people are wanting to have the school openings it s not a big subject young children have done very well in this disaster that we ve all gone through he said while addressing vice president mike pence trump added that it s something they can seriously consider and maybe get going on later in the call colorado gov jared polis said his state s schools are not reopening fully before summer but hope to open some buildings for special education meetings and for small groups of students in vocational programs we re hoping at least for those last few weeks that kids who are taking classes that need the physical equipment they can come in in smaller groups polis said but we want to reconfigure it with better social distancing for next school year trump made the comments as the centers for disease control and prevention worked to finalize guidelines for reopening the economy for schools that included putting students desks 6 feet 1 8 meters apart serving meals in the classroom instead of the cafeteria and closing playgrounds reopening schools is considered key to getting the economy moving again without a safe place for kids many parents would have difficulty returning to work but some education officials say opening schools quickly would bring major risk and little reward especially since the end of the school year is approaching are they going to reopen for two weeks three weeks said daniel domenech executive director of the american association of school administrators it s not the right thing to do particularly when we re involving the safety and welfare of our students at a white house news conference monday trump acknowledged that there s little time left in the school year even as he said many states are thinking about getting kids back into the classroom i think you ll see a lot of schools open up even if it s for a very short period of time he said in terms of what this vicious virus goes after young people seem to do very well young people seem to do very well so i know that there are some governors that aren t necessarily ready to open up states but they may be ready to open up the school systems schools across the nation have closed during the coronavirus pandemic and dozens of states have ordered their schools to remain closed through the rest of this academic year only a few have publicly discussed earlier openings including montana which says school districts can resume classroom instruction on may 7 in many districts officials have said it s still unclear whether students will be able to return to the classroom by next fall and even if they do many are planning for social distancing measures that could make school look radically different from the past los angeles mayor eric garcetti said on cnn that it s way too early to reopen his city s schools adding that you don t get a lot of credit for moving too quickly to reopen responding to trump s comments one of the nation s largest teachers unions said there s still much work to be done before schools can open safely the american federation of teachers said there needs to be better testing and tracking for the virus and schools must have access to personal protective equipment it s good the president understands that reopening society and the economy hinges on successfully and safely reopening schools said randi weingarten the union s president but the question should not be whether we open schools but how we do it safely covid 19 is a terrible virus that has already taken too many lives and in the absence of a vaccine there is no magic wand or magic elixir as the president would have us believe if schools reopen too quickly and end up spreading the coronavirus they could be held legally liable said francisco negr n chief legal officer for the national school boards association and while coronavirus cases have been mild among u s children many schools have students with medical conditions that could make them vulnerable he said the foremost concern for schools is going to be safety of their students and safety of their employees negr n said in the cdc s draft guidelines for schools the agency suggested a three phase reopening process for schools in communities with low levels of covid 19 spread and those with confidence that the incidence of infection is genuinely low the guidance encourages schools to create isolation areas for students who develop symptoms and if anyone with covid 19 is found to have been in the building it advises schools to shut down for one or two days to clean and disinfect domenech of the school administrators association said the guidelines pose significant logistical hurdles trying to keep younger students 6 feet 1 8 meters apart could prove to be impossible he said and many schools have so many students they would violate suggested limits on large gatherings still schools are looking for ways to limit student interaction as they reopen including plans to bring only a portion of the students in at once schools might bring half the students in for the morning for example and rotate in the other half for the afternoon while they re at home students could keep taking classes online domenech said everybody wants to have the kids back he said we understand the impact that this has on the economy you have working parents and they need their kids to be safe and in a school environment so they can go back to work sooner or later schools will have to reopen the question is how this story has been corrected to show later during trump s call with governors colorado gov jared polis said some of his state s schools hoped to reopen for small groups of students contact us at editors time com
