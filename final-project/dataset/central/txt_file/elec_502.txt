in the u s darron cummings ap hide caption canadian athletes hold up the national flag during the 2014 winter olympics in sochi russia sen ted cruz was born in calgary and some question his eligibility to run for president in the u s there will be a question from some about texas sen ted cruz s eligibility to run for president that s because even though cruz grew up in texas he was born in canada he renounced his canadian citizenship in 2013 democrats are sure to remind voters of cruz s canadian birth since some on the right have questioned where president obama was born the president is a native of hawaii sen ted cruz says because his mother was born in the united states that makes him a natural born citizen and eligible to run for president scott olson getty images hide caption sen ted cruz says because his mother was born in the united states that makes him a natural born citizen and eligible to run for president the u s constitution says presidential candidates have to be natural born citizens but the supreme court has never weighed in with a definition leaving it open to interpretation it s a question that has come up before in 2008 senators passed a resolution making it clear for example that john mccain was allowed to run given that he was born on a u s military base in the panama canal zone barack obama and hillary clinton both senators then voted for it barry goldwater the 1964 gop nominee was born in arizona when it was a territory not a state and some questioned george romney s eligibility to run in 1968 because he was born in mexico romney s parents were u s residents cruz s parents worked in the oil industry in calgary canada when he was born his mother was born in the united states his father was born in cuba but later became a u s resident cruz argues that because his mother was born in delaware he is in fact a natural born citizen article ii section 1 of the u s constitution states no person except a natural born citizen shall be eligible to the office of president u s constitution hide caption and most legal scholars agree in fact two of the best known supreme court lawyers who are not normally on the same side make the case that cruz as were mccain george romney and goldwater is eligible to run neal katyal who served as acting solicitor general in the obama administration and paul clement who was solicitor general under george w bush wrote earlier this month in the harvard law review that there is no question cruz is eligible they say that because cruz s mother was a u s citizen and his father was a u s resident cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a natural born citizen within the meaning of the constitution and the naturalization act of 1790 they also point to british common law and enactments by the first congress both of which have been cited by the supreme court both confirm that the original meaning of the phrase natural born citizen includes persons born abroad who are citizens from birth based on the citizenship of a parent as to the british practice laws in force in the 1700s recognized that children born outside of the british empire to subjects of the crown were subjects themselves and explicitly used natural born to encompass such children these statutes provided that children born abroad to subjects of the british empire were natural born subjects to all intents constructions and purposes whatsoever the framers of course would have been intimately familiar with these statutes and the way they used terms like natural born since the statutes were binding law in the colonies before the revolutionary war they were also well documented in blackstone s commentaries a text widely circulated and read by the framers and routinely invoked in interpreting the constitution no doubt informed by this longstanding tradition just three years after the drafting of the constitution the first congress established that children born abroad to u s citizens were u s citizens at birth and explicitly recognized that such children were natural born citizens the naturalization act of 1790 provided that the children of citizens of the united states that may be born beyond sea or out of the limits of the united states shall be considered as natural born citizens provided that the right of citizenship shall not descend to persons whose fathers have never been resident in the united states the actions and understandings of the first congress are particularly persuasive because so many of the framers of the constitution were also members of the first congress that is particularly true in this instance as eight of the eleven members of the committee that proposed the natural born eligibility requirement to the convention served in the first congress and none objected to a definition of natural born citizen that included persons born abroad to citizen parents katyal and clement conclude there are plenty of serious issues to debate in the upcoming presidential election cycle the less time spent dealing with specious objections to candidate eligibility the better fortunately the constitution is refreshingly clear on these eligibility issues npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
