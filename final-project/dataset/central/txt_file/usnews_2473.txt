pundits have been drawing comparisons between president donald trump and president richard nixon for basically as long as trump has been in office and especially since special counsel robert mueller began his investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election but those comparisons don t usually come from trump himself an exception came on sunday when president trump tweeted in light of news that white house counsel don mcgahn had met with mueller s team that mcgahn wasn t a john dean type rat because he wasn t testifying behind the back of the white house dean as nixon s white house counsel played a key role by deciding to cooperate with prosecutors in events leading up to the president s resignation in 1974 tapes validated his senate watergate committee testimony about the president s role in the attempt to cover up the break in at the watergate office of the democratic national committee dean pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice for his role in the cover up and spent four months in confinement at fort holabird i certainly didn t want to commit any crimes he told time in a tuesday afternoon phone call and i wish that i had had somebody i could draw on or somebody s experience i could have drawn on as it turns out there was somebody who could draw on his experience namely michael cohen trump s former personal lawyer who on tuesday pleaded guilty to tax evasion campaign finance violations and making false financial statements and made statements under oath about his actions during the trump campaign cohen s plea came on the same day that a jury found former trump campaign chairman paul manafort guilty of eight counts of bank and tax fraud related to his work as a political consultant abroad dean spoke to time about his reaction to that news and what he thinks of his own return to the headlines below is the transcript edited for clarity of that conversation when michael cohen appeared in court to plead guilty today he stated that he arranged payments made to two women who alleged they d had affairs with then candidate donald trump at the direction of the candidate in order to influence the election what s your reaction to that he has pretty much identified the president as a criminal he said he did it at his behest if trump weren t president he probably would be named as a co conspirator and indicted what does that mean for the comparisons to watergate it s conspiracy watergate was a conspiracy this is a campaign conspiracy in other news from today what s your reaction to the manafort trial verdict it s not surprising it s clear that jury went carefully through the case i wouldn t be surprised if they were somewhat affected by the speed with which the judge forced the prosecution to put the trial on which made some of it confusing to them but they seemed to get the big issues they got the bank fraud understood that it s an opening shot by the special counsel it really sets up the situation that manafort was in what did you think of trump calling you a rat for your role in exposing the watergate cover up that just didn t surprise me at all every day he throws invective at somebody i was trying to be the honest guy and stop all this nonsense of spinning and lying and twisting history i was more distressed or annoyed by him calling the true public servants who have taken salary cuts to go to work for bob mueller thugs that s just so uncalled for these are men who are committed to the rule of law who are doing the honorable thing it s just disappointing coming out of the president of the united states he s just denigrating the office every day he s there in recent weeks and especially after this weekend s tweet you ve found yourself back in the headlines for something that happened decades ago how does it feel to have basically gone viral it s not surprising it s a culmination of what s been going on i didn t know when michael cohen was going to plead or work a deal out but i knew it was imminent because i was talking to his lawyer lanny davis whom i know personally and he was picking my brain as to what had happened and how it had all happened back during watergate he knows that subject pretty well so he was just refreshing his recollection i wasn t giving legal advice just historical information since you and mcgahn and cohen were all in the position of being the president s lawyer in some way though in very different situations one of the questions that has come up is how attorney client privilege might apply in mcgahn s situation in particular since that was how the president drew you in how do you think that legal concept applies mcgahn is certainly drawing the right lessons from what i went through one of the interesting things that was resolved because of watergate is the whole issue of when a lawyer represents an institution or organization who the client is and it s not the constituents of the organization or entity or whatever you describe it as it is rather the organization itself so in this instance they made it very clear that he represents the office of the president and not the man who occupies the office and there s a huge difference attorney client privilege certainly runs to his private counsel but in most instances does not run to his government counsel while trump can obviously hire and fire any lawyer he wants it s not likely a public employee lawyer is going to bear down on him like a private counsel might because i don t think trump is the kind of client that most people would recognize who opens up and really tells them what s going on i suspect john dowd trump s former personal attorney really has not a clue exactly what trump did and didn t do what happened is richard nixon who is extremely competent really bungled watergate and never hired a lawyer who knew how to advise him nixon didn t draw on eminent local washington defense lawyers and trump has done the same it s amazing nixon finally hired a good lawyer after he left office he hired jack miller who had been the head of the criminal division of the justice department but it was too late what do you think will happen next it s not clear unlike watergate how the public is going to become educated about all this there is really no equivalent to the senate watergate committee the republicans just won t set it up they don t want to inform the public about this so as long as they control the house and senate they re not going to let s say the house goes democratic after the election i suspect we will learn through a combination of oversight committees if not by reinvigorating the intelligence committee of the house under adam schiff it s really important that the public understands this that really happens best when you get live witnesses in front of the house and senate explaining these things mueller s doing a counterintelligence investigation which properly shouldn t be made public it involves a lot of sources and methods that could put a lot of people s lives and their families in jeopardy by revealing what we know about what the government has learned of russia s activities but it s vital and the fact that trump is doing everything to inhibit that is again unspeakable is there anything you learned during that time that would useful for people to keep in mind as this news develops it s early watergate went on for years and it takes time for the public to one learn two even get interested in learning and three react that s one of the things that watergate certainly teaches us what s very useful and what got me through the whole matter was my belief that the truth ultimately prevails write to olivia b waxman at olivia waxman time com
