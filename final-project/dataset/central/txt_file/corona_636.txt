home many americans have been able to shift their lives online but some 42 million people cannot loading april 7 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic forces americans out of their workplaces classrooms and social spaces and into their homes the internet has become for many the only link to society but 42 million americans don t have access to high speed internet for some it is simply a matter of access as broadband isn t as ubiquitous in rural areas as it may seem in cities and suburbs but having the option of purchasing high speed internet is only part of the puzzle you also need to be able to afford it the result is a sharp divide along racial and class lines over who has broadband one that like many economic divides is becoming starker as the pandemic wears on as the lockdown continues a number of internet service providers are taking steps to ensure access it s encouraging to see isps rising to the occasion says tyler cooper editor in chief of broadbandnow a company that helps people find and compare internet service providers the internet is no longer a luxury it s really a prerequisite for participating in modern life when amy olsen wants to have a video chat with her family she has to drive four miles to the parking lot of the lowell vermont town clerk to use the free wi fi none of lowell s 879 or so residents have access to direct broadband service according to broadbandnow a company that helps people find and compare internet service providers the closest anyone there can get is fixed wireless which uses outdoor directional antennas to broadcast radio signals to residential wi fi gateways but for that you need to live close enough to an antenna ms olsen doesn t instead she uses a sluggish satellite connection which is fine for sending email and downloading web pages but not for much else video she says is slow and bouncy ms olsen is far from alone as endless social media feeds and youtube videos emphasize that we re all in this together a huge swath of the population is finding itself digitally erased from the conversation some 42 million americans and a quarter of all rural residents lack access to broadband according to a february 2020 report from broadbandnow even among those who live in places where broadband is offered for many it remains out of reach just 41 of households with incomes below 20 000 have broadband at home

the internet has become for many the only link to society amid a steady stream of news stories about teleconferencing remote learning and netflix binging those without reliable online access are finding themselves shut out when you re online and most of your people are online it feels like we re all online says jessamyn west a vermont librarian who teaches people how to use computers but the whole world is bigger than what s on the internet on monday a bipartisan quartet of lawmakers urged congress to include dedicated broadband funding for students and low income families in the fourth coronavirus response package in a letter to congressional leaders two republicans sen kevin cramer of north dakota and rep roger marshall of kansas and two democrats sen amy klobuchar of minnesota and rep peter welch of vermont wrote that absent legislation small providers may be unable to continue to help ensure that the communities they serve can access distance learning and telehealth services several studies have demonstrated a strong link between broadband access and economic prosperity an analysis conducted by microsoft published last april found that u s counties with the highest unemployment also had the lowest broadband usage low income areas tend to be more rural says tyler cooper broadbandnow s editor in chief that creates sort of a vicious cycle municipal broadband initiatives however can help turn this vicious cycle into a virtuous one mr cooper cites chattanooga tennessee where in 2010 the city s electric power board began offering fiber optic connections to all residents today the city boasts download speeds of 1 gigabit per second about 40 times the national average ten years ago that town was kind of a ghost town says mr cooper when this network came into play all of a sudden you had these really attractive prospects for companies within five years chattanooga whose population stands at about 180 000 had generated between 2 800 and 5 200 new jobs according to a study by the utility and its lightning fast broadband speeds had earned it a new nickname gig city of course having the option of purchasing high speed internet is only part of the puzzle you also need to be able to afford it a recent study by the u k internet comparison site cable found that prices in the united states the country that created the internet ranked 119th out of 195 nations with an average internet package costing 67 69 a month the same package in mexico by comparison costs 33 15 and in canada it costs 34 86 the result is a sharp divide along racial and class lines over who has broadband one that like all such divides is becoming starker as the pandemic lockdown wears on according to a 2015 pew report just 54 of black americans and 50 of hispanic residents have broadband at home compared with 72 of their white counterparts according to the report more americans are relying on their smartphones to get online which works fine for consuming content but is difficult for say composing a r sum we re all participating in this mass experiment we re shifting large amounts of our economy into this online world says mr cooper without a doubt this crisis will show us pretty definitively the importance of broadband in the home america s digital divide is not just about access to technology says ms west but what she calls digital readiness which she defines as the combination of skills but also trust plus willingness to use technology it s not just can you click a button she says it s do you understand how the systems work so that you can use the tools the skills are one set of things you teach people says ms west but even if somebody told you how to do copy and paste if you don t know how to evaluate a website or you don t know how to go through all the hurdles of putting your credit card online you re in a not as ready position to do the things you need to do for students the sudden shift to online learning can widen this gap now some students are having their education streamed to them on home computers in their parents home offices while others are making do with their phones in crowded apartments education was in some ways the great leveler for a universal basic level of study says ms west everyone gets a clean bathroom and a meal they can afford and an education that is geared more or less toward everybody for ms olsen a librarian at the lanpher memorial library in hyde park vermont andthe president of the vermont library association her lack of reliable internet access forced her family to make a wrenching choice her two children students at the university of vermont in burlington are spending the lockdown not back at home but with friends who have broadband it was a hard decision she says i can call but i can t see their faces as the lockdown drags on a number of internet service providers are attempting to ensure access comcast for instance has agreed not to disconnect anyone s service or charge late fees along with charter communications the company has agreed to open free wi fi hotspots across the country comcast charter and spectrum are also offering free trial periods of 60 or 90 days to low income households and around the country many school districts are repurposing their buses as mobile wi fi hotspots to help ensure that their students stay connected get the monitor stories you care about
