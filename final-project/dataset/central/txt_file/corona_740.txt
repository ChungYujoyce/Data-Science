dire projections of u s deaths from the coronavirus are placing new scrutiny on the trump administration s initial response while prompting questions about whether faster action could have lowered the death toll the white house presented sobering numbers on tuesday that the best case scenario with full mitigation measures in place is between 100 000 and 240 000 deaths in the united states those figures would exceed the u s death toll from the vietnam war and korean war combined the numbers have raised questions specifically about why the u s was slow to roll out tests to identify the virus while bringing new criticism on president trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more for downplaying the virus s threat earlier this year furthermore some say the u s is still not responding quickly enough a number of states do not have stay at home orders and florida where some officials see an emerging outbreak only issued one on wednesday the grim outlook has brought criticism to trump and the federal government along with state officials seen as not reacting quickly enough to the pandemic lawrence gostin a public health expert at georgetown university said the death toll would be dramatically lower if the united states had taken earlier action we wasted many weeks before we implemented social distancing and before we ramped up testing he said even today the testing is spotty and social distancing is a patchwork across the country ashish jha director of harvard s global health institute said on cnn wednesday morning that earlier testing and earlier orders for people to stay at home would have made a difference i don t know any public health expert who does not believe that if we had gotten our testing together if we had gotten our hospitals ready if we had communicated and gotten a lot of our lockdown orders going much earlier we wouldn t have a very different situation jha said we clearly would have top government experts have said that s not completely clear to them asked by cnn s jim acostajames jim acostain the age of trump media bias comes into the spotlight trump officials don t wear masks on trip to mask making facility trump rips cnn reporter for self congratulation question you don t have the brains you were born with more at a press briefing on tuesday whether the death projections could have been lower with earlier action anthony faucianthony faucitrump hits biden and obama in defense of his golfing biden swipes at trump presidency is about a lot more than tweeting from your golf cart top new mexico tourism official says mass gatherings may not be possible for 18 months more the government s leading infectious disease expert said it is possible though it depends on how early the virus was circulating undetected if there was no virus in the background there was nothing to mitigate fauci said if there was virus there that we didn t know about then the answer to your question is probably yes he added though that he did not want that to be a soundbite that gets taken out of context in a perfect world it would have been nice to know what was going on there fauci said of the early weeks of the outbreak we didn t but i believe jim that we acted very very early trump at the same briefing responded by again stressing his decision to close off travel from china at the end of january i made a decision to stop china from coming in took a lot of heat even from china trump said adding that was a big decision china has faced persistent doubts about its transparency and the statistics it is making public asked if the united states had gotten a late start on fighting the virus vice president pence on wednesday pointed to china where the outbreak began the reality is that we could ve been better off if china had been more forthcoming pence told cnn trump s earlier statements are also getting new attention a sober trump warned it was headed into two very tough weeks on tuesday as officials unveiled models showing as many as 240 000 people could die even if social distancing was practiced but on feb 24 he tweeted the coronavirus is very much under control in the usa we are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries cdc world health have been working hard and very smart stock market starting to look very good to me on feb 27 when the u s had 15 confirmed cases he said when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that s a pretty good job we ve done on march 9 he compared the coronavirus to the flu and said despite thousands of deaths from the flu nothing is shut down life the economy go on trump is not the only leader coming under scrutiny new york city mayor bill de blasiobill de blasiowoman apologizes after video goes viral of her calling police on black birdwatcher in central park de blasio 2 million people in new york city face food insecurity amid pandemic trump calls study on taking earlier action against coronavirus a political hit job more d has also faced criticism including for going to work out at the gym hours before gyms were ordered to close because of the outbreak the new york timesreported thatsome top city health officials threatened to resign if he did not take stronger action to close schools and businesses while new york is now the hardest hit area the west coast which had the earliest known coronavirus cases has fared better at least so far california was the first state to implement a stay at home order on march 19 white house officials on tuesday showed a graph of california and washington state with much flatter curves than new york and new jersey abroad experts point to the example of south korea which has been able to bend down its curve of cases far lower than the u s through extensive testing and tracing of infected people s contacts to isolate them it seems like the evidence is if we could have done that then things might be more under control said eleanor murray a professor at the boston university school of public health the u s has now missed the initial window of opportunity to take that approach but experts say in order to eventually ease up on blunt stay at home orders once the worst is passed the u s needs to dramatically ramp up testing that would allow for moving to a new phase of tracing infected people s contacts and isolating them while the projection of 100 000 to 240 000 deaths is sobering it is also possible that the numbers could be even worse since we still don t have great testing our numbers are still potentially too low murray said those projections also assume full mitigation measures but not every state has issued orders for their residents to stay at home the worst case scenario in the white house model with no intervention to slow the spread is 1 5 million to 2 2 million deaths trump has declined to say whether all states should issue stay at home orders and gostin the georgetown professor said he is concerned that some states still have not even now he said a month into the epidemic in the united states we re doing too little view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900
