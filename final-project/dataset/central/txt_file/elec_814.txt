kelly npr hide caption sen bernie sanders center reaches out to supporters after speaking at a get out the vote canvass launch at the city college of san francisco ahead of last week s california primary three days ahead of california s democratic presidential primary bernie sanders made several appearances in southern california before headlining a rally in san diego there was a sunday morning walk through a farmers market in downtown los angeles there was a walk through west hollywood la s gayborhood with a pre drag brunch address to diners at a hamburger joint on santa monica boulevard that was followed by a stroll through santa monica pier where the candidate rode a merry go round and even interrupted an outdoor spin class fundraiser to give an impromptu stump speech and there was a stop at plaza mexico an outdoor market that caters to a primarily latino audience in lynwood a bit south of la once sanders arrived with traveling press in tow he walked through the crowded mall which happened to be hosting a music festival that day after shaking hands and hugging fans sanders tried to take the main stage of the festival as he and his entourage approached the side of the stage he was denied by several of the event staff there were vigorous head shakes of disagreement and as a female event staffer pulled a barricade closer to keep sanders and his crew out she said angrily this is our event passers by pushed through and ran to the crowds that gathered as bernie sanders made unplanned stops across san francisco meg kelly npr hide caption sanders staffers walked away from the exchange flustered some muttering profanities sanders himself seemed befuddled it was the exact opposite of the reception he received earlier in the day when he took over the stage at that outdoor spin fundraiser stumping in front of stationary bikes and large images of the black and brown inner city youth the event was raising money for sanders experience in southern california offers glimpses into everything that went right and wrong for his campaign in more ways than one at lynwood and in santa monica and all throughout the primary season sanders was a party crasher sometimes that worked out for him and sometimes it did not at each stop on sanders scheduled tour of the san francisco bay area he was greeted with excitement intense interest and rousing support from crowds meg kelly npr hide caption love and anger this week marked the final presidential nominating contest for the democratic party in washington d c bernie sanders lost and he isn t throwing in the towel just yet he says but sanders also says he can do arithmetic and that math shows he did not get enough votes or delegates to be the democratic nominee he trails clinton by millions in the democratic popular vote and hundreds in party s delegate count with or without superdelegates hillary clinton was declared the presumptive nominee last week and she is now campaigning as one would expect a presumptive party nominee to campaign complete with the endorsement of a sitting president it d be fair to say that the only thing keeping bernie sanders campaign alive is that he hasn t yet said it is dead sanders met with clinton on tuesday night for what both campaigns called a positive discussion but did not drop out he has said he will do everything he can to defeat donald trump even if sanders is not the nominee and he will address his supporters thursday evening online in a live stream his plans for the future aren t yet clear but looking back sanders insurgent campaign accomplished more than anyone could have expected even the senator himself from the way he fundamentally changed how presidential campaigns can raise money with the millions he raked in from small donations from supporters often averaging 27 as he repeatedly proclaimed on the stump to his introduction of many of the ideas of democratic socialism into the mainstream in many ways his successes seemed to come out of nowhere sanders had been a senator from vermont for decades with low name recognition and single digit showings in early presidential polls and he wasn t even a democrat it would be easy to see the sanders campaign as something that just happened but in fact he was part of a concerted effort the outgrowth of a social movement that began a few years back in zuccotti park in new york the sanders campaign has direct links to the occupy wall street movement sanders supporters genei baker left and palmer lamb right both came dressed to inspire and impress for sanders last rally before the california primary meg kelly npr hide caption winnie wong founder of the online group people for bernie is one of the former occupy wall street activists who helped draft bernie sanders to run and she said sanders actually wasn t the first senator activists approached we started the draft elizabeth warren effort first she told npr ready for warren came out of occupy and people for bernie came out of ready for warren wong is not shy about identifying sanders and his candidacy as a tool to get occupy wall street ideals into the mainstream it was always a tactic she said at a sanders rally in san francisco in every way at every step of the way but if sanders was in some ways an outgrowth of occupy his reach quickly expanded beyond that movement s confines it would have been hard to predict that from the beginning though sanders press conference announcing his run in april of last year had little in common with the rock concert like rallies he s become known for this campaign that april announcement was small organized on a lawn outside the u s capitol with sanders seemingly startled by the microphone itself urging reporters to keep it quick because he had to get back to his day job as a senator a young rally attendee playfully gestures as results from the california primary are displayed at sanders primary night rally on june 7 meg kelly npr hide caption a young rally attendee playfully gestures as results from the california primary are displayed at sanders primary night rally on june 7 in fact many of sanders campaign staff had day jobs as well early on a lot of them worked for the campaign for free after they finished those but within months sanders had made a movement tapping into a new wave of progressive populism first hinted at during the occupy movement sanders self described political revolution to transform our country economically political socially and environmentally quickly became a force by february sanders razor thin finish with clinton in the iowa caucuses he lost by only 0 3 percentage points it became official the sanders campaign was now no longer outsider but insurgent secret service agents guarded sanders podium at his los angeles rally after he lost the california primary june 7 meg kelly npr hide caption secret service agents guarded sanders podium at his los angeles rally after he lost the california primary june 7 sanders rallies grew larger and took on their own feel part concert part picnic part love fest sanders fans danced freely before his rallies began mothers breast fed their young children in the aisles tie died shirts could be spotted throughout the crowds sanders himself seemed like a kind loving grandfather to many of his supporters famously at one sanders rally in portland ore because portland a bird landed on the candidate s lectern in many ways the sanders campaign was a love revolution with a message of unity diversity and prosperity for all but under the surface the sanders movement was just as much an exercise in anger over time another side of the sanders phenomenon began to reveal itself a palpable disgust not just for sanders opponent clinton but for the party she is a part of the media that covered her and a system that many sanders supporters thought was rigged heavy police and secret service presence surrounded sanders as he made unplanned stops in neighborhoods across san francisco on june 6 meg kelly npr hide caption one big rigged conspiracy the night of california s presidential primary sanders held a rally in an airplane hangar at the santa monica airport the tall and wide half circle roof made for a dramatic scene as thousands of supporters poured into the space to support their candidate even as his chances at winning the democratic nomination were all but zero beneath the sweeping metal roof while a man dressed as jesus holding a sanders sign paced the room the anger that had been building in sanders supporters for months was on full display when a big screen at the rally showed hillary clinton leading in the california race the crowd chanted bullshit over and over again until the image on the screen changed the crowd also chanted things like cnn sucks when clinton s name was mentioned in sanders speech the crowd booed many in attendance cornered reporters to share disgust with their coverage of the election particularly reporting on the associated press announcement the night before that clinton had secured the support of enough superdelegates or unpledged party leaders and elected officials to put clinton over the top to become the party s presumptive nominee a lone supporter lingered in the stands after sanders primary night rally on june 7 meg kelly npr hide caption a lone supporter lingered in the stands after sanders primary night rally on june 7 many of sanders supporters didn t believe he lost fair and square sanders himself still hasn t said he has the day president obama endorsed clinton and told sanders in the oval office that he was about to do so sanders pointed to ballots still out in california on tuesday after a statement about the orlando massacre sanders talked about long lines in arizona instead sanders supporters in the crowd in santa monica that night and elsewhere called the delegate count itself a conspiracy a day earlier sanders surrogate nina turner a former ohio state senator suggested the ap call coming the night before california voted was intended to suppress voter turnout there dutch merrick was in the crowd that tuesday night he said he was hopeful that sanders would take his fight to the democratic convention and demand an actual count of the actual votes he felt the democratic party establishment had decided clinton would be the nominee months ago before the primary election was complete it s a fait accompli that message had not changed in a year he said holding a sanders poster all the coverage went to one woman candidate hillary for merrick the entire system was rigged in clinton s favor he pointed to voting irregularities in several states over the past few months long lines at polling places in arizona and names disappearing from voter lists in places like new york she clinton just puts a friendly face on fascism merrick continued i was excited eight years ago to vote for an african american for president but it essentially put someone that pushed the same agenda kept the same defense department the same cia the same wall street policies with a black face it didn t do us any good so now we re going to get a female face on the same policies not going to do us any good he concluded i would probably vote for trump to burst the bubble to finally pop the zit sanders call to a revolution has been answered at recent rallies with gestures of anger toward the status quo and distrust of the democratic party s primary process meg kelly npr hide caption sigma scott who was at the rally with merrick said if she takes it the nomination by petty theft or grand theft i would rally and vote that she s impeached that mood seemed to be present at sanders events all throughout california in the lead up to the primary in these waning days of the campaign it wasn t just that bernie sanders was the truth and the light to these super supporters it s that in their eyes hillary clinton was the lie and the darkness an empty chair left behind after sanders final rally in san francisco meg kelly npr hide caption an empty chair left behind after sanders final rally in san francisco clinton wasn t just an opponent to many sanders supporters she was a cheater perhaps even a criminal the democratic party wasn t just a political party it was an apparatus focused solely on doing whatever it took to grant clinton the nomination and whatever math would justify her win was fraudulent because the system itself was an undemocratic sham at a san francisco rally for sanders the previous day sanders supporter aaron selverston seemed to crystallize the emotions of many who felt alienated by the democratic party and the primary process i think the whole argument about the delegate math is irrelevant to most bernie supporters he said as dave matthews played in san francisco s crissy field before sanders took to the mic because it s not about some sort of allegiance to a party the party has failed the party has failed half of the people who typically vote democratic and those are the people who are supporting bernie despite sanders ability to connect with younger voters of color and gestures of support to the black lives matter movement his campaign has struggled to gain support from older minority voters meg kelly npr hide caption mistakes were made though much of the anger some sanders supporters show is directed at the media or clinton or trump some of the blame for sanders failing to reach the nomination is his own from the start sanders said he would run a positive campaign on the issues refusing to directly attack his primary opponent clinton he famously declared at one democratic presidential debate the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails when asked about clinton s use of a private server during her time as secretary of state the emails have been a constant line of attack for republicans against clinton but sanders refused to hit her on the issue even as staffers urged sanders to find some line of attack on her over time sanders did attack particularly on paid speeches she gave to wall street executives after her time as secretary of state repeating in stump speeches i kind of think if you get paid a couple hundred thousand dollars for a speech it must be a great speech i think we should release it and let the american people see what the transcript was jesus a regular at sanders rallies poses with supporters after sanders loss in the california primary meg kelly npr hide caption by the time that message stuck though clinton s lead had become all but insurmountable another sore spot for his campaign that would perhaps inflict even more damage was an inability to connect with large numbers of minority voters in several nominating contests throughout the primary season sanders did win a majority of black and latino primary and caucus voters ages 35 and under but in south carolina s primary after strong showings in iowa and new hampshire sanders lost the black vote by almost 70 percent even admitting himself we got decimated at a seattle rally last year sanders was forced from the stage by two black lives matters protesters he had to end his own event without finishing his stump speech for many minority voters sanders message on income inequality failed to connect the dots between wealth disparity and institutional racism and many people of color felt that white sanders supporters were too eager to dismiss them as low information when they did not support the vermont senator sanders responded he hired minority staff in key positions namely hiring symone sanders a blm activist as his national press secretary soon after the seattle incident sanders campaign recruited surrogates of color as well like the rapper killer mike and actress rosario dawson and he had no shortage of key celebrity endorsements from the likes of danny glover and spike lee but it wasn t enough sanders coalition of liberals working class whites and young voters of all colors couldn t shake clinton s lead with women and older minority voters sanders campaign also did not focus on the sweep of super tuesday states on march 1 that s when clinton put real separation between herself and sanders his campaign was often outmatched by clinton s superior ground game with its infrastructure seemingly never dismantled after her 2008 democratic primary loss and bolstered even by remnants of the obama political machine as time went on clinton racked up an increasingly bigger lead one that sanders would never be able to overcome even as he regularly out fundraised his democratic opponent and his rallies filled stadiums throughout the country maybe there s nothing sanders could have done to overcome the clinton machine on the ground but university of vermont professor huck gutman a close friend of sanders and his former chief of staff seemed to predict the problems sanders would have with minority voters in an interview with npr soon after sanders launched his presidential campaign one of the differences between bernie and so many other people who are liberals gutman said is that bernie s central concern has always been with the condition of what he calls working class families he is consumed by the need for economic justice even as gutman pointed out sanders track record of support for other progressive causes he said of sanders his central concerns have never been war or civil rights or gay rights or women s rights sanders supporters including winnie wong bottom right founder of the online group people for bernie celebrated as though they had won even after significant losses in the june 7 primaries which had been touted as critical to the campaign meg kelly npr hide caption the very idea that something has failed it s not a part of our language the day of the california primary after the ap had declared clinton the presumptive nominee it was really hard to find anyone saying sanders actually lost the race or would lose it soon you didn t hear it as sanders block walked and greeted thousands on hollywood boulevard and at coffee shops and the farmers market in silver lake in los angeles you didn t see it when the senator was on the hollywood walk of fame greeting fans and celebrity impersonators alike you didn t hear it in his speech that night or even later in the week after president obama endorsed clinton sanders campaigned that day and in many of the days before and after like a winner and if you just saw those scenes from the trail in california and not the news you could have been convinced that sanders had actually won the whole thing and perhaps that is the lingering juxtaposition of the sanders campaign numerically he has lost sanders will not be his party s nominee but in so many ways he has won just by surviving this long and not just surviving but at many points thriving and influencing a movement that could have a very long tail one of the great successes of this campaign is that bernie sanders has really electrified a whole new generation of young people to become engaged in the political process winnie wong said and they re young and they re not apathetic and they re energetic and they re smart after the crowds disperse from sanders large scale rallies their scope and scale becomes all the more visible meg kelly npr hide caption wong contends that sanders fundamentally changed america s political conversation making a movement like occupy and an ideology like democratic socialism mainstream prior to bernie sanders nobody ever dared utter the word socialism she said forget about the 10 million who cast their vote for a democratic socialist think about the many more millions across this country who are talking about it probably right now that s even more important if you look at sanders campaign as part of a larger progressive populist movement that had been building for years from zuccotti park to burlington vt and almost to the white house all of a sudden it makes more sense and it also feels in many ways not finished just yet people in social movements don t really see an end to their work wong said the very idea that something has failed it s not a part of our language getting real sanders enters a vehicle in his motorcade disappearing behind the sea of supporters still standing on the street meg kelly npr hide caption after being rejected from the stage at plaza mexico in lynwood calif that sunday before the state primary sanders walked into a mexican restaurant at the mall and enjoyed a meal with his family a mariachi band played and at one point sanders danced with one of his grandchildren the embarrassment of the moments before seemed to have been forgotten the candidate was having a good time and when he left the mall a large crowd was waiting to greet him regardless of what happened at the stage he was able to interact positively with hundreds of potential voters but already tweets and videos recounting the details of sanders being blocked from the stage were circulating on social media with many using the moment to mock sanders and critique his record of outreach to latino communities traveling press asked for comment on the incident and soon spokesman michael briggs told a washington post reporter that in fact sanders hadn t been denied a microphone in lynwood contradicting multiple eyewitness reports briggs told a washington post reporter that another supervisor at the event had come to offer sanders a place on the stage and to say bernie was welcome but briggs said it was in fact the sanders campaign that denied the festival organizers by that point he said we had moved on it was a moment that in several ways could symbolize sanders entire campaign a victory and a defeat all at the same time and in spite of it all a dogged determination to keep pressing ahead and to seemingly never ever admit you ve lost npr thanks our sponsors
