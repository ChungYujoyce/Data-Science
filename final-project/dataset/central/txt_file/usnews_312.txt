for sen elizabeth warren in new hampshire the challenge is clear in an early primary state where sen bernie sanders won 60 of the vote in 2016 she needs to both cut into his young progressive base and expand her appeal to older voters who may have picked clinton in 2016 even though sanders and warren are friends and ideological allies the two senators are circling each other in the democratic presidential primary often discussed in reference to one another and competing for overlapping groups of voters in dozens of conversations with warren supporters in new hampshire on thursday sanders repeatedly emerged as a reference point younger voters said they supported warren because of her similarities to sanders while older voters said they supported her because of her differences from him most of her younger supporters said they had supported sanders in 2016 even if they hadn t been eligible to vote yet while most of the older supporters had supported clinton sanders s campaign is on the upswing again after his heart attack in early october his campaign has been focusing on expanding the electorate of voters with a strong debate showing and a major queens rally featuring a coveted endorsement from alexandria ocasio cortez and he plans to return to campaign in new hampshire this week while sanders won new hampshire in 2016 by more than 20 points warren is currently leading in the state by a hair partly because of her cross generational support in a recent franklin pierce university boston herald poll young voters supported sanders at nearly twice the rate of older ones but voters of all ages supported warren at roughly equal rates in 2015 and 2016 sanders was the obvious choice for college students as clinton failed to attract big crowds on college campuses and decisively lost the youth vote the crowd sizes for bernie sanders were big and easy to convert into volunteers unlike hillary clinton who had a a challenge cultivating early volunteers says mike ceraso a new hampshire democratic strategist who worked for sanders in 2016 and south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg earlier this year warren is cutting into the backbone of sanders field organization in 15 and 16 more than a thousand people came to warren s event on thursday at dartmouth college in hanover n h and students waited in line to take a selfie with the senator and to pet her dog bailey sanders came to dartmouth in late september and spoke to a crowd that was roughly the same size and many of the students at the warren event said they had also gone to the sanders one some said they supported warren because they saw her as sanders s natural heir i love bernie said jackson harris a 21 year old geography and computer science major at dartmouth he s done a lot of really great things in his life but this is not his time for the presidency it s time for warren to get it done he s so old and warren s so similar to him said harris s friend juan lainez a 21 year old senior majoring in government and latin american studies everyone who was for bernie four years ago is now for warren underneath it all the students said they wanted someone who could win i think warren can pull it off says em morris a 22 year old graduate student in experimental and molecular medicine who enthusiastically supported sanders in 2016 any of them can win but i think warren will put up the best fight a few hours later at an event at newport opera house in newport n h warren gave a nearly identical speech to a much older crowd but the selfie line was just as long here the crowd was full of people who had voted for clinton in 2016 who were skeptical of sanders s far left ideology and saw warren as a more practical alternative many were senior citizens themselves who were concerned about sanders s age bernie s not a bad guy but she s more plan oriented says sally caltrider a 65 year old registered nurse who voted for clinton in the 2016 primary i was upset with bernie at the end of the primary last time i don t think he did enough to support hillary besides she added his health concerns me other older voters shared that concern bernie s too old said lisa matthews 64 i wish he d get outta there if she can t beat trump nobody can said mary edes 71 a retired teacher who also voted for clinton in 2016 i m hoping it s not going to be a man i think some people think she s too far left but if people listened to her they will come away with a different opinion says cindy martin a 66 year old retiree i don t think she s aligned with the far left socialists she s not as far left as bernie sanders other older supporters said they were heartened by warren s ability to reach the young i think she ll inspire the base of the party said benson bobrick a 72 year old historian who traveled to newport to hear warren speak young people in particular write to charlotte alter at charlotte alter time com
