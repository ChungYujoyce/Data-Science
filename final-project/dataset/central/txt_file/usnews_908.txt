it was christine blasey ford s admission that she was terrified to appear before the senate that hit home for many sexual assault survivors as they gathered across the country to listen to her testimony that supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in high school a lot of us understand that feeling and none of us wants to be in that situation none of us want to have to relive it and especially not in front of the entire country says georgetown law student julia mizutani 25 she was definitely pushed into it and that s not fair but i m grateful she s doing it for all of us mizutani says she was assaulted in high school in an incident she described as almost the same exactly as ford s she said she cried with other students as they watched ford deliver her opening statement thursday morning and they led a moment of silence for survivors soon after i wasn t around for anita hill but i imagine that this is very similar and it s frustrating that nothing has changed mizutani says and i think we re hoping things have changed in the metoo era and i guess we ll see but the fact that it even had to come to this means we haven t moved the needle all that far ford accused kavanaugh of pushing her onto a bed covering her mouth and trying to remove her clothes at a party in high school more than three decades ago kavanaugh has denied the accusation and he and republican senators reacted with outrage during his own hearing later thursday the back to back testimony from ford and kavanaugh quickly became a national moment as people across the country tuned in at law schools and the new york stock exchange on airplanes and subway cars but for sexual assault survivors the moment provoked particular turmoil the rape abuse incest national network rainn saw a 147 increase above normal volume in calls to the national sexual assault hotline on thursday a 76 year old missouri woman called into c span and broke down in tears saying she was sexually molested by an older student when she was in second grade this brings back so much pain she said i thought i was over this and i have not brought this up for years until i heard this testimony and it is just breaking my heart charity ave lallemant 44 was a freshman in college when anita hill testified during the confirmation hearings for supreme court justice clarence thomas on thursday she made a sign that said dr ford we believe you and stood outside the dirksen senate building with a crowd of women listening to ford s testimony over a megaphone it was so powerful to stand there and listen to her words and not even see her just hear her words and look at the faces of all of the women outside just listening to her words says ave lallemant who said she was sexually assaulted in college and again later in life it s been extremely anxiety producing to have the news wash over us every day here and i think to a certain extent i m numb to it in a lot of ways because it s so constant she says but i have been looking forward to today because i felt that i could do something to stand for someone the way i wish someone had stood for me rosie ryan a 20 year old barnard college student and co president of take back the night a group that advocates against sexual violence says she admired ford s bravery and composure but was disappointed to witness a system that she doesn t think can ever hold space appropriately for the experience of survivors i cried several times and i just wanted to hug her she says others spoke out on social media to share how ford s testimony had affected them some survivors chose not to watch at all i would desperately like to believe that prof ford s testimony will make a difference on the ultimate outcome of the nomination but i am not watching because i cannot bear the disappointment that i think will follow judge kavanaugh s confirmation as a supreme court justice georgetown law student desiree luckey 27 said in an email i know if i watch i will be frozen in the memories of my own rape and immobilized rendering myself ineffective and vulnerable i don t watch so that i can act and hopefully in acting i can do my part to create a culture where rapists don t win write to katie reilly at katie reilly time com
