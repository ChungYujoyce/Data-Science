washington attorney general william barr said monday that former president barack obama and presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden are not under investigation despite president donald trump s assertions that his predecessor s administration committed criminal offenses trump has repeatedly accusedobama of unjustly targetinghis associates in what he calls obamagate and has called on the senate judiciary committee to call his predecessorto testify in hearings about the origins of the investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election trump however has yet to explainwhat crime he thinks obama committed barr during an unrelatedbriefing on the continuing inquiry into december s deadly shooting at the pensacola naval air station said he would not allow the criminal justice system to be used as a political weapon the criminal justice system will not be used for partisan political ends barr said before launching a blistering critiqueof the russia investigation the attorney general has tapped john durham the u s attorney in connecticut to lead a parallel inquiry into the origins of the russia probe barr said the russia inquiry led by special counsel robert mueller promoted an utterly false theory that the trump campaign had colluded with the russian government what happened to the president in the 2016 election and throughout the first two years of his presidency was abhorrent it was a grave injustice and it was unprecedented in american history barr said the durham investigation is trying to get to the bottom of what happened and it will determine whether there are federal laws broken those who broke the laws will be held to account while barr said monday that he does not expect durham s work to lead to a criminal investigation of either obama or biden he suggested that others could be vulnerable in the criminal inquiry in a tweet last week trump urged sen lindsey graham chair of the senate judiciary committee to call obama to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the country s history pressed later by a reporter to say what crime his predecessor had committed and whether the justice department should investigate trump did not answer graham r s c pushed back against the president s request to call obama to testify i am greatly concerned about the precedent that would be set by calling a former president for oversight he said in a statement trump and his allies have seized on the prosecution of former national security adviser michael flynn one of the first targets of mueller s inquiry saying that the retired lieutenant general was entrapped by fbi agents into lying about his contacts with russian ambassador sergey kislyak obamagate it s been going on for a long time it s been going on from before i even got elected trump told reporters this month and if you look at what s gone on and if you look at now all of this information that s being released some terrible things happened and it should never be allowed to happen in our country again when pressed about the criminal accusations by a washington post reporter trump added you know what the crime is the crime is very obvious to everybody all you have to do is read the newspapers except yours earlier this month the barr justice department announced that it intended to abandon the flynn case asserting that the prosecution was unjustified a federal judge who will ultimately decide flynn s fate has since appointed a retired judge to challenge the justice effort to drop the case and explore whether flynn had committed perjury contributing jeanine santucci and courtney subramanian
