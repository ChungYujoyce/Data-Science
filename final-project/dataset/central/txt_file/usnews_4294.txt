the criminal case against michael flynn has become a microcosm of donald trump s presidency combine a deep state conspiracy theory with twisted logic and faux outrage and presto change o up is down and down is up in this case a guilty plea has transformed into a motion to dismiss it s enough to make a judge s head spin ordinarily when a prosecutor seeks to drop a case the motion to dismiss is unopposed and the judge grants the motion without a hearing perhaps that s what attorney general william barr was counting on in flynn s case though a series of unusual facts have sparked a different response fromu s district judge emmet sullivan as a result we are about to see whether our independent judiciary can withstand the dark arts of the trump administration in 2017 special counsel robert mueller charged flynn with making false statements to the fbi regarding his conversations with the russian ambassador about u s sanctions among other things flynn promptly entered a guilty plea and agreed to cooperate with mueller s team in its investigation of russian interference in the 2016 election after issuing his report last spring finding no crime of conspiracy and declining to charge obstruction of justice mueller closed his office flynn then had a change of heart and asked to withdraw his guilty plea accusing prosecutors of acting in bad faith now with mueller long gone barr s department of justice is asking the court to dismiss the case against flynn this is not the first time barr has taken action to unwind mueller s work doj dismissed charges against two russian shell companies indicted for conspiring to interfere with the 2016 election barr also overruled career prosecutors in their sentencing recommendation of trump associate roger stone to advocate for a more lenient punishment now despite flynn s guilty plea barrseeks to dismiss the case against him altogether not so fast rather than summarily grant the motion the fiercely independent sullivan last week appointed an amicus curiae or friend of the court to help make sense of this turnabout by doj sullivan tapped john gleeson a retired federal judgewho has served as a prosecutor and defense attorney to present arguments against the government s motion to dismiss and address whether flynn should be held in contempt of court for perjury sullivan has also indicated that he plans to issue an order permitting outside interested parties to weigh in with amicus briefs in its motion to dismiss doj does not argue that flynn did not lie but it saysthe lies were not material to a matter within the jurisdiction of the fbi this is where the logic starts to contort doj argues that the lies cannot be material because the investigation was not properly predicated that is based on facts to support a crime or national security threat and so without a legitimate investigation the argument goes no lie arising under the investigation could ever be material poof no materiality no crime and the case must be dismissed this argument contradicts the conclusion of the doj inspector general who found that the flynn investigation was in fact properly predicated crossfire hurricane the fbi properly legally investigated 2016 trump campaign the rest is noise and spin not only is this logic twisted but barr s shortsighted strategy to benefit flynn will have a profoundly negative impact on the ability of law enforcement agencies to use criminal prosecution in the future as a powerful inducement to get people to tell them the truth defendants who are charged with lying will use doj s frivolous argument against it to attack predication and materiality in every case but sullivan still has the final say here and he has shown himself to be no pushover in 2009 he dismissed the public corruption conviction of republican sen ted stevens of alaska after learning that prosecutors had withheld exculpatory information he also appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the prosecutors in that case and so what will sullivan ultimately decide here he has several options the judgecould grant the motion to dismiss with prejudice and the case will be over by specifying that the dismissal is with prejudice as doj requests the same charges could not be brought against flynn in the future sullivan could grant the motion without prejudice meaning that the case would be dismissed but that a future administration could refile the charges trump justice he s using his office to reward friends punish enemies and tarnish america hecould deny the motion to dismiss deny the motion to withdraw flynn s guilty pleaand proceed to sentencing by filing his motion to withdraw his plea flynn has breached the plea agreement that limited his sentence to six months and sullivan could sentence flynn up to the statutory maximum of five years in prison sullivan could also find that flynn committed perjury before the court by submitting conflicting accounts as to whether he lied to the fbi only one of those statements can be true if so the judgecould find flynn in contempt and impose additional punishment in his discretion first as in the stevens case sullivan will enlist the help of others to decide what the interests of justice require sadly doj has made it necessary to bring in outside advocates to protect the judiciary from being seen as aiding and abetting corruption but we can be grateful for an independent judge who will not allow himself to be fooled by smoke and mirrors barbara mcquade a former u s attorney for the eastern district of michigan is a professor
