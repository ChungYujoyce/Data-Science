biden wins hawaii primary warren to host high dollar fundraiser for biden more i vt on the sidelines while the trump administration s efforts to contain the spread of infections and the economic carnage likely to result from the pandemic will give democrats opportunity to attack in the fall biden s relative lack of visibility is causing some democrats concern i honestly think it hurts democrats in a lot of ways right now trump has the megaphone and there s no real alternative voice out there said steve jarding a democratic strategist i think biden could follow trump s press conferences and instead of pandering and posturing refer to the experts and have experts with him jarding warned the cancellation of debates and primaries is likely to slow biden s political momentum the loss of that voice i think is very very harmful not just because you don t hear the democratic leader s voice the titular leader in biden all you hear is trump he said the process where primaries are being delayed that s hurtful that s how you get momentum the coronavirus pandemic has not just suspended debates and primaries but also fundraising and volunteer organizing activities which is especially damaging to biden who faces the tough task of beating an incumbent president something that s only been done three times in the past 100 years biden has kept a relatively low profile since the health care crisis paralyzed the country last month making a few digital and media appearances but otherwise letting trump grab center stage some senate democrats say they would like to see biden

processing plants more d mich democratic strategists warn however that biden as the challenger is the natural underdog and will be more hurt by weeks or months of inactivity than trump who appears nearly daily on national television to update the country on efforts to contain the pandemic trump is his own organization for the most part he still does his tweets to his 75 million followers and he s on the news every day in that sense the bully pulpit of the white house that megaphone is so large that that becomes the campaign said jarding that s the power of incumbency when the other side has to shut down and thinks it s inappropriate to be out campaigning that absolutely helps trump he added ross k baker a professor of political science noted that presidential incumbents have lost reelection only a few times in the past centuryand that the current coronavirus crisis underscores the advantage trump has as the incumbent baker said the coronavirus crisis illustrates the ability of the president to dominate the narrative trump has managed to find a very interesting and politically significant substitute to his rallies he said referring to the daily briefings of the white house coronavirus task force which trump leads it s for many people a time of day when they tune in to hear the president they re not tuning in to hear joe biden or bernie sanders baker said what it is is the ability of the president to control the media if he s skillful some democrats are now trying to pressure television networks to stop covering trump s briefing jon favreau obama s former speechwriter and the progressive change campaign committee wrote an email to supporters tuesday arguing there is zero reason to give the president a free campaign commercial every day where he s free to spread lies that put people s lives at risk favreau noted that msnbc host chris hayes has refused to play audio of trump s briefings and the local npr station in seattle has decided not to air the

response but failed to put much of a dent in his numbers recent polls show a majority of americans approve of trump s handling of the coronavirus crisis and his general job approval ratings are close

politician in modern history he said democrats acknowledge while trump s handling of the pandemic is a potential target they need to be careful not to appear to be undermining the national response a democratic senator who requested anonymity to discuss party tactics warned that biden should be careful of appearingto undercut the president during a time of national crisis it s very awkward for someone running for president as a candidate you don t want to undermine people working together the senator said i don t think biden getting into the middle of this helps at all the lawmaker added democrats realize that while republican missteps in responding to coronavirus could be fodder for political ads in the fall they must be careful not to be seen as impeding the national response after
