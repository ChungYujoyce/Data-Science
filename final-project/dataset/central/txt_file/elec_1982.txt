president cruz would be as ideologically unbending as senator cruz loading january 26 2016 as donald trump and republican rival ted cruz battle it out on the way to the iowa caucuses feb 1 a favorite attack by mr trump is that nobody likes senator cruz particularly in congress he can t deal the texan stands on the middle of the senate floor and can t make a deal with anybody trump said tuesday on msnbc s morning joe that s not idle chatter even if it s typical trumpian broad brushing from a former president to former house and senate leaders to sitting members of congress establishment republicans are sounding alarms about the likability and deal ability of the tea party darling who led the way to a partial government shutdown over the affordable care act in 2013 monitor interviews with more than a dozen senators bear this out though not all jump on the dump truck and some are more diplomatic about their criticisms than others where views more starkly diverge is whether a president cruz would be as ideologically unbending as a senator cruz with some observers expecting no appreciable change and others suggesting that the presidency would force him in a more pragmatic direction senators don t like to criticize their fellow senators and several pointed to cruz s strengths his intellect passion and humor when asked about cruz sen susan collins a moderate republican from maine paused then she pointed out that no senate republican has endorsed the texan despite the fact that they have all come to know him since he took office in 2012 it s not helpful to the level of debate in this country to have a member of this body trashing the senate rather than working within the senate to make it more responsive and to reform whatever he may see as its deficiencies senator collins said as she rode the senate subway to her office last week her colleague sen lindsey graham r of south carolina was far less tactful he s not a problem solver when you think of problem solving the last person that comes to mind is ted cruz everybody s a problem but him said senator graham who after dropping out of the presidential campaign now supports jeb bush one senior republican labels cruz a neo nihilist who tears down rather than builds in a speech on the senate floor last summer cruz called his own party leader senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r of kentucky a liar this simply is not done in a place where strict decorum is still the order of the day and it angered many republicans one reason republicans are going on the record about cruz is because they are so concerned that he will get the nomination cruz for his part frequently refers to his colleagues as part of the washington cartel the renegade wears his flamethrower status as a badge of honor joking with voters about needing a food taster when he sits down to a meal in the senate dining room his supporters meanwhile love the fight in him an e mail request from the monitor to his campaign went unanswered but if unbending ideology and derision characterize cruz s short tenure in the senate what might they portend for a cruz presidency some observers contend that what you see is what you ll get while others think that he may well bend or at least have to mend some fences i can t necessarily say that past is prologue says sen thom tillis r of north carolina who sits on the judiciary committee with cruz and admires the way the attorney senator pins down witnesses particularly in confirmation hearings senator tillis was backed by the tea party express in a tough race in 2014 and calls cruz an asset on the committee but tillis points out that being a senator is not the same as president and then adds i would be hopeful that whoever emerges as the republican nominee recognizes that working with us produces a far better result for the nation while tillis says he has not clashed with cruz he adds that rebuilding burned bridges is one of the factors that a president cruz would have to deal with this point that a senator and a president are two very different jobs is key to those who think that relations between cruz and establishment republicans in congress would improve if the tea party champion were to become president matt mackowiak a gop consultant in houston points out that cruz had absolutely no incentive to play along or try to accomplish anything when he got to the senate three years ago first he ran a campaign as a principled conservative who wasn t going to give an inch second he wanted to be a national player i think he realized that waiting nine months to give your maiden floor speech and keeping your head down wasn t a path he wanted to take then sen barack obama had the same realization but just as important says mr mackowiak the senate at that time under democratic control was a graveyard for any real accomplishments by a minority party the incentive instead was to be a bomb thrower to develop your outside game not your inside game mackowiak points to cruz s intense admiration for president reagan the consultant believes that cruz wants to emulate the morning in america president to do that he would need a legislative agenda that would require cooperation from congressional republicans and depending on the math also democrats maintaining a poisoned relationship with leaders of both houses would be insane he would never do that mackowiak says but others are not so sure they point to a new era of politics in which long term relationships are not as important as short term coalitions on issues they look at the angry voter on both the left and the right who is tired of the establishment and most important they look at cruz himself not only has he stood his ground even if it s been a losing ground on issues such as defunding planned parenthood killing the iran nuclear deal and defeating a senate immigration bill he also promises up and down to stick to those positions neither will he run to the mushy middle in a general election campaign he says the positions he s taking are resonating with people says a conservative senator in arms jeff sessions r of alabama they re tired of talk it may well be that establishment republicans in congress bend to a president cruz notice how rep paul ryan r of wisconsin has reached out to the rebellious hard right freedom caucus that drove out establishment speaker john boehner last fall a president cruz would likely put enormous pressure on a gop controlled congress to govern from an ideologically rigid position and that congress would feel an enormous amount of pressure to cooperate with him says james henson director of the texas politics project at the university of texas at austin if that s the case says professor henson expect to see immediate pushback from cruz on such issues as the affordable care act gay marriage and abortion rights in ways that test the supreme court where he argued eight cases as the texas solicitor general cruz has been deeply critical of the high court and may challenge it by supporting state efforts working with congress or even through executive order henson says whether ted cruz the president would be like ted cruz the senator gets down to the mixture of true believer and strategic player in his political profile says henson so far the two have worked hand in hand his rigidity has served him politically get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox one can look at ted cruz and speculate that his political career up to this point has been predicated on upward mobility and that once he got to the highest office in the land he might exhibit a bit more pragmatism henson says that s not out of the question but i wouldn t bet on it what it comes down to he says is what cruz really wants and what motivates him and who he is as a person no one knows the answers to those questions better than ted cruz link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise
