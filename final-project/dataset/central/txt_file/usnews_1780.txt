to understand what it means to be famous like stormy daniels for the reasons she is famous spend time with her in a public space she walks quickly her head down blending in with the neighborhood moms at an upscale manhattan mall petite hardly noticeable in jeans sneakers and a gray long sleeved t shirt but her anonymity is deliberate she avoids eye contact folding into herself as if pressing into a fierce wind once inside the shelter of a photo studio she unfurls becoming yet again the woman we know from the media wry unflinching and lightning quick with a snarky retort it has been an incendiary year on oct 15 a california judge threw out the defamation case she filed against donald trump her other lawsuit against the president over a nondisclosure agreement nda that forbade her to talk about their alleged 2006 affair continues to wend its way through the court system over the past year daniels 39 has become the zelig of white house scandals her nda in which she and trump were both referred to by pseudonyms was first reported in january and in august the president s former personal lawyer michael cohen admitted to working with trump to pay her 130 000 in hush money a day later trump reversed his previous story saying he d known about the deal with daniels and paid cohen back himself and while the saga has barely ruffled the president s poll numbers it has transformed daniels life making her simultaneously a target of vitriol and a hero for feminists depending on which side of the trump divide you re on who would have thought that 90 seconds with donald trump would turn into 90 of my life she asks lost somewhere in all this is the story of a girl who grew up in baton rouge la deep in what is now trump country the childhood she describes in her new memoir full disclosure a new york times best seller was marked by resilience in the face of deprivation neglect and sexual abuse she was a smart kid who got a s at the local magnet school but went home to a house that had rats and roaches and not enough to eat she writes that she has already beaten the odds because by all accounts she should be living in a trailer with no teeth as with a lot of people who grew up without resources her unease about money lingered long after she didn t have to worry about her next meal it used to be that a hunger pang would create panic she says for those reasons and more daniels defends using her current spotlight to her advantage stacking up paid performances and unpaid interviews in the name of building her brand i m doing the same thing i ve always done she says but if you drive an ice cream truck and the city has a heat wave you d be an idiot not to drive your ice cream truck almost nothing makes her angrier these days than being called a retired porn star as several reporters have done as if the revelation of l affaire trump offered her a comeback she points out that the story about her nda broke last january and weeks later she was nominated in multiple categories at the adult video news awards for her previous work how is that retired she says but her new perch in the global limelight has taken a toll she couldn t have foreseen nearly two years ago when lawyer michael avenatti offered to help her challenge her nda there has been the wave of death threats and the sudden need for bodyguards but worse there was the repeated publication of her given name annihilating the already flimsy wall of privacy between her profession and her home life time has published daniels legal name in the past and it is readily available online she worked for years to escape the instability of her youth to build a career however unorthodox to create a home in texas and buy horses and teach her 7 year old daughter to ride and now that life has been overturned perhaps permanently she shields the girl from the news no tv no radio but there s inevitably a limit to how long she can protect her daniels grieves over the way her sudden fame has affected the people in her life even near strangers like the two young women who were arrested with her at a ohio strip club in july it was a controversial raid that daniels insists was politically motivated and that columbus police chief kim jacobs later admitted was a mistake charges involving touching patrons were later dropped but the damage was done daniels says not so much to her as to the other two women those girls lives are ruined because their mug shots and real names are printed in the paper and printed in a story that has my name in it she says so they re forever attached to the dirty porn star perhaps most painful daniels says is that her marriage has not withstood the drama that her life has become that alleged encounter in a hotel with trump happened years before she and her husband began dating around 2010 but daniels says she never told him instead he found out on the news if i could do it over i would have tried harder to find an appropriate time to tell my husband she says her husband filed for divorce in july in her book daniels makes the case that she is a lot more than that one encounter with a reality tv star but when i ask if she worries she ll share the fate of monica lewinsky who struggled for decades to escape the shadow of a relationship with a president the answer is yes i d like to be remembered for being a fair and good leader of her film production crew she says but let s face it i m going to be known as the porn star who slept with donald trump that reputation she fears will not only define her it will likely preclude any other romantic relationship any future partner would be teased and tortured relentlessly she says it s a profoundly sad revelation complicated in part by daniels unflappable resolve she does not regret coming forward she insists she does not regret telling the truth but the fallout has lasted longer than she ever expected when her defamation suit was tossed out trump attacked her on twitter going after her looks as he often does with female foes great now i can go after horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the great state of texas he wrote referring to her ongoing lawsuit the tweet ignited a cable news frenzy daniels responded quickly and in kind game on tiny though powerless in any traditional sense daniels is clearly no shrinking violet label her a whore and she just laughs impervious to that kind of shaming that s rich whore she counters thankyouverymuch i ask if the omnipresent avenatti is using her to build his career and a possible presidential bid if he runs for president i m going to run against him she jokes but no he s not exploiting her she insists if anything it s the other way around i ve paid him all of 20 though he doesn t like me telling anyone that she says laughing if he wasn t already bald he would be bald by now because of me and no she says there s nothing between them in mid october daniels flew to berlin to continue her book tour inevitably she will be asked about the president and his private parts she ll answer gamely pushing her memoir punching above her weight and then pack up for the next city it s a bargain she made willingly even if she didn t quite know the price so there s nothing to do but to keep moving head down not knowing exactly what her life will look like when the winds let up in an earlier version of this story the age of daniels daughter was incorrect she is seven this appears in the october 29 2018 issue of time contact us at editors time com
