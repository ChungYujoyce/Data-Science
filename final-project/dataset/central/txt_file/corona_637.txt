eventually claimed it probably did well i don t like to think it did i think i handled it very well trump said but i guess it probably did i mean i got impeached he added that i certainly devoted a little time to thinking about it trump echoed the claims of supporterswho blamed the administration s slow response to the coronavirus on the president s impeachment case the senate impeachment trial which began with the swearing in of senators on jan 16 and ended with trump s acquittal on feb 5 diverted the attention of the government said senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky speaking tuesdayto radio talk show host hugh hewitt critics described the impeachment argument one employed by many trump supporters in recent weeks as excuse mongering trump they noted began taking questions about coronavirus in january and downplayed the threat until late february well after the trial ended joshua geltzer a former national security aide during the obama administration said impeachment previewed trump s response including his ignoring government experts and relying on private sources of information mitch mcconnell just blamed trump s covid 19 failures on impeachment tweeted geltzer

jackson about 500 000 coronavirus tests released last monthby abbott laboratories are available andnot being utilized by states according to dr deborah birx who s leading the white house coronavirus

came aftermaryland gov larry hogan arepublican contradicted president donald trump s claimthat problems with coronavirus testing had been resolved hogan told npr tuesday that while the administration has taken some steps to create new tests they re not actually produced and distributed out to the states trump has faced mounting pressure from states over the availability of tests as well as a shortage of medical supplies for health care workers treating coronaviruspatients many americans with symptoms of covid 19 have found it difficult to be tested and those who have been tested have been told it will take more than a week to get results in recent days trump has touted that the u s has conducted more tests than any other country but he leaves out a key piece of context whilethe u s has surpassed south korea in terms of raw tests it has administered far fewer tests per capita given that the u s is more than six times the size of south korea courtney subramanian washington inassessing

late start in fighting the coronavirus numerous governors including andrew cuomo in new york have said the federal government has been slow and disorganized in delivering necessary medical supplies trump also offered sympathy to his former hometown saying we pray for the doctors and the nurses for the paramedics and the truck drivers and the police officers and the sanitation workers and above all the people fighting for their lives in new york and all across our land analysts said new york got hit hard in part because of heavy travel at the start of the new year between the big apple and wuhan china where the coronavirus originated david jackson washington members of president donald trump s administration laid out dire estimates tuesday to underscore the potential impact of the

house coronavirus response coordinator without intervention birx said as many 2 2 million could have died presented to the president over the weekend the data explains why trump backed down from an earlier notion of reopening the country by easter or potentially opening parts of the nation that were less hard hit officials said trump announced sunday he would extend social distancing guidelines through april 30 our country is in the midst of a great national trial trump said tuesday we re going to go through a very tough two weeks trump s top health officials including anthony fauci director

we re going to see things get better he said our strength will be tested and our endurance will be tried this is the time for all americans to come together and do our part michael collins washington former president barack obama appeared to take a swipe at president donald trump s initial skepticism of the coronavirus pandemic a rare rebuff for a president who tends not to weigh in on the work of other presidents we ve seen all too terribly the consequences of those who denied warnings of a pandemic obama tweeted tuesday without directly naming the president we can t afford any more consequences of climate denial all of us especially young people have to demand better of our government at every level and vote this fall he added linking to an article announcing the rollback ofenvironmental mileage standards put in place by obama in 2012 the trump administration has faced sharp criticism for its handling of the u s outbreak which has crippled the u s economy and claimed more than 3 100 lives as oftuesday trump initially sought to downplay the pandemic and suggested opening up the economy by easter or april 12 as recently as last week the president has since said strict social distancing guidelines will remain in place through april 30 obama who has mostly used his twitter account to praise workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic and promote

policies courtney subramanian the republican party of virginia suggested tuesday that democratic gov ralph northam set his statewide stay at home order to expire on june 10 because the gop primary is going to be held on june 9 in these challenging times we want to give the governor the freedom to make necessary decisions without partisan rancor but the timeline seems all too convenient said party chairman jack wilson we ask that governor northam show us the data that led to his decision wilson said while they were not implying northam was purposefully engaging in voter suppression an explanation would help to mitigate any concerns on monday northam ordered virginia residents to stay home except for certain activities like getting groceries or to get medical care in order to contain the spread of the coronavirus virginia has1 250 confirmed cases of the virus which has killed at least 27 people in the state according to the virginia department of health virginia s republican party canceled its presidential primary this year citing overwhelming support for president donald trump but gop voters still have to decide on who will try to unseat incumbent sen mark warner as well as races for house members and local representatives william cummings as new york continues its search for much needed ventilators gov andrew cuomo said the federal emergency management agency basically bigfooted individual states and drove up prices comparing buying ventilators to online auctions it s like being on ebay with 50 other states bidding on a ventilator cuomo said you see the bid go up cause california bid illinois bid florida bid new york bid california rebids that s literally what we re doing i mean how inefficient and then fema gets involved and fema starts bidding and now fema is bidding on top of the 50 so fema is driving up the price what sense does this make cuomo then said he believes fema should ve been the purchasing agent for medical equipment before becoming the sole distributor to states in need cuomo released data indicating new york had more than 75 000 positive cases including more than 9 000 new cases with a death toll of 1 550 as of tuesday morning lorenzo reyes secretary of state mike pompeo said tuesday that he saw no need to ease tough u s sanctions on iran or other nations that have been particularly hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic the united nations secretary general ant nio guterres has urged world leaders to back off such crippling economic penalties to ensure that people in those targeted countries have access to food medicine and other vital supplies as they confront the pandemic this is the time for solidarity not exclusion guterres said last week pompeo has overseen the trump administration s maximum pressure campaign against iran implementing a series of escalating sanctions aimed at crippling tehran s economy and weakening its leaders iran is reeling from the coronavirus outbreak with more than 40 000 reported infections and nearly 3 000 reported deaths skeptics say those figures are misleadingly low fearing a much more widespread crisis pompeo noted that u s sanctions include exemptions for humanitarian goods and he argued that iran venezuela and other countries should be able to get anything they need to address the pandemic the goods that are needed for each of these countries to resolve that coronavirus problem in their nations are not sanctioned pompeo said during a state department briefing tuesday pompeo said the trump administration has offered humanitarian aid to iran north korea and venezuela among other sanctioned countries but that assistance has been rejected some of these countries continue to build bombs and missiles and nuclear capability all the while their people are starving he said deirdre shesgreen secretary of state mike pompeo said tuesday that a state department official has died from covid 19 the disease caused by the coronavirus we ve had a state department official pass away as a result of this virus one of our team members pompeo said during a briefing tuesday we now have 3 000 americans who have been killed this is tragic a state department spokesperson later said two locally employed staff members at u s embassies in jakarta indonesia and kinshasa congo have died from covid 19 we offer our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families affected by this tragedy and thank them for their loved ones service to the united states said the spokesperson who was not authorized to speak on the record because of state department policy we do not at this time have any reports of covid 19 related deaths of american staff within the department of state s domestic and global workforce the state department s 75 000 workforce deployed in more than 200 locations across the globe has been deeply affected by the pandemic in january the agency began evacuating diplomats from the u s consulate in wuhan china the

york has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the u s and on monday a navy hospital ship arrived in manhattan s harbor to help treat the thousands who have been diagnosed with covid 19 christal hayes house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said tuesday that the coronavirus outbreak will likely require the country to move toward voting by mail in upcoming elections pelosi said on msnbc s morning joe she thought the 2 trillion cares act signed into law last week by president donald trump should have had more funding for the states to address the reality of life that we are going to have to have more vote by mail the final bill allocated 400 million toward helping states vote during the outbreak while the democratic version of the legislation included 4 billion for that purpose president donald trump criticized the effort to include funding for elections in the bill during a fox news interview on monday the things they had in there were crazy they had things levels of voting that if you ever agreed to it you d never have a republican elected in this country again the president said on fox friends i feel sad that the president doesn t have confidence in his own party pelosi said tuesday she said she did not think vote by mail would negatively affect republicans chances to the polls william cummings senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky added his name tuesday to the list of people who blamed the slow response to the coronavirus on president donald trump s impeachment the senate impeachment trial which began with the swearing in of senators on jan 16 and ended with trump s acquittal on feb 5 diverted the attention of the government mcconnell told radio talk show host hugh hewitt trump critics have described the impeachment argument one employed by many trump supporters in recent weeks as an excuse trump they noted began taking questions about coronavirus in january and downplayed the threat until late february well after the trial ended trump supporters like sean hannity have long claimed that impeachment diverted the government s attention from issues like the coronavirus also on the hewitt show tuesday sen tom cotton r ark said ihave to tell you that in mid january and late january unfortunately washington especially the congress was consumed with another matter you may recall the partisan impeachment of the president on feb 27 trump said during a speech at the white house that the virus was going to disappear one day it s like a miracle it will disappear he then said you know it could get worse before it gets better it could maybe go away we ll see what happens three weeks before the republican controlled senate acquitted trump of house impeachment charges that he abused power and obstructed a congressional investigation into his team s efforts to get ukraine to investigate democratic political opponent joe biden david jackson maryland gov larry hogansaid tuesday on npr s morning editionthat president donald trump was incorrect in saying coronavirus testing problems had been resolved yeah that s just not true i mean i know that they ve taken some steps to create new tests but they re not actually produced and distributed out to the states hogan said when host rachel martin asked him about trump s assertions no state has enough testing in a coronavirus task forcebriefing yesterday trump said america s coronavirus testing was better than any country in the world the maryland republican said hewas listening to the smart team in the white house like drs deborah birx and anthony fauci who were giving accurate information hogan who issued a statewide stay at home order on monday had a grim outlook for states pandemic preparedness there s nobody in america that s prepared he said nicholas wu in a tuesday morning interview on msnbc s morning joe house speaker nancy pelosi said she and congress do not take responsibility for the country s slow response to the coronavirus at the beginning of the year no not at all she said tuesday on msnbc in response to a question from co host willie geistabout whether she or congressboreresponsibility instead she said she was proud of the work congress did the speed with which coronavirus response bills passed and the bipartisanship that was the hallmark of it all we can only go as fast as the signature she said of the white house s support for legislation the house speaker added that she was sad there was no respect for science from the white house in the beginning but president donald trump will say and do what he does nicholas wu glenn fine the inspector general for the defense department was appointed to head the committee that will oversee the largest rescue package in u s history the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act which was signed into law by president donald trump last week provides more than 2 trillion to help stave off the economic impacts caused by the covid 19 outbreak that has now killed more than 3 000 people in the u s and nearly 40 000 people worldwide the cares act calls for the establishment of apandemic response accountability committee to oversee the distribution of the funds approved in the massive stimulus bill as well as the two previous emergency spending bills that were passed to address the outbreak fine will head that nine person committee composed of inspector generals from other departments i look forward to working with my fellow inspectors general on the committee to provide effective independent oversight of the funding provided by the pandemic legislation fine said in a statement on monday through our efforts we will seek to promote transparency and ensure that funds are being used consistently with the law s mandate to respond to this public health crises much of it was junk trump pelosi claim credit for beating back bad ideas in coronavirus stimulus during the contentious debate ahead of the final bill s passage the establishment of an oversight committee to prevent waste and abuse was insisted upon by congressional democrats who were particularly concerned that the nearly 500 billion allocated to help large industries could become a corporate slush fund senate minority leader charles schumer d n y said he was pleased with fine s appointment the pandemic response accountability committee is critical to holding president trump and his administration accountable to the letter and spirit of the law schumer said in a statement glenn fine has a good reputation as a tough federal prosecutor and former doj inspector general and must exercise his full oversight authority to ensure that the trump administration implements the cares act as intended william cummings president donald trump s rocky relationship with the news media was on display again monday as he bristled at questions about his handling of the coronavirus outbreak during a white house news conference cnn s jim acosta with whom trump has clashed on several occasions including a 2018exchange that led to a failed white house effort to revoke acosta s press credentials asked the president what do you say to americans who are upset with you over the way you downplayed this crisis over the last couple of months acosta proceeded to quote several of trump s earlier comments in which he saidthe outbreak was very much under control and that it will go away like a miracle it will go away and we re going to have a great victory trump told acosta he went on to defendthe accuracy of the previous comments while simultaneously explaining he said them because i want to keep the country calm i don t want panic in the country i could cause panic much better than even you i would make you look like a minor league player trump told acosta instead of asking a nasty snarky question like that you should ask a real question coronavirus justice department launches inquiry of senators who sold large chunks of stock before coronavirus market slide trump later turned his ire on pbs newshour s yamiche alcindor whom he told the previous day to be nice and not ask threatening questions after she asked about his statement that new york gov andrew cuomo was requesting more ventilators than needed on monday alcindor asked trump why the u s trailed south korea in per capita testing for the virus i know south korea better than anybody trump replied you know how many people are in seoul you know how big the city of seoul is he asked trying to explain that the difference was due to population density trump then claimed seoul s population is 38 million when according to the city s government it is actually about 10 million you should be saying congratulations to the men and women who have done this job who have inherited a broken testing system and who have made it great trump said to alcindor and if you don t say it i ll say it i want to congratulate all of the people you have done a fantastic job william cummings
