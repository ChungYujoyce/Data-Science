like many iowans roxanne gusthaveson still isn t sure whom she ll caucus for next week but her focus on finding a candidate who can beat president donald trump means that joe biden is probably her guy gusthaveson has noted the former vice president s rhetorical meanderings sees the hiccup in his step since he last sought the democratic party s nomination in 2008 and would prefer if he and his family weren t enmeshed in the ongoing impeachment drama in washington but she likes biden and suspects he d be the strongest challenger against trump he might not win iowa the 64 year old retired city worker says as she waits for biden to arrive at the university of iowa s student center on jan 27 but we need someone different in the white house and joe biden is probably the best shot to get that maybe with the caucuses less than a week away biden is hoping that enough iowans are like gusthaveson ready to vote with their heads not their hearts it s not a bad bet most polls have shown that democrats are more focused on defeating trump than on finding a candidate they agree with ideologically and biden who outperforms his rivals in hypothetical head to head matchups against trump is viewed by many as the democrat with the best chance in november in the final sprint before the caucuses biden s advisers are consistently making his electability their closing argument this election isn t about me and what i want says former iowa first lady christie vilsack a longtime biden friend and an adviser to his campaign the candidate i choose can t just be who i want and agree with philosophically or the person i like although i m certainly choosing that way instead she says iowa democrats need to consider which of the options can win republican votes this fall where sen bernie sanders is preaching a revolution and sen elizabeth warren is promising to take the fight to entrenched special interests biden is offering a simpler sales pitch we have to beat him intones one recent biden campaign ad that lingers on polling figures showing biden leading trump in recent head to head matchups joe biden is the strongest candidate to do it he beats trump by the most nationally and in the states we have to win this is no time to take a risk at biden s events there s evidence the argument is breaking through bernie has really good policy but he can t beat trump says 17 year old will haddy a high schooler from iowa city who under iowa rules can participate next week because he ll be a voter on november s election day joe is boring when it comes to policy but he can win to be sure biden has die hard fans like debi wakeland a 67 year old from blue grass who attended biden s jan 28 meet and greet in a hungarian bar in davenport they re the ones who get to his rallies early and don t mind when he s running late he knows what he s doing wakeland says but to win the campaign is also counting on caucus goers who aren t necessarily thrilled with biden yet see him as the best shot at toppling trump it s one of those moments like when ronald reagan ran against jimmy carter we had to vote for the lesser of two evils then the lesser was reagan now it s biden says ed voelpel a 76 year old retiree who waited for biden to arrive at a jan 28 event on the banks of mississippi river in muscatine i d rather have bernie says 52 year old math professor jim cochran but we have to beat trump not exactly a ringing endorsement but biden will take it write to philip elliott at philip elliott time com
