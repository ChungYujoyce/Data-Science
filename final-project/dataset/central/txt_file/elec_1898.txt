character loading february 29 2016 a flood of mainstream republican officials and donors have lined up behind marco rubio in the week since former florida gov jeb bush suspended his campaign for president and yet rubio s team concedes that neither the influx of support nor the conversion of many of bush s wealthy donors is enough to stop donald trump instead of riding the wave of new support alone rubio has been forced to speed up plans for an all out assault on the billionaire businessman s character rubio had hoped to wait until the chaotic republican nominating campaign had shrunk to a two man race but with a growing sense of urgency among gop stalwarts to settle on a trump alternative the young florida senator is trying to simultaneously slow trump and cast himself the savior of the party s future i will never quit i will never stop until we keep a con man from taking over the party of reagan and the conservative movement rubio thundered at a rally with 2 000 people in oklahoma city on friday it is a delicate balance rubio a 44 year old first term u s senator is trying to project leadership in the party while also going after trump using his own game marked by mockery and uncanny aim for his opponent s vulnerabilities but the hard nosed strategy is necessary says tennessee gov bill haslam rubio s latest big endorsement rubio looked around and thought well i might not like it but that s what the media is covering and that s what people are responding to but rubio is quickly getting a feel for what he began during thursday s debate launching a direct challenge to trump s appeal to working class voters in recent days rubio has dished about trump s on stage perspiration and alluded jokingly that trump may have wet his pants he s also taken to referring to the billionaire businessman as a con artist dozens of times a day while campaigning it s amazing to me a guy with the worst spray tan in america is attacking me for putting on makeup rubio charged as he campaigned in georgia on saturday donald trump likes to sue people he should sue whoever did that to his face over the weekend rubio and cruz attacked trump for refusing to condemn the endorsement from david duke a former ku klux klan leader we cannot be a party that nominates someone who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the ku klux klan rubio went further in a message to thousands of supporters in leesburg virginia we cannot be a party who refuses to condemn white supremacists and the ku klux klan rubio said not only is that wrong it makes him unelectable how are we going to grow the party if we nominate someone who doesn t repudiate the ku klux klan but make no mistake rubio s new tack is a fight for survival he trails trump in virtually all of the 11 states holding nominating contests on march 1 known as super tuesday the florida senator has finished in no better than second place in the first four primary contests trump has won three out of four and texas sen ted cruz remains a top tier contender even after finishing in third place in the last three contests given trump s momentum rubio s team says publicly the senator s best chance for the nomination might be a contested national convention in july that could happen only if rubio prevents trump from accumulating the majority of delegates in the months long primary season that extends through june some florida based donors as well as top donors and fundraisers in washington d c chicago and elsewhere were ready to join rubio s team immediately after bush left the race there are a number of us now that gov bush is out of the race who were very impressed with his debate thursday and see him as the one to take down trump said chicago investor craig duchossois who shifted from bush to rubio he showed he s not going to take any crap from him in the past two weeks rubio has also won the backing of four governors and 20 members of congress more than all of his republican rivals combined rubio had hoped to forestall a one on one brawl with trump until there were only two cruz ohio gov john kasich and retired neurosurgeon ben carson remain in the race although none have the level of support from as many governors and members of congress as rubio in a year of the outsider however it s unclear how much that will boost his momentum and in the meantime rubio s assault on trump s character continues audiences in super tuesday states oklahoma georgia and alabama ate up the tough talk as he whipped through southern states it s about time he take his gloves off and start fighting said gary baker from okmulgee oklahoma i think he should have started punching sooner better late than never said greg strimple a republican pollster and former adviser to the national republican senatorial committee the rubio campaign needs to set up a contrast on trump equate trump to the culture of corruption americans hate where the rich get richer and middle class pays the price strimple said rubio says there s time but none to waste if you sense a sense of urgency it s not just about winning rubio said it s about the idea that the party of reagan and the conservative movement could fall into the hands of a con man who s pulling the ultimate con job on the american people get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox peoples reported from memphis
