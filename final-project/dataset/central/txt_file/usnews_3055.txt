moscow and come up spectacularly short but trump s dodge that he has no businesses in russia so there is no connection to putin is a classic magician s trick show one idle hand while the other is actually doing the work the truth as several columnists and reporters have painstakingly shown since the first hack of a clinton affiliated group took place in late may or early june is that several of trump s businesses outside of russia are entangled with russian financiers inside putin s circle so yes it s true that trump has failed to land a business venture inside russia but the real truth is that as major banks in america stopped lending him money following his many bankruptcies the trump organization was forced to seek financing from non traditional institutions several had direct ties to russian financial interests in ways that have raised eyebrows what s more several of trump s senior advisors have business ties to russia or its satellite politicians the trump russia links
