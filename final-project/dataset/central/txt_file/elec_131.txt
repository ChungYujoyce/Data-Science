familiar with aleppo syria loading september 9 2016 gary johnson found himself in a presidential candidate s nightmare thursday when asked a simple question about the crisis in aleppo syria on msnbc s morning joe what is aleppo the libertarian candidate responded prompting a wave of online criticism and ridicule that quickly made its way around the internet the timing certainly wasn t ideal mr johnson who has hovered at around 10 percent in the polls needs to reach 15 percent to qualify for the upcoming presidential debates but the gaffe while embarrassing may not have a significant impact on the fate of johnson s campaign as experts say foreign policy doesn t typically play a large role in the outcome of elections later in the day the former new mexico governor clarified his initial

experience that matters it is judgment current president barack obama had asimilar response to opponents accusations that he lacked foreign policy experience in 2008 arguing that his real life experiences living in indonesia visiting pakistan and connecting with relatives in poor villages in kenya were more valuable than foreign policy experience on a political level candidates levels of experience aside foreign policy issues typically take a backseat to economic ones when november rolls around americans rarely rarely rarely vote on foreign policy issues and it has to be a dramatic
