the party should put more energy into protecting solid gop seats that could be in danger if a wave materializes this fall not every seat is created equal ultimately you have to decide what is the best path to holding the majority said matt mackowiak a gop strategist based in texas you re dealing with a chess board that has 30 or 40 pieces on it and you re trying to figure out how to get from here to there it s a judgment call both sides have to make he added and it s challenging republicans are bracing for tough midterm elections with anxiety running high over whether anti trump sentiment could hurt the gop at the polls the gop election strategy has been further scrambled by democrat conor lamb s upset victory in a pennsylvania special election last month which suggested the gop could even be vulnerable in areas of the country where trump was strong in 2016 historically the president s party loses about 32 seats on average during the midterms democrats will win back the majority if they flip a net 23 seats there are nearly two dozen republicans running in races that are currently rated as toss ups including reps leonard lanceleonard lancegun debate to shape 2020 races gop fears

cook s house editor the nrcc will have to decide in the months ahead whether it s worth pouring large sums of cash into democratic likely and leaning seats like costello s or if the party is better served trying to save republican leaning seats and defending gop incumbents in competitive races they want to spend their precious dollars as productively and efficiently as possible mackowiak said they have a pretty good idea of the top 10 or 15 races the question what s the second 15 incumbents tend to get priority but a whole host of other factors go into the decisionmaking process that includes who the democratic opponent isin a race what the dynamic is like in the district whether the candidate is running a good campaign the resources the party has how much it costs to advertise in the district and the overall political environment first and foremost the job of the party committees is to protect incumbents said doug heye a gop strategist and formerspokesman for the republican national committee but he added there are hundreds of factors it varies in exact science and it s very fluid many of these choices may not be made until around labor day ahead of the two month sprint toward the finish line in november plus there could be more changes to race ratings coming down the pike another factor that could influence the nrcc s strategy at some point the house gop s campaign arm may even have to cut certain republican candidates loose in order to shift limited party resources elsewhere although those types of tough decisions may not come until late in the election cycle a candidate s own fundraising can also guide where the nrcc chooses to invest you can try to drag a candidate across the finish line but if they re not running on their own that job is very very difficult to achieve heye said the lord helps those who help themselves after lamb outspent saccone 5 to 1 republican leaders warned lawmakers not to rest on their laurels when it comes to fundraising

meeting last month according to a source in the room the biggest concern for party leaders however is not moderate lawmakers facing competitive races it sthe entrenched republicans who have never seen a real fight before leadership has been really clear to their members about not taking anything for granted heye said that s where people get caught by surprise fifty fourdemocratic challengers outraised 43 gop incumbents in the last quarter of 2017 according to thedemocratic congressional campaign committee dccc a figure that has further stepped up anxiety among republicans fighting to keep the house that follows on reports that35 republican incumbents were outraised in the third quarter of last year democratic candidates across the country are out hustling and out organizing republican incumbents many of whom have not faced a competitive challenge in a very long time and are struggling to find those old campaign muscles tyler law a spokesman for the dccc said in a statement those numbers may also ramp up pressure on republicans in the safest districts to start ponying up more money for their party in an encouraging sign the nrcc hauled in a record breaking 32 million at its annual march dinner where trump took the stage this year the committee had 54 million in cash on hand at the end of february while the dccc had 49 million on hand but some of the gop s donors may feel more inclined to contribute money to candidates in the senate where the map is far more favorable to republicans ten democratic senators are running for reelection in states that trump won offering the gop several opportunities for offense we ve seen the value of one senate seat said mackowiak pointing to the senate s failure to repeal obamacare so what you might see is dem donors focus on the house and republican donors focus on the senate view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the contents of this site are 2020
