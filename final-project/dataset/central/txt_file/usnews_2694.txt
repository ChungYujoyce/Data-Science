four senators who voted to put clarence thomas on the supreme court remain in office and one of them is now leading the committee overseeing the confirmation hearings of brett kavanaugh as trump s nominee faces an allegation of sexual assault as a teenager comparisons have been made to sexual harassment allegations made by attorney anita hill against thomas in 1991 almost every republican senate seat has turned over since then except the four senators chuck grassley orrin hatch mitch mcconnell and richard shelby all are republican men who voted for thomas though shelby was a conservative democrat in 1991 democratic sen patrick leahy who was also in the senate in 1991 voted against thomas during the thomas hearings hatch and grassley were particularly outspoken in casting doubts on hill after hill then 35 testified in front of a famously all male senate judiciary committee including hatch the utah republican told reporters he didn t believe her account there s no question in my mind she was coached by special interest groups he told the deseret news her story s too contrived it s so slick it doesn t compute hill accused thomas of describing to her acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes asking her out on repeated occasions and discussing the size of his penis with her among other things but hatch argued that she may have gotten the description of an incident in which thomas allegedly said that someone had put a pubic hair on his coke can from a scene in the book the exorcist in a 2010 interview hatch said that he still believed hill s testimony was untrue arguing that she had attributed things someone else did to thomas i can tell you clarence thomas was telling the truth he said i believe that anita hill was an excellent witness i think she actually believed and talked herself into believing what she said there was a sexual harasser at that time according to the sources i had and he was her supervisor he just wasn t clarence thomas in recent days hatch has also cast doubts on psychology professor christine blasey ford s allegation that a teenaged kavanaugh held her down put his hand over her mouth and attempted to remove her clothing at a house party in maryland in the 1980s i think she s mistaken he told reporters i think she s mistaking something but i don t know i mean i don t know her he also added that even if the assault allegations were correct senators would be obliged to consider kavanaugh s entire record if that was true he said i think it would be hard for senators to not consider who the judge is today that s the issue is this judge a really good man and he is and by any measure he is grassley who also served on the judiciary committee in 1991 described the witnesses who testified about thomas as an effort to assassinate the character and integrity of the nominee as the chairman of the committee today the iowa republican has given ford a deadline of friday to agree to a hearing next week in which she and kavanaugh would testify much fewer than the witnesses who testified in thomas case asked about the difference grassley told a reporter you re talking about history we re not looking back we re looking forward after thomas was confirmed to the supreme court by a vote of 52 48 mcconnell now the senate majority leader called thomas a winner for emerging from hill s unproven allegations today the kentucky republican has focused his ire on the process surrounding ford s allegation now at the eleventh hour with committee votes on schedule after democrats have spent weeks and weeks searching for any possible reason that this nomination should be delayed now now they choose to introduce this allegation mcconnell said before convening a lengthy meeting with gop senate judiciary committee members there mcconnell indicated he was 100 percent behind kavanaugh according to politico shelby also voted yes on the confirmation of thomas in 1991 but has taken a more neutral stance on kavanaugh since ford s claims senator shelby believes that these are serious accusations his communications director said chairman grassley and the judiciary committee are working to hear her out experts argue that republicans risk another parallel to the thomas hearings the backlash among women voters that followed in the next congressional elections which led to 1992 being dubbed the year of the woman since then the number of women in the senate and the house has more than doubled debbie walsh the director of the center for american women and politics at rutgers university said that republicans may be emboldening the me too movement against sexual harassment and assault regardless of how they vote i think that no matter the outcome if he is not confirmed and it s because of this or if he is confirmed in spite of this it will energize this movement that s out there even more she said write
