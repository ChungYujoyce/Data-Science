former president barack obama returned to the political arena with full force on friday giving a speech reflecting on the partisan gridlock and upheaval that he believes has characterized the united states since president donald trump succeeded him in office over a year and a half ago obama delivered his speech at the university of illinois at urbana champaign where he received the paul h douglas award for ethics in government in the remarks which were a preview of the arguments he will make on the campaign trail obama denounced president trump by name the first time he has done so that explicitly since leaving the white house and offered a broader critique of the direction he believes the country is heading in under the leadership of his successor some of you may think i am exaggerating when i say these november elections are more important than any in our lifetime obama said i have been guilty at saying this when i was on the ballot but a glance at recent headlines should tell you this moment really is different the only way to combat this current state of democracy he told his audience was to get out and vote in the midterm elections as a fellow citizen not as a president but as a fellow citizen i am here to deliver a message said obama and that is you need to vote because our democracy depends on it read obama s full speech transcript below president obama hey hello illinois i l l audience i l l president obama i l l audience i l l president obama i l l audience i l l president obama okay okay just checking to see if you re awake please have a seat everybody it is good to be home it s good to see corn laughter president obama beans i was trying to explain to somebody as we were flying in that s corn that s beans and they were very impressed at my agricultural knowledge please give it up for amaury once again for that outstanding introduction i have a bunch of good friends here today including somebody who i served with who is one of the finest senators in the country and we re lucky to have him your senator dick durbin is here i also noticed by the way former governor edgar here who i haven t seen in a long time and somehow he has not aged and i have and it s great to see you governor i want to thank president killeen and everybody at the u of i system for making it possible for me to be here today and i am deeply honored at the paul douglas award that is being given to me he is somebody who set the path for so much outstanding public service here in illinois now i want to start by addressing the elephant in the room i know people are still wondering why i didn t speak at the commencement laughter the student body president sent a very thoughtful invitation the students made a spiffy video and when i declined i hear there was speculation that i was boycotting campus until antonio s pizza reopened laughter so i want to be clear i did not take sides in that late night food debate the truth is after eight years in the white house i needed to spend some time one on one with michelle if i wanted to stay married laughter and she says hello by the way i also wanted to spend some quality time with my daughters who were suddenly young women on their way out the door and i should add by the way now that i have a daughter in college i can tell all the students here your parents suffer laughter they cry privately it is brutal so please call laughter send a text applause we need to hear from you just a little something and truth was i was also intent on following a wise american tradition of ex presidents gracefully exiting the politicalstage making room for new voices and new ideas and we have our first president george washington to thank for setting that example after he led the colonies to victory as general washington there were no constraints on him really he was practically a god to those who had followed him into battle there was no constitution there were no democratic norms that guided what he should or could do and he could have made himself all powerful he could have made himself potentially president for life and instead he resigned a scommander in chief and moved back to his country estate six years later he was elected president but after two terms he resigned again and rode off into the sunset the point washington made the point that is essential to american democracy is that in a government of and by and for the people there should be no permanent ruling class there are only citizens who through their elected and temporary representatives determine our course and determine our character i m here today because this is one of those pivotal moments when every one of us as citizens of the united states need to determine just who it is that we are just what it is that we stand for and as a fellow citizen not as an ex president but as a fellow citizen i am here to deliver a simple message and that is that you need to vote because our democracy depends on it applause now some of you may think i m exaggerating when i say this november s electionsare more important than any i can remember in my lifetime i know politicians say that all the time i have been guilty of saying it a few times particularly when i was on the ballot laughter but just a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different the stakes really are higher the consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire and it s not as if we haven t had big elections before or big choices to make in our history the fact is democracy has never been easy and our founding fathers argued about everything we waged a civil war we overcame depression we ve lurched from eras of great progressive change to periods of retrenchment still most americans alive today certainly the students who are here have operated under some common assumptions about who we are and what we stand for out of the turmoil of the industrial revolution and the great depression america adapted a new economy a 20th century economy guiding our free market with regulations to protect health and safety and fair competition empowering workers with union movements investing in science and infrastructure and educational institutions like u of i strengthening our system of primary and secondary education and stitching together asocial safety net and all of this led to unrivaled prosperity and the rise of a broad and deep middleclass in the sense that if you worked hard you could climb the ladder of success and not everyone was included in this prosperity there was a lot more work to do and so in response to the stain of slavery and segregation and the reality of racial discrimination the civil rights movement not only opened new doors for african americans it also opened up the floodgates of opportunity for women and americans with disabilities and lgbt americans and others to make their own claims to full and equal citizenship and although discrimination remained a pernicious force in our society and continues to this day and although there are controversies about how to best ensure genuine equality of opportunity there s been at least rough agreement among the overwhelming majority of americans that our country is strongest when everybody s treated fairly when people are judged on the merits and the content of their character and not the color of their skin or the way in which they worship god or their last names and that consensus then extended beyond our borders and from the wreckage of world war ii we built a postwar web architecture system of alliances and institutions to underwrite freedom and oppose soviet totalitarianism and to help poorer countries develop this american leadership across the globe wasn t perfect we made mistakes at times we lost sight of our ideals we had fierce arguments about vietnam and we had fierce arguments about iraq but thanks to our leadership a bipartisan leadership and the efforts of diplomats and peace corps volunteers and most of all thanks to the constant sacrifices of our men and women in uniform we not only reduced the prospects of war between the world s great powers we not only won the cold war we helped spread a commitment to certain values and principles like the rule of law and human rights and democracy and the notion of the inherent dignity and worth of every individual and even those countries that didn t abide by those principles were still subject to shame and still had to at least give lip service for the idea and that provided a lever toc ontinually improve the prospects for people around the world that s the story of america a story of progress fitful progress incomplete progress but progress and that progress wasn t achieved by just a handful of famous leaders making speeches it was won because of countless quiet acts of heroism and dedication by citizens by ordinary people many of them not much older than you it was won because rather than be bystanders to history ordinary people fought and marched and mobilized and built and yes voted to make history of course there s always been another darker aspect to america s story progress doesn t just move in a straight line there s a reason why progress hasn t been easy and why throughout our history every two steps forward seems to sometimes produce one step back each time we painstakingly pull ourselves closer to our founding ideals that all of us are created equal endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights the ideals that say every child should have opportunity and every man and woman in this country who s willing to work hard should be able to find a job and support a family and pursue their small piece of the american dream our ideals that say we have a collective responsibility to care for the sick and the infirm and we have a responsibility to conserve the amazing bounty the natural resources of this country and of this planet for future generations each time we ve gotten closer to those ideals somebody somewhere has pushed back the status quo pushes back sometimes the backlash comes from people who are genuinely if wrongly fearful of change more often it s manufactured by the powerful and the privileged who want to keep us divided and keep us angry and keep us cynical because that helps them maintain the status quo and keep their power and keep their privilege and you happen to be coming of age during one of those moments it did not start with donald trump he is a symptom not the cause applause he s just capitalizing on resentments that politicians have been fanning for years a fear and anger that s rooted in our past but it s also born out of the enormous upheavals that have taken place in your brief lifetimes and by the way it is brief when i heard amaury was eleven when i got elected and now amaury s starting a company that was yesterday but think about it you ve come of age in a smaller more connected world where demographic shifts and the winds of change have scrambled not only traditional economic arrangements but our social arrangements and our religious commitments and our civic institutions most of you don t remember a time before 9 11 when you didn t have to take off your shoes at an airport most of you don t remember a time when america wasn t at war or when money and images and information could travel instantly around the globe or when the climate wasn t changing faster than our efforts to address it this change has happened fast faster than any time in human history and it created a new economy that has unleashed incredible prosperity but it s also upended people s lives in profound ways for those with unique skills or access to technology and capital a global market has meant unprecedented wealth for those not so lucky for the factory worker for the office worker or even middle managers those same forces may have wiped out your job or at least put you in no position to ask for a raise as wages slowed and inequality accelerated those at the top of the economic pyramid have been able to influence government to skew things even more in their direction cutting taxes on the wealthiest americans unwinding regulations and weakening worker protections shrinking the safety net so you have come of age during a time of growing inequality of fracturing of economic opportunity and that growing economic divide compounded other divisions in our country regional racial religious cultural it made it harder to build consensus on issues it made politicians less willing to compromise which increased gridlock which made people even more cynical about politics and then the reckless behavior of financial elites triggered a massive financial crisis ten years ago this week a crisis that resulted in the worst recession in any of our lifetimes and caused years of hardship for the american people for many of your parents for many of your families most of you weren t old enough to fully focus on what was going on at the time but when i came into office in 2009 we were losing 800 000 jobs a month 800 000 millions of people were losing their homes many were worried we were entering into a second great depression so we worked hard to end that crisis but also to break some of these longer term trends and the actions we took during that crisis returned the economy to healthy growth and initiated the longest streak of job creation on record and we covered another 20 million americans with health insurance and we cut our deficits by more than half partly by making sure that people like me who have been given such amazing opportunities by this country pay our fair share of taxes to help folks coming up behind me applause and by the time i left office household income was near its all time high and the uninsured rate had hit an all time low and wages were rising and poverty rates were falling i mention all this just so when you hear how great the economy s doing right now let s just remember when this recovery started applause i mean i m glad it s continued but when you hear about this economic miracle that s been going on when the job numbers come out monthly job numbers suddenly republicans are saying it s a miracle i have to kind of remind them actually those job numbers are the same as they were in 2015 and 2016 applause anyway i digress so we made progress but and this is the truth my administration couldn t reverse forty year trends in only eight years especially once republicans took over the house of representatives in and decided to block everything we did even things they used to support so we pulled the economy out of crisis but to this day too many people who once felt solidly middle class still feel very real and very personal economic insecurity even though we took out bin laden and wound down the wars in iraq and our combat role in afghanistan and got iran to halt its nuclear program the world s still full of threats and disorder that comes streaming through people s televisions every single day and these challenges get people worried and it frays our civic trust and it makes a lot of people feel like the fix is in and the game is rigged and nobody s looking out for them especially those communities outside our big urban centers and even though your generation is the most diverse in history with a greater acceptance and celebration of our differences than ever before those are the kinds of conditions that are ripe for exploitation by politicians who have no compunction and no shame about tapping into america s dark history of racial and ethnic and religious division appealing to tribe appealing to fear pitting one group against another telling people that order and security will be restored if it weren t for those who don t look like us or don t sound like us or don t pray like we do that s an old playbook it s as old as time and in a healthy democracy it doesn t work our antibodies kick in and people of goodwill from across the political spectrum callout the bigots and the fearmongers and work to compromise and get things done and promote the better angels of our nature but when there s a vacuum in our democracy when we don t vote when we take our basic rights and freedoms for granted when we turn away and stop paying attention and stop engaging and stop believing and look for the newest diversion the electronic versions of bread and circuses then other voices fill the void a politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment takes hold and demagogues promise simple fixes to complex problems they promise to fight for the little guy even as they cater to the wealthiest and the most powerful they promise to clean up corruption and then plunder away they start undermining norms that ensure accountability try to change the rules to entrench their power further and they appeal to racial nationalism that s barely veiled if veiled at all sound familiar now understand this is not just a matter of democrats versus republicans or liberals versus conservatives at various times in our history this kind of politics has infected both parties southern democrats were the bigger defenders of slavery it took a republican president abraham lincoln to end it dixiecrats filibustered anti lynching legislation opposed the idea of expanding civil rights and although it was a democratic president and a majority democratic congress spurred on by young marchers and protestors that got the civil rights act and the voting rights act over the finish line those historic laws also got passed because of the leadership of republicans like illinois own everett dirksen so neither party has had a monopoly on wisdom neither party has been exclusively responsible for us going backwards instead of forwards but i have to say this because sometimes we hear oh a plague on both your houses over the past few decades it wasn t true when jim edgar was governor here in illinois or jim thompson was governor i ve got a lot of good republican friends here in illinois but over the past few decades the politics of division of resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the republican party this congress has championed the unwinding of campaign finance laws to give billionaires outsized influence over our politics systemically attacked voting rights to make it harder for the young people the minorities and the poor to vote applause handed out tax cuts without regard to deficits slashed the safety net wherever it could cast dozens of votes to take away health insurance from ordinary americans embraced wild conspiracy theories like those surrounding benghazi or my birth certificate laughter rejected science rejected facts on things like climate change embraced a rising absolutism from a willingness to default on america s debt by not paying our bills to a refusal to even meet much less consider a qualified nominee for the supreme court because he happened to be nominated by a democratic president none of this is conservative i don t mean to pretend i m channeling abraham lincoln now but that s not what he had in mind i think when he helped form the republican party it s not conservative it sure isn t normal it s radical it s a vision that says the protection of our power and those who back us is all that matters even when it hurts the country it s a vision that says the few who can afford a high priced lobbyist and unlimited campaign contributions set the agenda and over the past two years this vision is now nearing its logical conclusion so that with republicans in control of congress and the white house without any checks or balances whatsoever they ve provided another trillion in tax cuts to people like me who i promise don t need it and don t even pretend to pay for them it s supposed to be the party supposedly of fiscal conservatism suddenly deficits do not matter even though just two years ago when the deficit was lower they said i couldn t afford to help working families or seniors on medicare because the deficit was an existential crisis what changed what changed they re subsidizing corporate polluters with taxpayer dollars allowing dishonest lenders to take advantage of veterans and students and consumers again they ve made it so that the only nation on earth to pull out of the global climate agreement it s not north korea it s not syria it s not russia or saudi arabia it s us the only country there are a lot of countries in the world laughter we re the only ones applause they re undermining our alliances cozying up to russia what happened to the republican party its central organizing principle in foreign policy was the fight against communism and now they re cozying up to the former head of the kgb actively blocking legislation that would defend our elections from russian attack what happened their sabotage of the affordable care act has already cost more than three million americans their health insurance and if they re still in power next fall you d better believe they re coming at it again they ve said so in a healthy democracy there s some checks and balances on this kind of behavior this kind of inconsistency but right now there s none republicans who know better in congress and they re there they re quoted saying yeah we know this is kind of crazy are still bending over backwards to shield this behavior from scrutiny or accountability or consequence seem utterly unwilling to find the backbone to safeguard the institutions that make our democracy work and by the way the claim that everything will turn out okay because there are people inside the white house who secretly aren t following the president s orders that is not a check i m being serious here that s not how our democracy is supposed to work applause these people aren t elected they re not accountable t hey re not doing us a service by actively promoting 90 percent of the crazy stuff that s coming out of this white house and then saying don t worry we re preventing the other 10 percent that s not how things are supposed to work this is not normal these are extraordinary times and they re dangerous times but here s the good news in two months we have the chance not the certainty but the chance to restore some semblance of sanity to our politics applause because there is actually only on real check on bad policy and abuses of power and that s you you and your vote look americans will always have disagreements on policy this is a big country it is a raucous country people have different points of view i happen to be a democrat i support democratic candidates i believe our policies are better and that we have a bigger bolder vision of opportunity and equality and justice and inclusive democracy we know there are a lot of jobs young people aren t getting a chance to occupy or aren t getting paid enough or aren t getting benefits like insurance it s harder for young people to save for a rainy day let alone retirement so democrats aren t just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage they re running on good new ideas like medicare for all giving workers seats on corporate boards reversing the most egregious corporate tax cuts to make sure college students graduate debt free applause we know that people are tired of toxic corruption and that democracy depends on transparency and accountability so democrats aren t just running on good old ideas like requiring presidential candidates to release their tax returns and barring lobbyists from making campaign contributions but on good new ideas like barring lobbyists from getting paid by foreign governments we know that climate change isn t just coming it is here so democrats aren t just running on good old ideas like increasing gas mileage in our cars which i did and which republicans are trying to reverse but on good new ideas like putting a price on carbon pollution we know that in a smaller more connected world we can t just put technology back in a box we can t just put walls up all around america walls don t keep out threats like terrorism or disease applause and that s why we propose leading our alliances and helping other countries develop and pushing back against tyrants and democrats talk about reforming our immigration so yes it is orderly and it is fair and it is legal but it continues to welcome strivers and dreamers from all around the world that s why i m a democrat that s the set of ideas that i believe in oh i am here to tell you that even if you don t agree with me or democrats on policy even if you believe in more libertarian economic theories even if you are an evangelical and our position on certain social issues is a bridge too far even if you think my assessment of immigration is mistaken and that democrats aren t serious enough about immigration enforcement i m here to tell you that you should still be concerned with our current course and should still want to see a restoration of honesty and decency and lawfulness in our government applause it should not be democratic or republican it should not be a partisan issue to say that we do not pressure the attorney general or the fbi to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents applause or to explicitly call on the attorney general to protect members of our own party from prosecution because an election happens to be coming up i m not making that up that s not hypothetical it shouldn t be democratic or republican to say that we don t threaten the freedom of the press because applause they say things or publish stories we don t like applause i complained plenty about fox news laughter but you never heard me threaten to shut them down or call them enemies of the people it shouldn t be democratic or republican to say we don t target certain groups of people based on what they look like or how they pray we are americans we re supposed to standup to bullies applause not follow them applause we re supposed to stand up to discrimination and we re sure as heck supposed to stand up clearly and unequivocally to nazi sympathizers applause how hard can that be saying that nazis are bad i ll be honest sometimes i get into arguments with progressive friends about what the current political movement requires there are well meaning folks passionate about social justice who think things have gotten so bad the lines have been so starkly drawn that we have to fight fire with fire we have to do the same things to the republicans that they do to us adopt their tactics say whatever works make up stuff about the other side i don t agree with that it s not because i m soft it s not because i m interested in promoting an empty bipartisanship i don t agree with it because eroding our civic institutions and our civic trust and making people angrier and yelling at each other and making people cynical about government that always works better for those who don t believe in the power of collective action you don t need an effective government or a robust press or reasoned debate to work when all you re concerned about is maintaining power in fact the more cynical people are about government and the angrier and more dispirited they are about the prospects for change the more likely the powerful are able to maintain their power but we believe that in order to move this country forward to actually solve problems and make people s lives better we need a well functioning government we need our civic institutions to work we need cooperation among people of different political persuasions and to make that work we have to restore our faith in democracy we have to bring people together not tear them apart we need majorities in congress and state legislatures who are serious about governing and want to bring about real change and improvements in people s lives and we won t win people over by calling them names or dismissing entire chunks of the country as racist or sexist or homophobic when i say bring people together i mean all of our people you know this whole notion that has sprung up recently about democrats need to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class voters or voters of color and women and lgbt americans that s nonsense i don t buy that i got votes from every demographic we won by reaching out to everybody and competing everywhere and by fighting for every vote applause and that s what we ve got to do in this election and every election after that applause and we can t do that if we immediately disregard what others have to say from the start because they re not like us because they re not because they re white or they re black or they re men or women or they re gay or they re straight if we think that somehow there s no way they can understand how i m feeling and therefore don t have any standing to speak on certain matters because we re only defined by certain characteristics that doesn t work if you want a healthy democracy we can t do that if we traffic in absolutes when it comes to policy you know to make democracy work we have to be able to get inside the reality of people who are different have different experiences come from different backgrounds we have to engage them even when it is frustrating we have to listen to them even when we don t like what they have to say we have to hope that we can change their minds and we have to remain open to them changing ours and that doesn t mean by the way abandoning our principles or caving to bad policy in the interests of maintaining some phony version of civility that seems to be by the way the definition of civility offered by too many republicans we will be polite as long as we get a hundred percent of what we want and you don t callus out on the various ways that we re sticking it to people and we ll click our tongues and issue vague statements of disappointment when the president does something outrageous but we won t actually do anything about it that s not civility that s abdicating your responsibilities but again i digress making democracy work means holding on to our principles having clarity about our principles and then having the confidence to get in the arena and have a serious debate and it also means appreciating that progress does not happen all at once but when you put your shoulder to the wheel if you re willing to fight for it things do get better and let me tell you something particularly young people here better is good i used to have to tell my young staff this all the time in the white house better is good that s the history of progress in this country not perfect better the civil rights act didn t end racism but it made things better social security didn t eliminate all poverty for seniors but it made things better for millions of people do not let people tell you the fight s not worth it because you won t get everything that you want the idea that well you know there s racism in america so i m not going to bother voting no point that makes no sense you can make it better better s always worth fighting for that s how our founders expected this system of self government to work that through the testing of ideas and the application of reason and evidence and proof we could sort through our difference sand nobody would get exactly what they wanted but it would be possible to find a basis for common ground and that common ground exists maybe it s not fashionable to say that right now it s hard to see it with all the nonsense in washington it s hard to hear it with all the noise but common ground exists i have seen it i have lived it i know there are white people who care deeply about black people being treated unfairly i have talked to them and loved them and i know there are black people who care deeply about the struggles of white rural america i m one of them and i have a track record to prove it i know there are evangelicals who are deeply committed to doing something about climate change i ve seen them do the work i know there are conservatives who think there s nothing compassionate about separating immigrant children from their mothers i know there are republicans who believe government should only perform a few minimal functions but that one of those functions should be making sure nearly 3 000 americans don t die in a hurricane and its aftermath applause common ground s out there i see it every day just how people interact how people treat each other you see it on the ball field you see it at work you see it in places of worship but to say that a common ground exists doesn t mean it will inevitably win out history shows the power of fear and the closer that we get to election day the more those invested in the politics of fear and division will work will do anything to hang on to their recent gains fortunately i am hopeful because out of this political darkness i am seeing a great awakening of citizenship all across the country i cannot tell you how encouraged i ve been by watching so many people get involved for the first time or the first time in a long time they re marching and they re organizing and they re registering people to vote and they re running for office themselves look at this crop of democratic candidates running for congress and running for governor running for the state legislature running for district attorney running for schoolboard it is a movement of citizens who happen to be younger and more diverse and more female than ever before and that s really useful applause we need more women in charge but we ve got first time candidates we ve got veterans of iraq and afghanistan record numbers of women americans who previously maybe didn t have an interest in politics as a career but laced up their shoes and rolled up their sleeves and grabbed a clipboard because they too believe this time s different this moment s too important to sit out and if you listen to what these candidates are talking about in individual races across the country you ll find they re not just running against something they are running for something they re running to expand opportunity and they re running to restore the honor and compassion that should be the essence of public service and speaking as a democrat that s when the democratic party has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the american people when we led with conviction and principle and bold new ideas the antidote to a government controlled by a powerful fear a government that divides is a government by the organized energized inclusive many that s what this moment s about that has to be the answer you cannot sit back and wait for a saviour you can t opt out because you don t feel sufficiently inspired by this or that particular candidate this is not a rock concert this is not coachella you don t need a messiah all we need are decent honest hardworking people who are accountable applause and who have america s best interests at heart applause and they ll step up and they ll join our government and they will make things better if they have support one election will not fix everything that needs to be fixed but it will be a start and you have to start it what s going to fix our democracy is you people ask me what are you going to do for the election no the question is what are you going to do you re the antidote your participation and your spirit and your determination not just in this election but in every subsequent election and in the days between elections because in the end the threat to our democracy doesn t just come from donald trump or the current batch of republicans in congress or the koch brothers and their lobbyists or too much compromise from democrats or russian hacking the biggest threat to our democracy is indifference the biggest threat to our democracy is cynicism a cynicism that s led too many people to turn away from politics and stay home on election day to all the young people who are here today there are now more eligible voters in your generation than in any other which means your generation now has more power than anybody to change things if you want it you can make sure america gets out of its current funk if you actually care about it you have the power to make sure we seize a brighter future but to exercise that clout to exercise that power you have to show up in the last midterms election in fewer than one in five young people voted one in five not two in five or three in five one in five is it any wonder this congress doesn t reflect your values and your priorities are you surprised by that this whole project of self government only works if everybody s doing their part don t tell me your vote doesn t matter i ve won states in the presidential election because of five ten twenty votes per precinct and if you thought elections don t matter i hope these last two years have corrected that impression applause so if you don t like what s going on right now and you shouldn t do not complain don t hashtag don t get anxious don t retreat don t binge on whatever it is you re bingeing on don t lose yourself in ironic detachment don t put your head in the sand don t boo vote applause vote if you are really concerned about how the criminal justice system treats african americans the best way to protest is to vote applause not just for senators and representatives but for mayors and sheriffs and state legislators do what they just did in philadelphia and boston and elect state s attorneys and district attorneys who are looking at issues in a new light who realize that the vast majority of law enforcement do the right thing in a really hard job and we just need to make sure that all of them do if you re tired of politicians who offer nothing but thoughts and prayers after amass shooting you ve got to do what the parkland kids are doing some of them aren t even eligible to vote yet they re out there working to change minds and registering people and they re not giving up until we have a congress that sees your lives as more important than a campaign check from the nra applause you ve got to vote if you support the metoo movement you re outraged by stories of sexual harassment and assault inspired by the women who shared them you ve got to do more than retweet a hashtag you ve got to vote part of the reason women are more vulnerable in the workplace is because not enough women are bosses in the workplace applause which is why we need to strengthen and enforce laws that protect women in the workplace not just from harassment but from discrimination in hiring and promotion and not getting paid the same amount for doing the same work that requires laws laws get passed by legislators you ve got to vote when you vote you ve got the power to make it easier to afford college and harder to shoot up a school when you vote you ve got the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance you could save somebody s life when you vote you ve got the power to make sure white nationalists don t feel emboldened to march with their hoods off or their hoods on in charlottesville in the middle of the day applause thirty minutes thirty minutes of your time is democracy worth that we have been through much darker times than these and somehow each generation of americans carried us through to the other side not by sitting around and waiting for something to happen not by leaving it to others to do something but by leading that movement for change themselves and if you do that if you get involved and you get engaged and you knock on some doors and you talk with your friends and you argue with your family members and you change some minds and you vote something powerful happens change happens hope happens not perfection not every bit of cruelty and sadness and poverty and disease suddenly stricken from the earth there will still be problems but with each new candidate that surprises you with a victory that you supported a spark of hope happens with each new law that helps a kid read or helps a homeless family find shelter or helps a veteran get the support he or she has earned each time that happens hope happens with each new step we take in the direction of fairness and justice and equality and opportunity hope spreads and that can be the legacy of your generation you can be the generation that at a critical moment stood up and reminded us just how precious this experiment in democracy really is just how powerful it can be when we fight for it when we believe in it i believe in you i believe you will help lead us in the right direction and i will be right there with you every step of the way thank you illinois god bless god bless this country we love thank you applause write to alana abramson at alana abramson time com
