trump coronavirus public health covid 19 misinformation during the white house coronavirus press briefing on april 23 president donald trump set off a firestorm of mudslinging and misinformation when he inquired about possibly using disinfectant to treat people with covid 19 fact checkers were all over the place after trump made the comments which followed department of homeland security undersecretary william bryan s description of recent government tests that found sunlight and disinfectant to be effective in eliminating the virus bottom line trump never said that people should inject or drink disinfectant headlines social media posts and news coverage suggesting that he did are false or misleading however trump did ask if there is something we can do that is similar to using a disinfectant that kills covid 19 quickly like injection inside or almost a cleaning many interpreted that question as a major problem and some in the media equated it to a recommendation or encouragement for people to inject or ingest disinfectant here s the transcription of trump s inquiry emphasis added so i m going to ask bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of if you re totally into that world which i find to be very interesting so supposedly we hit the body with a tremendous whether it s ultraviolet or just very powerful light and i think you said that hasn t been checked but you re going to test it and then i said supposing you brought the light inside the body which you can do either through the skin or in some other way to bryan and i think you said you re going to test that too sounds interesting right and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that so that you re going to have to use medical doctors with but it sounds it sounds interesting to me so we ll see but the whole concept of the light the way it kills it in one minute that s that s pretty powerful in evaluating the remarks many fact checkers revealed their own media bias many including cnn lean left media bias rating and snopes com center media bias rating published fact checks that definitively described trump s comments as a suggestion snopes posed the question did trump suggest injecting disinfectants as covid 19 treatment and rated the claim as true saying he offered his thoughts on how disinfectants could be brought inside the body by injection cnn s headline read trump dangerously suggests sunlight and ingesting disinfectants could help cure coronavirus right rated fact checkers had a different tone the daily wire running the headline no trump did not tell people to inject themselves with disinfectant or drink bleach focused on fact checking claims from twitter users who stated that trump urged americans to inject themselves with disinfectant breitbart published a fact check editors later re labeled it an opinion piece saying that trump was far from a model of clarity but he did not actually propose injecting patients with disinfectant another difference was seen in how fact checkers described the transcription of trump s comments some included the full transcription seen above others such as politifact failed to include trump s first words of so i m going to ask bill in their transcription which they described as the full context the use of a question mark at the end of the bold sentence in the transcript above was also inconsistent between different outlets there wasn t a clear partisan divide in this usage some left rated outlets included the question mark along with many right rated outlets some even used it in one part of a story but failed to in other parts of the same story the video of trump s comments shows there may be some room for interpretation as to whether or not he posed the comment as a question his voice was monotone and carried little extra inflection but the fact that his comments begin with so i m going to ask bill a question and and is there a way means trump was questioning the possibility not making a definite suggestion to those watching at home using the word suggestion can be misleading in this case the president very clearly suggested something at the briefing but what exactly did he suggest did trump suggest looking into something like disinfectant injections as a possible covid 19 treatment yes he did did he suggest people inject disinfectant no he did not this distinction is crucial in separating a nationally televised spitballing session from a reckless call for self treatment a media outlet reporting responsibly would have strove to make that abundantly clear from the very beginning but instead we ended up with some examples of fake news even fact checkers can be biased and reveal their subjective interpretations of events yet another reason why people need to prioritize a balanced news diet and get information from all parts of the political spectrum this piece was reviewed by john gable president lean right
