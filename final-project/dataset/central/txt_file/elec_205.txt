if the republican party dies will it take the democrats with it george will among others predicts that if donald trump wins the nomination and the presidency the first not much of an if after indiana the second quite a large one it will destroy the republican party i think he s probably right though it depends what you mean by destroy there would still be something called the republican party under a president trump it just won t be the same anymore this sort of thing happens all the time in business and entertainment 3m started out as a mining company now it makes sticky notes and seemingly a trillion other things maybe giving trump the lead vocals of the gop will be like when van halen replaced david lee roth with sammy hagar not the same band but pretty successful all the same that s a bad analogy of course because hagar was a good frontman with the full support of his band give trump the mic and a lot of the most talented people in the republican party will drop their instruments and walk off the stage but a lot of new people might like the show the trump campaign points to all the working class democrats and independents flocking to his message nowhere more so than in indiana on tuesday if they re successful the gop won t be the party of limited government and free markets anymore instead it will be more likea party of a kind of statist white identity politics of the sort that is common across much of europe white folks can play the multiculturalism game too are you black are you hispanic are you gay trumpideologistroger stone once asked democratic consultant hank sheinkopf when sheinkopf said no stone replied then why the f are you a democrat you should be with us down ballot gop candidates fear trump shipwreck column if trump and stone succeed in transforming the party along these lines democrats will likely benefit in the short runbecause the electorate is just too diverse to sustain the kind of republican party that stone described indeed democrats i talk to are once again envisioning another new new deal that s no surprise the democrats have been a cargo cult to the new deal for nearly a century and they always think the resurrection is at hand that s what they thought when presidentobama was elected in 2008 boy were they wrong the democratic party thrived under fdr butit shriveled under obama during obama s eight years in office the democrats have lost more house senate state legislative and governors seats than under any other president writes npr s mara liasson she adds democrats currently hold fewer elected offices nationwide than at any time since the 1920s there are many reasons for this but one is particularly relevant obama lost the traditional heart of the democratic party the white working class in fairness the democrats trouble with blue collar whites pre dates obama but obama accelerated the process in 2012 he lost this group by 26 points 62 36 trump is winning with those votes hillary clinton the surprise populist column policing the usa alook atrace justice media also because the electorate in non presidential elections is older and whiter the democrats were crushed in 2010 and 2014 moderate and centrist democrats have been effectively purged from the party hillary clinton mightlook like a somewhat conservative democrat to some but that s mostly because she hasbeen hounded for months by an avowed democratic socialist if the gop actually did implode tomorrow it would spell both a short term bonanza for the democrats and a long term existential crisis people forget that beyond policy and philosophy what sustains both parties is a kind of team sport the democrats run on being anti gop and the republicans campaign on being anti democrat take away one dance partner and the one left on the floor has no idea what to do next and dancing with donaldtrump won t be anything like dancing with ted cruz who has suspended hiscampaign the democrats have no idea how to tango with a new gop that also promises to maintain or expand entitlement programs raise trade barriers and tax the wealthy if the republican party under trump joins democrats in wanting to fund planned parenthood how will we tell who is leading and who is following whether trump destroysor merely transformsthe gop the net effect could be the same both parties could lose their reliable rationale for existence that kind of creative destruction could leave a vacuum for one or more new parties to fill the void jonah goldberg anamerican enterprise institutefellow andnational reviewcontributing editor is a member of usa today s board of contributors in addition to its own editorials usa today publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including ourboard of contributors to read more columns like this go to theopinion front page
