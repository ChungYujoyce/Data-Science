washington secretary of state mike pompeodenied that herecommended the firing ofthe department s watchdog because of an investigation into pompeo s conduct saying instead that the official was undermining the state department s mission pompeo told the washington post in an interview posted monday he was unaware that the oustedinspector general steve linick was investigating him for allegedly using a staffer to run his personal errands he acknowledged askingpresident donald trumpto fire linick but declined to name any specific instances of linick s undermining the state department the outlet reported i went to the president and made clear to him that inspector general linick wasn t performing a function in a way that we had tried to get him to that was additive for the state department very consistent with what the statute says he s supposed to be doing pompeo said the kinds of activities he s supposed to undertake to make us better to improve us rep eliot engel fired inspector general was investigating 2019 saudi arabia arms deal pompeo wouldn t respondto the post s questioning about the allegation whether he enlisted an aide to run his errands according to the posted interview i m not going to answer the host of unsubstantiated allegations about any of that he said rep eliot engel the democratic chairman of the house foreign affairs committee said that he had learned of the investigation into pompeo on saturday and said it suggested linick s firing is an unlawful act of retaliation it is not possible that this decision or my recommendation rather to the president rather was based on any effort to retaliate for any investigation that was going on or is currently going on pompeo told the post because i simply don t know i m not briefed on it i usually see these investigations in final draft form 24 hours 48 hours before the ig is prepared to release them so it s simply not possible for this to be an act of retaliation end of story trump announced linick was being removed from his post friday evening explaining a loss of confidence in linick s ability to do the job engel and other democratic lawmakershave called for an investigation into linick s termination suggesting the move was part of a larger pattern of the trump administration blocking independent oversight pompeo said monday that there did not need to be a reason for linick s termination the president obviously has the right to have an inspector general he said just like every presidentially confirmed position i can terminate them they serve at his pleasure for any reason or no reason house speaker nancy pelosi d calif acknowledged the president s right to fire an official but said if it looks like it s in retaliation for something that the inspector general is doing that could be unlawful democrats have also said linick wasinvestigating a declaration of anational security emergency in 2019 to justify an 8 1 billion arms sale to saudi arabia which pompeo did not discuss in his interview with the post in a letter to trump on monday pelosi said it was alarming that linick s firing may have to do with the arms sale investigation and that congress must be aware of a clear and substantial cause to fire an inspector general it is alarming to see news reports that your action may have been in response to inspector general linick nearing completion of an investigation into the approval of billions of dollars in arms sales to saudi arabia pelosi wrote therefore i am asking that you provide detailed and substantial justification for the removal of inspector general linick before the end of the 30 day period contributing will cummings deirdre shesgreen
