to macron s criticism in the economist of the u s s decision to withdraw troops from syria without consulting nato allies a move macron said was an example of the alliance experiencing the brain death of nato i think that s very insulting the u s president had told reporters nobody needs nato more than france and frankly the one that benefits really the least is the united states we re helping europe he continued i think when france makes a statement like they made about nato it s a very dangerous statement to make sitting with trump macron addressed his comments my statement created some reactions he said i do stand by it the two went on to speak about syria in the meeting held before reporters when asked if france had committed to take back detained isis fighters still in the region trump joked to macron would you like some nice isis fighters let s be serious macron cooly responded adding that there needs to be a larger push to defeat isis overall this is why he s a great politician because that s one of the greatest non answers i ve ever heard trump responded macron also brought up the issue of syria earlier in the meeting when i look at turkey they are fighting against those who fight with us shoulder to shoulder against isis macron said turning to trump trump decided to withdraw troops from the region after speaking with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan over the phone president erdogan subsequently launched an attack on syrian kurds following the u s s withdrawal from the region which some have argued constitutes ethnic cleansing syrian kurds were key allies in the u s s fight to defeat isis macron also demanded clarifications from the turkish side on its purchase of russian made air defense missile systems how is possible to be a member

united states and its nato allies none macron said in the interview speaking at a meeting tuesday with nato secretary general jens stoltenberg president donald trump responded to macron s comments president macron said that nato is brain dead i think that s very insulting the president told reporters he added it was a very very nasty statement towards the world leaders at the summit nobody needs nato more than france and frankly the one that benefits really the least is the united states we re helping europe he continued i think when france makes a statement like they made about nato it s a very dangerous statement to make speaking with trump on tuesday macron reaffirmed his comments to the economist saying i do stand by it the u s president is himself a longtime critic of nato

days seem to be over on wednesday the house judiciary committee will hold its first public hearing of the ongoing impeachment inquiry into the president experts will speak about the legality of impeaching the president for pressuring ukraine to investigate his political rivals former vice president and current 2020 presidential contender joe biden and his son hunter the white house declined the committee s invitation to take part in the hearing the judiciary committee is tasked with deciding if the evidence against trump warrants a formal house vote on his impeachment i think it s very unpatriotic of the democrats trump said when asked about the inquiry i think it s a very bad thing for our country trump repeated that he did nothing wrong and called the democrats crazy democrats on the house intelligence committee are scheduled to release a report on tuesday on their findings from the inquiry so far the republicans on the committee will release a rebuttal the summit begins just nine days before the u k s general election on dec 12 which comes after months of political deadlock over the u k s repeated failed attempts to reach a deal to exit the european union although he said he s a fan of brexit trump said i ll stay out of the election he added that he thinks boris is very capable and he will do a good job but said he could work with anybody trump schedule doesn t currently include a one on one meeting with the british prime minister despite the precent of the u s president usually meeting with the leader of the summit s host country however trump will meet with johnson tuesday night at meeting that includes several leaders before heading to a meeting with queen elizabeth ii and prince charles the president also spoke on his ongoing trade war with china and suggested he might delay plans to reach a deal the china trade deal is dependent on one thing do i want to make it he said adding that he has no deadline in some ways i think it s be better to wait until after the election with china you want to know the truth he continued the rise of china as a geopolitical force will likely come up again at the summit write to madeleine carlisle at
