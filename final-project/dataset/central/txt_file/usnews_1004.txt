adrian ozuna is sitting on a folding chair at the chinese community center in houston as the room empties out the squeaks from sneakers on an adjacent basketball court becoming audible ozuna is the president of the southwest democrats a club whose motto is reflecting the diversity of houston and he s just finished running a forum for candidates in local races you ve never heard of including state house seats and county tax assessor collector they re not the kind of candidates grabbing national headlines as the 2020 presidential contenders slug it out for the democratic nomination but with senator bernie sanders emerging as the party s front runner they are precisely the kind of candidates many democrats are worried about among party operatives and officials there s widespread fear that putting a self described democratic socialist at the top of the ticket will jeopardize the slow but steady gains democrats have made in recent years in red state cities like houston and its surrounding suburbs there are a lot of areas with a lot of swing voters who will be turned off who are turned off by that message ozuna says though ozuna s club has not endorsed a candidate he said he is cognizant of concerns that sanders could make it harder for local candidates we need to make sure that the voters who vote are on board as texans get ready to vote on super tuesday sanders isn t just the leader in the polls he s a constant topic of discussion among moderate democrats worried that his ambitious proposals like medicare for all and his broader calls for political revolution could alienate voters in suburbs like houston s that voted blue in 2018 and helped democrats win back the house if moderate suburbanites who dislike trump won t vote for sanders it could reverse those gains i m concerned just about the gains we re trying to make in texas says u s rep marc veasey who represents an urban and suburban congressional district that stretches between dallas and fort worth and who endorsed former vice president joe biden we need nine seats to be in the majority seat in the state legislature and i think bernie being at the top of the ticket makes that path much harder veasey is especially worried about the label of democratic socialism which he thinks voters in texas will reject there s not going to be enough explaining in the world that you can do to overcome that he says on the other hand progressives argue that diverse cities like houston are precisely the kind of place that voters would be willing to take a chance on an exciting candidate who can turn out the voters they need to turn this state blue that s why democrats across the country are watching places like harris county where houston is located it s a fast growing area that until 2016 was considered the largest swing county in the nation now democrats can comfortably say the area is trending blue a fact that reflects rapidly changing demographics with a population that is 40 latino and nearly 20 black the past two democratic presidential nominees have won here by widening margins and in 2018 u s rep lizzie fletcher won here becoming one of two democrats to flip a texas congressional district two days before super tuesday a group of democratic volunteers gathered at torchy s tacos a restaurant across the street from west university place an upper middle class well educated houston suburb that sits squarely in fletcher s congressional district they were there to canvas for kristi thibaut a candidate for harris county commissioner in the third precinct who s running on flooding related issues a chronic topic for the area and improving infrastructure is sanders my preferred candidate for this particular district probably not thibaut admit do i think it will really kill me no thibaut s political consultant is less circumspect i will tell you bernie s a disaster in texas if he s the nominee says keir murray sitting beside thibaut down ballot candidates will be hard pressed to make gains some recently elected incumbents will struggle to survive if he s the nominee he s just not i don t think the cup of tea for this state but progressives in texas say sanders can help reach new voters that could be pivotal to the democrats gaining new ground in the state mike siegel a progressive candidate running in texas 10th congressional district which abuts the harris county suburbs says he thinks sanders is the best democrat to power the party s goals in texas it s just a very sophisticated intersectional approach to campaigning and it s a very bottom up strategy for each community siegel says siegel nearly flipped the seat he is running for in 2018 and thinks that this time he will find success because of continuity in message and a more sophisticated operation he believes the same is true for sanders siegel and other progressives also point to former u s rep beto o rourke who came up a few points short in his bid for senator ted cruz s seat in 2018 as evidence that there is a home in texas for progressive ideas o rourke who also ran a failed presidential campaign this cycle drew out a lot of new voters in his senate run and came close to beating cruz on what was considered by many in the democratic establishment to be too progressive of a platform for such a red state democratic organizers in texas often say texas is not a red state it s a non voting one sanders strategy of trying to motivate new voters including latinos meshes with what democrats have already been trying to do in texas texas organizing project a progressive grassroots organization whose core constituencies are black and latino voters estimates there are half a million eligible but unregistered voters of color in harris county one of several they have a presence in they ve been working to turn them out for a decade and say they re starting to see an impact in 2018 for example progressive lina hidalgo who the group organized for was elected as harris county judge in an upset victory over an incumbent republican hidalgo is the first latina and woman to serve in that position in february sanders got top s endorsement he excites people says mary moreno top s communications director days before the state votes on super tuesday the houston office is busy with volunteers phone banking and getting ready to go out and canvass for down ballot candidates it s not enough that people are afraid of trump or don t like trump right moreno adds we need someone they can vote for somebody who they re excited about and i think that s what bernie sanders does people are excited to vote for him whether they share that enthusiasm or are anxious about sanders long term impact in local politics most texan democrats agree on this they want president donald trump out of the white house getting behind the democratic candidate whoever it is will be key to making that happen says erika rocha the texas state director for swing left a group working to flip swing areas blue rocha says she doesn t know what the effect would be on other democrats if sanders is the nominee we ll have to see what that looks like when people cast their ballots she says unifying in support of the eventual democratic nominee is going to be for everybody up and down the ballot write to lissandra villa at lissandra villa time com
