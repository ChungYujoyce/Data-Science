of the democratic presidential race without warning on friday ending a long shot bid that began with unmatched buzz that quickly faded he announced the move in an email to supporters and later in an emotional speech in iowa where he had planned to spend the next four days stumping at candidate forums a fish fry brew pubs and college campuses though it is difficult to accept it is clear to me now that this campaign does not have the means to move forward successfully he wrote my service to the country will not be as a candidate or as the nominee o rourke had yet to score an invitation to the next televised debate on nov 20 in atlanta and it wasn t looking likely a body blow in a crowded field the party set a nov 13 deadline to hit 3 in four national polls and o rourke was two polls short with tepid support and no momentum the decision ramps up pressure on juli n castro and other laggards and could accelerate the winnowing with less than 100 days before the iowa caucuses president donald trump who has enjoyed using o rourke as a foil called him a nasty guy at a rally in tupelo miss and taunted him for boasting that he was born to be president he made a total fool out of himself trump told his crowd he came out of texas a very hot political property and he went back as cold as you can be so you come from texas you don t like religion you don t like oil you don t have guns that s not a good combination oh no beto just dropped out of race for president despite him saying he was born for this i don t think so in a fawning cover story timed to his campaign launch vanity fair quoted the texan saying that i m just born to be in it he insisted later that he was saying only that he felt drawn to public service not that he felt destined to run for president but the image of entitlement dogged him and dragged him down his penchant for livestreaming road trips rallies and even haircuts and dental cleanings brought social media stardom and a devoted following but also made him a target for lampooning of the sort dished out by hillary clinton adviser philippe reines on friday night he predicted that o rourke would return to the spotlight the next day to apologize for dropping out badly say he s learned from the bad dropout and ready to re drop out as for trump although he loved to bash o rourke recently at a dallas rally he painted the texan as a gun grabbing enemy of religious freedom he also provided much needed oxygen at key moments when trump descended on el paso for a february campaign rally o rourke took the opening and led a massive counter demonstration that elevated his national profile weeks ahead of his campaign launch excited crowds gathered for a first glimpse in iowa and new hampshire but their attention had wandered by the end for reasons not yet apparent o rourke cut short his campaign so abruptly that his wife amy who occasionally joined him on the stump was not on hand for the final moments of his campaign the night he lost to cruz she was at his side as he told a sea of disappointed but adoring backers that i am so f ing proud of you guys this was a decision that we made so recently and so reluctantly that she can t be here in person he told a far more modest but equally adoring crowd in des moines as he often did while campaigning he wore a grey v neck sweater and stood on a box as an aide livestreamed the moment a hint of sadness in his voice he thanked supporters and aides you will always be with us and i will always be with you the anticlimactic scene came almost exactly a year after he electrified democrats in texas and nationwide as the party s most formidable statewide candidate in a generation he held sen ted cruz below 51 and nearly managed to snap a democratic losing streak that dates to 1998 in texas the 80 million he raised set an all time record for any senate nominee anywhere the buzz that race generated turned into a siren song and he heeded it after some hesitation and a solo road trip that he journaled online as he weighed his options in one of his breezy often poetic entries he confessed that the defeat to cruz put him in a funk a candor that endeared him to many and prompted critics to dismiss him as self absorbed in march he plunged into the presidential race as a leading contender but o rourke never found a niche and betomania didn t last long with no statewide office under his belt his resume paled besides those of other competitors he emerged from the texas senate race with an image as a moderate compared with the likes of sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders given his support for free trade and the oil and gas industry as a white male in the party s most diverse field in history he couldn t avoid comparison to a former vice president joe biden whose experience he couldn t touch and pete buttigieg a small city mayor whose charisma ended up overshadowing o rourke s the texan vowed to support the party s eventual nominee with all of his energy though this is the end of this campaign we are right in the middle of this fight he told supporters in des moines citing gun violence climate change structural racism and the consequences of the trump presidency as ongoing issues that motivate him and bring together democrats he noted that his last stop before returning friday to iowa was newtown conn site of a horrific school shooting on dec 14 2012 that left 26 people dead all but a half dozen of them children i will still be part of all the causes that brought us here together in the first place he said his prospects were already flagging when news came of the el paso massacre on aug 3 he rushed home and suspended traditional campaign activities for nearly two weeks skipping the iowa state fair to attend funerals for the 22 victims console his community lead marches against hate and serve as the border city s unofficial ambassador as national attention focused on gun violence and anti immigrant sentiment rivals lauded the leadership he showed during that episode but distanced themselves when he began demanding mandatory buybacks of assault weapons a departure from his vow during the senate race and up to that point in the presidential race that he would let americans keep any guns they already owned and only wanted to ban future sales hell yes we re going to take your ar 15 your ak 47 he declared at a debate in houston six weeks after the rampage beto will forever be known as the one who finally dropped the pretense and admitted that democrats want to confiscate guns from law abiding citizens asserted trump campaign spokesman tim murtaugh beto will forever be known as the one who finally dropped the pretense and admitted that democrats want to confiscate guns from law abiding citizens after the massacre he retooled his campaign devoting more time to sites of shootings and hate crimes and somewhat less in the traditional battlegrounds he got a temporary bounce in polls but not enough he gave no hints ahead of friday s decision that he was even toying with such a move hours before he dropped out his campaign announced that he would make his pitch to new hampshire civic leaders next friday at the politics and eggs breakfast a rite of passage for serious contenders he was already scheduled to visit concord that day to file for a spot on the first in the nation primary ballot beto o rourke is a fighter advocate and leader texas democratic party chairman gilberto hinojosa said after the announcement in the wake of the el paso shootings he made the entire country proud as he focused his campaign on ending gun violence and the rise of white supremacy beto o rourke has done amazing things for the democratic party in texas and we look forward to his future castro the other texan in the presidential field has struggled even more for traction the former obama housing secretary and san antonio mayor has none of the four polls needed to qualify for the nov 20 debate he lauded his erstwhile rival beto has inspired millions of americans all over our country and rallied texans and el pasoans after the tragedy that struck his hometown i am thankful for his voice and his continued leadership and i look forward to working together in whatever he chooses to do next he wrote beto has inspired millions of americans all over our country and rallied texans and el pasoans after the

supporters in texas and around the country had hoped that he would turn his sights in 2020 on sen john cornyn capitalizing on the network and excitement he generated against cruz but from the outset of his presidential race he ruled out a senate bid insisting it would not be a fallback option even if the white house dream fell short with the texas primary well underway o rourke has repeatedly tamped down speculation he showcased democrats angling for a shot at cornyn on oct 17 as he led a counter rally when trump campaigned before a huge crowd in downtown dallas carol donovan chairwoman of the dallas county democrats called it sad and disappointing for o rourke to drop out beto o rourke had so many fans in texas she said he was so popular in texas and there were so many people who were rooting for him she was resigned to the fact that he won t run for the u s senate seat no doubt a relief to the likes of mj hegar and state sen royce west but i don t think we ve seen the last of beto
