 danielle kurtzleben tamara keith arnie seipel peter overby matt katz scott horsley editor s note this has been updated at 1 25 p m et friday with additional fact checking information hillary clinton accepted the democratic nomination for president thursday night delivering a speech that lays out her plan to address terrorist threats and create jobs npr s politics team annotated clinton s speech below portions commented on are highlighted followed by analysis context and fact check in italics you can read our fact check of donald trump s speech at the republican national convention last week here thank you thank you so much thank you thank you all so so much thank you thank you thank you all very very much thank you for that amazing welcome thank you all for the great convention that we ve had a few thank yous at the top of a speech are not uncommon but look at all the people clinton thanks here at the top of her speech this is something she does at every single campaign event she thanks local elected officials she thanks her top volunteers and campaign organizers by name the scale and consistency of the thank yous are a trademark of clinton s understated campaign style tamara keith and chelsea thank you i m so proud to be your mother and so proud of the woman you ve become thank you for bringing marc into our family and charlotte and aidan into the world and bill that conversation we started in the law library 45 years ago it is still going strong you know that conversation has lasted through good times that filled us with joy and hard times that tested us and i ve even gotten a few words in along the way on tuesday night i was so happy to see that my explainer in chief is still on the job i m also grateful to the rest of my family and to the friends of a lifetime for all of you whose hard work brought us here tonight and to those of you who joined this campaign this week thank you what a remarkable week it s been we heard the man from hope bill clinton bill clinton grew up in hope ark and the man from hope is the title of a biographical film shown during the 1992 democratic national convention the last line of bill clinton s acceptance speech in 1992 was i end tonight where it all began for me i still believe in a place called hope danielle kurtzleben and the man of hope barack obama america is stronger because of president obama s leadership and i m better because of his friendship we heard from our terrific vice president the one and only joe biden he spoke from his big heart about our party s commitment to working people as only he can do and first lady michelle obama reminded us that our children are watching and the president we elect is going to be their president too and for those of you out there who are just getting to know tim kaine you will soon understand why the people of virginia keep promoting him from city council and mayor to governor and now senator and he will make the whole country proud as our vice president and i want to thank bernie sanders bernie bernie your campaign inspired millions of americans particularly the young people who threw their hearts and souls into our primary sanders won 12 million votes in the democratic primaries to clinton s 15 8 million according to realclearpolitics and clinton is right about young people s devotion to sanders as the washington post s aaron blake found sanders won more under 30 votes this primary season than clinton and trump combined danielle kurtzleben you ve put economic and social justice issues front and center where they belong and to all of your supporters here and around the country i want you to know i ve heard you your cause is our cause after the speech i spoke to several sanders supporters in the arena who appreciated the acknowledgement but still weren t convinced that she really meant it tamara keith our country needs your ideas energy and passion that is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for america we wrote it together now let s go out and make it happen together my friends we ve come to philadelphia the birthplace of our nation because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today we all know the story but we usually focus on how it turned out and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all when representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here some wanted to stick with the king and some wanted to stick it to the king the revolution hung in the balance then somehow they began listening to each other compromising finding common purpose and by the time they left philadelphia they had begun to see themselves as one nation that s what made it possible to stand up to a king that took courage they had courage our founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together now now america is once again at a moment of reckoning powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart bonds of trust and respect are fraying and just as with our founders there are no guarantees it truly is up to us we have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together our country s motto is e pluribus unum out of many we are one will we stay true to that motto well we heard donald trump s answer last week at his convention he wants to divide us from the rest of the world and from each other he s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise he s taken the republican party a long way from morning in america to midnight in america he wants us to fear the future and fear each other well you know a great democratic president franklin delano roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to trump more than 80 years ago during a much more perilous time the only thing we have to fear is fear itself now we are clear eyed about what our country is up against but we are not afraid we will rise to the challenge just as we always have we will not build a wall instead we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one and we ll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy we we will not ban a religion we will work with all americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism donald trump initially called for a temporary ban on all muslims entering the u s following the san bernardino calif terrorist attack last december but he now talks about fighting terrorism through a temporary ban on people from countries with a known history of terrorism tamara keith there s a lot of work to do too many people haven t had a pay raise since the crash there s too much inequality too little social mobility too much paralysis in washington too many threats at home and abroad but just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as americans to meet these challenges we have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world we have the most tolerant and generous young people we ve ever had we have the most powerful military the most innovative entrepreneurs the most enduring values freedom and equality justice and opportunity we should be so proud that those words are associated with us i have to tell you as your secretary of state i went to 112 countries when people hear those words they hear america so don t let anyone tell you that our country is weak we re not don t let anyone tell you we don t have what it takes we do and most of all don t believe anyone who says i alone can fix it yes those were actually donald trump s words in cleveland and they should set off alarm bells for all of us really i alone can fix it isn t he forgetting troops on the front lines police officers and firefighters who run toward danger doctors and nurses who care for us teachers who change lives entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe he s forgetting every last one of us americans don t say i alone can fix it we say we ll fix it together in his convention speech trump did say i alone can fix it he was referring to the political system he sees as broken clinton first used this line of attack the friday after the gop convention and it has been well received by supporters ever since clinton is taking the phrase beyond trump s original context but there are certainly other instances in his convention speech and others where he has portrayed himself as the one who can fix various ills from isis to the economy tamara keith and remember remember our founders fought a revolution and wrote a constitution so america would never be a nation where one person had all the power two hundred and forty years later we still put our faith in each other look at what happened in dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers police chief david brown asked the community to support his force maybe even join them and you know how the community responded nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days according to data posted on the dallas police department facebook page 467 people applied to the department between july 8 and july 20 that s more than triple the 136 people that applied between june 8 and june 20 danielle kurtzleben that s how americans answer when the call for help goes out twenty years ago i wrote a book called it takes a village and a lot of people looked at the title and asked what the heck do you mean by that this is what i mean none of us can raise a family build a business heal a community or lift a country totally alone america needs every one of us to lend our energy our talents our ambition to making our nation better and stronger i believe that with all my heart that s why stronger together is not just a lesson from our history it s not just a slogan for our campaign it s a guiding principle for the country we ve always been and the future we re going to build a country where the economy works for everyone not just those at the top where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school no matter what zip code you live in a country where all our children can dream and those dreams are within reach where families are strong communities are safe and yes where love trumps hate that s the country we re fighting for that s the future we re working toward and so my friends it is with humility determination and boundless confidence in america s promise that i accept your nomination for president of the united states now sometimes sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage as you know i m not one of those people i ve been your first lady served eight years as a senator from the great state of new york then i represented all of you as secretary of state but my job titles only tell you what i ve done they don t tell you why the truth is through all these years of public service the service part has always come easier to me than the public part i get it that some people just don t know what to make of me so let me tell you the family i m from well no one had their name on big buildings my family were builders of a different kind builders in the way most american families are they used whatever tools they had whatever god gave them and whatever life in america provided and built better lives and better futures for their kids my grandfather worked in the same scranton lace mill for 50 years because he believed that if he gave everything he had his children would have a better life than he did and he was right my dad hugh made it to college he played football at penn state and enlisted in the navy after pearl harbor when the war was over he started his own small business printing fabric for draperies i remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens he wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had and he did my mother dorothy was abandoned by her parents as a young girl sheended up on her own at 14 working as a housemaid she was saved by the kindness of others her first grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year the lesson she passed on to me years later stuck with me no one gets through life alone we have to look out for each other and lift each other up and she made sure i learned the words from our methodist faith do all the good you can for all the people you can in all the ways you can as long as ever you can so i went to work for the children s defense fund going door to door in new bedford mass on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school i remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house she told me how badly she wanted to go to school it just didn t seem possible in those days and i couldn t stop thinking of my mother and what she d gone through as a child it became clear to me that simply caring is not enough to drive real progress you have to change both hearts and laws you need both understanding and action so we gathered facts we built a coalition and our work helped convince congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities it s a big idea isn t it every kid with a disability has the right to go to school but how how do you make an idea like that real you do it step by step year by year sometimes even door by door my heart just swelled when i saw anastasia somoza representing millions of young people on this stage because we changed our law to make sure she got an education so it s true i sweat the details of policy whether we re talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in flint mich the number of mental health facilities in iowa or the cost of your prescription drugs because it s not just a detail if it s your kid if it s your family it s a big deal and it should be a big deal to your president too after the four days of this convention you ve seen some of the people who ve inspired me people who let me into their lives and became a part of mine people like ryan moore and lauren manning they told their stories tuesday night i first met ryan as a 7 year old he was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds because i leaned over to lift him up children like ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the children s health insurance program that covers 8 million kids in our country chip had 8 1 million kids on the rolls as of 2015 and while clinton wasn t in the legislature she was instrumental in getting it passed as politifact found earlier this year danielle kurtzleben lauren manning who stood here with such grace and power was gravely injured on 9 11 it was the thought of her and debbie st john who you saw in the movie and john dolan and joe sweeney and all the victims and survivors that kept me working as hard as i could in the senate on behalf of 9 11 families and our first responders who got sick from their time at ground zero i was thinking of lauren debbie and all the others 10 years later in the white house situation room when president obama made the courageous decision that finally brought osama bin laden to justice and in this campaign i ve met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change and with your help i will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the white house and you heard you heard from from republicans and independents who are supporting our campaign well i will be a president for democrats republicans and independents for the struggling the striving the successful for all those who vote for me and for those who don t for all americans together tonight tonight we ve reached a milestone in our nation s march toward a more perfect union the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president standing here standing here as my mother s daughter and my daughter s mother i m so happy this day has come i m happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between i m happy for boys and men too because when any barrier falls in america it clears the way for everyone after all when there are no ceilings the sky s the limit so let s keep going let s keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across america has the opportunity she deserves to have but even more important than the history we make tonight is the history we will write together in the years ahead let s begin with what we re going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead now i don t think president obama and vice president biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes our economy is so much stronger than when they took office nearly 15 million new private sector jobs twenty million more americans with health insurance and an auto industry that just had its best year ever the jobs gain figure clinton cites is from the trough which came about a year after president obama took office the insurance figure includes those who gained coverage through new insurance exchanges expansion of medicaid and changes in the private insurance market that allow young adults to stay on their parents plan u s auto sales hit 17 5 million last year an all time high scott horsley now that s real progress but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo not by a long shot we re still facing deep seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery i ve gone around our country talking to working families and i ve heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn t working for them some of you are frustrated even furious and you know what you re right it s not yet working the way it should americans are willing to work and work hard but right now an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do and less respect for them period democrats we are the party of working people but we haven t done a good enough job showing we get what you re going through and we re going to do something to help so tonight i want to tell you tonight how we will empower americans to live better lives my primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the united states from my first day in office to my last especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind from our inner cities to our small towns from indian country to coal country from communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures and here s what i believe i believe america thrives when the middle class thrives i believe that our economy isn t working the way it should because our democracy isn t working the way it should that s why we need to appoint supreme court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights not restrict them with this oversimplified phrase clinton is effectively calling for court mandated public financing which is extremely unlikely peter overby and if necessary we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united passing a constitutional amendment would very likely be really really really hard in the current political climate of gridlock proposing one requires either a two thirds vote of the house and senate or a constitutional convention which two thirds of the states would have to call for according to the national archives to be ratified it requires 38 of the 50 states to approve it danielle kurtzleben and not even advocates of this one can agree on language that avoids other first amendment issues peter overby i believe american corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return many of them are but too many aren t it s wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other and i believe wall street can never ever be allowed to wreck main street again and i believe in science i believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good paying clean energy jobs i believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy it would be self defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out comprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together and it s the right thing to do the congressional budget office projected the immigration bill passed by the senate in 2013 would boost the economy and reduce the federal deficit while slightly reducing wages scott horsley so whatever party you belong to or if you belong to no party at all if you share these beliefs this is your campaign this is part of clinton s occasional outreach to both sanders supporters and people she once called reasonable republicans at the convention thursday night speakers included a former ronald reagan staffer and a woman who is leading a group of republican women supporting clinton tamara keith if you believe that companies should share profits with their workers not pad executive bonuses join us if you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty join us if you believe that every man woman and child in america has the right to affordable health care join us if you believe that we should say no to unfair trade deals that we should stand up to china that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers then join us if you believe we should expand social security and protect a woman s right to make her own health care decisions then join us and yes yes if you believe that your working mother wife sister or daughter deserves equal pay join us that s how we re going to sure this economy works for everyone not just those at the top now you didn t hear any of this did you from donald trump at his convention he spoke for 70 odd minutes and i do mean odd and he offered zero solutions trump s acceptance speech at the republican national convention in cleveland offered a number of measures to address the various problems he defined they included trump s ban on muslims entering the united states which he now describes as a proposal for the u s to suspend immigration from any nation that has been compromised by terrorism until such time as proven vetting mechanisms have been put in place trump also reiterated his call for a border wall to combat illegal immigration new trade policies in addition to renegotiating bad trade agreements infrastructure investment and tax reform clinton has argued these proposals are wrong or not feasible and therefore aren t solutions but the statement suggests trump s speech was devoid of specific proposals which is not true arnie seipel but we already know he doesn t believe these things no wonder he doesn t like talking about his plans you might have noticed i love talking about mine in my first hundred days we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new good paying jobs since world war ii jobs in manufacturing clean energy technology and innovation small business and infrastructure if we invest in infrastructure now we ll not only create jobs today but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future and we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs bernie sanders and i will work together to make college tuition free for the middle class and debt free for all clinton originally had a debt free college plan which was designed to ensure that people could attend college without taking out loans that meant the student had to work and that the family would contribute what it could but in july she moved further in her primary rival bernie sanders direction proposing that college tuition at public universities for students from families making 125 000 or less a threshold that would be phased in would be free danielle kurtzleben we will also we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt it s just not right that donald trump can ignore his debts and students and families can t refinance their debts and something we don t say often enough sure college is crucial but a four year degree should not be the only path to a good job the income gap between high school and college grads is bigger for millennials than it was for generation xers baby boomers and the silent generation according to a 2014 pew research center report danielle kurtzleben we will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it we will give small businesses like my dad s a boost make it easier to get credit way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks in america if you can dream it you should be able to build it and we will help you balance family and work and you know what if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the woman card then deal me in now here s the other thing we re not only going to make all these investments we re going to pay for every single one of them and here s how wall street corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes this is not because we resent success because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent that s where the money is and we are going to follow the money in his convention speech bernie sanders said something similar saying that 85 percent of the income gains had gone to the top 1 percent a stat that politifact called half true because it was outdated in 2014 and 2015 they write the 99 percent s incomes recovered and the top 1 percent s share fell to 52 percent danielle kurtzleben and if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas we ll make them pay us back and we ll put that money to work where it belongs creating jobs here at home now now i imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking well that all sounds pretty good but how are you going to get it done how are you going to break through the gridlock in washington well look at my record i ve worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people and if you give me the chance that s what i ll do as president but then i also imagine people are thinking out there but trump he s a businessman he must know something about the economy well let s take a closer look in atlantic city 60 miles from here you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because donald trump refused to pay his bills now remember what the president said last night don t boo vote people who did the work and needed the money and didn t get it not because he couldn t pay them but because he wouldn t pay them he just stiffed them true specifically she is referring to the losses suffered by contractors on the taj mahal casino the associated press found that trump owed 70 million to 253 contractors when the casino opened after the casino filed for bankruptcy about a year later many contractors got just 33 percent of what they were owed as a result some went out of business it s unclear whether trump could have paid those bills as clinton argued he was deeply overleveraged on the project with extensive debt and both his corporate and personal finances were in relatively poor shape at the time matt katz wnyc and you know that sales pitch he s making to be president put your faith in him and you ll win big that s the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses then trump walked away and left working people holding the bag he also talks a big game about putting america first well please explain what part of america first leads him to make trump ties in china not colorado trump suits in mexico not michigan trump furniture in turkey not ohio trump picture frames in india not wisconsin donald trump says he wants to make america great again well he could start by actually making things in america again now the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security you know anyone anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face from baghdad to kabul to nice and paris and brussels from san bernardino to orlando we re dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated so it s no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance looking for steady leadership wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority i m proud that we put a lid on iran s nuclear program without firing a single shot now we have to enforce it and we must keep supporting israel s security experts believe the agreement has lengthened the time iran would need to develop a nuclear bomb from weeks or months to at least a year however the deal has had little effect on iran s nonnuclear troublemaking elsewhere in the region scott horsley i m proud that we shaped a global climate agreement now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments including ourselves and i m proud to stand by our allies in nato against any threat they face including from russia i ve laid out my strategy for defeating isis we will strike their sanctuaries from the air and support local forces taking them out on the ground we will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen we will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country it won t be easy or quick but make no mistake we will prevail now donald trump donald trump says and this is a quote i know more about isis than the generals do no donald you don t he thinks he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are a disaster trump said our military is a disaster in a debate in charleston s c hosted by the fox business network on jan 14 2016 arnie seipel well i ve had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years including as a senator on the armed services committee and i know how wrong he is our military is a national treasure we entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces decisions about war and peace life and death a president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country including captain khan and the sons of tim kaine and mike pence both marines so just ask yourself do you really think donald trump has the temperament to be commander in chief donald trump can t even handle the rough and tumble of a presidential campaign he loses his cool at the slightest provocation when he s gotten a tough question from a reporter when he s challenged in a debate when he sees a protester at a rally imagine if you dare imagine imagine him in the oval office facing a real crisis a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons i can t put it i can t put it any better than jackie kennedy did after the cuban missile crisis she said that what worried president kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started not by big men with self control and restraint but by little men the ones moved by fear and pride america s strength doesn t come from lashing out it relies on smarts judgment cool resolve and the precise and strategic application of power and that s the kind of commander in chief i pledge to be and if we re serious about keeping our country safe we also can t afford to have a president who s in the pocket of the gun lobby i m not here to repeal the second amendment i m not here to take away your guns i just don t want you to be shot by someone who shouldn t have a gun in the first place we will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals terrorists and all others who would do us harm you know for decades people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch but i ask you how can we just stand by and do nothing you heard you saw family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage you heard you saw family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals i refuse to believe we can t find common ground here we have to heal the divides in our country not just on guns but on race immigration and more and that starts with listening listening to each other trying as best we can to walk in each other s shoes so let s put ourselves in the shoes of young black and latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism and are made to feel like their lives are disposable let s put ourselves in the shoes of police officers kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job we will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve and we will defend we will defend all our rights civil rights human rights and voting rights women s rights and workers rights lgbt rights and the rights of people with disabilities and we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from you know for the past year many people made the mistake of laughing off donald trump s comments excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show they thought he couldn t possibly mean all the horrible things he says like when he called women pigs or said that an american judge couldn t be fair because of his mexican heritage or when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability or insults prisoners of war like john mccain a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect now at first at first i admit i couldn t believe he meant it either it was just too hard to fathom that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things could be like that but here s the sad truth there is no other donald trump this is it and in the end it comes down to what donald trump doesn t get that america is great because america is good after clinton s speech there were claims on twitter that this quote was lifted from alexis de tocqueville s democracy in america interestingly the weekly standard found in 1995 that it is a line of unknown provenance often misattributed to de tocqueville reagan used it by way his speechwriters said of eisenhower as well as pat buchanan and bill clinton the weekly standard wrote danielle kurtzleben so enough with the bigotry and bombast donald trump s not offering real change he s offering empty promises and what are we offering a bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country to keep you safe to get you good jobs and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve the choice is clear my friends every generation of americans has come together to make our country freer fairer and stronger none of us ever have or can do it alone i know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart it can be hard to imagine how we ll ever pull together but i m here to tell you tonight progress is possible i know i know because i ve seen it in the lives of people across america who get knocked down and get right back up and i know it i know it from my own life more than a few times i ve had to pick myself up and get back in the game like so much else in my life i got this from my mother too she never let me back down from any challenge when i tried to hide from a neighborhood bully she literally blocked the door go back out there she said and she was right you have to stand up to bullies you have to keep working to make things better even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce we lost our mother a few years ago but i miss her every day and i still hear her voice urging me to keep working keep fighting for right no matter what that s what we need to do together as a nation though we may not live to see the glory as the song from the musical hamilton goes let us gladly join the fight let our legacy be about planting seeds in a garden you never get to see that s why we re here not just in this hall but on this earth the founders showed us that and so have many others since they were drawn together by love of country and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow that is the story of america and we begin a new chapter tonight yes the world is watching what we do yes america s destiny is ours to choose so let s be stronger together my fellow americans let s look to the future with courage and confidence let s build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country and when we do america will be greater than ever

house or the senate in fact a two thirds vote of both is required a previous version of this story incorrectly said that proposing a constitutional amendment requires a two thirds vote of either the
