during the presser trump appeared to suggest that ultraviolet light and the ingesting of disinfectants could serve as treatments for the novel coronavirus when he gets new information he likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue and so that s what dialogue he was having i think he just saw the information at the time immediately before the press conference and he was still digesting that information dr birx told host jesse watters during a preview of the interview shown by fox chief white house correspondent john roberts on friday watters also referenced dr birx s comments when speaking on fox news program the five on friday i m having dr birx on my weekend show and i actually asked her you were there dr birx do you think the president would say anything dangerous watters said she said no she said he was probably as he does thinking out loud and trying to come up with a good idea and just talking to the person at dhs he continued the white house did not immediately offer a response to time s request for comment on dr birx s statements during an april 23 press conference bill bryan an undersecretary at the department of homeland security dhs

preparing for the study to undergo that process keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here following bryan s announcement president trump said so i asked bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of supposing we hit the body with a tremendous whether it s ultraviolet or just very powerful light and i think you said that that hasn t been checked but you re going to test it and then i said supposing you brought the light inside the body which you can do either through the skin or in some other way and i think you said you re going to test that too it sounds interesting and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute trump continued and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that a zoomed in clip of dr birx s reaction to these comments went viral
