fervor but for most donald trump s claims of a rigged election aren t an invitation to violence loading october 21 2016 barbara gibbons never used to be passionate about politics then in 2008 the mother of six watched as president obama won the white house amid allegations that he had ties to a controversial group accused of falsifying voter registration information four years later a pew center report revealed that nearly 2 million dead people were still registered to vote in the united states by the time donald trump announced his candidacy in 2015 ms gibbons was convinced that the united states political system was corrupt and needed an overhaul today she sees in mr trump the nation s last real hope for change and should trump lose on nov 8 gibbons worries that drastic measures may be necessary to prevent further abuse of americans constitutional rights if the situation continues the way that it s going she says it just might take another revolution it just might take a civil war to get our country back it s a statement that appears to bolster growing concerns about unrest over the results of the november presidential elections in voicing unsubstantiated charges of election rigging at the final presidential debate wednesday night critics said trump not only cast a shadow on the very foundation of american democracy liberal commentators also raised the specter of intimidation at the polls and gave implicit consent to post election turmoil but interviews with voters in california s kern county a region in the central valley with deep roots in cultural and political conservatism reveals a less militant response to trump s remarks by and large residents agreed it would be disappointing even upsetting to see hillary clinton win the presidency yet few besides gibbons said anything about responding with violence it may be a possibility perhaps in some pockets of the country where we ve seen anger at trump rallies says jeanine kraybill an assistant professor of political science at california state university bakersfield kern county s largest city but from my experience here i don t think it ll get to a level of violence she says and i think there are definitely parallels with what is happening in the central valley with other states kern county sits at the southern tip of california s san joaquin valley just about 100 miles north of los angeles in terms of culture and politics however the place looks a lot more like the bible belt than hollywood residents here have a firm tradition of conservatism one that values smaller government fewer regulations and the second amendment severe drought throughout the 1930s forced millions of farmers and their families out of the great plains by 1940 200 000 of them had resettled in california today the descendants of those transplants give kern county a distinct republican streak among both working class whites and the scions of oil and agriculture the region s two main industries in economy and demographics the region also shares much with the areas of the midwest and the south that animated trump support nationwide the great recession coupled with california s protracted drought led to major cuts in manufacturing and agriculture in the region unemployment in kern county remains nearly double the state rate and while the area has like the rest of california gradually diversified over the past two decades there s little interest in developing the cosmopolitan culture of los angeles and san francisco professor kraybill says as bakersfield resident craig buster barnard puts it we are in california but we are not of california everybody puts this part of california down he adds in his south texas drawl picked up from years spent there where his grandfather grew up we had to be taught to be self reliant so when trump brings up allegations of a rigged system that really causes residents to be suspicious kraybill says some of us might think that s irresponsible and unprecedented to state but that resonates with them for gibbons the mother of six her support of trump stems from a deep distrust of the current political establishment which she calls the regime she s horrified at what she sees as government encroachment on her constitutional rights the only way to reverse the trend she says is to elect someone to office who is outside of that system we need to rally together and make a change she says leaning out of the driver s side of her pickup adorned with a trump sticker and a miniature american flag and should that effort fail violence is almost never the answer she says but there is genuine fear at a pizza parlor in bakersfield members of the kern county young republicans a volunteer organization that helps local and national gop campaigns gathered to watch the final debate for at least one person present the notion of a clinton victory was alarming my parents call me a doomsayer says bryce zaden a member of the group director of sales for a local equipment leasing company but i personally think we ll be at war soon enough if hillary wins for others trump losing the election could be a reason to buy guns but not to use them violently i d probably go buy some stock in a gun company says phillip peters the group s chairman it ll probably go through the roof the way it did after obama was elected in oildale an unincorporated area just north of bakersfield the mood was more sullen than enraged residents outright refused to talk politics when asked about their support for either candidate many shrugged and said neither was worth voting for most however sounded like retiree linda parker sure she says if hillary wins i would be upset but i don t know what i would do about it still some held onto the hope that the nation would manage to overcome its differences regardless who becomes president if trump wins the people who hate him they re going to come along though they may not like it says dean haddock a clinical psychologist and chair of the republican party of kern county if hillary wins the people are going to stay with it and they re going to support it because it s the will of the people he says the best thing i love about the united states is we re able to exchange power and still we re going to be together get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox even
