three years ago this month on june 27 2016 the supreme court ruled in the biggest abortion case in more than two decades whole woman s health v hellerstedt in a vote of 5 to 3 the justices struck down two provisions in a texas law as unconstitutional because they placed an undue burden on a woman s right to access an abortion the law required abortion clinics to have facilities like an ambulatory surgical center and physicians who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital provisions which abortion advocates say are medically unnecessary and cumbersome for healthcare providers in her concurring opinion justice ruth ginsburg argued that as doctors consider abortion to be safe it would be beyond rational belief that such regulations were necessary while the decision was hailed as a landmark ruling and a victory for supporters of abortion rights states have continued to pass laws limiting a woman s ability to terminate a pregnancy in the past year several states have passed heartbeat legislation which bans abortion after a fetal heartbeat is detected and alabama has passed a near complete ban on the procedure although even some abortion opponents say that they don t expect the legislation to be upheld in the lower courts others have acknowledged that the goal is to mount a challenge to abortion in the u s supreme court in hopes of overturning roe at the same time other states have passed legislation to expand protections for abortion new york for instance passed a law in january that would permit abortion after 24 weeks if a woman s health is at risk or if the fetus is unable to survive outside the womb time spoke to stephanie toti the lawyer who argued on behalf of whole woman s health about the state of abortion access three years after the decision toti is currently working as senior counsel and project director for the lawyering project which she founded in 2017 to promote reproductive rights and justice she also spent 10 years working for the center for reproductive rights we are working on a number of cases across the country to promote access to contraception and abortion we ve got two cases in texas one that challenges an embryonic and fetal tissue disposition requirement which requires that all pregnancy related tissue resulting from a miscarriage or an abortion at a health center be buried or cremated so it essentially requires that healthcare providers treat that tissue like human remains regardless of the personal beliefs or values of their patients we ve got a second case in texas challenging a broader set of restrictions on abortion including trap laws targeted regulation of abortion providers mandatory delay parental consent and laws that deny abortion patients the benefits of scientific progress so for example texas has a ban on the use of telemedicine in abortions there also we re representing the city of baltimore in a challenge to the trump administration s title x modifications what these new regulations do is they create a gag rule that says that healthcare providers who participate in the title x program can t counsel or refer their patient for abortions title x serves a lot of different communities and healthcare providers so planned parenthood is a big title x recipient but the city of baltimore through its health department also operates a number of title x programs and so they would lose several million dollars if these regulations were to take effect the access situation in texas has been mixed since the whole women s health decision unfortunately a number of clinics were forced to close while that litigation was ongoing because some of the requirements had taken effect at least temporarily and that forced nearly half the clinics in the state to close and a lot of them were never able to reopen it s sad because after the clinic is closed for a while they have to start to lay off staff and they can t hold on to the building lease they have to start selling off equipment and then particularly for the health practices that are independent kind of single healthcare practices it s really hard for them to sustain themselves when they re not able to see patients there s definitely a robust community of reproductive health advocates in texas who have been working to improve access as much as possible in the aftermath of that decision both the healthcare providers who are offering abortion care and also the abortion funds the practical support networks the other advocates who are working really hard to rebuild the infrastructure and support the people in the state who are trying to gain access to that care the legal landscape concerning abortion access has been cyclical in the united states since the time of roe the supreme court s jurisprudence and the availability of abortion at the state level hasn t been a steady march forward towards increased rights and increased access we have big advancements in the law and then followed by big setbacks we find ourselves at this moment now where it appears that the court might be poised to overturn roe or at the very least to roll back protections for reproductive rights we ve had moments like that in history before notably in 1992 when everyone thought that the court was poised to overturn roe but instead it issued a decision reaffirming the fundamental right to abortion but altering the legal standard by which abortion restrictions are judged i ve come to think of the struggle for abortion rights not as a particular fight that s going to have a conclusion but rather i think of it more as a garden that needs to be cultivated constantly there s never going to come a time when this struggle is over i think that the moment that we re at right now is really scary but it s not unprecedented so i think that folks shouldn t despair and they shouldn t lose hope that we just need to double down on our efforts and accept that this is going to be an ongoing struggle i think people definitely have cause for concern but i also think that it s important to keep in mind that there s overwhelming support in the public for abortion access and that the court is in a dialogue with the public as well as with the other branches of government in that public opinion and public engagement can help shape the context in which the court sees these issues the court doesn t exist in a vacuum i don t know the chief justice personally and so it s hard for me to comment on what s in his heart about this issue i think a lot of folks try to speculate and maybe some of those folks do have personal knowledge but i think a lot of that speculation is just that wild speculation it s hard to know how the chief justice or how any justice is going to rule in a given case until you see their opinions and so while i am certainly worried and concerned that the current supreme court may roll back some of the reproductive rights that people have fought so hard for over the last five decades i also remain hopeful that the rule of law will prevail and that the justices will ultimately show respect for precedent i think that the fact that the court declined to take that indiana case signals that there s not a real appetite for taking on an abortion case right now and i ll also add that while lots of things about that concurring opinion were disheartening i think it is important for reproductive rights advocates to grapple with the history of the movement and grapple with the history of this nation and to acknowledge that there is a painful history of racism it s essential that advocates for reproductive rights ensure that those rights are available to everyone and that we fight not just to secure abortion access on paper but to secure the right for everyone to effectuate their decision about whether and when to have children and to ensure that there are no disparities about healthcare outcomes among different communities right now there s a huge disparity in maternal mortality for black women i see all of these things as interrelated and the goal of all of this advocacy is to ensure that self determination for everyone and to promote both gender equality and racial and economic justice as we proceed towards the next national election in 2020 i think we re going to see both increased efforts to limit reproductive healthcare access by those who are hostile to abortion but also efforts to strengthen reproductive healthcare access by those who are supportive and i think we re seeing in some states efforts to pass legislation to repeal restrictive laws or to codify protections for reproductive rights in the law in terms of whether the supreme court is going to decide an abortion case in the next couple of years it s hard to know i think it may depend on whether some of the states force their hand in terms of the laws that they re enacting write to tara law at tara law time com
