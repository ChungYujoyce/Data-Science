des moines iowa ap democrat cory booker dropped out of the presidential race monday ending a campaign whose message of unity and love failed to resonate in a political era marked by chaos and anxiety his departure now leaves a field that was once the most diverse in history with just one remaining african american candidate former massachusetts gov deval patrick since launching his campaign last february booker a u s senator from new jersey struggled to raise the type of money required to support a white house bid he was at the back of the pack in most surveys and failed to meet the polling requirements needed to participate in tuesday s debate booker also missed last month s debate and exits the race polling in low single digits in the early primary states and nationwide in an email to supporters booker said that he got into this race to win and that his failure to make the debates prevented him from raising raise the money required for victory our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win money we don t have and money that is harder to raise because i won t be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in washington he said booker had warned that the looming impeachment trial of president donald trump would deal a big big blow to his campaign by pulling him away from iowa in the final weeks before the feb 3 iowa caucuses he hinted at the challenges facing his campaign last week in an interview on the associated press ground game podcast if we can t raise more money in this final stretch we won t be able to do the things that other campaigns with more money can do to show presence he said in his email to supporters booker pledged to do everything in my power to elect the eventual democratic nominee for president though his campaign says he has no immediate plans to endorse a candidate in the primary it s a humbling finish for someone who was once lauded by oprah winfrey as the rock star mayor who helped lead the renewal of newark new jersey during his seven years in city hall booker was known for his headline grabbing feats of local do goodery including running into a burning building to save a woman and his early fluency with social media which brought him 1 4 million followers on twitter when the platform was little used in politics his rhetorical skills and ivy league background often brought comparisons to president barack obama and he d been discussed as a potential presidential contender since his arrival in the senate in 2013 now massachusetts sen elizabeth warren has mastered the art of the selfie on social media another former mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana is seen as the freshest face in the field former vice president joe biden has built a strong base of support with black voters and booker s message of hope and love seemed to fall flat during an era characterized perhaps most strongly by democratic fury over the actions of the trump administration an early focus on building out a strong and seasoned campaign operation in iowa and south carolina may have hampered his campaign in the long run as the resources he spent early on staff there left him working with a tight budget in the later stages of the primary when many of his opponents were going on air with television ads that meant that even later in the campaign after he had collected some of the top endorsements in iowa and visited south carolina almost more than any other candidate a significant portion of the electorate in both states either said they were unfamiliar with his campaign or viewed him unfavorably on the stump booker emphasized his midwestern connections often referencing the nearly 80 family members he has still living in iowa when he campaigned there and delivered an exhortation to voters to use radical love to overcome what he considered trump s hate but he rarely drew a contrast with his opponents on the trail even when asked directly and even some of booker s supporters worried his message on trump wasn t sharp enough to go up against a republican president known for dragging his opponents into the mud booker struggled to land on a message that would resonate with voters he s long been seen as a progressive democrat in the senate pushing for criminal justice reform and marijuana legalization and on the campaign trail he proposed establishing a 1 000 savings account for every child born in the u s to help close the racial wealth gap he was among the first candidates to release a gun control plan and at the time it was the most ambitious in the field as it included a gun licensing program that would have been seen as political suicide just a decade before he also released an early criminal justice reform plan that focused heavily on addressing sentencing disparities for drug crimes but he also sought to frame himself as an uplifting unifying figure who emphasized his bipartisan work record that didn t land in a democratic primary that has often rewarded candidates who promised voters they were tough minded fighters who could take on trump booker s seat is up for a vote this year and he will run for reelection to the senate a handful of candidates has launched campaigns for the seat but booker is expected to have an easy path to reelection booker s exit from the presidential race further narrows the once two dozen strong field which now stands at 12 candidates catch up on the 2020 election campaign with ap
