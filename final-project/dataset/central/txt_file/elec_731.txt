in 2016 donald trump s message of busting political correctness won him the white house rejecting the democratic party s identity politics run amok was a sneaky good strategy working like a charm among working class voters in america s heartland trump though he had just become a republican five minutes ago better sensed than the party s established leaders the emotional needs of rank and file republicans for all his faults this is trump s superpower sensing cultural undercurrents and reflecting the emotions of histarget audience he often says what regular folks are thinking but don t feel they are allowed to verbalize today a great many americans feel angst about their children inheriting a country that allows for the indiscriminate destruction of reputations via cancel culture and promotes narratives over truths in the name of political correctness in 2020 trump can rekindle his old strategy by giving voice to these concerns to overcome serious political headwinds extreme uneasinessexists in middle america over cancel culture the practice of journalists and woke activists unearthing old utterances of celebrities athletes and even some regular peoplefor the purpose of embarrassing them and ruining their lives do some human beings say or tweet dumb things yes does it often happen when a person is younger less experienced in the world and not enlightened enough to know that at some point in the future someone might find their thoughtless tweet offensive you bet they aren t even marginally reasonable democrats just might reelect trump and they ll have no one to blame but themselves if there s anyone in america who could rally the canceled to his cause it s trump who faces cancellation attempts every day heck several democrats have proposed taking his twitter feed for violating the platform s terms of service but that s the point why should we tolerate a society in which a group of inquisitors is given carte blanche to silence people they don t like banish political thoughts that aren t welcome in liberal enclavesand ruin people s lives over things uttered years ago never one to eschew affiliation with the controversial trump is uniquely positioned to make this a voting issue in 2020 in washington d c when a 12 year old african american girl claimed that three white boys at her private christian school pinned her down and shaved her dreadlocks the media predictably fell for it hook line and sinker demanding answers of vice president mike pence s wife karen who teaches at the school the account was too perfect for media types who crave stories confirming their own political biases white on black violence christian school connection to trump instead of seeking the truth however the media just as it did with the covington catholic and jussie smollett stories was blinded by a narrative instead of approaching the fantastical claim with caution after a few days the little girl confessed to making it up i don t blame her in america these days a good narrative is better than the truth when you want attention just ask the liberal politicians seeking the democratic nomination for president sens elizabeth warren and kamala harris for instance falsely tweeted a debunked allegation that michael brown was murdered by a police officer in ferguson missouri never mind that president barack obama s department of justice disproved the hands up don t shoot narrative long ago in doing so warren and harriscravenly served their political ends without regard for the societal damage done by spreading falsehoods on such tragic stories rule 1 host makes the rules thanksgiving in the age of donald trump 9 ways to avoid political food fights warren s use of false narrativesextends to her own origin story which now includes multiple fabrications including that she is native american and was once fired from a teaching job for getting pregnant last week she misled a voter about sending her children to private school she did but claimed she didn t warren is not a woman of color despite allowing employers to describe her as such nor was she fired in the 1970s for becoming pregnant according to recently discovered school board documents but being a plain old white woman who declines job offers and is wealthy enough to send her kids to private school doesn t sell in today s democratic party so she conjured a put upon alter ego and rocketed to the top of the primary field no wonder our kids are inventing plights of their very own americans are rightly worried about their children inheriting a sick culture president trump can
