formally left the european union at the end of january ireland is also exempt from the restrictions according to a proclamation later issued by the white house trump in just his second oval office

will always put the wellbeing of america first trump said the virus has presented a unique challenge for trump who has proven immune to scandals and statements that would likely have doomed other presidencies trump struck a measured tone after facing days of criticism from democrats and former government officials that he was not taking the outbreak seriously enough he urged the public to wash their hands and stay home if they were feeling ill and projected confidence that the u s was well prepared for the situation but the president has in the past delivered serious and thoughtful scripted remarks after national tragedies and critical moments only to revert back to partisan swipes and twitter attacks trump urged americans to put partisanship aside and come together as one family a plea that may be difficult to accept from a president who last week labeled the governor of washington a snake and the white house was forced to walk back his initial remarks about the extent of travel restrictions on europe underscoring the dysfunction that has engulfed the administration for much of trump s presidency trump touted his decision last month to curb travel to the united states from china south korea and iran and he argued europe increased its own exposure to the virus by failing to do the same the european union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from china and other hot spots he said as a result a number of new clusters in the united states were seeded by travel from europe trump said that the new travel restrictions will be put in place friday at

while people transporting goods would not the president did not explain why the restrictions would not apply to the u k which currently has over 400 confirmed cases of the coronavirus this is more than other european countries subject to the ban but far lower than the numbers reported by italy france spain and germany trump has come under criticism for his handling of the coronavirus thus far particularly from democratsforcontradicting top health officials and repeatedly downplaying the severity of the outbreak he argued as recently as two weeks ago that the number of confirmed cases in the u s would soon be close to zero the world health organization who earlier wednesday declared the coronavirus a pandemic and the dow jones industrial average plunged over 1 400 points closing in a bear market the number of american citizens confirmed to have the coronavirus referred to as covid 19 topped 1 000 overnight tuesday and there have been over 30 deaths in the u s as a result of infections of the disease trump on wednesday maintained that the risk to average americans remains very very low even as public health officials have increasingly warned of the spread of the virus and told the public to expect changes in their daily lives but he also cast the battle against the virus as being above politics and said all americans needed to work on the issue together each of us has a role to play in defeating this virus he said he called on the country to put politics aside in order to chart a path forward together on the response to the virus doing so may be difficult given the

affected by the coronavirus and instruct the treasury department to defer tax payments for three months without interest or penalties for specific individuals and businesses adversely impacted by the virus trump called on congress to pass legislation to extend relief to workers worried about missing a paycheck if they are feeling ill or put into quarantine the request is likely to be well received among democrats who have pushed for paid sick leave for hourly workers the president also urged congress to consider a payroll tax cut trump on tuesday pitched congress on a payroll tax holiday through the end of the year but the proposal has been received coolly in capitol hill if the president s goal was to calm uneasy investors he initially appeared to be unsuccessful u s stock futures
