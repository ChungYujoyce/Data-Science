even in death sen john mccain could not escape the nasty and divisive brand of politics inside the republican party that he spent his 35 years in congress fighting arizona voters are heading to the polls tuesday for primary elections that while lacking mccain s name on the ballot are likely to serve as yet another venue for the mccain like traditionalists to jostle with a rising brand of conservatives who hold president donald trump as their role model among the most conservative in the country the state s gop seems set to embrace trump s brand of in your face politics in the race to replace sen jeff flake who decided to retire rather than keep fighting with his party s president i m not happy about it but this is the president s party right now flake told nbc news meet the press on sunday and i think that we ll be sorry for that in the future but that s the case right now in the days leading up to the primary even mccain s looming death seemed fair game for attack former state sen kelli ward who won 40 of the vote against mccain in 2016 republican primary suggested the timing of mccain s announcement last week that he was discontinuing medial treatment was designed to hurt her campaign ward blamed the media for highlighting her facebook comments at campaign stops she continued to eviscerate mccain the son of the navy elite a vietnam prisoner of war and a two time white house hopeful she won applause for it i m sorry that he s sick it s a horrible thing but that doesn t mean that his policies suddenly became good she told reporters aboard her bus they didn t mccain died a few hours later and ward noted on twitter that his decades of service will not be forgotten by the men women of arizona then by monday morning she was back spoiling for a fight seeming indifferent or even antagonistic to the fact that mccain died while fighting brain cancer ward tweeted this political correctness is like a cancer in the past this kind of open trolling would have been seen as disqualifying but in the trump era it fits with what republican primary voters are demanding in fact at one recent tea party meeting in phoenix the group leader criticized the republican establishment s favored candidate two term rep martha mcsally as martha mccain sally mcsally however has tried to wrap herself in the trump aura as well she s campaigning with immigration hardliner and former gov jan brewer an early trump supporter after mcsally joined trump in upstate new york where the president signed the john s mccain national defense authorization act without as much as a mention for the namesake senator she too didn t mention her fellow member of the arizona congressional delegation the move left those close to the mccain family seeing red even if some recognized the political logic behind it that followed other instances of mcsally a former air force fighter pilot distancing herself from mccain perhaps the nation s most celebrated pow all of this perhaps is necessary in trump s republican party he holds such sway over his party s base in a way few other presidents have enjoyed but that means it also has risks for others inside the gop tent where the roster of republicans currently stands at 50 in the senate for instance many republican senators fear a mcsally loss would tip the seat and the senate into democratic hands namely those of likely democratic nominee kyrsten sinema because many of those washington hands see ward as unelectable do you want kelli ward showing up for work in a senate where its members work in the mccain senate office building knowing she was trashing him on his death bed one senior republican said every time we start to consider maybe ward toned it down she does this garbage this republican is speaking of a proposal to rename the marble building where mccain had his offices for years the russell senate office building in his honor this republican also used language far stronger than garbage to describe ward s antics on primary eve former sheriff joe arpaio is also running for the republican nomination he is largely seen as a spoiler to split the hardline immigration vote with ward although some polls have shown him fading fast one potential problem roughly 75 of the gop primary vote has been cast before election day starts so his exit from the stage may have come before voters realized what a non factor he is in this race the intraparty fighting does not end with the flake race arizona gov doug ducey faces a primary challenge of his own his opponent has for months suggested warned really that the governor may appoint mccain s wife cindy to the seat ducey has deftly dodged committing either way saying those who lobbied while mccain was alive disqualified themselves and suggesting that any talk of succession was insensitive cindy mccain known on the global stage as an advocate for human rights and against human trafficking is an option to fill the seat although those close to her say politics is completely removed from her mind in this hour of grief still she has the national recognition of political donors is widely regarded inside washington circles and her late husband s tussles with trump make her an appealing figure to independents others said to be in the mix include former sen jon kyl who retired after the 2012 elections and is now managing the confirmation hearings for trump s supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh ex house members john shadegg who retired in 2010 and whose son now is managing mcsally s campaign and matt salmon a republican congressman who retired in 2016 some lawmakers in arizona are lobbying ducey to name former state legislator kirk adams currently a ducey aide others are eyeing barbara barrett a former diplomat in the george w bush administration and respected business executive senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and ducey alike want someone for the role who runs for re election when voters will decide who fills the balance of john mccain s the term into early 2023 it all adds up to some complicated political calculus those close to ducey say he won t pick a successor until after mccain is laid to rest this weekend at the naval academy in annapolis maryland even if ducey were to lose his primary an unlikely event most observers in phoenix say he still has the power to name mccain s successor and to exclude someone like ward from consideration if ducey wins his primary and then his general he will have the freedom as a lame duck to name whomever he wishes to the seat however the two seats end up being filled the decision will end up reflecting the fight for the soul of the republican party between mccain and trump at this moment in history write to philip elliott at philip elliott time com
