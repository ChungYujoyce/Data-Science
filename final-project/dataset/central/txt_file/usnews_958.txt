aida elena molina a 49 year old independent voter in merced calif went to bed on nov 8 2016 with a smile on her face thinking that she would wake up the next morning to news of the nation s first female president of course that was not the case i saw the news and i was crying i thought to myself gosh i m never going to see a woman become president she told time over the phone fifty six percent of american women think it s unlikely a woman will become president in 2020 according to a national poll of adult women conducted aug 29 sept 2 2018 by time and ssrs but while women as a whole were not expectant of a female president a majority of democratic women 53 and many women of color were more optimistic about the possibility fifty five percent of hispanic women and half of black women said they think a woman is likely to be elected president in 2020 while just 38 of white women said so if we had a woman president she would be a little more empathetic and likely to do things for the good of all it would mean so much said molina who is half white and half hispanic we do have so much power but it seems to get squashed all the time only 35 of republican women think americans will elect a female commander in chief in 2020 consistent with the expectation of many that president donald trump will run for a second term and win i don t know if our country is ready for a female president dawn zimmerman a 57 year old republican in omaha neb wrote in an email to time i would like a female to take the reins however i don t feel most of the country agrees with me zimmerman added that she would like to see trump reelected heading into a contentious midterm election day two years into the trump era which has brought about divisive nation wide conversations surrounding race gender and issues like gun control and health care women voters and politicians are under a microscope black women voters a highly mobilized group heading into the midterms reported the biggest increase in political engagement since the 2016 presidential election compared to white and hispanic women 38 of black women said they ve become more engaged and the highest numbers planning to vote in the midterms 78 black women were also more likely than other groups to have changed their minds about national issues since 2016 at 52 i did not used to think we had poor leadership theresa golden an unaffiliated 58 year old black woman living in xenia ohio wrote to time in an email now however i find our leadership at all three levels of government poor many democratic women 42 compared to 35 of republicans and 22 of independents are also revved up going into the midterms consistent with expectations for a year in which republicans hold the house senate and presidency i am more engaged now due to all the hate and violence happening i feel as result of trump spewing hate stephanie hill a 60 year old democrat in st petersburg fla wrote to time in an email still more than half of democratic women said their level of engagement has stayed the same or decreased which may be a sign of discouragement hill is receiving social security disability benefits but struggling financially this is why this election is so important to me i now understand what many americans are going through she wrote like her the poll found that across all political affiliations all age groups all income levels and most racial identities women are most concerned about the same national issue affordable health care given a list of 21 national issues and the option to select more than one 45 of republican women 46 of democrat women and 51 of independent women said affordable health care is an issue that matters most to them kelli helminiak a 43 year old high school government teacher plans to vote in her home state of iowa based strongly on health care policy helminiak described struggling with the cost of a new insurance plan offered by her husband s company after the affordable care act and said that while she s concerned about the republican party s failure to repeal obamacare she will still vote republican i do have faith in trump to continue pushing for reform she wrote to time in an email i used to hold more stock in positive personal attributes but after supporting countless candidates that were nice guys i m ready for someone who isn t afraid of offending some people if it means the job is going to get done after affordable health care republican poll respondents next biggest concern was reducing illegal immigration same as for white women for the democrats it was gun control same as for hispanic women black women were the only group to rank affordable health care second to another issue racial justice golden ranked racial justice as the most pressing national issue america formed into a great capitalist nation with alleged democracy from the blood sweat and struggles of the enslaved and impoverished melting pot she wrote what better way to control the 99 than to create unjustified hatred for other human beings based on melanin she stressed the importance of voting the fights for the right to vote proved a bloody deadly process why would i disrespect and dishonor the legacy afforded me as national issues like racial justice and women s rights have been debated across the media the white house has maintained a combative relationship with the press poll respondents considered the impact of the government and the media on women s lives slightly favoring the media most women said the government neither supports nor harms them but republican women were more likely to say it s more supportive rather than harmful to women 37 said so democratic and independent women were more likely to say the government is more harmful than supportive 36 and 29 said so respectively possibly a reflection of the current division of power between the parties only 24 of women overall said they think the government mostly supports women when asked the same question about the role of the media 32 of all respondents said it mostly supports women 38 of democrats 34 of republicans and 25 of independents said the same about a quarter of all respondents said both that the government and the media mostly harm women the midterms come a little over a year after a major media story the sexual misconduct allegations against hollywood mogul harvey weinstein and the metoo movement took hold across the country since its start the movement has reached across fields and led to the resignations of accused political leaders like democratic sen al franken and rep john conyers jr and republican reps patrick meehan and trent franks franken conyers franks meehan and weinstein all denied some of the allegations against them heading into the midterm elections poll respondents reflected on the impact of the national debate surrounding sexual harassment and misconduct thirty seven percent of democrats 35 of republicans and 37 of independents polled said they have experienced workplace sexual harassment in their lifetimes many respondents who said they experienced sexual harassment also said they would not vote for a candidate who had been accused molina described being sexually harassed early in her career i find it very hard to stomach any man who is a sexual predator she said voting for a man who has been accused of an act for which there is evidence is akin to condoning that act molina added she is trying to vote for women candidates whenever possible kathy hixon a 54 year old democrat in fort lauderdale fla described being verbally sexually harassed on public transportation many years ago i probably would not vote for an accused candidate unless he can prove otherwise she wrote to time in an email i know that s not fair but in this day and age you can never be too careful helminiak said she has experienced incidents that some might consider harassment but she wasn t bothered by she said she might vote for someone accused of sexual misconduct depending on the situation it has to be a case by case basis she said over the phone i can t even go so far as to say if someone was accused to rape it has be more than just the accusation regardless of politics many respondents agreed that across the board things could be better and that women can and should have a hand in making change women have so much to offer katie elder a 38 year old independent voter and mother of four in panama city beach fla wrote in an email to time her town was ravaged by hurricane michael and she spends her days commuting back and forth from her home which is missing its ceilings and the place where she and her family are temporarily living elder is stunned by the kindness and generosity of volunteers who have helped her community particularly a group of methodist women from louisiana who lived through hurricane katrina and have brought formula and diapers to families short on supplies if i believed everything my democrat friends said to me i d believe the world is going to hell in a hand basket and if i believed everything my republican friends said it would be the same elder said over the phone choosing to feel hopeful people want to help people want to have a country that stands together and women get things done this poll was conducted between aug 29 and sept 2 2018 surveyed 1 003 adult women in the u s and had a margin of error or plus or minus 3 6 percentage points write to lucy feldman at lucy feldman time com
