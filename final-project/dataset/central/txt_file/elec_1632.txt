interviewed saying trump is finally finished said tobe berkovitz a boston university professor who specializes in political communications thatmust have happened 10 times the problem now is the clock is running down we ll be at four weeks three weeks two weeks can he pull the rabbit out of the hat one more time before the first trump clinton clash the gop nominee s advisers let it be known that he was not engaging in prolonged formal preparations but with the second debate now of magnified importance there are reports that the trump team is taking a more focused approach new jersey gov chris christie an early trump supporter and skilled debater is reportedly involved in the debate preparations some republicans are skeptical about how much ground trump can make up at this stage however now it s up to him said gop strategist and hill contributor matt mackowiak it s like coaching versus playing coaches can prepare you and they can have the right play calls but at the end of the day the player on the field has to go do it so far trump has fallen short he really needs to win decisivelyon sunday numerous recent polls have shown the scale of the challenge trump faces on wednesday a new poll from monmouth university showed him trailing clinton by 2 percentage points in ohio which has been one of the most favorable battleground states for the gop nominee another new survey from wral tv and survey usa showed trump trailing in north carolina also by 2 points and a national poll from reuters ipsos gave clinton a 6 point edge the data forecasting site fivethirtyeight gave clinton a 76 2 percent chance of prevailing in its poll only forecast as ofwednesdayevening her highest rating by that measure since late august but the polls of the race have swung wildly before clinton has twice led the realclearpolitics national polling average by more than 6 points in mid june and early august only to have trump winnow those leads down to virtually nothing some clinton critics maintain that she could yet be pushed off track by an external event such as an unforced error or damaging disclosures from an organization such as wikileaks which published embarrassing emails between democratic national committee staffers as the party s convention began this summer in philadelphia a wikileaks news conference earlier this week failed to live up the hype that surrounded it however casting doubt on whether the organization can follow through on its threats republicans also warn that trump and his supporters can t depend on a lucky break the nominee himself they say needs to wrest back the initiative from clinton hope is not a strategy said mackowiak more of the same is not going to change the trajectory of the race he needs to demonstrate at this next debate that he is prepared to be president and that he can force hillary clinton back on defense there is a recent precedent for a debate turnaround in 2012 president obama gave a lifeless performance at his opening clash with gop nominee mitt romney and fell sharply in the polls afterward but vice president biden acquitted himself well against romney s running mate future speaker paul ryanpaul davis ryanlobbying world john ratcliffe is the right choice for director of national intelligence and for america house democrat calls for halt to lawmakers sleeping in their offices more wis and obama was much improved when he met romney a second and third time sunday sdebate will be in a town hall format but there is no consensus among insiders as to whether that helps or hinders trump some backers suggest it will make it easier for trump to feed off the energy of the crowd skeptics counter that televised town halls are technically challenging in terms of tone and body language and that a small mostly quiet audience creates a very different atmosphere from the rambunctious rallies where trump thrives but what if trump surpasses expectations and reels in clinton s lead one more time he would be the turnaround master of the decade if he pulls that off said berkovitz view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the contents of
