when president trump took the stage in new mexico on monday night he projected confidence about his chances at winning the blue state we really think we re going to turn this state and make it a republican state trump said onstage at the santa ana star center in rio rancho but while many of the thousands of new mexico residents who came out to see him say they love their president they don t

dwayne mcfarland when asked if he thinks trump can win new mexico while waiting in line hours before the rally he s going to turn the tide and it s going to be closer because i think a lot of people have seen what he has done but mcfarland laments it s too liberal of a state it s always been a democratic state so i m not sure if he ll be able to says sammy aronow 52 but i think he has quite a large following here the challenges in this state are a democratic governor democratic mayors democratic everybody adds ray evans 63 this is a democratic state still ray and her friend jan peel 60 say they have some hope look around you peel says motioning to the lines of people snaking all around the arena three hours before the rally is due to start new mexico may be democratic but the crowd in

outside the center pulled over into the dusty shrubs leading far away from the designated parking lots into the evening by the time trump arrived the 7 000 seat arena appeared to be at capacity of the 13 people time spoke to at the rally only two hadn t supported trump in 2016 and that s only because they are currently nine and 17 years old and weren t of legal voting age he does stuff right for our country and he does amazing stuff and he s just a person that i love gushes nine year old madison mcfarland dwayne s daughter rally goers monday night often cited the strong economy and emphasis on creating american jobs as the top reasons they supported the president but they also said they approved of trump s stance on the second amendment his america first philosophy and what multiple people referenced as his values or godly views or the fact that he s a good christian man a lot of it was misconstrued in the beginning but now the policies have been enacted things are starting to work and people are starting to see that he was right says brian peterson 39 of why he thinks trump can win over more people in new mexico in 2020 so he s starting to change a lot of our world now

of support on that front martinez says it s not about race it s about rule of law it s about respect there s a lot of people that are in front of the line trying to get in here legally and then you
