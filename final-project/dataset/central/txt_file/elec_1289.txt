votes for state governor and senator following last week s closely fought mid term elections officials say florida secretary of state ken detzner said that as unofficial results in both races had fallen within a margin of 0 5 a recount was required by law the two ballots are among the most important yet to be decided us president donald trump responded to the news by accusing democrats of trying to steal the elections the state s republican governor rick scott who is standing for the senate also warned of electoral fraud but neither he nor president trump offered any evidence to back their claims the recounts are expected to take several days but analysts say possible legal challenges mean it could take weeks for the winners to be confirmed mr detzner has ordered that all 67 florida counties complete machine recounts for the senate and gubernatorial races by 15 00 local time on thursday if a machine recount shows a difference of 0 25 or less between the candidates the state will proceed to a hand recount that must conclude by 18 november local media report in the race for florida s senate seat unofficial results revealed a gap of just 0 15 between the votes for incumbent democrat bill nelson and mr scott democrat andrew gillum had already conceded the state governorship but ron desantis s lead for the republicans later narrowed to 0 41 after the recount was announced mr gillum said i am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote mr desantis however insisted that the results were clear and unambiguous just as they were on election night it is important that everyone involved in the election process strictly adhere to the rule of law which is the foundation for our nation he added mr trump had earlier said there was a lot of dishonesty over contested votes some candidates have already launched legal action mr scott who claimed victory on tuesday is suing officials over an election recount while mr nelson is suing over uncounted ballots and there have also been a number of protests outside the elections office mr scott called on sheriffs in every county to closely monitor the recount process tweeting we will not let unethical liberals steal this election it s time senator nelson accepts these results and allows the state of florida to move forward to a better future in one of his three lawsuits against election overseers mr scott has asked a judge to impound voting machines and ballots when they are not in use mr nelson responded to the legal action in a statement on sunday saying his rival the state s outgoing governor was making false and panicked voter fraud claims because he was afraid of losing if rick scott wanted to make sure every legal ballot is counted he would not be suing to try and stop voters from having their legal ballot counted as intended said the democratic incumbent authorities have meanwhile shot down a conspiracy theory about ballot fraud florida senator marco rubio was among those who retweeted a photo showing a box labelled provisional ballots found at a school raising concerns about possible foul play but election officials stated that the box contained only supplies mr trump told reporters on friday before leaving for paris to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of world war one that he believed that mr scott
