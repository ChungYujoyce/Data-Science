 despite a soaring national profile in the u s senate sen kirsten gillibrand d ny has failed to achieve liftoff as a presidential prospect she has not broken 2 percent in a single national poll since officially declaring her candidacy in mid march and her 0 4 percent average in the realclearpolitics aggregate of surveys places her behind the likes of juli n castro tulsi gabbard and even geeky long shot andrew yang politicoon sunday evening gillibrand joined fox news sunday host chris wallaceas part of a town hall event in dubuque iowa fox news the left wonders if gillibrand still has a path to the nomination and applauds her town hall performance in the two years leading up to her 2020 run senator kirsten gillibrand spent millions of dollars building up a network of online and grass roots donors who could power her coming presidential campaign but after ms gillibrand s big announcement in january her expensively laid plans unraveled as those potential contributors all but vanished her campaign says she is connecting one voter at a time in coffee shops and living rooms but in a celebrity fueled climate dominated by mass media and viral moments online it is not clear such a pathway exists in 2020 shane goldmacher new york times the modern media environment favors the flashy over the wonkish for example when trump compared democratic challenger pete buttigieg to mad magazine s alfred e newman it produced 26 percent more media mentions than gillibrand s family bill of rights she was the first democratic presidential candidate to offer a 100 day plan for boosting families the first to offer a comprehensive abortion rights plan the first to release her tax returns the first to swear off using hacked information in her campaign and one of the few to propose giving voters money to spend on the candidates of their choice none of that has translated into anything close to a first place showing in the polls nor has it garnered much media attention but from the back of the pack sen kirsten e gillibrand of new york is building her campaign on ideas jerry zremski the buffalo news a new york senator who s long made gender equity a core plank of her political identity and now her 2020 candidacy gillibrand delivered a town hall appearance that only underscored the importance of this message one exchange in particular illustrated the need for greater representation in politics at one point wallace pressed gillibrand to explain a tweet emphasizing that the future was female and intersectional what do you mean our future is female he asked we want women to have a seat at the table gillibrand replied but what about men wallace asked seemingly suggesting that her message could imply some kind of exclusion a common fear that s been expressed about movements that advance people who have historically been underrepresented in different fields they re already there do you not know gillibrand hit back prompting laughter and cheers from the audience seventy seven percent of the house and 75 percent of the senate is still comprised of men and the us has yet to ever elect a woman president to suggest that men don t already have a seat at the table would mean ignoring those facts yet as different groups work to address existing gaps it s prompted concern among some people who ve traditionally dominated certain fields gillibrand s response confronts such fears head on li zhou vox yet some have noted the limitations of a perceived niche candidate even one representing a high profile social movement that helped fuel voter turnout less than a year ago four senators running for president kamala d harris of california amy klobuchar of minnesota elizabeth warren of massachusetts and gillibrand all cite their success in winning statewide elections as proof that a woman can reach heights no woman has before all rail against sexism and gender pay gaps all press for a woman s right to choose the issues on which gillibrand hoped to build her campaign reproductive rights paid family leave and gender pay equality are no longer distinguishing ones now they are mainstream invoked by female and male candidates alike as one new york based strategist put it it s one thing to emphasize the woman part when you re running against all men it s another thing when you re running against a lot of very qualified women who are also moms and more chelsea janes washington post finally while gillibrand has made abortion the central issue of her presidential campaign public opinion on specific abortion policies is still mixed including among democrats roughly two thirds of americans say abortion should generally be illegal in the second trimester and more than 80 percent say it should generally be illegal in the third trimester numbers that have held steady since the 1990s the crucial swing states that helped trump secure victory over clinton including wisconsin michigan pennsylvania and florida have only razor thin majorities supporting abortion in all or most cases these voters could really matter some moderates and conservatives who were initially uncomfortable with trump specifically point to the third presidential debate when hillary clinton endorsed third trimester abortion as the decisive moment that solidified their reluctant support for trump given the way the current democratic primary is shaping up on this issue that dynamic could conceivably play out again in 2020 emma green the atlantic the right is critical of gillibrand s candidacy and town hall performance highlighting her seemingly opportunistic changes in policy positions over time the right is critical of gillibrand s candidacy and town hall performance highlighting her seemingly opportunistic changes in policy positions over time gillibrand the tip of the spear for the metoo movement in congress senate successor to hillary clinton and one time doyenne of the wall street bundlers doesn t have enough donors to meet her party s standard for participation in its first debate later this month she s still short of the 65 000 donor mark a population not much larger than that of little dubuque here at the intersection of iowa illinois and wisconsin so what on earth is she still running for when gillibrand like her colleagues amy klobuchar and cory booker started getting ready to run for president they didn t know a lot of the things now shaping the race they didn t know that joe biden really was that popular among black voters they didn t know that seven senators would be running they didn t know that democrats would go gaga for the 37 year old mayor of the fourth largest city in indiana these are not people who got to where they are by being squeamish or for lack of ego or ambition so what do you expect them to do except slog on chris stirewalt fox news she just seems too much like hillary clinton and voters who want trump to lose are probably not going to pick someone who reminds them of the person to whom trump did not lose let me be clear i do not mean that they are alike simply because they are both women there was literally a 2010 vanity fair profile titled in hillary s footsteps kirsten gillibrand and the same cannot be said for other female candidates such as kamala harris or elizabeth warren both of whom are doing fairly well especially compared with gillibrand katherine timpf national review at the town hall when asked about gun violence given the recent shootings in virginia beach gillibrand said the nra is the worst organization in this country she then implied the nra is okay with selling guns to terrorists they care more about their profits than the american people they care more about selling guns to someone on the terror watch list or with a grave mental illness or who has a violent criminal background gillibrand then laid out a three step plan for reducing gun violence including universal background checks banning bump stocks assault rifles and military style weapons and creating federal anti trafficking laws none of these steps could have prevented the virginia beach shooting chrissy clark the federalist the nra is a non profit it doesn t sell guns and the nra backed background checks at the point of sale to prevent criminals from purchasing firearms the terror watch list issue had more to with that being an unadjudicated and vastly overused status developed by law enforcement without any recourse to due process even some of the people who develop those lists think it s potentially dangerous to counterterrorism efforts to conflate its use with gun control also gillibrand accuses the nra of torpedoing the banning of bump stocks used in the las vegas massacre when donald trump himself banned bump stocks last year when she represented only my rural upstate district gillibrand was more than happy to wave the nra flag when it came time to run for statewide office gillibrand changed her position to suit her political needs and now that she s running for the democratic presidential nomination and taking flak from progressives over appearing on fox the nra is now the worst organization in the country ed morrissey hot air if you believe in gun control fine stick to it defend it if you believe in the second amendment fine stick to it defend it but pick a side and stick to it i m not saying people can t grow and change their point of view but this is straight up political pandering she didn t just alienate one side she s alienated everyone beth baumann townhall in addition to the second amendment her stance on immigration has flip flopped since joining the senate gillibrand has referred to trump s immigration and border security policies as racist on multiple occasions despite previously promulgating identical positions she contended in january that those same positions were not racist when she supported them she later reversed her position on allowing illegal immigrants to obtain drivers licenses only a day after she announced that she will seek the democratic nomination for the presidency in 2020 molly prince the daily caller gillibrand is attempting to find the overlap between aggrieved soccer moms who voted for hillary clinton but can t get with elizabeth warren s breathless cronyism abortion absolutists who spar with intersectionalists on the basis that they sideline feminism and metoo activists who are mostly in it for the political points all of this is to say that gillibrand doesn t really have a constituency tiana lowe washington examiner up to 25 cups of coffee a day safe for heart health study finds the guardian
