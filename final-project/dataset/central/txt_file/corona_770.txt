 by lori robertson posted on march 20 2020 after president donald trump said i don t know anything about the disbanding of a white house pandemic response office the democrats claimed that he lied and pointed to trump s earlier remarks about some of the people we cut as evidence but those remarks were in response to a question about proposed budget cuts not the anti pandemic team in question several democrats have criticized the trump administration s response to the coronavirus outbreak by pointing to the dissolving of a team within the white house s national security council dedicated to coordinating a response to a pandemic as we ve written before in 2018 the administration did eliminate a key position that would have been involved in such a response the senior director of the nsc s office of global health security and biodefense but that doesn t mean the responsibilities of that office were eliminated administration officials have described a reorganization or streamlining of the nsc an nsc spokesman told the washington post in may 2018 that the administration will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure some still have been critical of the elimination of the post or a separate global health team for instance the center for strategic international studies recommended in a november 2019report restoring the position on the nsc as one of seven key changes to better protect the american public from global health threats in a march 13 press conference the president was asked what responsibility do you take for the disband ing of the white house pandemic office and he responded that he didn t know anything about it and when you say me i didn t do it the president said i could ask perhaps my administration but i could perhaps ask tony about that because i don t know anything about it i mean you say you say we did that i don t know anything about it trump s mention of tony was a reference to dr anthony s fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the reporter made clear she was talking about the reorganization that happened at the national security council and trump added it s the it s the administration perhaps they do that you know people let people go the next day march 14 the democratic national committee tweeted yesterday trump said he didn t disband the government s pandemic response team he lied here he is earlier this year defending doing just that the accompanying video showed trump saying some of the people we cut they haven t been used for many many years and if if we ever need them we can get them very quickly and rather than spending the money and i m a business person i don t like having thousands of people around when you don t need them when we need them we can get them back very quickly but those remarks came in a feb 26 press conference after trump was asked about his proposed budget cuts to the centers for disease control and prevention the national institutes of health and the world health organization reporter feb 26 your budgets have consistently called for enormous cuts to the cdc the nih and the who you ve talked a lot today about how these professionals are excellent have been critical and necessary does this experience at all give you pause about those consistent cuts trump no because we we can get money and we can increase staff we know all the people we know all the good people it s a question i asked the doctors before some of the people we cut they haven t been used for many many years and if if we ever need them we can get them very quickly and rather than spending the money and i m a business person i don t like having thousands of people around when you don t need them when we need them we can get them back very quickly for instance we re bringing some people in tomorrow that are already in this you know great government that we have and very specifically for this we can build up very very quickly and we ve already done that i mean we really have built up we have a great staff trump doesn t say to whom he s referring in talking about staffing cuts but the question was about his proposed budget cuts not the national security council global health security team the nsc was not mentioned in the reporter s question or trump s answer as we ve said before trump has consistently proposed budgets that would cut funding for the cdc and nih but congress hasn t enacted those proposals the cdc s staff has decreased by 591 positions or 5 4 from december 2016 through march 2019 the most recent data available from the office of personnel management daniel wessel a spokesperson for the dnc told us that trump didn t answer the question that was asked and was likely talking about the nsc issue which had been in the news that day trump was not answering the question that he was asked so we should not be held to the standard of what the question was he said in an email trump s response on the day that headlines were breaking about the decision by his nsc to cut the pandemic response team was just as likely probably more likely about the pandemic response team than anything else wessel added that the point of whether trump lied is moot saying there have been several news stories that showed trump s administration and nsc led by john bolton did indeed dismantle the pandemic response team in the spring of 2018 zach parkinson a spokesman for the trump campaign told us as the full video makes clear at no point in this exchange was the national security council or the global health security directorate team mentioned the president was specifically asked about his proposed budgets not any personnel reorganization or actions parkinson also said the claim that the nsc team was eliminated is false saying former and current national security council officials have repeatedly said the team working on biodefense is still at the nsc others on twitter including celebrities and journalists have retweeted a march 17 article by the independent a u k publication that also linked trump s feb 26 remarks to the nsc issue the democratic group protect our care pointed to that article and wrongly said trump made these comments in 2018 the atlantic also citing the independent story initially said the president s remarks were from 2018 but later corrected that the independent story didn t say the video was from two years ago but may have left that impression a video has emerged of donald trump talking about cutting the us pandemic response team in 2018 it said the date pertains to the cutting not the video which is merely a few weeks old as we explained in a march 3 story the administration did eliminate a key position at the nsc but that doesn t mean the entire team was fired as then democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg said or that all of the functions of the office were eliminated thewashington post reported in may 2018 that then national security adviser john bolton dissolved the nsc s office of global health security and biodefense in a reorganization effort rear adm r timothy ziemer left his post as senior director of that office and wasn t replaced president barack obama had created the nsc unit in 2016 after the yearslong ebola outbreak in west africa trump appointed ziemer as senior directorinapril 2017 but ziemer left about a year later he now servesas senior deputy assistant administrator for the bureau for democracy conflict and humanitarian assistance at usaid the post said this was part of a reorganization by bolton and quoted an nsc spokesman as saying global health global health security and biodefense would be addressed under the new structure theatlantic also reported at the time that some team members were shifted to other groups and others took over some of ziemer s duties tom bossert a former white house homeland security adviser who helpeddevelop the trump administration s biodefense strategy and was thedesignated leadfor coordinating the american response to a biological crisis was alsoreportedlypushed out of the nsc when bolton took over bossertresignedin april 2018 a day after bolton started as national security adviser bossert was replaced with a series of people but when trump announced his coronavirus task force on jan 29 he did not name current homeland security adviser julia nesheiwat in any capacity bolton as well as tim morrison former senior director for counterproliferation and biodefense for the nsc also have described the moves as a restructuring or consolidation what was the office of global health security and biodefense became part of the directorate on counterproliferation and biodefense morrison objected to claims that the office was dissolved writing in the post on march 16 that the administration create d the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation weapons of mass destruction terrorism and global health and biodefense it is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented morrison led that directorate for a year he wrote before leaving that position another official replaced him he said the administration has decreased staffing at the nsc something morrison said was needed after bloat under the previous administration we didn t get a statement from the white house when we asked about the nsc issue but the washington post fact checker did nsc spokesman john ullyot told the post no director level positions were eliminated during this process and the organization retained its subject matter expertise under a different organizational structure some have said the nsc needs a separate global health security point person or team as the center for strategic international studies recommended that s a matter of opinion and we take no position on that three days before morrison s op ed beth cameron former senior director for the old nsc team the global health security and biodefense office wrote in the post that disbanding that directorate left an unclear structure and strategy for coordinating pandemic preparedness and response democratic senators had questioned the move at the time as well as former government officials kenneth w bernard who served in both former president bill clinton s and president george w bush s administrations wrote in 2018 that this was the third time that an administration had downgraded the importance of disease and bioterrorism threats in the hierarchy of national security issues bernard said he worked in such a post in 1998 but the bush administration abolished it in 2001 then reopened it a year later after 9 11 and the 2001 anthrax attacks he said obama abolished it again after his election but in his second term created the nsc office bolton responded to the recent criticism on twitter on march 14 saying claims that streamlining nsc structures impaired our nation s bio defense are false global health remained a top nsc priority and its expert team was critical to effectively handling the 2018 19 africa ebola crisis democratic rep gerald connolly and republican rep steve chabot have introduced a bill that would require that the president create a global health security interagency council and appoint an employee of the national security council serving at the senior director level or higher to serve as chair for the council connolly asked fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases in a march 11 hearing whether it was a mistake to dismantle the office in the nsc devoted to global health and security fauci responded i wouldn t necessarily characterize it as a mistake i would say we worked very well with that office it would be nice if the office was still there we take no position on whether it was a mistake or not to eliminate the global health security post or restructure the nsc team but it s wrong for democrats to cite trump s remarks about some of the people we cut as proof that he lied about not knowing what happened to the nsc team q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
