for guidance at the epicenter near seattle mayor jenny durkan has relied on science teamwork and speed loading march 20 2020 seattle mayor jenny durkan the granddaughter of an irish catholic immigrant sits in her city hall suite wearing a shamrock pin it s st patrick s day but her office and the city outside is nearly empty two months ago the united states first case of covid 19 was confirmed just north of seattle that discovery set the emerald city into uncharted waters the pandemic s double whammy on public health and the economy has been akin to an earthquake shaking seattle s foundations to ms durkan getting the local response right isn t just about accountability seattle is where she grew up as one of eight children where she sold linens at jcpenney where she graduated from law school i love this city to my bones this is so hard she says you know it s going to have such deep long term consequences along with washington state gov jay inslee and king county executive dow constantine she s determined to rise above blame game politics and speak in one voice as one government as she said in a press conference march 11 we re a gritty city we come back from adversity ms durkan says but this one is going to test everyone s will and everybody s mettle it was monday march 2 when mayor jenny durkan took the call at her seattle home on the line was harvard trained epidemiologist trevor bedford who had caught the mayor s attention with an ominous tweet two days earlier about his seattle lab s tracking of the new coronavirus dr bedford had connected the genetic dots between the first u s coronavirus case a man who tested positive jan 20 after returning from wuhan china to snohomish county north of seattle and a teenager who tested positive in the same county on feb 28 this strongly suggests that there has been cryptic transmission in washington state for the past 6 weeks tweeted dr bedford ms durkan urgently tracked down dr bedford who studies infectious diseases at seattle s fred hutchinson cancer research center to dig into his predictions why did they depart so starkly from what government health officials were reporting his modeling frankly was very different from what public health was telling me ms durkan recalls editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free there is no paywall as the former u s attorney listened carefully to the evidence the shocking revelations sank in after talking with him there was little doubt in my mind that the modeling was accurate she recounts a belief other top experts would confirm we aren t dealing with five cases we are dealing with hundreds of cases and our time to act was yesterday she sketched out the math in a chart on a piece of paper one she has carried ever since over 70 000 cases she thought in six weeks she pauses it was one of the most sobering moments of my entire life the next day at 1 33 pm ms durkan signed a proclamation of civil emergency for seattle the blue collar town where she d grown up as one of eight children where she d sold linens at jcpenney and later graduated from law school the city she loves editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall two weeks later on st patrick s day ms durkan the granddaughter of an irish catholic immigrant sits virtually alone in her 7th floor office suite wearing a shamrock pin sunshine glints off the nearby skyscrapers the deserted streets and a few blocks away the waters of elliott bay the lobby of city hall adorned with a huge gold seal of chief seattle is eerily empty her lone assistant apologetically requests that all the mayor s visitors first wash their hands and remain several feet apart from her but even at a distance ms durkan s gregarious warmth quick wit and no nonsense demeanor comes through thanks for coming in she greets this reporter raising one hand and making a v with four fingers in a vulcan salute popularized by spock in star trek i bungle the return salute which perhaps aptly means live long and prosper it takes practice she says flashing a smile the heaviness of the moment though is unmistakable as ms durkan presides over a city that has gone from boom to virus inflicted bust virtually overnight for the past decade seattle has been one of the fastest growing cities in the country but the double whammy of the pandemic on public health and the economy is akin to an earthquake shaking the emerald city s foundations asked whether this is the biggest challenge of her career ms durkan doesn t hesitate no question about it by a magnitude of several factors she says i don t think that our country has dealt with a more impactful and complicated and widespread crisis in many generations in response ms durkan is relying not only on top scientists but also her own well honed political instincts to guide seattle through today s uncharted waters the daughter of a legendary washington state senator and lobbyist she learned to stand her ground by tussling with her siblings when she graduated from the university of washington law school in 1985 she recalls her mother commenting finally someone is going to pay you to argue but she also learned the art of compromise and teamwork on the sunday after dr bedford briefed her she huddled for two hours with washington state gov jay inslee king county executive dow constantine and other senior officials to ensure they were on the same page once we heard the science i don t think there was anyone in the room that didn t feel the government had to make some significant steps to reduce public gatherings she says it s not either or it s really more of a dial she says you try the first step and if that seems not to be working you have to accelerate through the dial pretty quickly on march 11 ms durkan stepped before the cameras flanked by governor inslee mr constantine and other officials to unveil that first step a ban on gatherings of more than 250 people but first she set the stage one of the most important things we can do according to the world health organization is to speak in one voice as one government she said after a crisp few words she elbow bumped with the governor made the vulcan salute and stepped aside this is something mayor jenny durkan was born to do says a longtime seattle journalist who spoke on condition of anonymity she s good at centrist democratic government the washington state team was determined as ms durkan said later to rise above the pull of blame game politics and fight the virus instead of each other in contrast a few days earlier as vice president mike pence visited the state to bring vital emergency aid president donald trump referred to governor inslee as a snake for alleging the administration had not stuck to the science robust local leadership has emerged in part amid a weak federal government response analysts say there was a lack of strong leadership from the feds says ann marie kimball professor emeritus of epidemiology at the university of washington moreover she says all epidemics and pandemics are really local so local officials are in the best position to tailor the response and they speak with a voice we recognize americans expressed more confidence in their state governments than in president trump or the federal government in handling the coronavirus according to a wall street journal nbc news poll released this week carrying her hand sketched chart of future cases ms durkan has no time to waste on infighting she knows seattle and washington are only about 11 days behind italy one of the world s hardest hit countries on the steeply rising covid 19 curve every time italy takes a step because they have reached a crisis point it sends a signal to us ms durkan says we should take that step now yet state and local resources only go so far what is keeping her awake at night is the lack of protective equipment such as gloves masks and gowns for washington s first responders and medical personnel last friday she visited seattle s harborview medical center only to see medical workers reaching into almost empty bins of masks if our workers get sick our health care system fails warns ms durkan who says she spent dozens of hours last weekend trying to help secure more protective equipment washington has already received some supplies from national reserves but is awaiting approval to get another 180 000 masks and face shields and 65 000 respirators hospital surge capacity is also inadequate without federal help she says more shelters for seattle s most vulnerable population particularly some 11 000 people experiencing homelessness are another critical need and given the expectation hundreds of thousands of people will lose their jobs we need something bigger than the new deal to put money in the pockets of workers and supplement private local and state relief efforts ms durkan says for example amazon executives pledged 5 million for small firms such as restaurants and food trucks in the vicinity of the company s downtown seattle headquarters seattle s vibrant patchwork quilt of neighborhoods is suffering she says and she takes such losses personally she remembers growing up during the boeing bust of the 1970s when the airplane maker cut more than 40 000 workers in her friends neighborhoods there was empty house after empty house and dandelions pushing up she recalls i love this city to my bones this is so hard she says you know it s going to have such deep long term consequences but ms durkan also has a tough streak that seattle needs right now after college she moved to an alaskan fishing village and taught english for two years then she worked as a baggage handler and dues paying teamster to help her pay for law school the first openly gay u s attorney and the first female seattle mayor for nearly a century she speaks her mind and tells it like it is get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your
