liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more and many anxious democrats are baffled as to why the race remains so close part of the reason may be that tv advertising often the single biggest budget item within a campaign is losing its effectiveness it s becoming more difficult to target voters said one democratic strategist who requested anonymity to speak candidly voters are more cynical about ads because they have seen them for decades nothing is as effective as it used to be the analysis published by nbc news on tuesday drawing on data from tracking firm advertising analytics found that the clinton campaign had spent 96 4 million on the airwaves against just 17 3 million from the trump campaign when outside groups supporting clinton s candidacy were included the total spend on her side reached 156 6 million the comparable figure for all pro trump advertising was 33 6 million clinton is a slight favorite in the race but the huge disparity in spending has failed to break the contest open data website fivethirtyeight gave clinton a 56 percent chance of winning as of tuesday afternoon while the realclearpolitics average of national polls showed her with an edge of about 1 percentage point some republicans argue that the closeness of the race especially against a candidate with trump s vulnerabilities is evidence of clinton s fundamental flaws as a candidate she s not up more because she s disliked and distrusted said gop consultant rick wilson who is working with independent presidential candidate evan mcmullin with any other candidate than clinton trump would be down by 25 percent other experts highlight additional factors one challenge for any candidate is the degree to which viewing habits have changed with audiences fragmenting and many young voters in particular moving away from traditional tv viewing there is no question that the return on investment for paid advertising continues to degrade from election to election as it does for commercial tv advertising generally said chris lehane a democratic strategist who served in former president bill

trump and his allies had spent less than 19 million earned media always trumps paid media said the democratic strategist and trump has mastered earned media in this election for good and bad a veteran republican ad maker fred davis agreed and suggested this could be part of clinton s problem he s a walking attention magnet and interesting davis said via email she s the past and relatively dull still despite all the idiosyncrasies of this year s race and the growing challenges of advertising effectively on television few people argue that ads don t matter at all many of clinton s ads have been negative including her most memorable spot which shows children watching a tv screen of trump making incendiary comments while that ad has attracted praise some democratic strategists say clinton needs to pivot and embrace a more positive message these operatives point out that trump s disapproval ratings can t go much higher and clinton needs to work on her approval disapproval numbers yet lehane argued that the ad campaign might have played a key part in keeping trump s approval ratings down if things work according to plan from a democratic perspective this could make victory all but impossible for the gop nominee ads can have a compounding effect over time lehane said trump remains stagnant in the low 40s in part because his negatives limit growth with key voter cohorts clinton s tv advertising appears from anecdotal evidence at least to have leaned heavily on a small number of ads independent experts say that finding the right balance between hammering a message home while not boring voters is a hard task that is kind of an art said travis ridout a washington state university professor and the co author of a book about campaign advertising repetition definitely is good we know but you do reach a point of diminishing returns the difficulty is that political junkies might be seeing tv all day long and might be seeing tons of ads and there may be another person only tuning in one hour a day you shoot for the average voter the belief that one can hit that target and transform the election may be overly optimistic said the democratic strategist who requested anonymity it s a mistake on the part of the campaigns to believe you can dig yourself out of a hole or bury your opponent simply be outspending them on air it s just not realistic anymore the strategist added view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the contents of this site are 2020 capitol hill publishing corp a
