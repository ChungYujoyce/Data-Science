the special house election taking place in georgia on tuesday is in a word ridiculous the contest to see who will become 435th in seniority in congress lower chamber has attracted an enormous amount of media coverage visits from one major political figure after another and over 50 million making it easily the most expensive house race in american history despite the efforts of the nation s hard working hot take writers the outcome of this election will not determine the fate of either the republican or democratic parties either this year next year or in 2020 not that every vote in congress doesn t matter but the political upheavals of the next few years are unlikely to be changed in profound ways depending on whether democrat jon ossoff or republican karen handel prevails in what is sure to be a close election nevertheless the georgia special election contains an important lesson it s an exaggerated version of something we should expect and even embrace for 2018 and 2020 the nationalized local election yes it s because there aren t hundreds of other races happening at the same time though there s also a special election going on in south carolina which you ve probably heard nothing about that fact and the closeness of the contest has pulled attention and dollars to georgia with a relentless gravitational tug but even if we can t expect that every house race will rouse the whole country s interest it s absolutely appropriate for voters to treat it like a referendum not only on president trump but on the national democratic and republican parties what s odd though is that neither candidate has seemed eager to do so while ossoff has certainly criticized trump he has also portrayed himself as anything but a partisan crusader here s my plan he says in one of his ads cut the wasteful spending reduce the deficit so the economy can keep growing and prioritize high tech and bio tech research to create more good jobs in metro atlanta it could have been spoken by a democrat a republican or a whig and even though the district leans republican karen handel hasn t exactly been touting herself as a foot soldier in the trump army while trump did a private fundraiser for her she wants voters to know she s no rubber stamp my job is to represent the people of the 6th district she says when asked about trump i m not an extension of the white house but here s the problem if she wins handel will be an extension of the white house not completely of course but the overwhelming majority of the time a vote for her is a vote for the gop agenda repealing the affordable care act cutting taxes for the wealthy rolling back environmental protections boosting military spending and so on handel won t be representing the 6th district in some subtle and nuanced way that differs meaningfully from how a republican member of congress from oregon or ohio would she ll be a reliably republican vote little more or less the same is true of ossoff for all his dull technocratic talk the most important thing for voters to know about him is that he s a democrat here s some bad news almost nothing he does will bring jobs to metro atlanta whether they re high tech low tech or no tech the days when a powerful congressman could guide billions of federal dollars to his district are largely behind us and a freshman legislator has virtually no ability to do so there may be some future moment at which ossoff casts a vote that differs from most other democrats but as likely as not it ll be on a less important and visible issue and to be honest the 6th district isn t exactly crying out for economic transformation it s already exceedingly well educated and well off that doesn t mean that members of congress shouldn t represent the interests and ideology of their districts but we tend to overstate what difference those local idiosyncrasies will make regular readers already know my contempt for the oft spoken line that your party s candidate shares insert our home state here values while the other party s candidate is some kind of foreign interloper who doesn t understand our kind of folks in the partisan time in which we live it s less important than ever as the two parties have grown increasingly unified internally and distinct from each other your congressmember s particular talents and preferences have mattered less and less which means you really are just voting for a party if you live in georgia s 6th district and you vote for handel you re voting to advance the republican legislative agenda and stand behind president trump if you do it again next year you ll be casting a vote to hold on to republican control of the house which means keeping that agenda going and forestalling the investigations that democrats will mount against the administration if they acquire subpoena power if you vote for ossoff you re choosing the opposite to stop gop legislation and make a democratic takeover one vote more likely and there s nothing wrong with that but if you re a conservative who wants to restrict abortion rights and cut taxes but you vote for ossoff because you like what he said about bringing more bio tech jobs to metro atlanta you re making a mistake because he won t be the kind of congressman you want once the votes are counted one party will proclaim that its victory is a harbinger of sweeping success to come and the other will say it means nothing both will be overstating things but come next year americans everywhere will vote as if the national parties their allies and donors from across the country dropped 50 million into their districts in other words as if the whole thing was a referendum on president trump and the gop s control of congress as well they should obama s america is the one we hope for trump
