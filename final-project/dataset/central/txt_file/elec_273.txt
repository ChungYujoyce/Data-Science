claims by and about donald trump dominate our report by factcheck org posted on march 4 2016 updated on march 4 2016 our wrap up of false and misleading claims in the 11th debate includes and trump cruz and ohio gov john kasich all repeated claims we ve fact checked before fox news hosted the march 3 debate in detroit between donald trump ted cruz marco rubioandjohn kasich rubio said trump built his business with 100 million he inherited from his father fred who also was a developer trump said that s wrong and claimed that he started with 1 million and turned that into a 10 billion company rubio is exaggerating and trump is underestimating the value of his father s contributions to his business we don t know how much trump may have inherited but the 100 million figure isn t supported by rubio or anything in the public record however trump got significant help from his father to build his company beyond 1 million rubio raised the issue of trump s inheritance when moderator chris wallace noted that rubio has been critical of trump s business savvy and asked rubio how many jobs he had created rubio said he talks about these great businesses that he s built he inherited over 100 million trump interrupted saying wrong wrong this exchange was similar to the last debate on feb 25 when rubio claimed that trump inherited 200 million how much did trump inherit his campaign declined to tell us however we have some information that is in the public record fred trump who was also a developer died in 1999 and the new york times at the timewrote that his estate has been estimated by the family at 250 million to 300 million more recently the times in a jan 2 story wrote that fred s will divided the bulk of the inheritance at least 20 million among his children and their descendants other than my son fred c trump jr who died in 1981 at the time there were four surviving children robert donald maryanne and elizabeth so it would appear that donald trump did not receive 100 million or 200 million as rubio claimed the rubio campaign did not respond last month when we asked about the 200 million inheritance claim but the senator seems to be referring to the value of fred c trump s business at the time donald joined the family business in the 1970s in the 1991 book trumped the inside story of the real donald trump former trump executive john r o donnell writes that fred trump was a developer of middle income apartments in the new york boroughs of queens brooklyn and staten island it was donald trump who moved the family business into manhattan over the years fred trump had forged strong connections with the city s democratic party machine o donnell writes in the late 1970s his son brought those connections and an estimable family fortune of 200 million to manhattan where he parlayed them into a real estate empire that would ultimately be worth over 2 billion that brings us to trump s claim that he started his company with just 1 million which underestimates his father s contributions in his response to rubio trump said believe me i started off with 1 million i built a company that s worth more than 10 billion and i say it not in a bragging way but that s the kind of thinking we need trump s campaign told us that he borrowed 1 million from his father but it did not tell us when or for what reason fred trump s obituary in the times said that he lent support and a small amount of money to his son donald s aspirations of becoming a developer however as o donnell s book suggests donald trump s success wasn t built just on a 1 million loan another trump author gwenda blair who wrote the trumps three generations of builders told us in an email that donald trump benefited from his father s considerable financial and political clout i would note that what was just as important as any cash loan to donald s success was fred s willingness to co guarantee the construction loan on donald s first manhattan project the grand hyatt and also fred s willingness to put his own considerable financial and political clout at donald s disposal blair told us blair also said that fred trump loaned more than 1 million on at least one occasion it occurred in december 1990 when donald trump s finances were in a dire state she said his father loaned him 3 3 million by sending an emissary to buy poker chips in that amount at trump castle casino in atlantic city and not cashing them in the loan which allowed donald trump to make an interest payment to castle bondholders was illegal because only sources certified by the casino control commission are allowed to make loans to casinos blair wrote to us the castle was fined 65 000 but the commission declined to investigate fred s or donald s role in this illegal transfer instead it certified fred as a lender and allowed the castle to pay the loan back over time rather than immediately in the end both trump and rubio are stretching the facts with their claims about trump s finances trump claimed that the federal governmentcould save hundreds of billions of dollars in waste by having prescription drug companies bid properly but medicare whichisn t allowed to negotiate drug prices now spent an estimated 77 billion total in federal funds on its prescription drug program in 2015 when moderator chris wallace pointed out that medicare s entire federal spending on part d its prescription drug component was well under the 300 billion a year savings figure trump had cited in the past trump countered that he was talking about saving through negotiation throughout the economy he then broadened that saying i m not only talking about drugs i m talking about other things we will save 300 billion a year if we properly negotiate but trump has indeed claimed several times that hecould save 300 billion a year through negotiating drug prices our fact checking colleagues at the washington post looked at trump s claim last month and found the figure to be nonsense among trump s claims using the number is this from a feb 17 interview with msnbc we re the largest drug buyer in the world we don t negotiate we don t negotiate you pay practically the same for the country as if you go into a drug store and buy the drugs if we negotiated the price of drugs joe we d save 300 billion a year trump said but it s difficult to save money that the government doesn t even spend according to the congressional budget office spending on medicare part d totaled 65 billion in 2014 and is expected to be 77 billion in 2015 and 88 billion in 2016 total medicare part d spending for those three years doesn t even add up to 300 billion all national spending on retail prescriptions whether through medicare medicaid private insurance or out of pocket totaled nearly 300 billion 297 7 billion in 2014 according to the national health expenditure data compiled by the centers for medicare medicaid services see table 16 so trump would be talking about saving all of the money the country spends on drugs per year the post pointed out that democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders has cited a much lower estimate for savings from negotiating medicare drug prices between 230 billion to 541 billion over 10years numbersfrom thecenter for economic and policy research s 2013 report on reducing waste with an efficientmedicare prescription drug benefit trump grossly exaggerated the u s trade deficit with china and falsely claimed that the u s runs a trade deficit with every country trump with china we re going to lose 505 billion dollars in terms of trades you just can t do it mexico 58 billion dollars japan probably about they don t know it yet but about 109 billion dollars every country we lose money with actually the u s imported 366 billion more in goods from china last year than it exported to that country according to official census bureau figures that s far short of the 505 billion figure trump floated which is close to the 532 billion net trade deficit with allcountries in 2015 trump s figure for mexico was correct a 58 billion deficit for 2015 but his figure for japan was way off census put it at less than 69 billion last year not the 109 billion trump claimed and it s simply false to say that the u s has a negative trade balance with every country the u s does run a deficit with all but three of its top 15 trading partners but the fact is contrary to trump s sweeping claim the u s had positive trade balances last year with brazil 4 billion netherlands 24 billion and belgium nearly 15 billion the u s also made money on trade last year with singapore 10 billion australia 14 billion and argentina 5 billion just to cite a few more when asked about his views on the second amendment cruz pointed to the 1994 assault weapons ban claiming a study showed the ban did nothing to reduce violent crime but that s false as we wrote in 2013 the ban s success in reducing crimes committed with banned guns was mixed according to a 2004 study gun crimes involving assault weapons declined however that decline was offset throughout at least the late 1990s by steady or rising use of other guns equipped with large capacity magazines cruz well listen unlike donald i would not support banning firearms in that instance with the assault weapons ban bill clinton banned many of the most popular firearms in america and by the way the study showed that ban did nothing to reduce violent crime it just took away the second amendment rights of law abiding citizens the 2004 study an updated assessment of the federal assault weapons ban impacts on gun markets and gun violence 1994 2003 was the lastofthree studieson the ban the ban itself was enacted in 1994 as part of theviolent crime control and law enforcement act of 1994 ultimately the research concluded that it was premature to make definitive assessments of the ban s impact on gun crime largely because the law s grandfathering of millions of pre ban assault weapons and large capacity magazines ensured that the effects of the law would occur only gradually and were still unfolding when the ban expired in 2004 to justify his call for killing the families of terrorists trump repeated a bogus claim that the wife of a 9 11 terrorist left the u s two days prior to the 2001 attacks on the world trade center and the pentagon and that she knew exactly what was happening trump the wife knew exactly what was happening they left two days early with respect to the world trade center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the world trade center flying into the pentagon trump s awkward reference to they and their husband must have left the audience confused about whether he was talking about one wife or several in fact when he first made the claim on cbs face the nation last dec 6 he said the 9 11 conspirators put their families on airplanes a couple of days before sent them back to saudi arabia for the most part that claim rated a four pinocchio rating from our friend glenn kessler who writes the washington post s fact checker column kessler citing the report of the 9 11 commissionand an interview with its former executive director philip d zelikow noted that all or nearly all of the 9 11 hijackers were unmarried furthermore zelikow stated that none of them brought female companions to the united states lebanese hijacker ziad jarrah who was on united flight 93 which crashed in pennsylvania did keep in touch with a girlfriend of turkish descent who lived in germany she later testified that she visited him in the u s in early 2001 but saw him for the last time in july in germany and knew nothing of the impending attacks trump said he was always against going into iraq he was an early critic of the war but there is no record of him speaking against the war before it started trump and i was always against going into iraq in fact i believe me i was always against it there was some cases where i sort of in one interview with a great friend of mine and yours howard stern said that said that i said very meekly long before we went in i said very meekly well maybe maybe i don t know by the time it got to that point i was always against iraq was trump always against going into iraq that s what he has been saying repeatedly throughout the campaign usually in more forceful language than this trump said for example in the feb 13 debate i said it loud and clear you ll destabilize the middle east in the sept 16 2015 debate trump claimedthat he fought very very hard against us going into iraq saying he could provide 25 different stories to prove his opposition but trump has yet to provide any evidence that he was opposed to the war before it started and no news orfact checking organization has been able to find any stories or interviews that prove trump right in fact radio shock jock howard stern asked trump on sept 11 2002 if the u s should attack iraq and trump said yeah i guess so you know i wish it was i wish the first time it was done correctly that was six months before the war started onmarch 19 2003 a timeline of trump s public statements on the iraq war in 2002 and 2003 can be found in our story donald trump and the iraq war it shows trump was an early critic of the war in july 2003 four months after the war started trump said that he wished the money being spent in iraq could be spent in new york city on sept 11 2003 the second anniversary of the 9 11 attacks and six months after the war started trump said it wasn t a mistake to fight terrorism and fight it hard and i guess maybe if i had to do it i would have fought terrorism but not necessarily iraq trump falsely claimed that the now defunct trump university has an a rating from the better business bureau and he made the misleading claim that we have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course trump this is a case i could have settled very easily but i don t settle cases very easily when i m right ninety eight percent approval rating we have an a from the better business bureau rubio that s false trump we have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course we have an a from the better business bureau and people like it as we ve written before trump university was a series of seminars in whichpaying customers could get tips on real estate the program was never officially licensed as a university and eventually changed its name to the trump entrepreneur initiative in may 2010 now trump and the program are the subjects of three ongoing lawsuits alleging fraud the better business bureau website does not currently list a rating for the trump entrepreneur initiative it says that is because bbb has information indicating it is out of business but in a statement to a reporter with politifact com a better business bureau spokeswoman said that over the years the company s bbbrating has fluctuated between an a and a d the spokeswoman declined to say when the program received the a rating however the most recent rating that we could find for the program was a d in 2010 that is based on news reports from the washington post and the new york times in 2011 and thenew york daily news and the bbb s own website in 2010 as recorded by the internet archive s wayback machine that suggests that the program was downgraded over a period of time from an a to a d rather than upgraded from a d to an a as trump also claimed during the debate in addition trump s claim that we have a 98 percent approval rating from the people who took the course is misleading while it may be the case that many attendees initially filled out positive evaluations one of the class action lawsuits alleges that the surveys were filled out under pressure or with the expectation that participants would receive additional benefits in the future tarla makaeff v trump university complaint sept 26 2012 while trump university s website has publicly claimed that 95 to 98 of students are satisfied with its course this figure is far from the truth while it may be true that trump university received some positive ratings in surveys given to the students while the seminars were in session or immediately afterward at this point many of the students actually still believe that they will eventually get the information and mentoring they need since they have been promised a one year apprenticeship or one year mentorship also these surveys are not anonymous but have the students names on them and students are often reluctant to criticize the instructors and mentors who they have paid a lot of money to help them throughout the year it is not until later when students see that the help and information they need is never coming that they realize they have been scammed for example kevin scott who paid more than 30 000 for the courses said that he gave his instructor a positive review because i did not think that the problems with the mentorship were his fault and robert guillo who also paid more than 30 000 on the program saidthat he gave his instructor a positive assessment because i believed that that was the only way to get my certificates of completion for the seminars that i attended update march 4 after the debate on march 3 trump tweeted an image of a screenshot showing the trump entrepreneur initiative had received an a rating from the better business bureau the rating is undated we have asked the campaign when it was awarded but have yet to receive a response however trump university changed its name to the trump entrepreneur initiative effective may 21 2010 as the screenshot tweeted by trump shows and the program has not accepted any new students since 2010 as alan garten an attorney for trump and his former school told cnn in an interview in september 2015 so as we wrote in our story the last rating we could find for trump university was a d in 2010 for the record we found 17 archived pages for the trump entrepreneur initiative between aug 25 2011 and march 4 2016 the highest recorded rating that we could find was a b on feb 2 2014 and the lowest recorded rating was a c on nov 11 2012 but those ratings were awarded at a time when the program was no longer accepting students bbb issued a statementmarch 4 saying the bbb business review of trump entrepreneur initiative formerly trump university has shown no rating continually since september 2015 the photo tweeted out after the debate last night did not show the current bbb business review or the current rating rubio claimed that trump expressed admiration for russian president vladimir putin trump countered that rubio was wrong in fact trump said that it was a great honor to be complimented by a highly respected man here s part of the exchange between rubio and trump at the debate rubio and vladimir putin who you ve expressed admiration for donald trump wrong wrong rubio you ve expressed admiration for him trump wrong rubio donald you said he s a strong leader trump wrong trump he said very good things about me and i said trump let me just tell you first of all i ve been hearing this man so long talking about putin putin said about me i didn t say about putin putin said very nice things about me and i say very nicely wouldn t it be nice if actually we could get along with russia we could get along with foreign countries instead of spending trillions and trillions of dollars in july 2015 trump said he would get along very well with vladimir putin but when specifically asked what he admires about him according to cbs news trump said i didn t say i admire him then in december putin saidat a press conference in russia that trump is a bright and talented person without any doubt andthat trump is an outstanding and talented personality trump in response didn t use the words admiration or strong leader but returned putin s compliments calling the russian leader so highly respected trump dec 15 2015 it is always a great honor to be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond i have always felt that russia and the united states should be able to work well with each other towards defeating terrorism and restoring world peace not to mention trade and all of the other benefits derived from mutual respect trump falsely claimed that rubio was the first person who ever disparaged the size of trump s hands trump he hit my hands nobody has ever hit my hands i have never heard of this look at those hands are they small hands actually rubio was not the first vanity fair s editor graydon carter related last octoberhow he got trump s goat more than 25 years ago with a jab at what he called trump s stubby fingers graydon carter oct 10 2015 just to drive him a little bit crazy i took to referring to him as a short fingered vulgarian in the pages of spy magazine that was more than a quarter of a century ago to this day i receive the occasional envelope from trump there is always a photo of him generally a tear sheet from a magazine on all of them he has circled his hand in
