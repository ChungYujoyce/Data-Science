keep me logged in president donald trump has one more distinction he can add to an unprecedented white house tenure the president has blown past individual democratic presidential campaigns in fundraising for his 2020 reelection bid but the crowded primary field together more than tripled his 2019 cash haul according to a cnbc analysis of federal election commission filings and campaign statements no incumbent president this century has been so thoroughly outraised by a field of challengers in the year before a reelection contest the main republican challengers to president barack obama in 2012 barely took in more than the incumbent in 2011 meanwhile president george w bush narrowly topped his challengers in fundraising in 2003 the year before he won reelection in 2004 the field is trouncing trump in fundraising and that is unprecedented said sarah bryner director of research and strategy at the center for responsive politics the cash edge reflects a democratic voter base energized and motivated since trump s 2016 election bryner said she added that the pace of donations could reflect a dislike of trump more than a fondness for any particular candidates though democratic contender and prolific fundraiser sen bernie sanders has a famously devoted following trump still had a fundraising advantage over any of his potential challengers entering 2020 his campaign said it raised 46 million in the fourth quarter higher than sanders 34 5 million the biggest haul in the democratic field the trump campaign has had time to accumulate cash while rivals in a jammed democratic primary compete for donors it had more than 100 million in the bank at the end of 2019 most democratic campaigns will not announce cash on hand numbers until the end of the month the fundraising figures for trump his two predecessors and their challengers in the year prior to their reelection bids are listed and visualized below total receipts which include transfers from other campaign committees and contributions from individuals are listed separately methodology cnbc counted only the challengers who raised more than 5 million from individual contributions during the year prior to the election at least 14 democratic candidates hit that threshold in 2019 about double the totals from 2011 and 2003 2020 candidates have not yet filed their fourth quarter 2019 figures with the federal election commission which required the use of rough totals for that period cnbc added the fundraising amounts released by presidential campaigns for the last three months of 2019 to the total through the first three quarters of the year a handful of candidates who dropped out of the race kamala harris julian castro kirsten gillibrand jay inslee beto o rourke and marianne williamson did not announce fundraising figures for the full year subscribe to cnbc on youtube got a confidential news tip we want to hear from you sign up for free newsletters and get more cnbc delivered to your inbox get this delivered to your inbox and more info about our products and services 2020 cnbc llc all rights reserved a division of nbcuniversal data is a real time snapshot data is delayed at least 15 minutes global business and financial news stock quotes and market data and analysis data also provided by
