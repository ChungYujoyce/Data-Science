s reputation as a lawmaker on the far left of the nation s ideological spectrum the lawmaker said senators worry about that politicians worry all the time the source added democrats don t want to speak out because there s a growing chance that sanders will be the nominee there is a real sense that whoever gets it we ve got to be behind him this election is too important the senator said other democrats are downplaying sanders s recent victories but fretting about whether he will embrace one of his rivals as the party s eventual nominee if sanders loses the contest we all hope to god he will follow what he said last night in new hampshire that we re all on the same team and it s all of our responsibility to bring whatever we can to help the nominee said another democratic senator
