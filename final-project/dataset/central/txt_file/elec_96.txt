 link copied today s stories explore california s role as national trendsetter john bolton s departure efforts to eradicate hate the first televised political debate in a young democracy and one reporter s journey into a new language but first in the wake of the 9 11 terrorist attacks xenophobia particularly islamophobia rose some americans have sought to counter that divisiveness and fear with unity and compassion we owe more than division and discord to those who perished from the attacks and those who served in its aftermath said jay winuk whose brother glenn a volunteer firefighter and emt died in the attacks on the world trade center mr winuk co founded 9 11 day an organization that promotes service and unity the anniversary of 9 11 should be a reminder to us all about our

tragedy she told the washington post an annual unity walk also draws people of different faiths together in washington to commemorate 9 11 there are so many forces in american society in human society actually that simply tell us we were not intended to live together in peace or in harmony the archbishop of washington wilton gregory said during the opening ceremony of the 14th annual unity walk

has the world been california ized beyond silicon valley and hollywood the fifth largest economy is also setting trends for environmental and other industry regulations as california winds up its first legislative session under complete democratic control this week it s taking up pathbreaking legislation perhaps the most groundbreaking might be the redefinition of what it means to be a worker in today s flexible gig economy a controversial bill passed tuesday by the state senate which gov gavin newsom has said he will sign could remake 1 million jobs from uber to doordash it is just one of several measures that would reinforce california s image as a national trendsetter new laws include the nation s first trapping ban on fur animals and a crackdown on doctors granting vaccine exemptions it s something that other states will look at says california political analyst sherry bebitch jeffe of the gig economy legislation that would turn independent contractors for companies like lyft into employees with protections even if the companies succeed in some later modification whatever the ultimate outcome it s bound to have a national impact observers say why because we re big says dr jeffe we re the fifth largest economy in the world as california winds up its first legislative session under complete democratic control this week it s taking up pathbreaking legislation perhaps the most groundbreaking is the redefinition of what it means to be a worker in today s flexible gig economy a controversial bill passed tuesday by the state senate which gov gavin newsom has

their products recyclable it s something that other states will look at says california political analyst sherry bebitch jeffe of the gig economy legislation that would turn independent contractors for companies like lyft into employees with protections even if the companies succeed in some later modification whatever the ultimate outcome it s bound to have a national impact observers say why because we re big says dr jeffe we re the fifth largest economy in the world california s size and economic might its diverse population its frontier and entrepreneurial spirit these are key reasons why the nation s most populous state has that as goes so goes reputation the state has essentially served as a tabula rasa or clean slate for americans says erendina delgadillo associate curator of history at the oakland museum of california fifteen years ago the state s eminent historian the late kevin starr told the monitor that california s influence from the environment to fashion to cuisine was done in a very big sense he said the battle is over the country has been california ized one could argue that the world has been california ized given the reach of silicon valley s tech giants of hollywood and of the state s environmental mandates and regulations this summer for example automakers honda ford volkswagen and bmw struck a deal to adopt the state s higher tailpipe emissions standards rather than go with the trump administration s plans for lower national standards more automakers are expected to sign on with california even as the administration moves to revoke the state s ability to set its own emissions standards i don t want to play into the smugness thing but when it comes to the environment california has not just been a leader in the united states but a global leader says ethan elkind director of the climate program at the center for law energy and the environment at the university of california berkeley but in this period of intense political polarization some of california s values appeal more to blue states than red ones especially as they eye the high tax state s severe challenges with housing homelessness and education there are many states that don t want to take the direction of california observes thad kousser a professor of political science at the university of california in san diego on issues such as gun control and immigration it s created legislation that other like minded states will follow but that red states will absolutely rebel against california for instance was the first state to ban assault style weapons this after a fatal 1989 mass school shooting with a semi automatic rifle in stockton there is also a law banning high capacity magazines whose constitutionality is being decided in the courts but a young man was able to buy a semi automatic rifle in nevada drive it over the border to california and use it to kill three people and wound nearly 30 others at the popular garlic festival in gilroy in july meanwhile scores of cities and counties across the country have declared themselves sanctuaries for unauthorized immigrants but only california connecticut illinois oregon and vermont all blue states have passed statewide laws limiting deportation cooperation with immigration and customs enforcement according to pacific standard which reports on social and environmental justice interestingly it was business considerations that motivated automakers to cut a deal with california on tailpipe emissions says mr elkind together california and the 13 states plus washington dc that follow its standards account for about 35 of the u s auto market california could well get caught up in a legal battle with the administration over its ability to set its own emission standards with automakers looking at years of uncertainty ahead so it made sense to strike a deal with california given the legal uncertainty and the possibility of having to produce vehicles to meet two different standards a national one set by the trump administration and the stricter one followed by california and the other states there s strong legal reasons that created strong business reasons for why the automakers needed to cut this deal now says mr elkind but behind the market and business forces driving the state s national impact on auto emissions and other climate related areas lies california s historic and broad dedication to the environment generally the political support for climate is a values question says mr elkind one that has bipartisan support in california and increasingly in the nation he says that translates into state mandates and regulations mandates on renewable energy on electric storage on low carbon fuels on building and appliance standards these mandates you hear business complaining about it but you ve seen it scale up he says dr jeffe the political analyst points to california s leadership role in the resistance to the trump administration obviously a role not endorsed nationwide but one of national consequence given the dozens of lawsuits it has filed against the administration the state also played a role in democrats retaking congress last year and of course there s california sen kamala harris long shot bid for the democratic nomination the most important trend now i think is the trend of california to fight back against donald trump every time he tries to stab us in the back on immigration on water on the environment she says perhaps even some of the state s more controversial attitudes such as its stance on unauthorized immigrants will eventually spread more widely she says non hispanic white people are now in the minority in california as demography changes across the nation we ll have to watch to see whether california is influential in the direction of the culture larry gerston a political scientist and analyst lecturing at the university of california santa cruz admits the state has serious problems he suggests it can perhaps act as a canary in a coal mine and point the way in solving them but he doesn t doubt the golden state will continue to lead the nation on many fronts though some outcomes may not be known for another 20 years given issues that are still in play and yet he s certain about one thing you won t be buying a fossil fuel car in 20 years you just won t you ll see them in museums in the relationship between a president and a top adviser both style and substance matter president trump is citing policy disagreements with john bolton but clashing styles may have mattered even more whether it was by firing or resignation national security adviser john bolton s departure from president donald trump s white house had seemed inevitable for a while what spelled his doom former officials and national security analysts say was not his strong views on foreign policy issues the president found that appealing rather it was mr bolton s take charge approach to issues that annoyed a president who may appreciate hearing different viewpoints but does not like being pushed in directions his gut tells him he doesn t want to go moreover the president does not tolerate any suggestion that anyone but him is in charge it s not that the president doesn t like hearing from people with different points of view he does says james carafano at the heritage foundation it s really about the relationship with the president and how he feels the process is going what happens after mr bolton s departure some with knowledge of the president s preferences expect to see more high profile diplomatic initiatives such as another north korean summit or revived diplomacy with the taliban some even speculate that mr trump could push for the ultimate showstopper a meeting with iranian president hassan rouhani at the united nations later this month the idea of a team of rivals serving the president best by offering an array of passionately held and clashing views for the chief executive to ponder has been around since at least abraham lincoln and for the last 17 months of donald trump s presidency the white house has depicted the president as relishing the strong and often conflicting positions within his national security team and above all between secretary of state michael pompeo and the famously self assertive and acerbic national security adviser john bolton that portrayal took a hit tuesday when mr trump abruptly announced through a tweet that he was firing mr bolton with whom he said he had often strongly disagreed mr bolton said he had resigned the president went on to hint at the widely known reality that mr bolton had increasingly found himself the white house odd man out both in personality and in viewpoint on issues from iran to north korea and afghanistan i disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions mr trump tweeted as did others in the administration whether it was by firing or resignation mr bolton s departure had seemed inevitable for a while yet what spelled the doom of mr trump s third national security adviser in less than three years was not so much his strong views on key foreign policy issues former officials and national security analysts say rather it was his take charge approach to issues among them iran and venezuela that annoyed a president who may appreciate hearing different viewpoints but does not like being pushed in directions his gut tells him he doesn t want to go moreover the president does not tolerate any suggestion particularly to the press or the public generally that anyone but him is in charge trump likes a multiplicity of advisers presenting a variety of approaches but he is very averse to situations where his advisers are ganging up on him and leading him to a certain line of thinking that he does not like says peter feaver a professor of political science and public policy at duke university in durham north carolina it s one thing if the president hasn t decided what to do but it s quite another if the president has decided to go left and his adviser is there saying no no no you ve got to go right indeed professor feaver who directed national security strategy planning during president george w bush s second term says it was some of mr bolton s same qualities that originally drew mr trump s interest above all his frequent smart attack dog commentaries on foreign policy usually on fox news that ended up souring the relationship between the two at the very same time in 2017 that the president s advisers were advising him to stay in the jcpoa the six nation nuclear agreement with iran there was john bolton on tv saying very effectively and compellingly to the president s ears that what the president wanted to do which was to get out of the jcpoa was the right thing to do professor feaver says but before long it would be precisely that public assertiveness that would begin irritating mr trump in particular he was put off by mr bolton s early interaction with the press that suggested he was running the iran and venezuela policies when mr bolton s entourage suggested over the weekend to some media contacts that it was mr bolton who had prevailed in squelching a surprise camp david meeting with the taliban to sign a peace deal ending the u s war in afghanistan it was seen by some as the last straw and that despite the president having indeed agreed with his national security adviser by nixing the high profile meeting by this spring relations between the president and his national security adviser had chilled considerably as mr bolton seemed increasingly dissonant with the president s preference for big deals and showy diplomacy such as his three unprecedented meetings with north korea s kim jong un indeed at the same time in late june that mr trump was crossing the border between the two koreas to meet mr kim for the third time mr bolton was in mongolia dispatched there by a president who wanted an adviser who had called for regime change in north korea nowhere in sight and then there was iran mr trump was fine with mr pompeo s maximum pressure campaign largely reliant on increasingly tough sanctions to get tehran to the negotiating table but he was less comfortable with mr bolton s push for a more belligerent approach to the iranian regime when mr trump at the last minute called off a military strike on iran in retaliation for the shoot down in june of a u s drone some white house and state department officials quipped privately that mr bolton had brought the president to within 10 minutes of a war he didn t want i temper john which is pretty amazing mr trump mused last spring for some analysts with close contacts with the trump white house mr bolton s departure is a clear sign that the president had concluded the administration s foreign policy decision making process wasn t working anymore it s not that the president doesn t like hearing from people with different points of view he does says james carafano director of foreign policy studies at the heritage foundation in washington it s really about the relationship with the president and how he feels the process is going and clearly the president had decided the decision making process had bogged down mr carafano notes that the president turned to mr bolton at another point in his presidency when he felt the process had slowed and was tempering his instincts for bold diplomatic action the president wanted to move to a faster execution of foreign policy than he was getting with former national security adviser h r mcmaster he says and he got that more aggressive execution with bolton and pompeo coming in but with the sharp differences that were dividing the national security team including between mr bolton and mr pompeo the process was once again slowing beyond the president s tolerance says mr carafano who has close links to the white house the question now shifts to whom mr trump will name to replace mr bolton and what signals he will send by the choice he makes with mr bolton out of the way some with close knowledge of mr trump s foreign policy preferences say they expect to see more of the showman s high profile diplomatic initiatives including such possibilities as another summit with north korea s mr kim and revived diplomacy with the taliban to get an afghanistan peace deal before next year s election some even speculate that mr trump could push for the ultimate showstopper a meeting with iranian president hassan rouhani at the united nations general assembly session in new york later this month what no one expects to see is another national security adviser with the brash personality and big public presence of john bolton if i had to guess i d say it would be someone who is aligned with mike pompeo because right now pompeo has the most influential voice with the president on national security issues says duke s dr feaver indeed one name being tossed around as a potential candidate for the job is brian hook secretary pompeo s senior policy adviser on iran and this time around the president may go for someone with a lower public profile who can make the trains run on time he adds and cut down on the drama to root out hate you first have to identify it technology has helped to reveal a thread of racism running through some u s police forces that s the first step now what in the past when a law enforcement officer shared a racist comment or joke it typically stayed in the room today as technology mediates an ever increasing portion of our social lives such remarks can become matters of public debate years after they ve been expressed in recent months a series of reports has revealed thousands of instances of police sharing racist xenophobic and white supremacist imagery and memes on facebook most cops are not racist says heather taylor an african american night watch homicide sergeant with the st louis metropolitan police department but if you think that there are no white supremacists you re definitely wrong you re definitely wrong the best way to prevent white supremacists from wearing the badge says sergeant taylor is not to hire them in the first place the prescription is better screening and hiring she says we can t hold on to people just because they run the fastest they shoot the best they meet all of these criteria that are important law enforcement wise but when it comes to being moral and ethically sound we can t pass these people through our academies if you ask heather taylor an african american night watch homicide sergeant with the st louis metropolitan police department if some of her co workers are white supremacists she will respond with an unequivocal yes most cops are not racist she says but if you think that there are no white supremacists you re definitely wrong you re definitely wrong she notes that there are currently six pending investigations for racial discrimination in the slmpd and that one case was recently resolved with a 1 1 million settlement we are in the news every other week she says st louis police department is hardly alone in struggling with racism in its ranks what is relatively new however are ways to expose officers who may be undermining public trust in law enforcement a series of reports from the center for investigative reporting earlier this year found active duty police officers posting racist memes on facebook prompting more than 50 police departments across the united states to take action in july propublica uncovered a group of 9 500 current and retired u s customs and border protection officers posting xenophobic and white supremacist imagery on facebook the plain view project established by a group of philadelphia attorneys in 2016 has cataloged more than 5 000 facebook posts and comments by police officers in eight cities that include racist imagery and encourage violence against ethnic minorities in june sergeant taylor and the ethical society of police demanded the immediate dismissal of st louis police officers exposed by the plain view project the officers werefound to have made facebook posts thattrafficin racist stereotypes promotethe confederate battle flag compareblack lives matter to the ku klux klan jokeabout extrajudicial executions andvilifymuslims st louis police officers had posted these inflammatorymessages publicly on facebook between 2013 and 2017 but they remained unnoticed until the plain view project posted them in its online database in june in the past when someone shared a racist comment or joke with a friend colleague or family member it typically stayed in the room today as technology mediates an ever increasing portion of our social lives such remarks can become matters of public debate years after they ve been expressed and when these remarks resurface sometimes years later they force two questions central to one of the biggest civil rights debates of our time to what extent does white supremacy find a home in american policing and how can it be best addressed to some those questions presume too sweeping an indictment of the force let s put aside the notion that there s rampant racism in law enforcement says jeff roorda business manager of the st louis police officers association the union representing st louis metro police that s a false narrative mr roorda who worked as a police officer for 17 years and is the author of the 2016 book the war on police how the ferguson effect is making america unsafe points out that many of the posts amassed by the plain view project are just variations on the logo of the punisher a marvel comics character many others express opinions held by a wide swath of americans he says i challenge you to find any profession with less occurrence of racist posts says mr roorda we expect to be held to a higher standard what we can t handle is being held to an impossible standard the ethical society has a history of addressing racial inequality he says but in the last few years their president sergeant taylor has been radicalized to vida johnson a georgetown university law professor and a criminal defense attorney the job of dealing with police with white supremacist beliefs is best handled outside the department one potential solution professor johnson argued in an article in the lewis clark law review in april is for jurists to expand their enforcement of the brady doctrine a pretrial discovery rule that prosecutors must disclose to the defense any material exculpatory evidence and the related giglio doctrine which requires disclosure of any such evidence that could be used to impeach the credibility of prosecution witnesses including police officers there is no doubt professor johnson wrote that membership in a hate group or ascribing to racist beliefs would be fodder for cross examination of an officer and useful to the defense having an outside group perform these background checks would help relieve police departments of the burden of policing themselves says professor johnson because of the blue wall of silence it s really hard to expose these officers because officers have to rely on one another she says professor johnson argues that prosecutors are well placed to help screen police officers for racist beliefs and affiliations with white supremacist groups if a prosecutor s office saw it as their role to really look into their witnesses carefully and particularly police officers who represent the government they would be making sure these checks were done she says i think that s just the culture of police departments says professor johnson and until we change that it s going to be hard to separate the good guys from the bad guys white supremacy and american law enforcement share a long history together the earliest forms of organized policing wereslave patrols and for much of u s history through slavery reconstruction and jim crow police have played a key role in upholding a racist social order and the problem didn t vanish at the end of the 20th century in 2006 the fbi sounded the alarm that so called ghost skins members of neo nazi or other hate groups posing as members of civilized society had joined police departments across the united states white supremacist groups in the 1980s and 1990s started promoting a strategy they refer to as infiltration says pete simi a sociologist who studies domestic terrorat chapman university in orange california we have no idea how effective or really widespread the strategy has actually been says professor simi who co wrote the 2010 book american swastika inside the white power movement s hidden spaces of hate for sergeant taylor membership in a hate group is only one form that white supremacy can take sometimes it s systemic she writes in a text message shortly after our interview sometimes it s as simple as racist words in an email group about president obama being inferior facebook posts an officer joining a group that hates muslims a supervisor refusing to allow someone in a specialized or coveted unit he or she supervises because of their hair or denying an officer a promotion because they re too ethnic for them the best way to prevent white supremacists from wearing the badge says sergeant taylor is not to hire them in the first place but she stresses that it is also important to screen police officers continuously throughout their career the prescription is better screening and hiring says sergeant taylor we can t hold on to people just because they run the fastest they shoot the best they meet all of these criteria that are important law enforcement wise but when it comes to being moral and ethically sound we can t pass these people through our academies the ethical society advocates community policing where officers aim to strengthen social bonds with the populations they police last year the group expanded and began accepting members from the st louis county police department which is directly responsible for policing the unincorporated areas of the county that department also contracts with several municipalities in the county to serve as their police department in 2015 in response to younger black officers leaving the department the ethical society founded a free pre academy program for those considering a career in law enforcement the program is open to people of all races and genders ages 19 and older all instructors are previous or current police academy instructors who take prospective recruits through a miniaturized version of a real academy they meet twice weekly for three hour classes on constitutional law criminal investigation and report writing fitness and nutrition and a class on maintaining emotional wellness the program is aimed at ensuring that the demographic makeup of the police department reflects that of the city according to the slmpd s 2018 annual report two thirds of the department s commissioned officers are white 30 are black and about 3 are other the city of st louis by comparison is 45 white and 49 black according to u s census data sergeant taylor is proud of the program but she recognizes its limits everything we do with our 10 week academy with screening people and trying to double check their character you ll still have officers who will fail that s just human nature she says americans may take televised candidate debates for granted but there are parts of the world that have been starving for this staple of democracy our reporter was on hand to witness history in tunisia the 2011 arab spring s sole success story tunisia holds its second ever free presidential elections sept 15 but the most remarkable feature of the voters two week crash course on the many candidates has been three nights of televised debates for the first time in the arab world leading candidates took to a stage to debate policy and defend their track records across the region the broadcasts are shattering taboos over challenging authority and raising expectations arab citizens have of their leaders this is a moment of pride for us tunisians a chance to remember why our revolution and struggle was all worth it says walid ben mohammed a tunis taxi driver rather than our next head of our state acting like they are the boss of us he or she has to plead with us as if they are applying for a job candidates even used some of their platform to promote tunisia s democracy to help other arab states embarking on a democratic transition in algeria and sudan people are looking to us as a model and will demand presidential candidates articulate their programs on national television says tarek tahlawi a tunisian political analyst two dozen presidential candidates vying over multiple nights to make their case to the people via television while political debates have become fatiguingly familiar for americans in tunisia they have been something else entirely historic for the first time in the arab world leading presidential candidates took to a stage this week to debate policy and defend their track records the debates in tunisia s capital on three consecutive nights ending sept 9 were broadcast across the region shattering taboos over challenging authority and raising the expectations arab citizens have of their leaders tunisia the arab world s purest democracy and the arab spring s sole lasting success story is holding its second ever free presidential elections sept 15 due to the hybrid nature of the tunisian political system of a president and a prime minister the subjects of the debates were limited to the specific realms of the president national security foreign policy and the military but even western viewers would have found many familiar subjects climate change the death penalty and how to best combat terrorism outgoing prime minister youssef chahed touted his tough on terror credentials by listing the terrorist cells that were busted under his premiership while candidates such as former caretaker president and human rights activist moncef marzouki promised to make the economy work for citizens other subjects were unique to the arab world how to help mediate peace in neighboring libya mending ties with syria s bashar al assad the palestinian cause and the explosive question of normalizing ties with israel others were national hot button issues unique to tunisia should tunisia ban the full face niqab veil for security reasons what are candidates solutions to prevent tunisians from trying to migrate to europe illegally and drowning off its coasts the debates were the result of five years of campaigning by the munathara initiative a tunisia based organization that holds politically themed debates across the arab world the debates were the most extensive and inclusive ever between arab political candidates the only precedent in the region was in 2012 when a private television channel held a debate between two of the nine candidates for egypt s presidency but the final two choices on the ballot including the eventual president mohammed morsi were not involved or held to scrutiny we wanted these debates to inspire other arabs with what is possible and tunisia again is showing the region what is possible once more says belabbes benkredda founder and ceo of munathara which is arabic for debate this is the antithesis of the fragmentation we have witnessed in our public discourse across the world by having all these broadcasters come together to air these debates everyone is taking part in a shared reality alternative facts have been an issue in a young democracy such as tunisia where many media outlets are tied to political parties gulf arab countries and turkey also have used their regional media networks to support rival tunisian parties and politicians creating local and regional echo chambers munathara working with tunisia s independent high electoral commission isie and the country s equivalent of the federal communications commission devised a debate format based on colombian and mexican models in which candidates are given 90 seconds to respond to specific questions from moderators as part of a compromise with the 11 tunisian channels organizers agreed to make the debates less confrontational with minimal interaction among the candidates themselves the lone criticism by the tunisian media yet according to tunisians themselves if the debates lacked in drama or verbal fisticuffs they made up for it simply by having leaders detail their policies and defend themselves within 90 seconds or face being cut off by the journalist moderators this is a moment of pride for us tunisians a chance to remember why our revolution and struggle was all worth it says walid ben mohammed a tunis taxi driver rather than our next head of our state acting like they are the boss of us he or she has to plead with us as if they are applying for a job the format made the arab world s first presidential debates more policy focused than personality driven rather than he said she said grandstanding or crowd pleasing slogans candidates were forced to quickly delve into the details or lack thereof of their plans for national security intelligence services protecting the borders diplomacy and tunisian foreign policy toward europe and africa to reinforce accountability for the country s next leader the debates included a 99 days section in which the candidates were given 99 seconds to articulate their pledges for their first 99 days in office moderators later asked for a show of hands from the candidates to pledge to come back on national television for their 100th day in office to review their 99 day promises and defend whether or not they have achieved them in the debates 99 day promises have included reviewing trade agreements and making france apologize for its decades of colonization of tunisia everyone is getting similar questions no one is getting preferable treatment says mounira jaylani a mother of four from hay tadhamin a marginalized neighborhood in the capital these debates prove that these candidates have to earn our trust and answer to us as president not only answer to their parties in addition to rekindling faith in a beleaguered democratic process the debates were hailed as a positive success in arab and tunisian media as well as fodder for radio talk shows tunisian daily newspaper al chourouk gave a rundown of each candidate s performance offering unusually blunt critiques and criticisms of a potential soon to be arab head of state the newspaper noted that although islamist ennahda candidate abdul fateh al mouro emphasized his oratory skills in the debates he seemed to try to be appealing to viewers simply through his eloquence rather than making an actual argument abeer mousa an apologist for dictator zine el abidine ben ali looked like she was following a script and her usual fire was absent former prime minister mahdi jumaa seemed to be too low energy for a candidate trying to convince voters while independent amr mansour was hopeless providing incomplete and unconvincing answers and appeared to be unprepared in addition to running on 11 local private and public channels the tunisian debates were carried live by satellite networks from libya iraq and algeria as well as by al jazeera live which beams for free into the homes of 100 million arab viewers across the region the historic nature of the debates was not lost on members of the arab media who filled tunisian state al wataniya studios on saturday during technical setup literally filming the electric cables being connected for the first arab presidential debates this is particularly true for neighboring algeria embroiled in a contentious political transition after protesters forced out longtime president abdelaziz bouteflika in april and for sudan where civilians and the military have entered a democratic transition after a monthslong showdown that saw hundreds killed candidates even used some of their platform to promote tunisia s democratic model as a tool to help other arab states embarking on a democratic transition in algeria and sudan people are looking to us as a model and will demand presidential candidates articulate their programs on national television says tarek tahlawi a tunisian political analyst who served as a debates adviser to one of the candidates because in tunisia we really do not know who will be our president and it is a position candidates have to earn french came to africa through conquest but today it belongs to schoolchildren in seychelles and doctors in congo just as much as office workers from france writes the monitor s ryan lenora brown last year in a restaurant in congo i asked a waiter for directions in what i thought was passable french sorry he said in response i don t speak english but as a journalist in africa home to most of the world s francophone countries having hopeless french skills isn t an option so for seven weeks this summer i swore off english and immersed myself in language school at middlebury college still when my new classmates asked why i wanted to study french i felt sheepish about learning a european language to talk to more africans why wasn t i studying swahili or wolof i wondered zulu or yoruba yes french was more widely spoken in africa than any of those languages but it was also the language of colonialism spread by violence and conquest but the longer i walked around inside the french language the more i realized how narrow my perception of the language had been if french is the language of moli re balzac and camus it is also the language of aim c saire l opold senghor and mariama b french s future and much of the world s is in africa that story had always been there i just had to learn how to see it so why are you studying french during my early days at middlebury college s french immersion school this summer i heard this question again and again it was delivered in a wide variety of accents with varying levels of grammatical acumen by dozens of my classmates who like me had all taken a pledge to only speak french for the duration of our seven week program i asked it too of opera singers and doctors of doctoral students and jazz musicians and as i stumbled through these introductory conversations i learned that there were the students who needed french the students who loved it and the students who merely tolerated its presence in their lives during my decadelong on again off again relationship with the french language i had mostly been part of the third category the apathetic i always liked the idea of speaking french which seemed to me wispy and delicate quieter than english even when spoken at the same volume but when it came to the actual speaking i was hopeless and i d mostly given up on changing that last year in a restaurant in kinshasa the congolese capital i asked a waiter for directions in what i thought was passable french sorry he said in response i don t speak english so why was i studying french anyway when asked by my new classmates i stuttered over my response and not only because of my middling language skills because i am a journalist who wants to work in all the countries of africa i tried because i want to write stories that are not a stereotype i ventured and because french is spoken by many africans as i said the words i felt sheepish about them here i was reciting my desire to learn a european language to talk to more africans why wasn t i studying swahili or wolof i wondered zulu or yoruba yes french was more widely spoken in africa than any of those languages yes it was the official language of 21 african countries but it was also the language of colonialism spread by violence and conquest even as i thought about this i flung myself into the program each day was cluttered with four hours of class and as many of homework plus two dozen extracurricular activities en fran ais from a student radio show to aqua aerobics the primary effects at least at first were daily headaches the result of hours feeling my way through conversations i d only half understood how do you dkzklgwe someone would ask yes i d reply french words as anyone who s studied the language knows well aren t crisp they begin strong and then frequently dissolve without warning in the center leaving a string of unpronounced letters trailing behind them at the same time sounds seem to melt together creating sentences that felt to me less like a string of individual words and more like water rushing from a tap a continuous thing with no discernible beginning or end il a mis le pied a french person might say he set foot or had they said il a mille pieds meaning he has a thousand feet hard to say because the pronunciation of those two sentences is identical not to mention there never seem to be enough consonants to go around il a ha ha ti my phonetics cd prompted me to repeat one july afternoon he hated haiti but even as i tried to repeat the phrase i d already made up my mind i would never hate haiti or know anyone who did because there was no way i d get through a sentence that sounded like this ee lah ah ee ah ee tee still i began to notice that with every passing week the world was cracking open a little wider one day i learned the past conditional in the days that followed suddenly the world was full of regret and reproach you could have gone i should have done it another week i wrestled the subjonctif which i was told was not a verb tense but a verb mood meaning that it expressed not when an action was happening but what you thought about it the subjonctif told you something was wanted it was regretted it was necessary the subjonctif was the expression of desire and of longing like so many things in french it made no sense to me and it made so much sense to me at the same time and the longer i walked around inside the french language the more i realized how narrow my own perception of the language had been if once it had been the language of the french it now belonged as much if not more to its other speakers there are more francophones in congo than in belgium or switzerland there are far more african french speakers than european ones if french is the language of moli re balzac and camus it is also the language of aim c saire l opold senghor and mariama b in 2014 a study by a french investment bank claimed that by 2050 french could be the most spoken language in the world largely because of demographic booms in francophone africa the study assumed that everyone in countries where french is an official language is a french speaker far from the truth but one point isn t up for debate french s future and much of the world s is in africa inside the french language i realized by the end of the summer is the same kind of story i like to tell more broadly of resistance rebellion and reappropriation of people taking something forced upon them and making it their own that story had always been there i just had to learn how to see it with so many women running for president in the united states americans might want to keep an eye on what europe has lately achieved in female leadership for its top governing institutions it has become a model for gender inclusivity in july two women were chosen by european union leaders for the first time to head the bloc s most powerful executive bodies and now nearly half of the incoming european commissioners will be women a similar achievement can be found in the european parliament in the u s women are entering corporate boardrooms at a record rate yet in politics the pace has been uneven in the house of representatives 23 4 are female the eu still struggles as a political body over issues like climate policy industrial strategy and military unity it especially struggles to compete with the u s and china but with women running its top institutions it can claim a new style of leadership starting with greater inclusivity on that score it is already a great power with so many women running for president in the united states americans might want to keep an eye on what europe has lately achieved in female leadership for its top governing institutions it has become a model for gender inclusivity in july two women were chosen by european union leaders for the first time to head the bloc s most powerful executive bodies christine lagarde chief of the international monetary fund was picked to manage the european central bank and ursula von der leyen who was germany s first female defense minister was given the nod to run the european commission the eu s administrative arm with some 32 000 employees then on tuesday the drive for gender parity in what is the world s second largest economy became even more impressive ms von der leyen revealed that nearly half of her 27 commissioners would be women up from a third under her male predecessor even national parliaments in europe have yet to reach such a high proportion a similar achievement can be found in the european parliament which is expected to approve the two female candidates soon women make up 41 of that elected body up from 15 in 1979 one reason for the increase is that more countries require political parties to nominate a certain proportion of women in elections in the u s women are entering corporate boardrooms at a record rate yet in politics the pace has been uneven in the house of representatives 23 4 are female europe has had the benefit of many women as national leaders such as german chancellor angela merkel who have pushed the eu toward gender equality ms von der leyen has gone a step further by naming women to important posts as commissioners for digital innovation defense and immigration the eu still struggles as a political body over issues like climate policy industrial strategy and military unity it especially struggles to compete with the u s and china but with women running its top institutions it can claim a new style of leadership starting with

scientist in boston whose founder was concerned with both the state of the world and the quality of available news following the events of sept 11 2001 commentators announced that the world would never be the same each of us can be a force for good today and every day by letting god s love dissolve prejudice and hate in our thoughts after the shattering acts of terrorism that took place on sept 11 2001 i wanted to pray but where could i start the pictures of the new york city scene were horrific then there was the plane crash just a short way east of where i lived in pittsburgh how could i get beyond the screams and carnage yet there was a simple fact that i had experienced all my life god goodness itself is present and acting i had confidence in the power and presence of that goodness i could begin simply by acknowledging that comforting presence it was speaking to me and to all of god s creation that had to be my starting point my first test by fire literally had been more than 30 years before during the race riots and the burning of pittsburgh there i had learned in the midst of hatred revenge and violence to turn away from judging and blaming i saw the flames and condemned all but i soon realized that i really needed to break out of just reacting i realized my need to learn to forgive and to love over the next several months at the university where i taught i created a living arrangement that brought together black and white students interested in learning how to overcome racism god was showing me that instead of reacting to all that hostility i could act confident in god s underlying goodness science and health with key to the scriptures by monitor founder mary baker eddy speaks of god as divine principle love underlying overlying and encompassing all true being p 496 in this pittsburgh experience i saw that god had never stopped loving his creation by becoming conscious of the ongoing action of divine love i was being equipped to help my community in a very practical way i was being awakened from a kind of hypnotic trance fascinated by pictures of a world where there are oppressors and victims a world where skin color defines your place in society that unjust world had seemed so real this awakening showed me something of what jesus called the kingdom of heaven as he said it s not distant but at hand matthew 4 17 i saw that i could hold that spiritual vision in consciousness this broke the hypnotic trance it freed me and on sept 11 2001 that again became my starting point a fuller sense of god good present and acting now that another anniversary of 9 11 is upon us we need a new day a new sense of the day we are living science and health speaks of day as the irradiance of life p 584 irradiance means sending forth radiant light light is often the symbol for truth integrity clarity freshness today is the lord s day full of light terrorism fear hatred prejudice all depend on the absence of light we are setting forth in this freshness of a new day in this day this irradiance of divine life good things happen divine love is present guiding the berlin wall crumbles arab youth reaches sometimes successfully for freedom and integrity how can we live this new day we need to lose the we versus they instead it s just us every one of us created by the same loving divine source with god love as our guide we begin to overcome prejudiced ways of seeing others learning to love our neighbor will keep our day radiant with light to do that we have to see not with the physical senses but with our spiritual sense this is the sense that can tell good from evil and what do we see using this sense we see the true spiritual nature of our neighbors and guess what it is so beautiful it becomes natural to love this is not a call for complacency jesus himself warned his disciples ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled matthew 24 6 the good news is that jesus teachings enable us to deal with these challenges he alerted us to not absorb the world s prejudices and materialistic approach and to not be shocked by its sometimes ugly appearance jesus gave us the means of dealing with this by teaching us to love we can do that we can go forth into the world as mrs eddy writes with a charity broad enough to cover the whole world s evil and sweet enough to neutralize what is bitter in it miscellaneous writings 1883 1896 p 224 in this way we will prove right the 9 11 commentators who predicted that the world would never be the same we can be a part of that change we can enter this arena this new day irradiant with life god and joyous to see greet and love each other as individual parts of god s creation adapted from an article published in the sept 5 2011 issue of the christian science sentinel thanks for joining us today come back tomorrow we ll look at whether or not the long expected purpling of texas politics is happening also republican sen ted cruz will be our guest at
