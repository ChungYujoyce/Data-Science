coronavirus transmission is not black and white some activities are riskier than others while some should cause little worry as states start to reopen parts of their economies and people tire of an all out quarantine the risk level of various activities should be considered to make decisions about what apos s safe and what should be avoided julia marcus a harvard medical school professor recently argued in the atlantic that we should remember that risk is not binary and that an abstinence only approach won apos t help likewise asking americans to abstain from nearly all in person social contact will not hold the coronavirus at bay at least not forever she wrote so we spoke with dr susan hassig an associate professor of epidemiology at the tulane university school of public health and tropical medicine in new orleans about the risks of going out to eat gathering with friends and opening mail while different activities are by nature riskier than others you should wear a mask when possible and try to keep a distance of 6 feet from others things like social distancing and wearing a mask or the lack thereof can alter risk level significantly here apos s what you should consider about various activities as restrictions start to lift across the country getting together with family or friends who don apos t live in your household comes with a high risk of infection hassig said if you haven apos t been living with them then there apos s a potential risk she said family and friends are unlikely to wear masks or social distance at these gatherings and asymptomatic people could spread the virus there if you do decide to get together with family or friends you should consider the age and underlying conditions of the people there and those you live with you should also consider who your friends could have come into contact with are they mostly staying at home are they visiting different friends every day it apos s not just your friend you apos re seeing hassig said it apos s everybody they apos ve spent time with bars should not be allowed to open hassig said the nature of bars mingling crowded bartops and the inability to wear a mask while you apos re drinking make them a high risk place for getting a coronavirus infection hassig said and alcohol can hinder decision making which could make those factors even worse rituals like shaking hands and taking communion in the catholic church as well as dense crowds and the prevalence of older people make religious services a high risk place for coronavirus infections the risk could be lowered by social distancing wearing masks and abstaining from rituals that involve touching eating or drinking movie theaters or large events like sporting games have a high risk especially because of the crowding at entries and exits even if attendees can enter and exit while social distancing which would likely be complicated and take longer getting infected while sitting in a contained area is still a risk gymgoers should wear a mask when possible hassig said equipment should be sanitized before and after each use and social distancing should be enforced rigorously indoor dining at restaurants is risky because of airflow and people being in an enclosed space for hours at a time to help mitigate the risks of eating in a restaurant people should wear masks until their food is delivered disposable materials especially for things like menus can also help hair and nail salons which have opened in several states have a medium risk of infection hassig said wearing masks is critical as it helps block particles from spreading as easily when you apos re speaking or coughing it also discourages employees and customers from touching their faces salon employees should be sure to wash their hands frequently hassig said when it comes to dates or gatherings with a very small group the same questions apply as with larger group gatherings geography also matters in an area with a lot of cases like new york the risk that your date could be contagious is higher than in a suburb with only a handful of cases social distancing on beaches can help lower the risk of catching the coronavirus while you apos re enjoying a day in the sun but it can also be hard to enforce because of the size of many beaches they usually have many points of entry so it would be difficult to limit capacity dining outdoors at a restaurant is a relatively low risk activity as long as tables are kept at least 6 feet apart being outside allows air to flow more freely you should still wear a mask as often as you can and be cautious of high touch items like menus and condiments when you apos re on a hike or a walk in the park you shouldn apos t worry too much about quickly walking past another person on a path or trail while you should try to maintain a distance of 6 feet from others at all times encounters of more than 15 minutes are riskier than walking past someone outdoor activities are low risk if you stay with people from your household if you meet up with other friends or family that still counts as a gathering and proper precautions should be taken shopping in a grocery store or a clothing store can be low risk if you keep a distance from others and wear a mask fitting rooms should be closed or if people are allowed to try on clothes anything that isn apos t purchased should be quarantined for a couple of days hassig said the place in stores with the most risk is the checkout where interactions with cashiers or other customers could help spread the virus there apos s a low risk of catching the coronavirus from touching your mail or other items like groceries hassig said she doesn apos t wipe down her groceries but if you apos re worried about it you can keep nonperishable items in the grocery bag for a few days before using them you should still be cautious about touching things like doorknobs and elevator buttons do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you d
