i went grocery shopping this weekend not just a quick stop to pick up a few things but a cart filling trip to replenish supplies at both my apartment and at my boyfriend s i expected my grocery shopping to be part of a productive sunday but my plans for the day went awry when the trip put me on the verge of a panic attack i m naturally anxious but woof it was a rough afternoon if it s been a while since you took a typical trip to the grocery store you might find a different shopping experience than you might expect here are my recommendations for how you can prepare for the journey in the time of coronavirus if you re going to the store where you usually shop take a few extra moments to organize your list by department or aisle your goal during this period of physical distancing should be to get in and out of the store as quickly as possible it is not the time when you want to be criss crossing the store because you walked right by that item you stuck onto the bottom of your list if you typically go to the store with your partner or kids it s time to fly solo the fewer people who are in the store at one time means the easier it will be to stay at least six feet apart if you can complete your shopping for more than one household at a time now s the time to band together to do it as i mentioned i did the shopping for my house and my boyfriend s house and let me tell you i m making him go next time you might be able to pick up items for your next door neighbor or a friend who lives close by to minimize their travels when you re out grocery shopping right now you might not have much a choice when it comes to what you can stroll right into many grocery stores right now but you might be surprised to find a line outside your store entrance if the staff is limiting the number of people who can shop at one time wait times can vary but it s best to expect you ll have to wait think you can squeeze in your grocery run before your next zoom call wait until after that meeting if the idea of making small talk in line to buy groceries makes you sweat grab a pair of earphones on your way out the door some stores are having staff sanitize carts between shoppers some are still allowing you to wipe down your own and some stores are out of sanitizing wipes altogether if you re not sure what the deal is at your store ask an employee you re sure to find a few near the entrance grocery stores are a madhouse right now the bottled water is gone staples like milk eggs and grocery aisles do not have a reputation for being spacious it s hard enough to keep physical distance from others everywhere you go but it s even more difficult when someone is standing in front of the chicken display for what feels like an eternity do your best to be patient and avoid getting close to anyone but also be forgiving if someone invades your personal space scolding is only going to raise tensions further they probably got distracted by their own grocery list and forgot that things aren t normal anymore simply step aside gracefully if you can my grocery store was out of eggs toilet paper and most types of bread i anticipated those items to be out of stock but every single type of pasta mustard go into your grocery trip expecting many shelf areas to be empty many of them will be restocked within hours but the odds are high that you ll leave the store without getting every single item on your list mustard aside there s a good chance you ll be able to get what you need even if it isn t your first choice if you re just shopping for yourself it s easy to adjust when the grocery store is out of your favorite brand or flavor of a product but if you re shopping for anyone else like a partner child or neighbor ask them this important question if they re out of that kind is there another option you prefer you might argue that this isn t a time to be picky but if you re someone who would normally stop in the grocery aisle and send a text to ask they re out of cocoa pebbles what do you want preparing some alternatives before you venture out to the store can help you reduce your shopping time it can also help set expectations for the folks who stayed home socially distancing is necessary for all of us right now but for seniors it s essential to help if you usually bring your own reusable bags you might find your store won t use them right now if you typically bag your own groceries this is less likely to impact you the virus isn t known to survive very long on soft items like tote bags but some stores that usually have baggers have been offering paper or plastic only in an effort to reduce the items store employees have to touch lisa rowan covers personal finance she was previously a senior writer and on air analyst at the penny hoarder her first book money hacks adams media will publish in september 2020
