joe biden has been campaigning like he s already won the democratic nomination in his first few forays in early voting states the former vice president has talked past his democratic primary opponents and aimed squarely at the up for grabs voters in swing state communities about president donald trump folks the fact is we cannot let this administration win again in 2020 he told cheering supporters on tuesday in henderson nevada we have to restore the american creed of decency honor and dignity leaving no one behind friendship implicit in the frontrunner s message on economic fairness workers rights and presidential temperament is an argument that he is the strongest democrat to challenge trump on his record in fact he s been treating his first few weeks as a declared candidate doing just that attempting to spark voters imaginations about how a trump v biden general election looks like it s rooted in a long running argument one that has vexed party insiders every four years can this person win more than anything else democrats want to defeat trump in polls of likely democratic voters that dominates everything else including ideological purity one poll conducted by cnn after biden joined the race said 92 of democrats said having the ability to beat trump was very or extremely important while roughly two thirds ranked having progressive policies or being the future of the party mattered a separate poll from quinnipiac university seemed to anoint biden as the best suited to the task of making trump a one termer in that survey 56 of democrats said biden was strongest to defeat trump while vermont sen bernie sanders came in second with 12 of democrats thinking he was capable of beating the president but there is a disconnect in these numbers even as more than half of democrats saw biden as the strongest he drew only 38 support in other words a double digit percentage of democrats were willing to go with less of a sure thing rather than biden biden advisers are hardly coy about making electability and a return to pre trump politics central to their strategy they are strategically trying to provoke trump a clown biden mused recently and trump has been taking the bait biden s team is also betting that obama era nostalgia will set in among the democratic electorate read more trump attacks biden more than other 2020 candidates is he afraid or excited rival democrats aren t exactly eager to start attacking a beloved party elder who served as a loyal lieutenant to the nation s first black president but they re also starting to see risk in biden running away with the nomination without any real pressure testing after all biden isn t the only democrat who stands strongly in a hypothetical head to head with trump given the margin of sampling error inherent with polling most of the democrats are essentially tied with trump and no one is a statistical slam dunk in fact cnn s latest polling shows biden joins south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg california sen kamala harris and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren running about even with trump vermont sen bernie sanders and former texas rep beto o rourke are slightly ahead of trump not one of them can be considered a definite leader over trump so biden is not uniquely positioned in the polls to coast to a win which is why biden is trying to sand off some of trump s support biden s message of unity and comity is one likely to assuage weary voters but he s also tossing a bone to those voters who sent trump to washington to send a message that business as usual wasn t working the political system is so broken biden said tuesday it s so mean and it s ugly that it s difficult to get anything done trump biden said is to blame the president has deliberately attempted to divide this nation and he s decided to be president for his base i ll be president for all americans biden said to cheers it s still very early in the process the iowa caucuses are 271 days away and voters are still shopping cnn s poll indicated 23 of voters want to know more about harris 20 want to hear more about warren and 17 want to see more buttigieg nothing at this point is set activists are starting to separate candidates into buckets but are hardly ready to pick just one the debates which start at the end of june could change all of that and there s warning in the example of then texas gov rick perry who had a meltdown during a 2012 campaign debate he was seen as the strongest challenger to defeat barack obama in polls that fall then he had his oops moment and support vanished the same could happen with any number of mini meltdowns or stumbles voters after all a fickle lot still with biden so firmly planted atop the pack and with voters so explicitly looking for someone to beat trump and with biden seemingly the favorite it s worth remembering that it comes with a giant target on his back democratic rivals will need to erode that lead and it could get messy one only need remember biden s love of improvising his responses to voters his long legislative record and even the number of voters who say he s best positioned to beat trump and yet still aren t with him his support may not be cemented just yet but rival democrats are risking a lot by hoping biden gaffes his way from his advantages write to philip elliott at philip elliott time com
