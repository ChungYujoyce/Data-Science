thursday the five most recent christian science articles with a spiritual perspective every monday hillary clinton has spent decades in the public eye turning her into a caricature of a cold emotionless woman she s trying to fix that loading august 13 2016 it was the most engaging moment in hillary clinton s economic speech a description of a man printing fabric for draperies he would lay out the fabric she said then put down a silk screen pour in paint squeegee it across and repeat the process over and over down the table until everything was printed he worked hard the democratic presidential nominee said thursday speaking at a manufacturing company near detroit that man was hugh rodham mrs clinton s dad the son of a factory worker she noted the point of her story was to paint a contrast with gop nominee donald trump who has an alleged history of not paying small businesses for their work on his properties clinton said that given her dad s work as a small business owner she took this aspect of mr trump personally but in telling her dad s story clinton was also revealing something of herself and not just her middle class upbringing she relaxed she smiled she seemed more well human and relatable in her presentation more certainly than when she s talking tax rates or college debt and that goes to a core challenge clinton faces in her cage match against trump getting voters beyond the caricature of her and to actually like her in focus groups earlier this week of wal mart moms the descriptions of clinton were devastating even among women who may vote for her words like emotionless cold and untrustworthy flowed freely why is clinton so challenged on the likability front women voters blame sexism echoing the findings of political scientists who say women candidates are more constrained in their behavioral options than men because of gender norms female politicians for example have to be careful not to get too huggy with voters a lot of women in power you have to give up something said ivania l a radiation safety officer in columbus ohio in a wal mart moms focus group if she was a man we wouldn t be saying she s cold hearted but running while female doesn t fully explain clinton s challenge for example liberal heartthrob elizabeth warren a democratic senator from massachusetts has no problem displaying what voters perceive as authentic emotion in a political speech clinton s old friends are frustrated that most americans don t see the same woman they know and love washington lawyer lanny davis got to know clinton right after she arrived at yale law school in 1969 and they ve been friends ever since at yale i got to know her as a friend someone with a winning and compelling personality friendly genuine funny down to earth fun to be with smart a great laugh and always concerned about you and others more than herself mr davis wrote recently in the hill newspaper the papers of clinton s close friend diane blair who passed away in 2000 shed some light on why clinton has built up a protective shell over the years in 30 years of friendship ms blair observed clinton as a lawyer an advocate for children then a first lady first of arkansas and then of the united states breaking the boundaries of a traditional political spouse s role she also saw up close how the clintons opponents sought to derail them as an adviser to bill clinton s first presidential campaign she was assigned to counter attacks on both clintons i know how necessary it was to keep them from ever scoring a fatal hit on bc or hillary and i guess i was uniquely qualified to do it blair wrote in a letter as reported in a recent article in the washington post she also saw how hillary clinton s spearheading of health care reform early in her husband s first term ignited a fierce backlash a reaction for which mrs clinton was unprepared clinton asked blair to reconstruct her first hellacious year in the white house the post reports blair s account which she called hillyear is a dizzying report on a woman pushed close to the brink juggling family responsibilities with high level political battles blair s papers which include personal correspondence with hillary clinton also portray a hostile press and the first lady sview that the white house wasn t fighting back hard enough against both clintons detractors if mrs clinton seems guarded to those who don t know her then a review of her eight years in the white house a period marked by scandal and ultimately her husband s impeachment certainly provides clues as to why but those who have worked for clinton a world dubbed hillaryland remain intensely loyal to her and when she won a seat in the senate in 2000 the first presidential wife to win election to public office she earned the respect of her colleagues including republicans in a monitor profile of clinton in 2008 sen lindsey graham r of south carolina called clinton a smart prepared serious senator with an ability to build unusual political alliances on a variety of issues still the clintons have always seemed to attract controversy partly of their own doing mrs clinton s use of a private email server while secretary of state raising questions about her handling of classified information hangs over her presidential campaign despite the justice department s decision not to pursue legal charges ditto the allegations of pay to play over donations to the clinton foundation in which critics say large donors were given preferential access to the state department by now clinton s negative image seems so baked into public consciousness it may be impossible to fix still efforts persist to improve perceptions of her president obama who derisively called her likable enough in a 2008 primary debate against her now speaks of her with genuine warmth at the democratic national convention last month daughter chelsea clinton introduced her mother with a deeply personal portrait also at the convention mrs clinton appeared in a video sitting at a kitchen table talking about her life and her goals a more relaxed presentation than her formal speeches get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox clinton also talks more freely about her family than she did in her last campaign her mother s tough childhood daughter chelsea now two grandchildren and she s less shy about the historic nature of her candidacy whether clinton can pass the living room test that is reach the point where enough voters are comfortable seeing her on the news each night is an open question but with an image challenged trump on the ballot against her it may not matter link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to the christian
