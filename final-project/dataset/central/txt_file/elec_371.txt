attorney scott murray and attorney general gordon j macdonald concord gov chris sununu secretary of state bill gardner and top state and federal prosecutors vow tuesday s first in the nation primary will go off without a hitch though they re prepared for contingencies during a nearly hour long news conference on thursday sununu said the state s 100 year tradition of fair and transparent elections will continue and the debacle with the count and reporting of results in iowa will not happen here we have a great record of being right reliable and on time and this time will be no different sununu said the reputation of iowa s caucus hit rock bottom thursday as democratic national chairman tom perez called for a recounting of all monday s votes in light of reports of rampant irregularities from initial reporting which led to even more delays in getting verified results enough is enough in light of the problems that have emerged in the implementation of the delegate selection plan and in order to assure public confidence in the results i am calling on the iowa democratic party to immediately begin a re canvass perez tweeted sununu said he won t brag next wednesday if the primary is carried out flawlessly he dismissed calls from the boston globe and others that new hampshire should lose its treasured status as the nation s first primary i am sure there are lot of folks who think they can replicate the success and integrity that new hampshire has built but they can t sununu said in the executive council chambers to a room packed with national reporters after the news conference state democratic party chairman raymond buckley echoed the opinion that any issues with the primary will be minor and likely will get resolved that day i am 100 percent confident buckley said we all know how to do this gardner said the paper ballot trail a voter registration database that is offline and can t be hacked and the experience of 6 000 local election officials ensure the quality election that citizens here have come to expect there has never been an issue with regards to the vote said gardner who has held the job since 1976 and is the nation s longest state election official new hampshire has never let the country down deputy secretary of state david scanlan said the state doesn t rely on phone apps such as the one that malfunctioned in iowa to use a sports analogy when a team wants to do well the first thing they want to do is stick with the fundamentals make sure you do those right that is what new hampshire does scanlan said there aren t many bells and whistles we see benefits of technology coming down the road the key is we are not going to let the technology interfere with how we conduct our elections attorney general gordon macdonald said throughout primary day five operators will be manning an election hotline to take complaints and concerns the toll free number is 866 868 3703 a new wrinkle is that macdonald has assembled 50 lawyers investigators and staffers to visit all polling places in the state including the three that plan to vote at midnight dixville notch hart s location and millsfield we will have 100 percent coverage in our state every polling place in town and ward will be visited by someone from the department of justice macdonald said macdonald said if the election hotline is tied up residents should call the ag s main number 271 3658 according to published reports the phone number for iowa precinct leaders to report their caucus results was posted on a fringe internet message board on monday night along with encouragement to clog the lines the jammed phone lines that left some caucus managers on hold for hours may have in part been a result of prank calls iowa party officials said an iowa democratic party official said the influx of calls to the reporting hotline included supporters of president trump who called to express their displeasure with the democratic party in 2002 gop aides engineered the jamming of phone lines to campaign offices for u s sen jeanne shaheen in new hampshire two gop staffers went to federal prison and the state republican party settled a lawsuit by paying the state democratic party 125 000 you would pick up and they would hang up recalled kathy sulliavan who was then state democratic chair it interfered greatly with the get out the vote efforts assistant u s attorney mark zuckerman said federal prosecutors stand ready to assist macdonald if an election dispute has a federal law component scanlan said the campaigns or party officials have concerns about voting irregularities afterward rooms have been reserved in the state house where political staffers can congregate on wednesday in the event something significant happens we intend to be transparent scanlan said former state lawmaker jim splaine the portsmouth democrat who authored the last major change to the state s first in the nation primary law agreed tuesday s primary will be nothing like iowa here no voter has to explain or justify his or her vote to anyone else nor can be bullied into submission by the loudest voice in the room we can vote our conscience our gut our personal beliefs splaine said if history is any indication our voters will turn out in greater numbers than in iowa or any other state that is yet to come some election security experts have maintained new hampshire should do more routine audits of the accuvote machines that automatically count the ballots in two thirds of communities the machines which tabulate about 85 percent of the state s total votes date to the 1990s this is the first election in which new laws take effect that equate the act of taking a ballot with becoming a resident sununu championed the measures after the 2016 election in which he alleged that some out of state college students and others had cast ballots here until this new law new hampshire was the only state in the country that didn t connect voting to residency the laws are now being challenged in court by lawyers for state democrats and civil libertarians gardner and macdonald said local election officials have been briefed about those changes he denied the claims of several democratic presidential candidates that the new definition intimidates young voters the way people register to vote the way they voted all the forms it is the same gardner said i am very
