question a number of conservative religious groups are asking in the wake of the nearly nationwide shutdown sparked by the coronavirus crisis loading april 6 2020 it s one of the most fraught questions for people of faith during the pandemic should we go to church in florida last week a sheriff arrested the pastor of a megachurch for violating a local shutdown order days later the governor exempted houses of worship when he issued a statewide stay at home order we ve got to understand when god is in control of our life then we can rest in the fact that we know that god said pastor darlene bishop driscoll during her march 29 sermonat an ohio megachurch that continues to meet ok so they call us stupid that s ok more than 80 of u s houses of worship have stopped meeting in person alabama texas and missouri however issued executive orders that include places of worship as essential services other states offer similar exemptions for religious gatherings few of the public health measures put in place around the country hit as close to home for people of faith as restrictions on when and how congregations can gather says dallas attorney brad nitschke and the tension between the first amendment s protection of the free exercise of religion and recommendations of public health authorities is clearly top of mind for elected officials as well rusty reno has been a bit alarmed over the past few weeks as both civil and religious authorities began to restrict the number of people who can gather together to pray the catholic theologian and conservative political thinker bristled when the new york archdiocese shut down most services over three weeks ago in response to the coronavirus crisis even though democratic gov andrew cuomo s executive order stated that houses of worship were not ordered closed i mean right now i m looking out of my window at the construction project on a very tall apartment building and it s ongoing says mr reno editor of first things a manhattan based journal published by the institute on religion and public life so the trades in new york got an exemption for construction projects the liquor stores are deemed essential services the hookah stores are deemed essential services he says so i still wish that the churches the leaders of the church had pressed for reasonable accommodations continues mr reno their concern especially now should be to sustain the spiritual health of those entrusted to their care he says editor s note as a public service we ve removed the paywallfor all our coronavirus coverage it s free it s been a refrain among a number of religious conservatives during the current contagion but last week after president donald trump warned americans that hard days lie ahead and his administration issued sobering projections of covid 19 s impact the nation s stay at home landscape began to change in unexpected ways last monday the sheriff in tampa florida arrested the pastor of an evangelical protestant megachurch charging him with unlawful assembly and violating the county s emergency public health rules on wednesday police in lakewood new jersey broke up a funeral for a hasidic rabbi charging 15 people with violating democratic gov phil murphy s executive order banning large gatherings this ban applies to everyone said ocean county prosecutor bradley billhimer in a statement to be blunt ignoring the governor s order places lives at risk not just the lives of everyday citizens but the lives of our brave men and women in law enforcement who are required to respond in order to break up these unlawful gatherings as more states began to issue versions of stay at home orders responding to president trump s warning that the country would have a rough two weeks ahead many have listed places of worship as essential services exempt from bans on public gatherings in florida republican gov ron desantis issued a new statewide order that listed essential activities including religious services in effect superseding the local health rules behind the arrest of the tampa pastor last week alabama texas and missouri issued executive orders that include places of worship as essential services michigan too exempts places of religious worship from penalty and kansas exempts activities necessary to preserve constitutional or legal rights including to perform or attend religious or faith based services or activities and manufacture or sell firearms few of the public health measures put in place around the country hit as close to home for people of faith as restrictions on when and how congregations can gather says dallas attorney brad nitschke a partner with jackson walker and the tension between the first amendment s protection of the free exercise of religion and recommendations of public health authorities is clearly top of mind for elected officials as well the vast majority of the nation s houses of worship including most catholic dioceses and evangelical protestant congregations have already stopped meeting in person according to a march survey by the american enterprise institute still about 12 of americans who attend a church temple synagogue or mosque say their congregations still continue to meet as before public health officials including the federal centers for disease control and prevention have urged communities of all kinds to avoid gathering in groups in an effort to stem the spread of covid 19 and alleviate the strain on the health care system some of these congregations have downplayed such warnings and many maintain a skepticism toward secular science and a deep suspicion of the encroaching power of government regulations some too express confidence in divine protection from what could be a moment of reckoning for the country we ve got to understand when god is in control of our life then we can rest in the fact that we know that god said pastor darlene bishop driscoll during her march 29 sermon at solid rock church in monroe ohio a multiservice megachurch that has continued to meet ok so they call us stupid that s ok later in the sermon she claimed the pandemic in which 1 3 million people worldwide have been diagnosed is god punishing the u s for legalizing abortion in the 1970s earlier in the week a local health commissioner sent solid rock a letter noting the complaints from those in the surrounding community many worried about the church s large gatherings ohio like other states has also exempted places of worship from stay at home health directives bringing together a large number of people during a pandemic increases the pace at which the virus spreads overwhelming our hospital systems and posing a significant risk to members within the congregation the commissioner s letter said echoing the guidelines given by the trump administration and the cdc in a statement solid rock church responded as christians we are charged by jesus christ to obey the laws of our land therefore if the laws of our nation should ever change with respect to our first amendment right to assemble thereby restricting us from having our church doors open we will willingly comply such postures during the crisis could do lasting harm to the cause of religious freedom long a central concern for many republicans and religious conservatives says robin fretwell wilson associate dean for public engagement and a professor at the university of illinois college of law as a legal issue professor wilson cites supreme court precedent that permits certain restrictions of religious expressions so long as they are applied neutrally to everyone religious liberty does not mean every citizen can become a law unto himself she says at the same time congress and dozens of states have also instituted religious freedom restoration acts which demand authorities present both a compelling government interest for any religious restrictions and if they do these must be the least restrictive possible but at a time like this in a crisis that affects all of us religious people should have to cooperate with the program just like everybody else says professor wilson who has helped the fairness for all initiative that works to bridge the divides between advocates of religious freedom and lgbtq rights every religious person cannot simply say nope not me they could then be like a traveling bubble of contagion like typhoid mary mr reno at first things however sees a deeper theological problem with the country s virtual shutdown and is concerned that damaging changes could outlast the pandemic get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox it s the modern conceit that we can control the time and the hour of death mr reno says people are anguished by the
