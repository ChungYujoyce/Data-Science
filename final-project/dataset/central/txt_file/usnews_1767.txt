sometimes kamala harris wakes up in the middle of the night because there s something on her mind did anybody get back to so and so how is my stepdaughter adjusting to her apartment in new york city sometimes those early morning moments are her only chance as the junior senator from california and a top democratic presidential candidate to think through the events of the past day oh i worry she says i worry sitting at a table upstairs from the stage where she s just held a town hall in waterloo iowa harris begins to laugh that deep body shaking laugh of hers let me just tell you i was born worrying i had a mother who worried i had a grandmother who worried it s kind of in my blood that jolt awake at 3 a m has become harris campaign theme the crux of her wandering stump speech what wakes the american people at 3 a m she says is not ideological mudslinging but practical concerns holding down a job getting through a health crisis weathering hurricanes and tornadoes harris 3 a m agenda as she calls it is the backbone of her campaign s policy approach a road map of solutions for the middle class but so far it has failed to get much traction at a time when the electorate is looking for sharp definitions and ambitious visions her emphasis strikes some democrats as vague and noncommittal and so harris is here in iowa trying to regain her footing in the race after a promising start in january her campaign has stalled while she is in the competition for the nomination she s stuck in the mid single digits in most national and early state polls and draws modest crowds perhaps three dozen people showed up to see her in waterloo where they were packed into a few rows in front of the stage so that the large room an ornate century old former department store wouldn t look so empty in mid september harris said she d be focusing on the first to vote caucus state it was something of an unwitting announcement she was overheard in washington joking to a colleague i m f cking moving to iowa at least a staffer quipped she didn t say i m moving to f cking iowa her campaign is doubling its staff in the state to more than 130 people and she has pledged to visit every week for the foreseeable future i m really excited about it she tells me saying the opportunity to engage in old school retail politics reminds her of her san francisco political roots i like people people like harris too they just can t quite place her like the acquaintance you recognize but can t recall how you met she seems both familiar and yet mysterious is she a liberal or a moderate establishment or populist reformer or radical critics point out that she has flip flopped or obfuscated her positions on important policy issues like health care and immigration and the speeches she could use to define herself often devolve into paeans to unity for all that however harris remains in the hunt she consistently polls among the top five candidates in the jumbled democratic field and she has the financial resources to remain viable her campaign raised 11 6 million in the quarter ending sept 30 a respectable haul although far short of what some other front runners pulled in as more long shot candidates bow out of the race campaign officials expect harris to benefit from voters renewed focus with a little luck they say she still has a fairly clear path to the nomination among the top polling democrats some churn seems inevitable former vice president joe biden remains the apparent front runner but his unsteady debate performances and shambling campaign have many insiders convinced he s on the brink of collapse when and if that happens the next leading candidates elizabeth warren and bernie sanders could face a rebellion from mainstream democrats who see them as too left wing in such a world harris would be well positioned as the alternative a practical idealist with undeniable political skills and a respected track record of problem solving rather than grandstanding as a 54 year old black woman she also offers a compelling profile for democrats hungry for diversity and fresh faces among the top tier candidates who also include pete buttigieg she is one of two women and the only person of color and she s younger than the three septuagenarian front runners by a decade and a half meanwhile as the democrat controlled house of representatives moves toward impeachment another piece of harris record may supercharge her candidacy in the coming months her background in law enforcement at a time when liberals are clamoring to make the criminal justice system less punitive her record as a district attorney and state attorney general has been a liability but in this new political climate voters may relish the idea of seeing harris with her icy prosecutor s glare square off against president trump on the national stage this guy has completely trampled on the rule of law avoided consequence and accountability under law she says of the president for all the sh t people give me for being a prosecutor listen i believe there should be accountability and consequence harris lives in los angeles now where her husband of five years entertainment lawyer douglas emhoff is based l a is only the latest of many places she s put down roots she tells me in an interview in a law office on the city s west side but home to her always conjures memories of a berkeley duplex where she lived with her mother and sister above a nursery school born in oakland harris had an itinerant childhood moving from california to illinois to wisconsin to montreal as her parents pursued academic careers her mother and father were both immigrants who came to the u s to attend the university of california berkeley shyamala gopalan harris mother came from india to get a ph d in nutrition and endocrinology while donald harris her father came from jamaica to study economics as a result most of harris family members were overseas she learned like many children of immigrants that family and community aren t necessarily something you are born into they are something you make her memories are replete with references to surrogate grandmas and second mothers godparents and godchildren aunts and uncles none of whom are related harris parents met in the 1960s in the civil rights movement both were members of a small group of students who met to discuss black consciousness and liberation they were unabashedly radical the group s heroes were malcolm fidel che says aubrey labrie a leader of the group some in the group were involved in the founding of the black panther party he says now in his 80s with graying braids and a voice made hoarse by parkinson s labrie remembers harris parents as committed activists joining in a protest of the local woolworth s to express solidarity with a sit in at a segregated lunch counter at a woolworth s in the south gopalan who died of cancer in 2009 was very feisty strong willed very assertive he says harris recalls being steeped in her parents activism in speeches she says she remembers being surrounded by a bunch of adults who spent all their time marching and shouting for justice once she told me she came down the stairs of her childhood house in berkeley to see free bobby carved in wet cement after the black panther leader bobby seale was arrested she was also on the front lines in her own way in 1970 when she entered first grade harris was in the second class of children to be bused across town to integrate an elementary school that had previously been 95 white it was a 40 minute journey each way she did not at the time understand that she was a pawn in grownups sociopolitical experimentation a lack of trauma that she jokes presents a challenge in politics people are like tell us your suffering tell us how hard it was she says but i was raised by proud people i was raised to know and believe we had everything we needed it s easy to see how this upbringing shaped harris standing as an outsider someone who had to convince others she belonged no matter where she was but she was the kind of outsider who was determined to get inside she was always trying to find commonalities even as she was aware of the difficulty of making herself understood in different contexts the reality is that when you are the so called minority she says you learn many languages necessarily while others including her own mother and sister a former american civil liberties union leader sought to protest and advocate from outside harris worked to find her way into institutions where no one like her had ever been in charge after graduating from howard university the historically black college in washington d c and the university of california s hastings college of the law she became a prosecutor first at the da s office in oakland s alameda county and then in san francisco in 2003 when harris announced she would run for san francisco da against her former boss many of her liberal friends balked lateefah simon who had worked with harris to get police and prosecutors to treat underage girls in the sex trade as victims rather than criminals remembers telling harris she was disappointed by her decision but harris was unfazed she d say are you going to be outside all the time with a bullhorn or are you going to be inside deeply in the face of folks with decisionmaking power simon remembers to harris simon recalls the way to make change was not to protest the system but to take it over harris underdog campaign did better than expected partly as a result of her relationship with her former boyfriend willie brown the legendary california politician who was then speaker of the state assembly harris had cultivated a strong fundraising base among the city s wealthy socialites brown 30 years her senior and technically still married had also appointed harris to boards and introduced her to his political network when they were dating in the 1990s sparking accusations of nepotism but harris campaign was also uniquely her own she put down her headquarters in one of the city s poorest black neighborhoods pounded the pavement and used an ironing board as a standing desk she ran on a platform of restoring competence to the bumbling department and relentlessly criticized the incumbent for his low conviction rate for major crimes she won in a landslide the law is written in black and white but prosecutors have tremendous discretion to shape the way it is applied it s a prosecutor who decides to put sex workers in jail while letting their customers off it s a prosecutor who decides that a white teenager who kills is a good kid who deserves a second chance but that a black teenager who commits the same crime is a predator who should be locked up for life it s a prosecutor who often decides that a woman who reports rape just doesn t seem believable even when there s physical evidence it was a prosecutor who decided in 2008 that jeffrey epstein deserved essentially house arrest for the serial sexual abuse of dozens of young women modern reformers seeking to curtail mass incarceration increasingly argue that no amount of policy reform will fix a system whose decisionmakers are vulnerable to certain blind spots when harris took over as da simon remembers her pointing out all the framed photos of past das along a wall the portraits were all of white men until her face appeared at the end of the line a 40 year old black woman it would not be easy to bring a new perspective inside the system just a few months into her tenure as san francisco da a young gang member killed a san francisco cop in the same rough neighborhood where she d headquartered her campaign harris who had run on her opposition to capital punishment announced she would not seek the death penalty the decision sparked a major controversy that some thought would end her political career before it started from the pulpit at the officer s funeral both california s senior senator dianne feinstein and the head of the police union called for the death penalty as harris sat stunned in the audience she stuck by her decision in the face of the firestorm ultimately securing a sentence of life without parole a couple of years later as a wave of homicides swept the city harris again saw her convictions tested while other elected officials proposed putting more cops on the street and beefing up gang enforcement she wanted a new approach instead of just accepting these statistics and reacting i asked my team to tell me who are the homicide victims under the age of 25 she says both the victims and the perpetrators they discovered had something in common more than 90 were high school dropouts many started missing class in elementary school quickly falling too far behind to ever catch up seeing an opening harris began sending notices to the families of chronically truant kids in meetings her office s representatives outlined the services that might help the family but also reminded them that parents whose kids didn t go to school were committing a crime and could be subject to fines and arrest even some members of harris own staff considered her approach overly threatening to struggling families but harris blazed ahead she said to me people will stop for a stray dog before they will stop for a black child alone in the middle of the day recalls simon the former colleague the thought of it still fills harris with fury people had no expectations from these children she says they had no understanding of the capacity of these children the system was not responding to what was in my mind a crisis we improved attendance by over 30 no parent ever went to jail it was about what i could do in my limited capacity based on the position i had the controversy still dogs harris however exhibit a for liberals who say she punished those she should have been trying to help when simon expressed her doubts harris would remind her of all the funerals she d attended for all the people you ve buried was anybody ever held accountable the women raped and left for dead on street corners who is going to see them black people want law enforcement says simon who considers herself a prison abolitionist we just don t want them to kill our children after two terms as da harris ran for state attorney general winning a close race against the republican da of los angeles as attorney general she went after big banks and the pharmaceutical industry for profit colleges and oil companies she refused to defend the voter approved proposition 8 banning gay marriage paving the way for the supreme court s 2015 decision legalizing it and she created a bureau of children s justice to oversee children s services but she also backed down from many fights declining to endorse ballot initiatives that would have reformed the three strikes law and ended the death penalty she even appealed a federal court decision striking down the death penalty as unconstitutional successfully reinstating a penalty she claimed to oppose criminal justice reformers charge that harris is cautious at best and hypocritical at worst an ambitious pol who wants to have it both ways and lacks the guts to pursue bold reforms a new wave of progressive das like philadelphia s larry krasner has gone much further than harris ever did with initiatives like restricting the use of cash bail which reformers say unfairly penalizes the poor while allowing the rich to buy their way out of jail there s sort of a laundry list for what it means to be a progressive prosecutor and she doesn t check a single one of the boxes says lara bazelon a professor at the university of san francisco school of law at least she didn t when she was an actual prosecutor and she was in a position to do something to make the system more fair harris bazelon notes dismissed the idea of legalizing marijuana as recently as 2014 but now that it s popular she supports it that seems to be a theme once she s not in any sort of political risk and there s a consensus that a reform is a good thing she s behind it bazelon said but when it s time to be bold and do the right thing she doesn t since her election to the senate in 2016 harris has thrilled liberal audiences with her punishing interrogations of trump administration officials she made former attorney general jeff sessions blanch and supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh squirm and in may she deftly filleted the current attorney general william barr asking him has the president or anyone at the white house ever asked or suggested that you open an investigation of anyone barr was reduced to stuttering he wouldn t or couldn t answer in recent weeks the clip has gone viral again as new questions have arisen about barr s involvement in the president s political pressuring of foreign governments sitting in the office in los angeles harris says she asked that question on a prosecutor s hunch it has become clear to me that these are the kinds of questions you have to ask members of this administration she says what kind of unethical requests has this president made of you i knew by instinct and by example that it is not beyond him to think that america s justice system is his personal apparatus for political gain he s made that quite clear now that the process to impeach trump is under way something harris called for but not until several other candidates beat her to it many liberals fantasize about her as the prosecutor of the impeachment trial in the senate the harris they see in those hearings is the harris they crave sharp ruthless oppositional unfortunately for her campaign ethics rules prevent her from using those clips to raise money but that s not the harris they get on the campaign trail presidential candidate harris wants to be about unity about uplift about bringing people together around not a particular agenda but a sense of who we are campaigning to fix what keeps people up at night she might just cure america s insomnia by putting us to sleep with platitudes various commentators have found harris elusive and she can be hard to pin down on policy positions early in her presidential campaign she called for abolishing private health insurance then took it back then later released a health care plan that would be government run but allow for both public and private health insurance in the first debate harris scored a clean hit on biden with her attack on his opposition to federally mandated busing in the 1970s and surged in the polls but in the ensuing days she couldn t definitively describe her own position on busing when i asked her what ought to be done about the ongoing segregation of public schools she spent several minutes discussing the need to speak the truth about all of this before finally settling on a prescription to deal with this issue she said we need to collect the data and then we need to expose it by upbringing and orientation harris seems to have a strong sense of right and wrong and a fierce drive to fight injustice coupled with virtually no large scale policy instincts presented with a problem she looks for ways to solve it starting with data guided by few firm ideological convictions all these grand ideas that academics and so many have about how you re going to transform the world she says but you know pay attention to the basics perhaps in these days of brutal ideological combat that kind of pragmatism could be sold as refreshing but in harris case it seems to be having the opposite effect some of the attendees at her events in iowa told me they don t think she s progressive enough others said she strikes them as too far left she hasn t gone far enough to get the activists behind her but she s gone too far for some of the moderates says larry gerston a professor emeritus of political science at san jose state university so she s in kind of a no person s land in terms of having a good base and yet polls indicate that democratic voters still want to like her if only they can figure out what she s about the race is far from over iowa voters are notorious for shopping around until the end on a clear early fall day more than 100 people have come to hear harris speak in a pub in coralville i like biden but i want someone new says 71 year old jane carlson a retired university worker i don t want yesterday i want tomorrow harris bounds onto the stage all gleaming smiles and upbeat energy so i m moving here she says with a big laugh and then turns serious we are at an inflection moment in the history of our country she tells the crowd a moment in time requiring us to look in the mirror and ask a question that question being who are we while harris is still speaking a few people begin to trickle out the back of the venue elizabeth warren is holding an event a little ways down the road they tell me and they don t want to miss it with reporting by lissandra villa washington this appears
