 domenico montanaro donald trump s missteps since the conventions have put hillary clinton in a dominant position if the election were held today according to the latest npr analysis of polling demographics and on the ground reporting clinton would win in a landslide of 2008 proportions she has solidified her leads in key battleground states and crosses the threshold of 270 electoral votes needed to win the white house in the npr battleground map with just states where she already has a significant lead in other words she could lose all of the toss up states ohio florida north carolina iowa nevada and georgia yes georgia now and still win as you can see in the map above 273 174 trump has battled a litany of bad headlines including feuding with a family whose army captain son was killed in iraq declined to support before endorsing key republicans like house speaker paul ryan joked that second amendment people could do something about clinton and charged that president obama and clinton founded isis he even said he wanted a crying baby taken out of a rally after a minute earlier saying he liked it he later said he would sponsor it and the baby will sing someday in philharmonic hall he said it has meant that key voting groups have moved more toward hillary clinton npr s asma khalid for example reported on how white college educated voters are converting to clinton that s a demographic found in important places like the suburbs of philadelphia denver and northern virginia it s been about the worst month any republican who wants trump to win could have feared clinton 363 174 that s pretty close to barack obama s 2008 margin of 365 173 over john mccain that might be if not the high water mark for clinton pretty darn close to it there aren t a lot more states that could go her way of course few things are likely to remain constant almost three months out from election day and this is just a look at where things stand now the next big chances trump has to change the dynamics are the debates the first is sept 26 on long island n y followed by the vice presidential debate oct 4 in virginia then the second presidential one oct 9 in st louis and the final debate 10 days later in las vegas overall most of our adjustments favored clinton including moving the key state of pennsylvania back into the lean d column from tossup where it stood for a month there is almost no path for trump without pennsylvania we also moved three traditionally red states in clinton s direction georgia to tossup from lean r utah to lean r from likely r and one electoral vote in nebraska to tossup from lean r georgia has seen massive demographic change over the past decade going from two thirds white in 2000 to 53 47 percent white to nonwhite now remember obama only lost it by 5 points in 2008 some polls are actually showing clinton in the lead though both are only in the low 40s history says this one likely moves back to the republican column but for now it s a tossup in utah another poll showed clinton and trump within a couple points of each other there are still a huge number of undecided voters how much of a factor gary johnson will be is a key question if he can get to the high teens or 20 points there s a path for clinton to win it while we re talking about johnson it would be very interesting to see polling in montana a place that has a big libertarian streak and that went for bill clinton in 1992 when ross perot got more than a quarter of the vote in the state and in nebraska it splits its votes out by congressional district obama won the omaha area district which is far more nonwhite than the rest of the state in 2008 the democratic house incumbent brad ashford is favored there and omaha based billionaire warren buffett is promising to help clinton there let s see where this one moves in the next month or so despite trump s bad three weeks he has seemed to hold up in a couple of states that were lean d florida and nevada they ve moved to tossup now as more polling has come out given demographics and clinton s turnout operation both states it could be argued are favorable for clinton but the rnc which is supplementing trump s on the ground operation has moved staff to florida to try to save the state clinton 273 174 safe d 164 california 55 connecticut 7 delaware 3 hawaii 4 illinois 20 maine
