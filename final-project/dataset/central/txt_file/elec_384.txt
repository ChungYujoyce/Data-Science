barring some explosive last minute scandalous revelation brett kavanaugh will be confirmed by the u s senate attracting a couple of republicans to turn thumbs down on the judge seems increasingly remote nothing that either maine republican sen susan collins or alaska s sen lisa murkowskihave done or saidsuggests that either of them will jump ship nonetheless democratic activists have been hounding senate minority leader chuck schumer to coerce west virginia s sen joe manchin sen heidi heitkamp from north dakotaand indiana s sen joe donnelly into falling on their swords by voting against kavanaugh such acts of self sacrifice would be unimaginable in today s senate where careers are not tossed away lightly and even in the unlikely event that schumer could persuade these democrats to walk the plank the party would end up being far worse off than it is now given the robust margins by which trump won the states of the three senate democrats voters there are likely to heed the urging of the president to defeat those who oppose his supreme court nominee it is also a certainty that if manchin heitkampand donnelly stick with their fellow democrats trump will make multiple appearances in their states to campaign for their republican opponents it takes nothing away from the political skill and adroitness of the three vulnerable senators to conclude that simply voting against kavanaugh would make an uphill struggle even steeper the causes of democratic anxiety about the likely rulings of kavanaugh on such subjects as roe v wade as sacred precedent or the continuance of the affordable care act are legitimate those are potential perils to be sure but the peculiar chemistry of the u s supreme court is not easy to predict sensing that a too sharp turn to the right will cause dysfunction on the high court may cause chief justice roberts to adjust his own behavior these concerns of course are in the realm of speculation what is the more likely event is the defeat of three vulnerable democratic senators more kavanaugh would cement supreme court support for an oppressed minority corporations if brett kavanaugh becomes a supreme court justice he ll finish what scott pruitt started supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh could deal death blow to obamacare if the democrats were able to hold down their losses in the worst midterm environment in decades it would serve as a constraint on the republican majority that would be especially significantif as many predict the democrats become the majority in the house to be sure the filibuster can no longer be used to block nominations but it retains considerable vitality as a device to gain concessions from the majority on legislation subtract a handful of democrats and that influence diminishes and along with it the ability to thwart trump s legislative agenda in the eyes of many democratic party activists of course votes for confirmation by the three endangered senators and a few others somewhat less vulnerable would be selling out for the cheapened coin of incumbency it is awkward to attack arguments in favor of political valor but it is unrealistic to demand self immolation of politicians especially in a what seems obviously to be a losing cause pressure on sen schumer from rank and file democrats to scuttle the trump agenda in congress has been fierce and unrelenting and one of the responsibilities of a senate leader is to listen to the demands of the party s most loyal adherents and contributors and heed them if possible but it is also important that he manage the expectations of party loyalists and dissuade them from pressing for objectives that are unattainable one such objective is the defeat of the kavanaugh nomination it is not worth the loss of seats that will cost his party current influence and move it further away from a future majority ross k bakeris a distinguished professor of political science at rutgers university and a member ofusa today s board of contributors follow him on twitter rosbake1
