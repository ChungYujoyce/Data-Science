we ve probably all got somebody on our friends list who s been sharing a lot of suspect information about the coronavirus the component pseudo facts of conspiracy theories are floating around facebook in abundance and it s super frustrating to see them rebroadcast by people you know and love you may be tempted to unfriend them or ignore their posts both valid options should you choose to take them but when it comes to pushing back against misinformation you have more power than you think yes even the ones posting nonsense on your facebook wall chances are you are somebody s most trusted source amid the rapid spread of the plandemic video many posted it while admitting they weren t sure about the claims it made but found they seemed important or sought to ask their more well informed friends for their opinions the implied message in posting anything to social media is that we want to hear what others think about it with that trust comes both power and responsibility think about how fans listen to celebrities even when said celebrities have no authority relevant to the subject they re speaking on there are plenty of smaller scale examples of this phenomenon in every community as we all have people we respect and whose opinions we give extra weight to maybe that s your rabbi your doctor your mom your yoga teacher that coworker who always hears the best gossip first and is somehow always right about it sometimes you don t ever know that you re that friend for somebody but they ve been listening closely to what you say all along these days if you re in a medical profession or if you re particularly good at staying on top of the news you re pretty much guaranteed to be in somebody s pantheon of trusted sources people are listening to you even if you don t realize it someone who has totally bought in to a conspiracy theory isn t going to be easily swayed no matter how thoughtful your response they ll just dig in harder after all the hallmark of a conspiracy theory is that it persists no matter the evidence there are real reasons to distrust governments and corporations there really are plenty of but when you have a conversation about misinformation your audience isn t just the person you re speaking to on facebook for example hundreds of people might see the post without commenting and without you necessarily knowing it your friends their friends members of a group that you both belong to for this reason i prefer to keep conversations about misinformation public if somebody dms you and wants to know more seriously consider how useful the conversation is going to be if they re mad and just want to fight it s not worth your time if they are a person important to you and you think you might be able to change their mind it s your call another thing about those sometimes invisible onlookers most of them have probably not bought into the latest wacky theory they just don t say much about it either way to use a different example anti vaccine posts may outnumber posts that sing the praises of vaccines that s because most people get their kids vaccinated and don t make a big deal about it they don t post about it any more than they d post hey look i brushed my teeth today so if you see a lot of misinformation out there don t get too discouraged some misinformation can be addressed on a factual basis if somebody tells you that covid 19 cases are falling in your state you can show them the actual numbers if they say the cdc says something false you can point out on the cdc website where it actually says the opposite when it s a simple claim like this facts work but most of the time the person who brings up misinformation is more swayed by tone or implications than the actual facts before you get too deep into the details ask them a few open ended questions and listen really listen to their answers you won t necessarily ask them in those exact words but ask this is where you ll learn that they re actually concerned about something other than the particular news story they posted they may actually have a serious worry about their family their health or their job and don t be afraid to share your own history and concerns if they learn how you came to your conclusions it may help them change their own you keep the most credibility when you re respectful and honest in the most scarily effective propaganda the talking head is calm and collected speaking with a laid back authority good propaganda artists speak softly and let everyone else get angry and frustrated take plandemic for example there s a video out there that claims to show a scientist being silenced by the government i keep but there s another reason to stay calm remember these people are your friends and friends of friends and whoever else is watching people mostly just want to be understood and have their concerns heard so be nice to your friends if you re going to drop a link debunking the thing they post about consider the tone of the article you choose we wrote our plandemic post with this kind of person in mind someone who saw the video and found it convincing can read our piece and not feel insulted most of the people you re talking to are probably smart and basically good people and be honest if you don t know an answer say so rather than making something up if you changed your mind about something in the past talk about why that was and if you agree with some parts of what your friend is saying point out those areas of agreement for more on how to talk to people about misinformation check out this piece from liz neeley about talking to friends about coronavirus this one from tara haelle about pushing back on propaganda like plandemic and the last several pages of the conspiracy theory handbook nobody likes to feel like they were sucked in by propaganda but ironically a lot of propaganda will tell you that you the viewer are clearly thinking for yourself if you read this article or watch that video it s all those other sources that are the real propaganda it s true that a little critical thinking goes a long way some questions that you can ask yourself and that you can encourage your friends to ask include here s the thing about a pandemic it s everywhere everybody wants to read something reassuring you don t have to spend hours of your life on trying to convince people sometimes your good deed can be just piping in with a quick opinion just to let onlookers know that not everybody agrees maybe you have a link or a quick fact to share or maybe just an opinion i saw that story and didn t find it credible here s what you do this way you won t get notifications that pull you back into the conversation do your best not to go back and check for replies either your job here is done that quick comment probably won t change anybody s mind but it could change the tone of the resulting conversation and who knows it might get somebody to do a little critical thinking on their own beth is
