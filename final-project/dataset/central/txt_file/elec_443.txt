in ohio joe raedle getty images hide caption olin dale clayton waits for bernie sanders before a january event in iowa with the united steelworkers local 310l sanders hopes his strength with white working class men can help him win in ohio when bernie sanders won the primary in michigan last week it shook up the narrative of the democratic race sanders did so with the help of white men if he s able to pull off a victory in ohio the same demographic will likely be key take jim who describes himself only half jokingly as an angry white man we re pissed off jim said jim s asked that his last name be withheld because his union afscme has endorsed hillary clinton and he supports sanders he can t be quoted publicly going against his union we haven t gotten raises our pensions have been cut our healthcare s increased and jim added sanders speaks to that bernie he speaks from the trenches jim said we feel that he s fighting for us in michigan sanders won with the support of 62 percent of white men who were one in three voters according to exit polls in 2008 in the democratic primary in ohio white men turned out in strikingly similar proportions to this year s michigan contest at the same time black voters could make up a smaller proportion of the electorate and likely won t be enough to put clinton over the top in michigan clinton won more than two thirds of black voters and they were 21 percent of the electorate in 2008 barack obama won nearly 90 percent of black voters in ohio they were just 18 percent of the electorate and clinton won the state ironically with the support of white voters including white men ryan a member of a building trades union in cleveland who also asked npr not to use his last name because his union has endorsed clinton feels the same way as jim she s clinton seen as the centrist candidate ryan said and she s a big money candidate and big money and centrism hasn t been working for middle class america for the past 30 years since reagan when ryan first saw sanders speak a few months ago something clicked he said it was as if a politician was finally saying what ryan had been thinking about the state of the country ryan was so swayed he even sent a small donation to sanders campaign and later bought a t shirt like nascar everyone wear their patch sanders won 62 percent of white men in michigan while clinton won 68 percent of blacks voters who lived in union households were split between the candidates likely because of black union members domenico montanaro 2016 2008 exit polls hide caption at a union hall in cleveland both jim and ryan talked about rising health care costs and trade deals that they believe have hurt much more than they helped sanders overwhelmingly won voters in michigan who thought trade deals cost american jobs 58 percent of voters said so there and sanders won them 2 to 1 one in three michigan voters said they lived in a household with a union member clinton and sanders split them likely accounting for that were black union members who went for clinton those numbers are not split out in exit polls jim said he s only gotten one raise really more like a cost of living adjustment in eight years you look at the stock market he said it s gone up i don t know how many a couple of hundred percent you know my wages have gone up 2 and a half percent and who s speaking to that bernie is and yeah i think maybe he s kind of like don quixote but i mean that s part of the attraction it really is at least for me and jim insists this isn t about gender he loves his congresswoman who incidentally endorsed sanders on friday there are elements of clinton s stump speech designed to speak to working class men including the parts where she talks about punishing companies that ship jobs overseas but it s clear from these interviews that sanders attacks on clinton s trade record her superpac her big money speeches to wall street banks they are breaking through the money issue nags at dave passalacqua he likes that sanders gets his campaign cash from regular people there s that old saying is politicians should be like nascar everyone wear their patch passalacqua said you know let s see what the patches are and sanders doesn t need to wear a patch because it s his own thing pie in the sky passalacqua is executive vice president of the communications workers of america local 4340 in cleveland his union has endorsed sanders but he s still undecided passalacqua agreed to meet at a cleveland diner along with jim goggin a fixture in the city s labor community he s an organizer for the delaware valley health care coalition it s pie in the sky said goggin with an unmistakable irish lilt i mean everything bernie says i think would be fantastic but the fact of the matter is that i am also a realist and i know that you can t do that for goggin it is all about beating the republicans in november and i wish to god that i thought he could win goggin said but i don t unfortunately think he can win consequently i m with hillary because at least she s not going to throw us under the bus the working people passalacqua chimes in and one good thing that bernie s been doing though even with hillary is bernie has moved hillary s positions on things from the outside it seems passalacqua is having a classic voter s struggle between his head and his heart he isn t convinced sanders will be able to do what he s promising who will he vote for whoever i think is going best for me and my family is the bottom line whoever is going to make not to steal donald s line but america great again said pasalaqua quoting donald trump s catch phrase because in order to make america great again we ve got to make the middle class great again so whoever s going to do that i think s going to be the best person and that s who i ll end up having to vote for no matter how tuesday s vote turns out and no matter who wins the nomination all four men said they would support the democratic nominee
