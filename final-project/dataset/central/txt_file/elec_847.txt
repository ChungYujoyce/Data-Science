women could outnumber their white male colleagues in the house after november a recent study suggested republican candidate troy balderson has been taking on democrat danny o connor for a seat in the house of representatives ohio is one of the key battleground states in the mid terms mr trump tweeted congratulations to troy balderson on a great win in ohio a very special and important race despite this us news outlets have not called the contest yet the new york times gave mr balderson 50 2 a lead of 1 754 votes in the 12th congressional district race with all precincts reporting but thousands of absentee and provisional ballots are still outstanding which could lead mr o connor to force a recount he said we re not stopping now a provisional ballot is used to record a vote when there are questions about a voter s eligibility absentee ballots are cast by those unable to attend polling stations democrat house representative ben ray luj n said the seat should have been a slam dunk for the republicans and the closeness of the contest was an ominous sign for them in november mr trump won the 12th congressional district in 2016 by more than 11 percentage points mr balderson and mr o connor will have to fight the seat again in november it appears donald trump has had success in getting the candidates he endorsed nominated they include john james an african american republican who won the senate race nomination in michigan and key ally bill schuette who will take on ms whitmer for governor in the same state the kansas gubernatorial election has been rancorous for republicans mr trump s controversial endorsement of the hard right kris kobach over incumbent jeff colyer may have just about paid off mr kobach holds a lead of just under 200 votes with all precincts reporting but again provisional and other ballots are still outstanding and one interesting sidebar ron estes has beaten ron estes in a kansas republican primary the victorious incumbent congressman had to fund a campaign to spell out which candidate was which the beaten candidate was ron m estes his opponent said the m stood for misleading the beaten man s campaign was described by some analysts as not serious the winning ron estes took about 80 of the vote and will face democrat james thompson a supporter of bernie sanders in november all 435 house seats 35 of the 100 senate seats and 36 of 50 governor races are to be fought the democrats need to pick up 23 seats in the house to gain a majority with dozens of republican lawmakers retiring this year the minority party has a decent chance of taking over the house in the senate they need just two seats to take control but the republicans are tipped to retain their majority and perhaps even consolidate it a general opinion poll of voting intentions last friday suggested democrats were 6 1 percentage points ahead of republicans this is the first time the social media giant has said president trump s tweet could be misleading have you
