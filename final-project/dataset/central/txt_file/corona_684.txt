but the public remains stubbornly bad at learning exclusive the next wave the next wave the united nations is preparing to issue a major funding appeal for more than 1 5 billion on wednesday to prepare for outbreaks of the new coronavirus in areas suffering some of the worst humanitarian crises in the world including gaza myanmar syria south sudan and yemen according to diplomatic and relief officials familiar with the plan while all countries need to respond to covid 19 countries with existing humanitarian crisis are particularly vulnerable and will require all humanitarian partners to look at their existing operations to see how they can be reprioritized and adapted to tackle the virus according to a confidential draft global humanitarian response plan reviewed by foreign policy but the request which would be in addition to ongoing humanitarian operations comes at a time when the world s leading economies are reeling from the economic shock induced by one of the most virulent pandemics since the 1918 spanish flu u n and private relief officials expect it will be a major struggle to convince wealthy governments to open their pocketbooks some of the biggest donors are seeing

bangladesh s cox s bazar and kenya s dadaab camp to an archipelago of refugee camps for afghans syrians palestinians and others throughout the middle east we are facing a global health crisis unlike any in the 75 year history of the united nations one that is spreading human suffering infecting the global economy and upending people s lives u n secretary general ant nio guterres told reporters on thursday noting that a global recession of unprecedented scale is a near certainty we must recognize that the poorest countries and most vulnerable especially women will be the hardest hit if we let the virus spread like wildfires especially in the most vulnerable regions of the world it would kill millions moreover the effort to ramp up an international aid response is being hampered by the quest to ensure the safety of international staff those concerns have been amplified by the announcement last week that david beasley the executive director of the rome based world food program had been infected with the coronavirus some international relief agencies have recalled senior field officers fearing they could be infected many humanitarian operations are scaling back physical presence recommending their international staff return home and closing offices according to a march 19 report by the assessment capacities project a norwegian nonprofit that provides analysis of major humanitarian crises ongoing restriction of travel suspension and changes to scheduled flights is likely to continue to disrupt humanitarian operations it is making us preoccupied with ourselves jeremy konyndyk a senior policy fellow at the center for global development said at a march 19 panel hosted by the new humanitarian news agency in donor capitals the preoccupation is much more with the threats to their homelands konyndyk who worked on the response to the ebola epidemic in west africa for the u s agency for international development said that u n and relief agencies are having to balance ensuring the health of their own staff with delivering care to needy communities you would have a hard time designing a more dangerous setting for the spread of this disease than an informal idp settlement he said you have a crowded population very poor sanitation very poor disease surveillance very poor health services this could be extraordinarily dangerous and i don t think that s getting enough global attention yet a woman and child sit together at a makeshift camp for displaced yemenis in the northern hajjah province on dec 16 the coronavirus could have devastating

sudan s health care system has been completely destroyed over the last seven years by the civil war said sterling carter a former aid worker in south sudan after five years of war with millions of people on the brink of famine yemen s population is more vulnerable to a coronavirus outbreak than those of most other countries the conflict has left most of the country s population effectively immunocompromised one aid worker said you have to basically picture the already overwhelmed public health system overwhelmed further and then overlay a food security crisis on top of it said scott paul of the aid organization oxfam america it s hard to put into words how bad that ll be internally displaced persons prepare food at the korijo camp in south sudan on sept 23 2018 the country s civil war has caused its health care system to crumble over the past seven years making it particularly susceptible to the spread of the coronavirus sumy sadurni afp via getty images i see the spread of covid 19 in poor and fragile countries as a huge risk as their health care systems are often very weak said richard blewitt the u n representative for the international federation of red cross and red crescent societies at this time we need global and local solidarity and compassion with all those affected by covid 19 wherever they live the u n has provided guidance to u n field workers refugee camp managers and public health specialists on how to battle the spread of the virus the guidance produced this month by a u n interagency standing committee calls for the development of an outbreak readiness and response plan for each camp that would assess the risk of coronavirus infection and train staff to detect test and monitor its spread as well as track and trace those infected with the virus and people they have come into contact with wherever possible mitigation measures to reduce overcrowding should be put in place according to the guidance action should be taken to promote social distancing and crowd management particularly at times when basic necessities such as food and water are being distributed to prevent large gatherings of people each site should have access to a laboratory to facilitate testing but relief workers say that some of the recommendations like social distancing may not be feasible in some of the world s largest camps for many population groups living in overcrowded conditions social distancing is a challenge or impossible according to the assessment capacities project report many countries that host refugee camps such as afghanistan and bangladesh are likely to be overwhelmed by the health needs of their own citizens nations with weak health systems may struggle to screen test and contain the epidemic for the host population let alone the refugees according to the report in gaza the u n relief and works agency unrwa which provides primary care for about 70 percent of the territory s more than 1 8 million people is bracing for

running a public information program that encourages hand washing and the need for social distancing unrwa has set up a triage system to monitor patients with respiratory illness directing those suspected of having the coronavirus to the local hospitals it will also try to help lessen the burden on hospitals by taking in patients with illnesses unrelated to the coronavirus gaza s hospitals already under strain have only a fraction of the number of intensive care unit beds it would need to handle an outbreak i m told that there are 60 icu beds in the hospitals matthias schmale the director of gaza s unrwa operations told foreign policy if there is a full scale outbreak the hospital sector won t cope the crisis he added has inspired a bit of dark humor among palestinians in gaza who note one point of irony israel s crushing economic blockade on gaza is helping keep palestinians safe from the coronavirus which has already killed over 15 000 people worldwide but that s only for now and the humor he noted masks a deep anxiety we are preparing for the worst and hoping for the best he said in fact the west bank city of bethlehem had an outbreak of dozens of cases of the coronavirus earlier this month after members of a group of greek religious tourists were confirmed to have contracted it when they returned home the unprecedented nature of the pandemic has fueled calls for radical thinking about the international response to the coronavirus crisis the leaders of major relief organizations are pressing donors to grant them greater flexibility to redirect funding from existing programs that are likely to be paralyzed by the pandemic and use that money for programs including clean water and sanitation projects that could help stem the crisis jan egeland a former u n relief chief who heads the norwegian refugee council has appealed to some 40 donors to allow his agency to redirect money earmarked for shelter programs ground to a halt by the pandemic and to use it to expand sanitation and hygiene programs the international community needs to fundamentally rethink its funding priorities for the coronavirus and redirect foreign assistance to fighting the spread of the bug egeland said as bad as it is now in the well organized and affluent north with health systems good sanitation and big infrastructure imagine how it will be when it will hit crowded camps with refugees and displaced people said egeland who spoke by telephone from quarantine in norway the bardarash camp pictured oct 24 in dohuk iraq swells with syrian kurdish refugees byron smith getty images egeland also complained that sweeping u s and u n economic sanctions imposed on governments in iran north korea and venezuela are hampering relief efforts now is the time to lift sanctions i don t need a lot of sanctions legislation making it more difficult to work in the worst places on the planet where the covid virus will hit much harder than in new york oslo and in wuhan he said the call for ending sanctions comes as iran has pressed governments to violate the sanctions iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif tweeted on monday to thank those calling for sanctions relief and urge states and businesses to defy u s mass punishment u s is not listening impeding global fight against covid19 he wrote u s secretary of state mike pompeo defended the measures saying tehran squanders money that could be used to fight the pandemic to fund terrorist operations in the region he also said that iranian documents show their health companies have been able to import testing kits without obstacle from u s sanctions since january u s sanctions do not target imports of food medicine and medical equipment or other humanitarian goods pompeo added egeland acknowledged that most u n sanctions regimes including those for iran and north korea include exemptions for the import of humanitarian goods but the sanctions have scared financial institutions from providing vital financial services to relief agencies not a single bank had the guts to transfer money because they were all afraid to be sued by the u s government he said it remained unclear whether the u n appeal will be on top of previous appeals by u n agencies for funding to combat the virus the world health organization announced earlier this year that more than 675 million will be required through april including 61 million for its own activities to mount an international campaign against the virus though who s director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus said recently that more money would be needed on feb 17 unicef issued an urgent request for 42 3 million to support the coronavirus response it will be used to reduce transmission of the virus by promoting distance learning for kids who can t attend school and public information aimed at shooting down misinformation the u n secretary general along with the u n s emergency relief coordinator mark lowcock tedros and the executive director of unicef henrietta fore will launch the new appeal at a joint press teleconference on wednesday the u n will ask that donors not reduce funding from other vital humanitarian aid programs to fund the coronavirus response the new appeal aims at addressing the additional needs from the covid 19 pandemic while sustaining the ongoing humanitarian operations and life saving programmes responding to the needs pre dating the new emergency according to the draft plan this is essential to avoid further loss of lives and suffering and the aggravation of affected people s vulnerabilities guterres meanwhile expressed concern that the pandemic could claw back decades of efforts to raise international health standards and to scale back the most extreme levels of poverty and undercut u n sustainable development goals which are designed to improve the standard of living around the world by the year 2030 a 7 year old girl suffering from malnutrition lies on a bed at a makeshift camp for displaced yemenis in the northwestern hajjah province on sept 28 essa ahmed afp via getty images guterres pressed governments to mount a coordinated global health strategy ramping up health spending and pitching in to help poor countries he contended that global solidarity is not only a moral imperative it is in everyone s interests covid 19 is killing people as well as attacking the real economy at its core trade supply chains businesses jobs guterres said workers around the world could lose as much as 3 4 trillion countries must resist the temptation to erect protectionist trade walls and should take steps including waiving interest payments to poor countries offering debt relief and sharply cutting fees for migrants to send remittance payments to loved ones in their homelands he said we need to focus on people the most vulnerable low wage workers small and medium enterprises guterres said that means wage support insurance social protection preventing bankruptcies and job loss that also means designing fiscal and monetary responses to ensure that the burden does not fall on those who can least afford it the recovery must not come on the backs of the poorest and we cannot create a legion of new poor we need to get resources directly into the hands of people colum lynch is a senior staff writer atforeign policy twitter columlynch
