much he s part of a group of new hampshire clergy who have been meeting with white house hopefuls in an effort toinject faith based moral concerns into democratic presidential politics for the candidates these love 2020events offer a chance to getcozy with religious movers and shakers who they hope might sway some of the voters in their flocks mr hopkins wants to know what each candidate

care about the least among us sessionswith 11 democratic candidates and one republican former massachusetts gov bill weld were all open to the press accordingto love 2020 organizers but when mr buttigieg sat down with the group in earlyjanuary at st paul s church in downtown concord campaign staffers insisted that this reporter waitoutside despite having been invited to cover the event they gave no reason saying only thatthe meeting was private mr buttigieg an episcopalian is hardly shy about his christian faith which he often invokes on the campaign trail as a moral guide for shaping policy positions what s important to me is to make sure that i m engaging with faith leaders and with thosethat they guide and care for he said after the meeting as a black suv waited to whisk him to anashua town hall event with recent polls showing a tight race in new hampshire the campaign was perhaps takingno chances on a religion charged gaffe navigating the sensitive terrain where faith meets progressive politics is par for the course forlove 2020 a project of the granite state organizing project gsop which brings together religious leaders community organizers and labor unions to tackle issues such as immigration and economic justice it s an effort to connect clergy with candidates in a democratic party that s increasingly secular and cautiouslyexperimenting to find where faith fits if anywhere in its political mix for candidates courting clergy support is nothing new not even here in what is according togallup and the pew research center one of america s least religious states in 2008 then candidate barack obama s campaign team called on religious leaders individually according to the rev jason wells executive director of the newhampshire council of churches inspired by the outreach mr wells who wasthen a parish rector volunteered for mr obama by canvassing door to door in his time off this time around campaigns don t seem to be wooing faith leaders individually as they used to mr wells says indeed love 2020 was born to fill a void organizers say amid a growing dearth of meaningfuldialogue with candidates campaigns are often most concerned with preventing unscripted soundbites notes arnie alpert co director of the new hampshire program ofthe american friends service committee a quaker based activist organization for example when senator warren does her famous selfie line for photos her staff people take your phone from you andthen they take the selfie mr alpert says with a laugh what that does is keep you from using your phone to actually record theinteraction progressive faith leaders believe love 2020 provides a meaningfulalternative and they ve been working hard to secure a seat at the table in new hampshire they have raced sometimes with just a few hours notice to meet with candidates in churches barns anywhere theycan get a brief audience with the person who might be their next president they say they re trying to reframe what faith

biden have carved out time to meetwith the love 2020 group of clerics each of whom has a local followingand a measure of clout this spotlight on our state givesus a chance to influence the national dialogue saysgsop executive director sarah jane knoy to focus on our shared values andour common humanity because the current national dialogue is very divisive and i think really kind ofhateful for local religious leaders love 2020 also provides a platform to ask the kinds of values questions candidates don t always hear elsewhere in a video of the buttigieg session provided by love 2020

social fabric mr buttigieg responded that when he s campaigning his soul is just out there for everyone to see there is a crisis of belonging in our country that i think is propelling everything from thebrokenness of our politics to mental health issues including rising rates of suicide and drug addiction he told the group holding the american project together depends so much on whether we can create thatsense of belonging it may well be the most important function of the presidency the clergy also minister to the candidates they meet much as evangelical leaders have done whenlaying hands on president donald trump and praying for him mr hirschfeld led mr buttigieg and the assembled groupin prayer the rev sarah rockwell of st andrew s church in manchester offered another kind of spiritual support to mr buttigieg as henavigates the pressures and personal tolls of running for president keeping a marriage intact it is not easy ms rockwell quietly said to the candidate as they
