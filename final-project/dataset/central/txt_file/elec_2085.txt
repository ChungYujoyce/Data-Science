 apr 15 2016 at 6 34 pm by nate silver filed under 2016 election seth wenig ap secretary clinton cleaned our clock in the deep south no question about it bernie sanders said during thursday night s democratic debate in brooklyn that is the most conservative part of this great country he continued but you know what we re out of the deep south now and we re moving up i have a few problems with this line of argument which seems to imply that democratic voters in the deep south don t reflect the larger democratic electorate the remarks thursday night echo previous comments made by sanders and his campaign consider sanders s reference to the term deep south which traditionally describes alabama georgia louisiana mississippi and south carolina these are five of the only six states along with maryland where at least a quarter of the population is black given the united states history of disenfranchising black voters not to mention the importance of black voters to democrats in november it s dicey for sanders to diminish clinton s wins there but the deep south isn t sanders s only issue his problems in the rest of the south are what really dooms him clinton s largest net delegate gains over sanders came from texas 72 and florida 68 two states that are within the south as the census bureau and most other people define it clinton also cleaned sanders s clock in virginia and north carolina overall clinton gained a net of 155 delegates on sanders in the five deep south states but she also added 211 delegates to her margin in the rest of the region alabama georgia louisiana mississippi and south carolina source fivethirtyeight delegate tracker the green papers in addition to being important to the democratic party s electoral present and future florida virginia north carolina and texas are quite diverse they re diverse ideologically miami and austin aren t exactly the most conservative part of the country and they re diverse racially they contain not only a substantial number of african americans but also hispanics and increasingly asian american voters in fact these states are among the most demographically representative of the diverse obama coalition that clinton or sanders will have to rely on in november although it will be a couple of decades before the electorate as a whole is majority minority the democratic vote is already getting there in 2012 only 55 percent of president obama s voters were white according to the national exit poll our demographic projections of this november s electorate which account for population growth since 2012 calculate that the white share of the democratic vote will tick down another percentage point to 54 percent the rest of the democratic vote will be black 24 percent hispanic 15 percent or belong to asian or other races 7 percent according to our projections so let s take those projections as being maximally representative of the broader democratic electorate as it stands today in which primary or caucus states has turnout come closest to those ratios in 21 states to have voted so far we have data on this from exit polls see here for virginia for example where democratic turnout was 63 percent white 26 percent black 7 percent hispanic and 5 percent asian or other when it voted on super tuesday that s pretty close to the democratic electorate overall although with too few hispanic voters in the other 29 states those that haven t voted yet or where no exit poll was conducted i ll estimate the democratic electorate based on our demographic projections with an adjustment for the fact that the democrats who vote in primaries are somewhat whiter than those who vote in november 1 then i ll calculate the root mean square error rmse for each state a measure of the difference between the demographics of its primary or caucus turnout and the projected democratic electorate in november a lower rmse is better for our purposes because it means the state s demographics are more representative of the national democratic coalition root mean square error of turnout as compared with projected democratic electorate in november source exit polls fivethirtyeight demographic projections the most representative state by this measure is new jersey we expect its primary electorate to be about 57 percent white 26 percent black 11 percent hispanic and 6 percent asian or other quite close to the national democratic electorate new jersey won t vote until june 7 although clinton was well ahead when the last poll was released there in february after new jersey comes illinois which clinton won narrowly and then florida where clinton won going away then there s new york which votes tuesday and where clinton is 15 percentage points ahead in our polling average virginia another southern state ranks as the next most representative clinton won it easily then there s nevada another clinton state before we go back to the south to north carolina also won by clinton the next group of four states maryland tennessee arkansas and michigan are roughly tied and include some further representation for the south along with finally one state michigan that sanders won in other words clinton has won or is favored to win almost every state where the turnout demographics strongly resemble those of democrats as a whole this shouldn t be surprising clinton is winning nationally by about 14 percentage points in the popular vote so if you re in a state that s well representative of democrats national demographics you might expect her to win it by a solid margin too listen to the latest episode of the fivethirtyeight politics podcast it s true that a couple of states in the deep south such as mississippi and louisiana rate as being not well representative by our definition but overall that s more likely to be true of places where sanders has won new hampshire ranks as the 46th most representative out of 50 states and iowa ranks 44th maybe those states shouldn t hold the first two contests wisconsin which sanders won last week is below average and the sort of wishful thinking sanders is engaged in can cut both ways yes clinton s lead would be considerably narrower although she d still be winning without delegates from the deep south but what if you excluded delegates from caucuses where sanders has gained a net of 150 delegates on clinton without those delegates sanders couldn t even maintain the pretense of a competitive race not only are most of those caucus states extremely white and therefore poorly representative of democrats national demographics many of them such as idaho and nebraska are also quite red furthermore caucuses tend to disenfranchise voters by making it harder to vote our demographic modeling suggests that this has hurt clinton and that sanders wouldn t have won by the same enormous margins if those caucus states had held primaries instead but overall the math is pretty simple sanders is winning states that are much whiter than the democratic electorate as a whole clinton is winning states that are much blacker than the democratic electorate as a whole and clinton is winning most of those states that are somewhere in the middle whether they re in the south like virginia or elsewhere like ohio or nevada that s why she ll probably be the democratic nominee for example in illinois our demographic projections expect 54 percent of democratic voters in november to be white but 58 percent of voters were white in the march democratic primary there according to the exit poll this is a typical example the share of white voters in a democratic primary is usually a few percentage points higher than the white share of democratic voters in november because our demographic projections were originally intended to reflect the november electorate i ve adjusted the number of white voters slightly upward so that they reflect a primary electorate instead nate silver is the founder and editor
