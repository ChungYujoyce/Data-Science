 mar 21 2016 at 6 30 am by harry enten and nate silver filed under 2016 election ross d franklin ap the republican race for the presidential nomination is down to just one man and one number donald trump and 1 237 the number of delegates required to clinch the nomination can trump win 1 237 delegates by the end of the primary season on june 7 will he be forced to plunder among the more than 100 unbound or currently uncommitted delegates who will make the trip to cleveland in order to win on a first ballot at the republican national convention or are we all but assured of a multi ballot convention any pundit giving confident answers to these questions is full of it so fivethirtyeight surveyed some of the best delegate obsessives and political experts we know on how many delegates they expect trump to win in the remaining contests trump has 695 delegates now and on average our respondents estimate he will still be just a little bit short of 1 237 on june 7 when california wraps up the primary calendar he might be close enough though that he could clinch the nomination in the six weeks between california and cleveland if that s the baseline case however it wouldn t take much for trump to deviate from it in either direction outperform these estimates in california for instance and trump could reach or surpass 1 237 delegates on june 7 lose a winner take all or winner take most state where these estimates have him favored however and trump could be well short of a majority there are few truly proportional states left on the gop s primary calendar so small shifts in any state can have major consequences in the delegate count that s why we surveyed this group my own personal1 delegate projection took a beating tuesday because i thought ted cruz would win missouri by a small amount instead of losing it by a small amount in addition to nate silver s and my estimates we tried to include a diverse set of opinions from across the political spectrum we also focused on analysts who have been following the delegate race closely and know the intricacies of the gop s delegate rules our panel included these people to best reflect the group consensus we used an olympic average in which we discarded the highest and lowest estimates in each state and averaged the remainder because of this averaging process and because we told panelists they could list probabilistic forecasts instead of deterministic ones2 in some cases the average reflects a number of delegates that it would be mathematically impossible for trump to achieve for instance our average has trump with 15 delegates in winner take all delaware which has 16 delegates at stake this is equivalent to saying that trump is highly likely but not quite certain to win delaware according to the panel overall our average response suggests that trump will win 513 delegates the rest of the way when combined with the 695 he s won so far that means he d fall 29 delegates short of the 1 237 needed to win on the first ballot here is the olympic average for each upcoming contest we ve left out some contests with only unbound delegates see the footnotes for more detail 3 trump projections based on an olympic average of estimates from nate silver harry enten adam geller national research inc daniel nichanian daily kos henry olsen ethics and public policy center margie omero purple insights patrick ruffini echelon insights and david wasserman cook political report if trump does in fact get 1 208 delegates he still might win on a first ballot he would need only a fraction of the delegates that are currently unbound or will be unbound to reach 1 237 who exactly are these unbound or uncommitted delegates some like the six from the virgin islands were elected by voters to be uncommitted but they may commit to a candidate closer to the convention others like the 54 pennsylvania district delegates are automatically unbound and have been elected as unbound for decades see when gerald ford beat ronald reagan in the 1976 primary these delegates are free to choose whichever candidate they want on all ballots 4 in addition some delegates from candidates who have withdrawn from the race may become available to trump depending on the state s rules although it s hard to know trump s exact chance of getting 29 delegates from this group trump probably would have a decent shot at reaching 1 237 all of the respondents agree that trump is not likely to get close to 1 237 delegates before june 7 when california and four other states vote the closest trump came was 1 088 delegates and even the most optimistic trump projection has him hitting 1 244 after all the states have voted that leaves trump with very little room for error to reach a majority of delegates without at least some of the currently unpledged or uncommitted delegates coming to his aid part of the reason we ll have to wait so long is how the rest of the calendar breaks down the month of april which includes a lot of primaries in the northeast should be good for trump may has far fewer contests and trump is expected to do poorly in nebraska oregon and washington not surprisingly our respondents estimates differed greatly in a number of states if you re looking for the states that could be make or break for trump then look to wisconsin new york indiana and california in all four trump s expected number of delegates won differed by at least 36 among the respondents indeed there was a somewhat bimodal distribution in the total number of delegates our respondents expected trump to reach three of us have trump earning from 1 136 to 1 156 and three have him winning from 1 237 to 1 244 the other two respondents have him in the 1200s but short of 1 237 that may be why you read some pieces that seem to indicate that trump is well on his way to winning on the first ballot but other people seem to think there s very little chance of it smart people disagree and a single upset in a winner take all state could change the map significantly our panel has trump winning all 58 delegates in winner take all arizona for instance which votes tuesday if he lost there it could make it very hard to get to 1 237 perhaps what becomes clearest is that there is still a lot we don t know we ll have to watch and see if there are any clues in the voting over the next month for now hang on for a wild ride listen to the latest episode of the fivethirtyeight politics podcast this is harry for instance they could give cruz and trump half the delegates in arizona even though it is winner take all if they thought each one had a 50 percent chance of winning it most panelists issued deterministic forecasts however some notes on the delegate numbers in this table we list only pennsylvania s 17 statewide delegates which are bound to the statewide winner the state s 54 district delegates are unbound american samoa s delegates are unbound unless instructed by resolution of the body which elected them as to the disposition of their vote on any business before the national convention we re not including north dakota s 28 delegates which are all unbound north dakota s state convention will meet starting april 1 wyoming has already selected 12 delegates and in addition to the delegates listed in the table three colorado and three wyoming delegates will go to the gop convention unbound most delegates have to vote a certain way in the first or first few ballots but can change their vote in subsequent ballots harry enten is a senior political writer and analyst for fivethirtyeight forecasterenten
