doctors without borders is arguing that the expansion of a trump administration program to leave asylum seekers in mexico while they await immigration court decisions will put vulnerable people in danger the international humanitarian group noted that the remain in mexico program now includes deportations to an area that the u s state department classifies with the highest travel advisory level 4 do not travel the same category also includes north korea sudan south sudan venezuela syria somalia libya iran and afghanistan previously the program had been piloted in el paso tex but on tuesday the program expanded 10 asylum seekers were deported from laredo tex to nuevo laredo which is in the mexican state of tamaulipas the state department warns that u s citizens should avoid travel to tamaulipas because violent crime such as murder armed robbery carjacking kidnapping extortion and sexual assault is common gang activity including gun battles and blockades is widespread we cannot criticize a policy but we are criticizing the consequences of these policies said maria hernandez who is a project coordinator in mexico for doctors without borders also known as m decins sans fronti res the decision that the united states government is taking and the blind acceptance as well from the mexican government of these migratory policies is putting vulnerable people in danger from

into the u s read more president trump wants asylum seekers to stay in mexico here s how that would work the group said in a statement that nuevo laredo is not a safe place to return refugees some of the patients that we see are beaten suffer death threats or they are abducted hernandez said noting that other patients reported witnessing or being subjected to extortion rapes sexual violence and even homicide jos a man from honduras was treated by doctors without borders in nuevo laredo after being kidnapped at a bus station when we got off the bus some men dragged my brother and me away and took my sister somewhere else he told the doctors without borders team according to an email from the group to time after a few hours my brother and i were released but she wasn t we still do not have any news of her we paid five thousand dollars in ransom which was all we had but they have not released her i do not know who can help us jos said we do not trust the police here margarita a 36 year old woman from guatemala recounted to doctors without borders how she and her three daughters ages 16 seven and six had narrowly avoided being kidnapped at a bus station in nuevo laredo they wanted to take my daughters she told doctors without borders according to an email to time i screamed with all my strength and we managed to escape the migrants names were changed to protect their confidentiality in the upcoming weeks it is possible that trump will seek even more aggressive deportation policies if the currently agreed upon measures which include the expansion of the remain in mexico program to nuevo laredo and other locations have not sufficiently achieved results in addressing the flow of migrants to the southern border hernandez warned that deporting more asylum seekers to mexico will only benefit the criminal networks that feed on the misery migrants and asylum seekers like jos and margarita s families are especially at risk of becoming victims of violence and other crimes we know as a fact that the most vulnerable people or the most targeted by criminal groups are these asylum seekers hernandez said in light of her experiences margarita feels that it is not safe
