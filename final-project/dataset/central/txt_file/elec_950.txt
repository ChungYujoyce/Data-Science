on tuesday president donald trump told fox news i want to encourage everyone to keep following our guidelines on social distancing avoiding large gatherings and hand washing and all of the other things that everybody knows they re supposed to be doing ultimately the goal is to ease the guidelines and open things up to very large sections of our country as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy i hope we can do this by easter i think that would be a great thing for our country and we re all working very hard to make that a reality fox newsalso on tuesday former vice president joe biden gave interviews to cnn and msnbc from his house in delaware campaigning for the democratic primary is largely on hold due to the coronavirus biden currently leads with 1 215 delegates to 910 for sen bernie sanders i vt cnn msnbc npron monday biden live streamed his first daily coronavirus press briefing realclearpolitics the left thinks trump is hurting his own electoral prospects with his coronavirus response and urges the biden team to step up president trump s approval rating has improved slightly amidst the coronavirus pandemic but the short term gains reflecting a possible rally around the flag effect at the time of national emergency may not hold if i were trump i d want to think six months ahead to the fall that means i d want a broad based stimulus plan that helps ordinary americans and small businesses to stay afloat during the weeks or months long shutdown i d want to stamp out the disease as much as possible even if that means social distancing is in effect for a bit longer and i d want to have a manhattan project on treatments testing and surveillance so that the coronavirus is more manageable until a vaccine is developed which is unlikely until well after election day the better off america is by november the more likely he is to be re elected nate silver fivethirtyeight the worst days of the virus s sweep through the us are almost certainly still ahead of us as the number of infections and deaths continues to rise so there s no guarantee those approval ratings will hold but i would argue that as trump continues putting himself in front of tv cameras to act like he s taking charge and driving this narrative forward he might still benefit even if things are falling apart he s still taking charge whatever that means and subconsciously we love a protagonist emily todd vanderwerff vox the best way to contain the economic damage here and thus maximize trump s chances for re election would be to throw all possible financial help at regular voters while organizing industry onto a wartime footing to defeat the coronavirus as quickly as possible on both the raw economic merits and as a matter of cold blooded political self interest that s what the president and republicans should be doing and yet they are doing the opposite the white house has been sitting on the defense production act for weeks without actually utilizing it the law would allow trump to supersede existing private contracts and re assign and pay private companies to produce the supplies devices and goods needed to fight the virus instead the white house has been trying to encourage purely voluntary efforts from big business which is proving both chaotic and inadequate jeff spross the week regarding biden voters seem to have coalesced around him for his past who they have known him to be for the past four decades in american politics rather than for anything in his present it s as if biden exists primarily as an idea rather than an actual candidate biden s team appears to understand this and to believe that what matters most now is keeping their candidate alive in the american imagination as an alternative to trump his appearances these days have an almost parallel universe quality to them biden s audience less remarks from his home in delaware have the suggestion of an oval office address and their content seems intended to offer a glimpse into the twilight zone where someone else someone more empathetic and capable is president for the foreseeable future there will be no more speeches in front of hundreds or lines of people waiting to shake biden s hand there may not even be the glossy fanfare of a convention with a prime time address but truthfully all those things were always sort of beside the point biden was never really convincing anyone on the stump his political power at this point is an idea held collectively about how to defeat trump the work now is to keep that idea convincing enough for long enough among as many people as possible for the corporeal man to actually win alex wagner the atlantic why not put together a series of presentations in which biden and well chosen experts and communicators explore policy challenges and consider solutions he would pursue you could do them on health care economic growth labor rights civil rights voting rights climate change immigration and any number of other issues the point wouldn t be so much to list all the members of the future biden administration as to fill out a picture of what he and his party think is important and what they want to do if they assume power we know that trump is uniquely ill suited to confronting a crisis such as this one he has hollowed out the government of competent professionals he s always more concerned with his image than with solving problems and he is utterly incapable of bringing the country together for any reason preferring to shift blame and attack his perceived enemies biden can tell voters that he d be the opposite on all counts what s trickier is to show them that s what he ought to start doing now there s no better time paul waldman washington post the right is encouraged by the recent increase in trump s approval and critical of biden s recent efforts and general strength as a candidate the right is encouraged by the recent increase in trump s approval and critical of biden s recent efforts and general strength as a candidate right now there is huge uncertainty about how long the nation s lockdown is going to last how severe the economic contraction will be and how fast we will recover once the all clear is sounded but already survey data show that the most of the public understands that the virus is not trump s fault and likewise that the economic calamity that has befallen us is not his fault either the usual rules of politics may not apply to this episode and my hunch is trump might come out of this stronger steven hayward power line blog it is hard to recall a time when a major party presumptive nominee has been so invisible and so irrelevant on the national stage biden is frozen in place without a lot of modern precedent to fall back on he can t use his own office to get in the news or do anything useful because he has been out of office for four years he can t hold campaign rallies which are unsafe for crowds and particularly hazardous to a 77 year old candidate his party s leaders on capitol hill seem uninterested in getting him involved in negotiations even within their own party he can t even formally celebrate wrapping up the nomination because sanders stubbornly insists on continuing his campaign so biden is reduced to reading embarrassingly halting statements off cue cards in an empty room dan mclaughlin national review mr biden hasn t yet grasped that as the presumptive democratic nominee he s already the party s leader he mistakenly left the drafting of his party s covid 19 stimulus bill to nancy pelosi and chuck schumer in congress by contrast in the 2008 financial crisis then sen barack obama stepped in and led dictating his party s approach and knocking heads to get it mr biden didn t display that ability or gravitas rather than lead off camera he wants the limelight that instinct may damage the credibility he ll need to dominate the stage later karl rove wall street journal on monday biden s delivery was leaden he seemed tired he slurred his words worse he repeatedly stumbled in his remarks despite reading them from a teleprompter at one point biden said this and uh in addition to that in addition to that we have to make sure that we uh are in a position that we are we let me go to the second thing biden says he wants a more public profile during this crisis after seeing his first attempt we wonder if anyone else does editorial board issues insights let s be honest the more biden is in front of voters the more likely he will remind us of how gaffetastic he is he is a placeholder of a candidate the dnc panicked when it was becoming clear that bernie sanders may rise to be their candidate and biden was dusted off and brought out as the safe choice by running biden the democrats are desperately hoping to defeat president trump in november the plan is for him to win and bring back the status quo of the obama days i think americans have moved past the status quo joe biden offers nothing new in policy or big ideas he looks back not forward by doing things like shadow briefings for example he undermines the president while offering no new solutions he simply parrots the words of advice from experts all of which is already being done by the trump covid 19 task force karen townsend hot air the more serious problem with biden is that he s the wrong person to lead america in a post coronavirus world because he will never stand up to china or make the chinese communist party pay a price for unleashing this plague upon the world never in his long political career has biden been willing to stand up to beijing as the senior democrat on the senate foreign relations committee in the 1990s biden pushed for china s membership in the world trade organization blocking measures that would have imposed human rights requirements in exchange for most favored nation status throughout his years as vice president china continued to build military outposts on contested islands in the pacific threaten its neighbors and assert sovereignty over some of the busiest commercial shipping lanes in the world all without hardly any pushback from biden and obama biden will not work to uncouple critical supply chains from china or bring back manufacturing jobs to american workers he won t seek damages from china under international law for unleashing a global catastrophe no a president biden would almost certainly seek a return to normalcy which is the rationale for his entire campaign what should be obvious by now even to biden is that there s not going to be a return to normalcy and when it comes to china there shouldn t be john daniel davidson the federalist museum gives its security chief a new job and his
