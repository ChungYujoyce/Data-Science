 for weeks illinois officials have said the state has been bending the curve on the covid 19 pandemic s rate of growth now the state s leaders say they think illinois is reaching the peak based on models by illinois researchers that officials unveiled thursday here s some more information models can look at lots of different things from new positive test results to hospital bed usage to estimate the peak the state showed two models thursday that look at the number of deaths due to the novel coronavirus one model from the university of illinois suggests that covid 19 deaths have already peaked in illinois the other by the university of chicago projects a peak arriving on may 6 according to data released friday the state acknowledged that many projection models including ones developed by the two universities had anticipated a peak in early to mid april the reason for the new predictions experts say is that the stay at home order and social distancing have slowed the spread of the disease it s the natural effect of the curve bending that chicago officials discussed last week cases and deaths have continued to increase but more slowly with the disease taking longer to spread that means the peak will arrive later with lower numbers of patients and deaths a side benefit hospitals won t see a flood of patients all at once leaving enough beds and ventilators to go around even if a peak arrives later gov j b pritzker cites this kind of research as the key reason he issued his stay at home order and why he is keeping it in place pritzker on thursday cited one calculation that estimated the state would have seen 14 times more deaths if he had not issued the stay at home order it also concluded that if the order were lifted friday the state would see a spike nearly that bad by mid june a rush of cases that would require far more hospital beds and equipment than the state has the governor chicago s mayor and other public health officials have said the peak may look more like a plateau that lasts for a few weeks unveiling the charts thursday pritzker pointed to the large variation in the number of deaths each day that are tied to covid 19 so although the projections offer estimates for each day s projected deaths the actual figures will likely fluctuate widely reality swings up and down sometimes drastically a fact that can t be captured by a simple median line he said chicago mayor lori lightfoot in her earlier daily news conference sounded a similar theme a month ago in march we were all thinking this week would be the peak that we would reach but what i think we have seen now is not so much a peak but a flattening that s a good thing but we don t know at this point how long it s going to take not just to flatten but to decrease lightfoot said the governor already has announced that the stay at home order will remain in place through may 30 albeit with tweaks starting may 1 state and chicago officials say they want to see a sustained drop in cases before they significantly lift restrictions although public health officials have not released any formula that would indicate when the worst might be over they said better testing and contact tracing are also needed pritzker said he could make one guarantee the modeling will change with more data the modelers themselves cautioned that there are many unknowns in their models will covid 19 stick around for the summer or die out in the heat and come back in the fall with so many infected people not showing symptoms will they unwittingly spread it faster as restrictions get relaxed will people who have gotten the virus develop an immunity and how fast could that protection starve the virus of new victims another pledge from city and state officials if the figures start rising faster they ll take more action if you see a second surge of cases in a way that you again overwhelm your health care system see very large numbers of ill people and death that you re not able to really handle that then you have to take a huge step backwards said dr allison arwady director of the chicago department of public health chicago tribune s gregory pratt contributed to this report jmahr chicagotribune com
