campaign polls show biden up big in michigan where 125 pledged delegates are at stake more than anywhere else on tuesday sanders badly needs a strong showing there to keep the race close and he s been hunkered in the state over the past week in an effort to pull out a surprise victory as he did in the 2016 primary but biden also has a massive lead in missouri polls and the black voters in the deep south who delivered huge victories for biden on super tuesday appear poised to do it once again in mississippi where biden is expected to win by a wide margin polls also show a tight race in washington where sanders won big over former secretary of state hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more in 2016 there is no polling of idaho or north dakota speaking at a rally in st louis on monday sanders acknowledged that his campaign must do better on its promise to turn out young people and irregular voters if he hopes to win so far exit polls have shown that young people are not turning out in large enough numbers for sanders to match biden s advantage with older people the bad news to be honest with you is that young people vote in much lower rates than older people sanders said that is the facts i hope all of the old people vote that s great but i want young people to be voting at the same rates because we are overwhelmingly winning young people s votes biden enters the day with about one third of the delegates needed to secure the nomination he leads sanders by about 90 delegates overall although votes are still being counted in california which sanders won that s not an insurmountable lead for biden but the party s proportional allocation of delegates makes it difficult for any candidate to mount a big comeback if they fall too far behind the map is favorable for biden in the coming weeks he appears poised for blowout victories in mississippi on tuesday florida on march 17 and georgia on march 24 sanders will get another shot at biden on the debate stage on march 15 but the urgency at the moment centers around michigan which accounts for more than 35 percent of the delegates that will be allocated on tuesday the vermont senator is seeking to cut into biden s support among black voters who make up about 20 percent of the democratic primary electorate there over the weekend civil rights leader the rev jesse jackson endorsed sanders who also held a

him in 2016 polls showed sanders trailing clinton by 20 points or more in michigan heading into the primary sanders squeezed out a shocking victory that altered the way many viewed the race between sanders and clinton you can see progressives coalescing behind bernie sanders in the closing hours said neil sroka a michigan based progressive strategist for democracy for america which has endorsed sanders if you believe the polling biden should blow it out of the water tomorrow but polling in michigan regularly underestimates young people that s what happened in 2016 i think it s a jump ball momentum is clearly on biden s side but the question is how strongly progressives fight back outside of michigan new data for progress surveys show biden leading by 55 points in mississippi and by 30 points in missouri in washington where sanders won 73 percent support in 2016 caucuses polls show biden and sanders running even like idaho and north dakota the state has switched to primaries this year which should benefit biden sanders is throwing everything he can at biden in an effort to blunt his momentum sanders is hitting biden over his past support for freezing spending on social security medicare and medicaid hoping it will cut into biden s lead among older voters and he is highlighting biden s role in shaping the 1994 crime bill saying it led to the disproportionate incarceration of black and brown people sanders is also hammering biden for his support for trade deals he said cost michiganders jobs for his vote to authorize military action in iraq in 2002 and for his support for a bill that made it harder for individuals to declare bankruptcy over credit card debt but biden s allies have been encouraged by sanders going out of his way to call biden a friend before drawing distinctions between their records believing he s paving the way for an amicable exit from the race if biden opens up an insurmountable lead i do think bernie is coming to the realization that we re approaching the end of the game here said howard gutman a former obama administration ambassador who supports biden he has to campaign and he ll knock joe but they re friends and you can clearly see has bernie has dialed it back a bit that s as it should be view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax
