themselves and gain traction the upcoming debates could shake things up or not loading june 11 2019 kamala harris connects well in person and on camera at a campaign swing through california she hugged sashayed and smiled her way through events her delivery is crisp and on point yet since launching her presidential campaign to great fanfare and an enormous crowd of 20 000 in oakland california in january she has been stuck in the lower tier of candidates recent polls show her support at or below 10 the california senator s struggles reflect the unwieldy nature of this historically large democratic field with 24 hopefuls traipsing around the early voting states and showing up at cattle calls making an impression even for the most promising contenders is proving to be a real challenge senator harris has also been faulted for pandering to the left and failing to communicate a core message but for many democratic voters it may come down to the bottom line who can beat president donald trump i think kamala harris will compete well but a lot will depend on whether democrats think it s less risky to nominate an old white guy instead of a younger woman of color says dianne bystrom a longtime observer of presidential campaigns and women in politics it may come down to that kamala harris has always been a trailblazer as the daughter of immigrant parents her mother came from india and her father from jamaica she was the first woman elected twice as california s attorney general and the second african american woman elected to the united states senate which she entered two years ago from the moment she got there the chattering classes began speculating about white house ambitions those lofty expectations seemed justified when she launched her presidential campaign in oakland california in january drawing an enormous crowd of about 20 000 people she s since brought in some big endorsements including california gov gavin newsom and an impressive fundraising haul what senator harris hasn t been able to do of late is break past 10 in national polls the california senator s struggle to gain momentum reflects the unwieldy nature of this historically large democratic field with 24 hopefuls traipsing around the early voting states and giving back to back speeches at cattle calls like the recent democratic hall of fame dinner in iowa and the party convention in california making an impression even for the most promising contenders is proving to be a real challenge senator harris has also been faulted for pandering to the left and appearing overly cautious on the trail in a field with relatively few big policy differences between them observers say it s vital for candidates to communicate core beliefs and a clear sense of identity but ultimately for many democratic voters it all may come down to the same bottom line who can beat president donald trump you have to have a message that resonates saysdianne bystrom a longtime observer of presidential campaigns and women in politics she s got great communication skills dr bystrom says of senator harris but i don t think she s as specific about her message as massachusetts sen elizabeth warren is she adds that senator harris needs to further define herself of course it s early yet and the upcoming debates the first of which will take place at the end of this month could offer many second or third tier candidates a chance to break out of the pack former vice president joe biden is widely regarded as a weak front runner and most political observers believe the landscape could shift substantially before democratic voters start casting ballots early next year jim messina former president barack obama s campaign manager famously commented on msnbc inapril that if senator harris were a stock he d buy her in other words seeing a future rise as a good bet in iowa the latest des moines register cnn poll has senator harriswell behind vice president biden as well as behind vermont sen bernie sanders senator warren and south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg yet it also found her tied with senator warren as the topsecondchoice of iowa democrats heading into the caucuses that can be a sign of hidden strength still being voters second choice is not the same as being their first choice at therecentcalifornia democratic convention in san francisco james smith a firefighter from long beach says senator harris is great but not for 2020 he s standing behind the international association of firefighters endorsement of vice president biden he s a friend of labor says mr smith joe s our guy alex n ez of mountain view raves about senator harris performance interrogating attorney general william barr at a senate hearing last month an exchange that went viral on social media as a former prosecutor she has a unique skill set he says but he doesn t envision her as president more like a future attorney general who might someday prosecute president trump she s forceful agrees roberta a retiree from new york who says she does not want her last name used for fear of becoming the target of a trump tweet coming out of an event for senator sanders in pasadena california she says she s a fan of senator harris and finds her very believable still she can t commit to backing her i m in a quandary i don t know who to vote for senator harris connects well in person and on camera at a recent campaign swing through california she hugged sashayed and smiled her way through events continually throwing the praise back at her supporters whether they were immigrant activists or union members her delivery is crisp and on point when a man jumped onstage at a moveon forum in san francisco and grabbed the microphone from her the former district attorney kept her cool calmly walking away as others including her husband hustled the man offstage in her stump speeches she focuses on pocketbook and equality issues particularly for women and women of color she proposes a monthly tax credit of 500 for families earning less than 100 000 a year a big boost for teacher salaries and equal pay for women with companies on the hook to prove they comply or else pay a fine yet having detailed policy positions is not the same as having a message warns bill carrick a democratic strategist in los angeles the message has to be part of who you are what you stand for what you believe in what your values are mr carrick describes the revolutionary senator sanders as a classic stand up for the little guy a lefty with policy underneath it all similarly senator warren has the total package someone who belongs in the hall of fame of policy wonks in her fight against corporations and who is also emotionally driven by this fight former vice president biden is another strong persona somebody who can bring us together get things done and most importantly win when asked about senator harris mr carrick pauses i m not sure what her message actually is and that s really a challenge lately she has been trying some new approaches at the california democratic convention she leaned much more into an anti trump message built around a series of truths about president trump s lies and calling for the start of impeachment proceedings at the iowa dinner last weekend she furthered this line of attack emphasizing her prosecutorial chops and portraying president trump as having defrauded the american people when it comes to health care taxes and national security i am prepared to make the case for america and to prosecute the case against donald trump the former district attorney said the rhetorical shift may be in response to critics who ve been arguing she ought to present herself as a pragmatist her main competitor in the race is not senator sanders these critics say but vice president biden they argue that she made a serious error in panderingto the left pulled there in part by her sister maya harris her progressive campaign chairwoman senator harris has supported liberal causes such as medicare for all the green new deal and the decriminalization of sex work and she has indicated an openness to reparations for slavery as well as having a conversation about voting rights for violent felons in several cases she s later had to walk back her comments or try to clarify it is a pattern similar to her record on some issues in california when she changed positions on the death penalty and stepped back from her controversial policy to punish parents for their children s truancy which resulted in a few parents going to jail david axelrod a former top adviser to president obama has criticized senator harris for being overly cautious in answering questions trying to have things both ways he told the los angeles times that she s a brilliant person but what we ve learned so far is that she s great at asking questions but timid at answering them get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox senator harris fans are fervent in their support and say she is facing strong winds of sexism and racism a point that dr bystrom who s now retired from iowa state university in ames also makes after hillary clinton lost to president trump in the electoral college the possibility of losing again is making some democrats very nervous about nominating a woman and a woman of color dr bystrom believes i think kamala harris will compete well but a lot will depend on whether democrats think it s less risky to nominate an old white guy instead of a younger woman of color she says i think it
