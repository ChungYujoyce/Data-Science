graduating to a totally brilliant future and here i am standing before you as president of the united states so i m guessing there are some people here today who thought that either one of those things either one would really require major help from god do we agree and we got it applause but here we are celebrating together on this very joyous occasion and there is no place in the world i d rather be to give my first commencement address as president than here with my wonderful friends at liberty university applause and i accepted this invitation a long time ago i said to jerry that i d be there and when i say something i mean it applause i want to thank president jerry falwell and his incredible wife becky stand up becky for their kind words their steadfast support and their really wonderful friendship applause let me also extend our appreciation to the entire falwell family trey sarah wesley laura and caroline thank you for everything you do to make this university so exceptional one of the truly great great schools most importantly to our new graduates each of you should take immense pride in what you have achieved there s another group of amazing people we want

re also deeply honored to be joined by some of the nearly 6 000 service members military veterans and military spouses who are receiving their diplomas today will you please stand please stand applause wow that s great thank you very much great job we re profoundly grateful to every single one of you who sacrifice to keep us safe and protect god s precious gift of freedom it is truly a testament to this university and to the values that you embrace that your graduating class includes so many patriots who have served our country in uniform thank you very much to the class of 2017 today you end one chapter but you are about to begin the greatest adventure of your life just think for a moment of how blessed you are to be here today at this great great university living in this amazing country surrounded by people who you love and care about so much then ask yourself with all of those blessings and all of the blessings that you ve been given what will you give back to this country and indeed to the world what imprint will you leave in the sands of history what will future americans say we did in our brief time right here on earth did we take risks did we dare to defy expectations did we challenge accepted wisdom and take on established systems i think i did but we all did and we re all doing it or did we just go along with convention swim downstream so easily with the current and just give in because it was the easy way it was the traditional way or it was the accepted way remember this nothing worth doing ever ever ever came easy following your convictions means you must be willing to face criticism from those who lack the same courage to do what is right and they know what is right but they don t have the courage or the guts or the stamina to take it and to do it it s called the road less traveled i know that each of you will be a warrior for the truth will be a warrior for our country and for your family i know that each of you will do what is right not what is the easy way and that you will be true to yourself and your country and your beliefs in my short time in washington i ve seen firsthand how the system is broken a small group of failed voices who think they know everything and understand everyone want to tell everybody else how to live and what to do and how to think but you aren t going to let other people tell you what you believe especially when you know that you re right applause and those of you graduating here today who have given half a million hours of charity last year alone unbelievable amount of work and charity and few universities or colleges can claim anything even close we don t need a lecture from washington on how to lead our lives i m standing here looking at the next generation of american leaders there may very well be a president or two in our midst anybody think they re going to be president raise your hand applause in your hearts are inscribed the values of service sacrifice and devotion now you must go forth into the world and turn your hopes and dreams into action america has always been the land of dreams because america is a nation of true believers when the pilgrims landed at plymouth they prayed when the founders wrote the declaration of independence they invoked our creator four times because in america we don t worship government we worship god applause that is why our elected officials put their hands on the bible and say so help me god as they take the oath of office it is why our currency proudly declares in god we trust and it s why we proudly proclaim that we are one nation under god every time we say the pledge of allegiance applause the story of america is the story of an adventure that began with deep faith big dreams and humble beginnings that is also the story of liberty university when i think about the visionary founder of this great institution reverend jerry falwell senior i can only imagine how excited he would be if he could see all of this and all of you today and how proud he would be of his son and of his family in just two days we will mark the 10th anniversary of reverend falwell s passing and i used to love watching him on television hearing him preach he was a very special man he would be so proud not just at what you ve achieved but of the young men and women of character that you ve all become and jerry i know your dad is looking down on you right now and he is proud he is very proud so congratulations on a great job jerry applause reverend falwell s life is a testament to the power of faith to change the world the inspiring legacy that we see all around us in this great stadium this is a beautiful stadium and it is packed i m so happy about that i said how are you going to fill up a place like that it is packed jerry in this beautiful campus and in your smiling faces but it all began with a vision that vision was of a world class university for evangelical christians and i want to thank you because boy did you come out and vote those of you that are old enough in other words your parents boy oh boy you voted you voted applause no doubt many people told him his vision wasn t possible and i am sure they continued to say that so long after he started at the beginning with just 154 students but the fact is no one has ever achieved anything significant without a chorus of critics standing on the sidelines explaining why it can t be done nothing is easier or more pathetic than being a critic because they re people that can t get the job done but the future belongs to the dreamers not to the critics the future belongs to the people who follow their heart no matter what the critics say because they truly believe in their vision at liberty your leaders knew from the very beginning that a strong athletic program would help this campus grow so that this school might transform more lives that is why a crucial part of reverend falwell s vision for making liberty a world class institution was having a world class football team much like the great teams of notre dame great school great place in fact vice president mike pence is there today doing a fabulous job as he always does applause a few years ago the new york times even wrote a story on the great ambitions of the liberty flames that story prompted a longtime president of another school to write a letter to jerry it s a letter that reverend falwell would have been very very pleased to read jerry tells me that letter now hangs in the wall in the boardroom of your great university it came from the late father theodore hesper who was the beloved president of the university of notre dame 35 years ago like this school s founder he was a truly kindhearted man of very very deep faith in the letter father hesper recalled that notre dame s own meteoric rise from a small midwestern school to a national football powerhouse and then he wrote something so amazing and generous he wrote i think you are on that same trajectory now and i want to wish you all the best and encourage you from the starting and from being able to start very small and arriving in the big time thanks to hard work great faith and incredible devotion those dreams have come true as of february of this year the liberty flames are playing in the fbs the highest level of competition in ncaa football applause don t clap that could be tough don t clap that could be tough i m a little worried i don t want to look at some of those scores here jerry you sure you know what you re doing here laughter those other players are big and fast and strong but i have a feeling you re going to do very well right from the most humble roots you ve become a powerhouse in both education and sports and just wait until the world hears the football teams you ll be playing on your schedule starting next season president falwell gave me a list of some of those schools the ones you re going to be playing 2018 would you like me to read the names just came out would you like to hear them i m a little bit concerned umass virginia auburn jerry are you sure you know what you re doing jerry auburn laughter i don t know about that james this could be trouble jerry rutgers old dominion brigham young army i might be at that game who am i supposed to root for tell me i don t know that s a tough one jerry i don t know jerry i m going to have to think about that one jerry buffalo troy virginia tech oh no jerry ole miss and wake forest those are really top schools maybe in four or five years i ll come to a game right you ll build it up laughter well good luck the success of your athletic program arriving on the big stage should be a reminder to every new graduate of just what you can achieve when you start small pursue a big vision and never ever quit you never quit if i give you one message to hold in your hearts today it s this never ever give up there will be times in your life you ll want to quit you ll want to go home you ll want to go home perhaps to that wonderful mother that s sitting back there watching you and say mom i can t do it i can t do it just never quit go back home and tell mom dad i can do it i can do it i will do it you re going to be successful applause i ve seen so many brilliant people they gave up in life they were totally brilliant they were top of their class they were the best students they were the best of everything they gave up i ve seen others who really didn t have that talent or that ability and they re among the most successful people today in the world because they never quit and they never gave up so just remember that never stop fighting for what you believe in and for the people who care about you carry yourself with dignity and pride demand the best from yourself and be totally unafraid to challenge entrenched interests and failed power structures does that sound familiar by the way the more people tell you it s not possible that it can t be done the more you should be absolutely determined to prove them wrong treat the word impossible as nothing more than motivation relish the opportunity to be an outsider embrace that label being an outsider is fine embrace the label because it s the outsiders who change the world and who make a real and lasting difference the more that a broken system tells you that you re wrong the more certain you should be that you must keep pushing ahead you must keep pushing forward and always have the courage to be yourself most importantly you have to do what you love you have to do what you love i ve seen so many people they re forced through lots of reasons sometimes including family to go down a path that they don t want to go down to go down a path that leads them to something that they don t love that they don t enjoy you have to do what you love or you most likely won t be very successful at it so do what you love i want to recognize a friend who is here with us today who can serve as an inspiration to us all someone who doesn t know the meaning of the word quit real champion a true true champion both on the field off the field he s a hall of fame quarterback for the buffalo bills really a good friend of mine an amazing guy jim kelly where is jim he s here some place where is jim stand up jim applause what a great man jim kelly he was tough jim do you have any idea how much money you d be making today they d hit jim it was like tackling a linebacker they d hit jim four guys five guys that weighed 320 and he d just keep going down the field he was much more than a quarterback he had tremendous heart and he knew how to win jim is tough and his toughest fight of all was that he beat cancer not once but twice applause and i saw him and his incredible wife as they were in a very low moment jill very very low moment and it was amazing the way they fought it didn t look good i would have said maybe maybe it s not going to happen but there was always that hope because of jim and jim s heart but i want to just say it s great to have you here today jim and these people are big big fans applause and if you can get a young version of jim kelly you ll be beating a lot of teams jerry so interestingly though i said i wonder what jim s doing here his daughter erin crosses the goal line to you and today with you so erin stand up where are you erin where is erin congratulations erin congratulations graduating from liberty great choice thank you applause liberty university is a place where they really have true champions and you have a simple creed that you live by to be really champions for christ whether you re called to be a missionary overseas to shepherd a church or to be a leader in your community you are a living witness of the gospel message of faith hope and love and i must tell you i am so proud as your president to have helped you along over the past short period of time i said i was going to do it and jerry i did it and a lot of people are very happy with what s taken place especially last week we did some very important signings right james very important signings applause america is better when people put their faith into action as long as i am your president no one is ever going to stop you from practicing your faith or from preaching what s in your heart applause we will always stand up for the right of all americans to pray to god and to follow his teachings america is beginning a new chapter today each of you begins a new chapter as well when your story goes from here it will be defined by your vision your perseverance and your grit that s a word jim kelly knows very well your grit in this i m reminded of another man you know very well and who has joined us here today his name is george rogers liberty university cfo and vice president for a quarter of a century during world war ii george spent three and a half years as a prisoner of war he saw many of his fellow soldiers die during the bataan death march he was the victim of starvation and torture as a prisoner of war when he was finally set free he weighed just 85 pounds and was told he would not live past the age of 40 today george is 98 years old applause great that s so great george if anyone ever had reason to quit to give in to the bitterness and anger that we all face at some point to lose hope in god s vision for his life it was indeed george rogers but that s not what he did he stood up for his country he stood up for his community he stood up for his family and he defended civilization against a tide of barbarity the kind of barbarity we re seeing today and we ve been witnessing over the last number of years and i just want to tell you as your president we are doing very very well in countering it so you just hang in there things are going along very very well you ll be hearing a lot about it next week from our generals things are going along very very well applause through it all he kept his faith in god even in the darkest depths of despair like so many others of his generation george came home to a nation full of optimism and pride and began to live out the american dream he started a family he discovered god s plan for him and pursued that vision with all his might pouring his passion into a tiny college in a place called lynchburg virginia did you ever hear of that lynchburg we love it do you like it we like it right i flew over it a little while ago it s amazing actually what started as a dream with a few good friends he helped shepherd into the largest christian university in the world just look at this amazing soaring growing campus and i ve been watching it grow because i ve been a friend of liberty for a long time now jerry it s been a long time thanks in great part george s financial stewardship hundreds of thousands of young hearts and souls have been enriched at liberty and inspired by the spirit of god george we thank you and we salute you and you just stay healthy for a long time george thank you applause now it falls on the shoulders of each of you here today to protect the freedom that patriots like george earned with their incredible sacrifice fortunately you have been equipped with the tools from your time right here on this campus to make the right decisions and to serve god family and country as you build good lives you will also be rebuilding our nation you ll be leaders in your communities stewards of great institutions and defenders of liberty and you will be great mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers loving friends and loving family members you will build a future where we have the courage to chase our dreams no matter what the cynics and the doubters have to say you will have the confidence to speak the hopes in your hearts and to express the love that stirs your souls and you will have the faith to replace a broken establishment with a government that serves and protects the people applause we must always remember that we share one home and one glorious destiny whether we are brown black or white we all bleed the same red blood of patriots we all salute the same great american flag and we are all made by the same almighty god applause as long as you remember what you have learned here at liberty as long as you have pride in your beliefs courage in your convictions and faith in your god then you will not fail applause and as long as america remains true to its values loyal to its citizens and devoted to its creator then our best days are yet to come i can promise you that applause this has been an exceptional morning it s been a great honor for me and i want to thank you the students i also want to thank you the family for getting them there and i want to thank and congratulate liberty may god bless the class of 2017 may god bless
