as congress was getting ready to pass the latest round of coronavirus relief last month rep joe neguse of colorado noticed a problem for his district back home nine of his 10 counties were too small to get any of the 150 billion set aside in the bill to help state and local governments governments representing less than 500 000 people were not eligible to access emergency aid to offset the costs that states counties and cities have been racking up during the coronavirus crisis when neguse did the math he calculated 85 of his district was shut out of the fund though the virus was not sparing his constituents simply because they lived in places that fell below the half million people mark neguse s district was not unique in the end out of the 3 262 counties and 39 044 local governments nationwide only 171 qualify for direct emergency aid under the treasury department guidelines for the cares act that was signed into law on march 27 in eleven states with small populations alaska idaho iowa louisiana maine montana north dakota new hampshire vermont west virginia and wyoming every city and county was ineligible for the money even city governments in places like st louis miami and cleveland didn t qualify states could still receive aid and distribute that cash to local governments at their own discretion or not in all of these places state and local governments are paying frontline workers like ambulance drivers police officers and utility workers from quickly disappearing bankrolls taxpayer supported food banks are seeing record demand as unemployment insurance is draining state reserves and sales tax revenue plummets under stay at home orders in some places that can t access the aid covid 19 is still on the rise and the strain on public resources will only grow but even in places with low or decreasing caseloads stay at home orders have tanked local economies and governments are struggling to pay workers and maintain basic services keep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter as soon as the cares act passed neguse started to rally lawmakers from across the political spectrum to remedy this slight in the inevitable sequel to the historic stimulus package four weeks later he has collected 147 co sponsors including five republicans spanning the ideological bridge from the progressive alexandria ocasio cortez to the far right immigration hardliner paul gosar their proposal would set aside 250 billion in the next stimulus package to governments serving fewer than 500 000 people doled out on a per person basis rather than trying to pick winners and losers instead let s just help every city in america that s hurting says neguse a first term democrat who is the freshman democrats representative during leadership meetings but the fight over more help for the states and local governments is already facing headwinds as the house is preparing to come back next week to work on what lawmakers are calling cares 2 0 house speaker nancy pelosi has already suggested as much as 1 trillion go to state and local government relief but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a kentucky republican and president donald trump argue it s not washington s job to bail out states bad choices mcconnell has suggested states that can t weather the crisis be permitted to declare bankruptcy and start over in an interview on monday trump said he does not support what he considers state bailouts it s not fair to the republicans because all the states that need help they re run by democrats in every case trump told the new york post the posturing may make for good drama in washington but it s hurting places like gilpin county colorado population 6 243 gilpin county which is in neguse s district is the hardest hit locale in the country by covid 19 s economic fallout according to a wall street journal analysis of national data four in five gilpin county workers are employed in the hospitality and gaming sectors and 70 of the county s budget comes from casinos that are now dark in gilpin there s been only a few reported cases of the covid 19 virus but they re going to have the greatest economic loss of any county in america neguse says it s a problem that unites local leaders from both major parties in this purple state fort collins republican mayor and boulder s democratic mayor are both managing similar challenges a straining need for social services furloughed workers industries that may take two years to find their footing again and almost no tax revenue to give any breathing room fort collins mayor wade troxell has already furloughed a quarter of his 2 400 city workers delayed construction projects and put in place a hiring freeze even so with 50 of his city budget coming from sales tax he is bracing for further cuts he has secured some help for the city through other parts of the cares act including a 649 000 housing and urban development grant 11 million for public transportation and 17 million to keep the regional airport operational but troxell anticipates coronavirus drag on fort collins economy could be anywhere from 25 to 53 million over the next two years without some help from congress that revenue stabilization would really help us get through that period that really sets up how municipalities come out of this on the other side says troxell it s happening in every community not just large ones about an hour south boulder mayor sam weaver is facing the same problems he s already furloughed 135 members of his permanent workforce of 1 400 city workers and the entire seasonal team of trail rangers and lifeguards he s predicting a 40 million loss over the next two years and is openly frustrated with washington s two tiered relief system like fort collins boulder got money from hud s development grants but that 485 000 is nowhere near what the city needs to dig out of this hole that seems to have no bottom weaver says compared to the billions needed to recover from this it s a drop in the bucket he says we are the ones providing the immediate assistance we currently have no federal support for what we re working on intentionally or not the way that the cares act allocated money to states and local governments automatically creates a division within states between residents in large urban centers and those living in suburban and rural areas in colorado for instance the act provides the state a maximum allocation of about 2 2 billion based on population roughly one in five of those dollars automatically goes to the five biggest counties and denver the state s only city large enough to qualify roughly 44 of the state s population live in those hubs whether the state s 59 other countries home to 56 or so of coloradans get any of that aid is up the state to decide in other words if you live in a dense place washington made sure your local government got some help if you don t it s up to bureaucrats at the state capitol to decide whether or not to help your local city and county offices when washington was writing the bill some lawmakers argued that the communities with fewer than 500 000 people could access federal aid through the hud grants that can be used by local governments for broadly defined community development projects they did but the limited funds didn t match the need some came with strings attached and all excluded communities smaller than 50 000 people that carries its own practical political risk roughly two thirds of americans live in communities smaller than 50 000 people in many of those places people may be testing positive less frequently than their cousins in the bigger cities but that might change as the virus spreads to more rural parts of the country and having a local government staring down a mountain of red ink puts them at a years long disadvantage many voters might think the government could have prevented it s a political calculation that is almost certainly not lost on neguse who if successful would be a hero to every budget officer in rural america trying to decide whether to lay off the sheriff s deputy or the sewage engineer we re on the front end of this crisis neguse says the truth of the matter is i fear what will happen down the road if we don t address this now please send tips leads and stories from
