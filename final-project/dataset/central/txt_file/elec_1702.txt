 former new york city mayor michael bloomberg is strongly considering entering the race for the 2020 u s democratic presidential nomination a move that could greatly disrupt the field just three months before the first nominating contests reuters the left is skeptical of bloomberg s chances arguing that he lacks both a clear message and a natural constituency something is getting in the way of the normal thought process that would begin at these presidential candidates are threatening my massive wealth and usually end at i should support a candidate who will stop this instead diverting wildly off into and it must be me i am the chosen one it s easy to see how our current moment would appeal to a billionaire with too much time on his hands and an inflated sense of his own utility to the world we have cnn throwing up a graphic comparing bloomberg s net worth 52 billion to trump s 3 1 billion and its reporters speculating that trump will extremely not like this graphic undoubtedly true but rather missing the point that having two plutocrats fight about who is richer would be just about the most debased grim way for the 2020 presidential contest to play out libby watson new republic you could take bloomberg s unusual combination of issue positions put some into one box and others into another and end up with something you d call moderate or centrist the other way to look at it however is that whoever you are you re going to find something about him to dislike as david dayen wrote in 2016 when bloomberg was considering a run an anti teachers union anti gun pro nanny state pro wall street pro stop and frisk pro inequality pro immigration pro surveillance pro iraq war neoconservative is almost surgically designed to repel practically every american voter on some level if bloomberg does decide to run i d predict that questions of ideology are going to bedevil him he has indicated that he s contemplating a bid because he doesn t think the field is strong enough to beat trump but he ll have to articulate a rationale for his candidacy that goes deeper than that paul waldman washington post what could be better for elizabeth warren who has built her candidacy on the claim that plutocrats control america s government than to run against a billionaire 51 times over who keeps slamming her proposed wealth tax which more than 80 percent of democrats support if bloomberg stops anyone it will most likely be the moderate candidate who actually is rising buttigieg buttigieg is 37 which offers a useful contrast to the four septuagenarians warren sanders biden trump he s competing against bloomberg is 77 buttigieg served in afghanistan bloomberg didn t serve in vietnam buttigieg lives in the midwest bloomberg lives on the upper east side of manhattan and at least as of 2015 in bermuda london westchester the hamptons florida and vail colorado as well buttigieg has never tried to ban big gulp sodas and most important a substantial number of democrats are actually enthusiastic about buttigieg s candidacy peter beinart the atlantic it s clear from the donor class s enthusiasm for buttigieg the endless parade of columns urging voters to take a closer look at amy klobuchar or steve bullock and now bloomberg s interest in joining the race that most people who look closely at the biden campaign have serious doubts about it but fundamentally he s extremely well known the obama administration remains very popular with rank and file democrats and his support from older working class democrats across racial lines is a plausible path to victory bloomberg stands no chance of poaching biden s black support but with nearly infinite money to spend he certainly might peel off a fair amount of biden s support among white moderates the question is what would this accomplish other than making a left wing victory more likely matthew yglesias vox real life non million dollar donor democrats are happy with the candidates they already have in july pew research center found that 65 percent of democrats had a good or excellent impression of the candidates running for the democratic nomination 25 percent said their sense was that the field was fair and only 5 percent had a poor impression by historical standards those are excellent numbers wealthy democrats who worry that joe biden elizabeth warren bernie sanders or pete buttigieg might lose aren t crazy to look elsewhere but democrats already have better options than the former mayor cory booker has the charisma amy klobuchar has a proven record of winning in the midwest and kamala d harris represents where the democratic party is heading bloomberg could do more for his party and for his own legacy by investing in one of them rather than treating himself to a vanity run for president david byler washington post the right believes bloomberg would make a strong presidential candidate but is skeptical of his chances of winning the democratic nomination arguing that his background and policies are unlikely to resonate with the current democratic party the right believes bloomberg would make a strong presidential candidate but is skeptical of his chances of winning the democratic nomination arguing that his background and policies are unlikely to resonate with the current democratic party the democrats now leading in the primary polls have major vulnerabilities bernie sanders and elizabeth warren want to blow up american capitalism and replace it with their top down socialist designs their agenda might scare suburban voters more than four more years of mr trump does joe biden often stumbles with his words on the stump and can t escape the ukraine imbroglio if impeachment goes to a senate trial he s also low on money pete buttigieg is a glib and clever 37 year old but his only political experience is as the mediocre mayor of a small and struggling city no wonder mr bloomberg thinks he might have a chance as three term mayor of new york he has more executive experience than anyone of the field as a successful entrepreneur he understands the private economy better than any candidate other than john delaney also a former ceo those would both be significant campaign assets against mr trump in a general election editorial board wall street journal the former veep is lackluster on his best days and his money woes are a tell that he has peaked bloomberg also has to know that fellow new yorker trump is not going to let the public forget that hunter biden got rich when his father was vice president indeed house dems bid to impeach trump over ukraine ukraine ukraine could well finish off their own presidential front runner because gop members will repeatedly shift the focus to the biden family s suspect roles there despite his years as a republican bloom berg should have plenty of democratic cred he s dumped hundreds of millions into the party s coffers most recently to help win unified control of swing state virginia and he s utterly in tune with most democrats on climate change abortion gun control immigration and other hot button issues a run is certainly worth a shot editorial board new york post bloomberg s success as mayor of new york is his strongest credential for running and it is a good one new york is a large messy city with an antiquated infrastructure a large indigent population and in the wake of the great recession a worrisome dependence on the financial industries it is no picnic to manage most new yorkers laud the former mayor for continuing rudy giuliani s success in keeping the big apple safe and also for building up and diversifying the city s economy he attracted significant investments from other industries including for instance big tech overall the city thrived under his leadership bloomberg s problem is that by the woke standards of today his pragmatic no nonsense approach to governing is at odds with the party he has chosen liz peek fox news i m simply not seeing where there s a big appetite among the democratic base for this guy to ride to the rescue if the democrats want a moderate they ve already got biden and believe it or not uncle joe is actually younger than bloomberg as for the socialist wing of the base that s currently propping up warren and sanders bloomberg should be a hard pass this will very likely turn out to be an expensive flop for the former mayor of new york but he ll still probably do better than the current mayor did jazz shaw hot air bloomberg is an effective manager if he were your boss you d feel very comfortable about the future of your company and position but you would also be vexed by the fact that the soda machine in your office only carried v8 and pomegranate juice let s be frank all the gold in fort knox could not get michael bloomberg elected president there is a simple reason for this the man s entire raison d etre is an anti fun agenda that slowly sucks the joy out of life and replaces it with cogs turning wheels in the factory of progress nobody wants that running the country through the deflavorizing machine as woody allen once put it is not a winning message david marcus the federalist if you were a serious progressive wouldn t you be sort of appalled at how the democratic party is allowed to serve as a playground for rich white men who have nothing better to do with their time than light vast eight figure sums of money on fire out of vanity if on the other hand you were a moderate facing accusations that your policies only benefit the billionaire class i somehow doubt you would appreciate having an actual billionaire right there defending all of the same policies if i were bernie sanders or elizabeth warren i would be feeling very good about bloomberg 2020 matthew walther the week
