in florida blamed the rhetoric of the front runner for the violence and the media for ignoring his offensive statements for too long this is what happen when a leading presidential candidate goes around feeding into a narrative of anger and bitterness and frustration rubio said sen ted cruz trump s closest rival in the race noted that in any campaign responsibility starts at the top when the candidate urges supporters to engage in physical violence to punch people in the face the predictable consequence of that is that it escalates cruz told reporters in illinois today is unlikely to be the last such incidence fellow gop candidate john kasich blamedfriday s events ontrump sowing seeds of division some let their opposition to his views slip beyond protest into violence but we can never let that happen the ohio governor said in a statement democratic front runner hillary clinton said the divisive rhetoric of the trump campaign should be of grave concern we all have our
