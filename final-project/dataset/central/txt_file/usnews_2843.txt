july phone call with the president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky i have received information from multiple u s government officials that the president of the united states is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 u s election wrote the unidentified officer who submitted the complaint to the inspector general of the intelligence community this interference includes among other things pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president s main domestic political rivals the complaint also claims that the trump administration tried to conceal the contents of the phone call in which trump requested zelensky look into former vice president joe biden and his son hunter biden s activities in ukraine the transcript was loaded into a separate electronic system that is otherwise used to store and handle classified information of an especially sensitive nature one white house official described this act as an abuse of this electronic system because the call did not contain anything remotely sensitive from a national security perspective the whistleblower wrote news of the allegations rippled across washington even before the report was made public culminating in more than 60 democratic members of the house of representatives announcing their support for an impeachment inquiry since monday as many moderate democrats who had thus far opposed launching a formal impeachment inquiry began endorsing the political process house speaker nancy pelosi made it official overall 220 house members now support an impeachment inquiry trump s actions were a betrayal of his oath of office betrayal of our national security and betrayal of the integrity of our elections pelosi said from the capitol on tuesday therefore today i m announcing the house of representatives is moving forward with an official impeachment inquiry trump has so far denied any wrongdoing referring to the politicization of his conversation with zelensky as nothing more than presidential harassment zelensky also said wednesday while sitting beside trump at the u n that he did not feel pressured by the call here is the entire

procedures outlined in 50 u s c 3033 k 5 a this letter is unclassified when separated from the attachment in the course of my official duties i have received information from multiple u s government officials that the president of the united states is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 u s election this interference includes among other things pressuring a foreign country to investigate one of the president s main domestic political rivals the president s personal lawyer mr rudolph giuliani is a central figure in this effort attorney general barr appears to be involved as well over the past four months more than half a dozen u s officials have informed me of various facts related to this effort the information provided herein was relayed to me in the course of official interagency business it is routine for u s officials with responsibility for a particular regional or functional portfolio to share such information with one another in order to inform policymaking and analysis i was not a direct witness to most of the events described however i found my colleagues accounts of these events to be credible because in almost all cases multiple officials recounted fact patterns that were consistent with one another in addition a variety of information consistent with these private accounts has been reported publicly i am deeply concerned that the actions described below constitute a serious or flagrant problem abuse or violation of law or executive order that does not include differences of opinions concerning public policy matters consistent with the definition of an urgent concern in 50 u s c 3033 k 5 g i am therefore fulfilling my duty to report this information through proper legal channels to the relevant

and to separate out information that i know or have reason to believe is classified for national security purposes 1 if a classification marking is applied retroactively i believe it is incumbent upon the classifying authority to explain why such a marking was applied and to which specific information it pertains i the 25 july presidential phone call early in the morning of 25 july the president spoke by telephone with ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskyy i do not know which side initiated the call this was the first publicly acknowledged call between the two leaders since a brief congratulatory call after mr zelenskyy won the presidency on 21 april multiple white house officials with direct knowledge of the call informed me that after an initial exchange of pleasantries the president used the remainder of the call to advance his personal interests namely he sought to pressure the ukrainian leader to take actions to help the president s 2020 reelection bid according to the white house officials who had direct knowledge of the call the president pressured mr zelenskyy to inter alia the president also praised ukraine s prosecutor general mr yuriy lutsenko and suggested that mr zelenskyy might want to keep him in his position note starting in march 2019 mr lutsenko made a series of public allegations many of which he later walked back about the biden family s activities in ukraine ukrainian officials purported involvement in the 2016 u s election and the activities of the u s embassy in kyiv see part iv for additional context the white house officials who told me this information were deeply disturbed by what had transpired in the phone call they told me that there was already a discussion ongoing with white house lawyers about how to treat the call because of the likelihood in the officials retelling that they had witnessed the president abuse his office for personal gain the ukrainian side was the first to publicly acknowledge the phone call on the evening of 25 july a readout was posted on the website of the ukrainian president that contained the following line translation from original russian language readout aside from the above mentioned cases purportedly dealing with the biden family and the 2016 u s election i was told by white house officials that no other cases were discussed based on my understanding there were approximately a dozen white house officials who listened to the call a mixture of policy officials and duty officers in the white house situation room as is customary the officials i spoke with told me that participation in the call had not been restricted in advance because everyone expected it would be a routine call with a foreign leader i do not know whether anyone was physically present with the president during the call ii efforts to restrict access to records related to the call in the days following the phone call i learned from multiple u s officials that senior white house officials had intervened to lock down all records of the phone call especially the official word for word transcript of the call that was produced as is customary by the white house situation room this set of actions underscored to me that white house officials understood the gravity of what had transpired in the call i do not know whether similar measures were taken to restrict access to other records of the call such as contemporaneous handwritten notes taken by those who listened in iii ongoing concerns on 26 july a day after the call u s special representative for ukraine negotiations kurt volker visited kyiv and met with president zelenskyy and a variety of ukrainian political figures ambassador volker was accompanied in his meetings by u s ambassador to the european union gordon sondland based on multiple readouts of these meetings recounted to me by various u s officials ambassadors volker and sondland reportedly provided advice to the ukrainian leadership about how to navigate the demands that the president had made of mr zelenskyy i also learned from multiple u s officials that on or about 2 august mr giuliani reportedly traveled to madrid to meet with one of president zelenskyy s advisers andriy yermak the u s officials characterized this meeting which was not reported publicly at the time as a direct follow up to the president s call with mr zelenskyy about the cases they had discussed on 9 august the president told reporters i think president zelenskyy is going to make a deal with president putin and he will be invited to the white house and we look forward to seeing him he s already been invited to the white house and he wants to come and i think he will he s a very reasonable guy he wants to see peace in ukraine and i think he will be coming very soon actually iv circumstances leading up to the 25 july presidential phone call beginning in late march 2019 a series of articles appeared in an online publication called the hill in these articles several ukrainian officials most notably prosecutor general yuriy lutsenko made a series of allegations against other ukrainian officials and current and former u s officials mr lutsenko and his colleagues alleged inter alia in several public comments 8 mr lutsenko also stated that he wished to communicate directly with attorney general barr on these matters 9 the allegations by mr lutsenko came on the eve of the first round of ukraine s presidential election on 31 march by that time mr lutsenko s political patron president poroshenko was trailing mr zelenskyy in the polls and appeared likely to be defeated mr zelenskyy had made known his desire to replace mr lutsenko as prosecutor general 4 on 21 april mr poroshenko lost the runoff to mr zelenskyy by a landslide see enclosure for additional information on or about 29 april i learned from u s officials with direct knowledge of the situation that ambassador yovanovitch had been suddenly recalled to washington by senior state department officials for consultations and would most likely be removed from her position on 9 may the new york times reported that mr giuliani planned to travel to ukraine to press the ukrainian government to pursue investigations that would help the president in his 2020 reelection bid on 11 may mr lutsenko met for two hours with president elect zelenskyy according to a public account given several days later by mr lutsenko mr lutsenko publicly stated that he had told mr zelenskyy that he wished to remain as prosecutor general starting in mid may i heard from multiple u s officials that they were deeply concerned by what they viewed as mr giuliani s circumvention of national security decisionmaking processes to engage with ukrainian officials and relay messages back and forth between kyiv and the president these officials also told me during this same timeframe multiple u s officials told me that the ukrainian leadership was led to believe that a meeting or phone call between the president and president zelenskyy would depend on whether zelenskyy showed willingness to play ball on the issues that had been publicly aired by mr lutsenko and mr giuliani note this was the general understanding of the state of affairs as conveyed to me by u s officials from late may into early july i do not know who delivered this message to the ukrainian leadership or when see enclosure for additional information shortly after president zelenskyy s inauguration it was publicly reported that mr giuliani met with two other ukrainian officials ukraine s special anticorruption prosecutor mr
