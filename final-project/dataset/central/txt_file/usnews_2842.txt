this month marks the two year anniversary of the metoo hashtag but it also marks the start of a monumental shift in just a few hours sexual violence including harassment went from a topic seldom discussed on mainstream platforms to one that dominated headlines and affected everything from pop culture to policy debates on oct 15 2017 alyssa milano asked her twitter followers to reply me too if they had been sexually harassed or assaulted a reference to the me too campaign i started in 2006 for millions it was the first time they were invited to open up about the trauma their experiences with sexual violence had caused for hundreds of thousands it was the start of a much needed conversation about safety in our workplaces neighborhoods and communities and for a few hundred it meant a disruption in the harmful toxic behavior they were engaged in using the various seats of power they held what happened two years ago was a historic and critical part of one of the most significant movements in the world but we know it didn t result in the kind of major shift in culture that the movement needs the kind where not only laws and policies change but individuals also feel a sense of responsibility to survivors for the harm that has been done and for the bodily autonomy they all deserve it was a consciousness stirring moment but it s not enough to create awareness what matters is what we do next the u s is just over a year away from the most consequential election in decades and not one remaining presidential candidate has prioritized addressing sexual violence as a platform issue kirsten gillibrand was vocal about it but she s no longer in the race we as survivors aren t just people looking for services we are a constituency looking for change we are working people taxpayers and consumers who push through our trauma every day despite being triggered and erased by a world that tells us our healing isn t important it s been only two years since the movement began to shed light on the behavior of wealthy and powerful predators but we ve already witnessed many of them return to and continue their daily lives without much consequence or repercussions candidates have a responsibility to address the rampant sexual violence that permeates all of society s systems and structures including government if we are talking about sexual violence as a public health crisis and with more than 19 million respondents to the metoo hashtag in the first year alone and a record numbers of calls at rape crisis hotlines across the country i feel confident doing so then it should be talked about with the same seriousness as other topics that have received far more attention policies around race immigration and health care have rightfully taken center stage during the recent presidential debates but something as prevalent as sexual violence an issue spanning and intersecting with all of the above has been largely overlooked sexual violence is a national problem that deserves a national response if we are invested in the outcome of this movement that we ve built then we must ensure that it remains part of the conversation with no presidential candidate that seems willing to truly and publicly grapple with this bipartisan issue we must once again raise our voices we must demand that the men and women who want to represent us in the white house and other political offices speak directly to and respond to our needs and we must be clear that we are ready to vote for accountability in 2020 we deserve a country that values our safety since its health and prosperity depends on our well being i am one person who saw a problem and tried my best to ignore it i tried to ignore it when it happened to me i tried to ignore it when it happened to folks in my family and i tried to ignore it when i saw it ripping my community apart i tried and tried until the part of my heart that has a passion for justice could not ignore it any longer today none of us can justify ignoring it two years ago millions of americans bravely raised their hands to say that their lives had been affected by the scourge that is sexual violence their hands are still raised while we wait for our candidates to answer a question that hasn t even been raised yet what about me too burke is the founder of the me too movement this appears in the october 21 2019 issue of time contact us at editors time com
