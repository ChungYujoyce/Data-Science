 while a fearful nation watched the terrorists attack again striking the caf s of paris and the conference rooms of san bernardino calif donald j trump looked out from his golden manhattan tower divining as he does the unseized opportunity before him toughness was his brand and in a tumultuous political season transgression his method he had already promised once again to water board terrorist suspects and more than that despite international treaties against torture he had even vowed not only to bomb the sh t out of the islamic state fighters in syria but also to take out their families another likely war crime and steal the oil from their land and sell it through american companies then in early december he made his next move an extraordinary call to bar all muslims from entering the u s including tourists and business travelers a direct challenge to the nation s constitutional right to the free exercise of religion i wrote something today that i think is very very salient very important and probably not politically correct he said while laying out his plan in south carolina before cheering throngs but i don t care in times of trial and desperation when institutions fail insecurity mounts and need arises even the most enlightened democratic states can turn inward and break against themselves it is impossible to read the history of the petty republics of greece and italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the distractions with which they were continually agitated wrote alexander hamilton in federalist no 9 published in 1787 james madison warned his nascent nation of the superior force of an interested and overbearing majority to remedy this america s founders forged a union with safeguards due process of law inalienable individual rights and a byzantine electoral system that intentionally slowed popular fury and change yet still the country has been tested over the centuries by demagogues and bigots leaders who broke social and political norms targeted enemies within and rallied the nation against the governing class president obama carpeted the oval office with a quote from martin luther king jr the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends towards justice such sentiments have a demonstrated history of being cast aside in anxious times back in the 1930s disruptive technological change and economic depression gave rise to louisiana s huey long who ruled more like a dictator than a governor disregarding the law as he denounced the billionaire robber barons and called for radical wealth redistribution he was followed in the 1950s by wisconsin senator joseph mccarthy who channeled foreign policy fears into spurious attacks against ideas and the people who held them alabama governor george wallace arrived in the 1960s riding fears of national decline and civil rights through presidential campaigns in which he promised to shake the eyeteeth of national politicians in both parties each was denounced like trump as a leader who appealed improperly to emotion and prejudice to gain power each was a master of the popular spectacle each terrified some and delighted others testing the nation s very identity everything about trump is a challenge a test even for the thousands of people who attend his rallies and cheer his outrages if any other republican candidate piped luciano pavarotti into his campaign events in the deep south people would talk but for trump it was part of a piece you hear him hit that high note there is no one like that he says one day in late november of the late tenor whom he considered a friend trump is standing backstage in birmingham ala before a rally that packs about 9 000 into a room twice the size of a football field on the first day of the regular deer hunting season i change the music around i pick it all he continues pavarotti they love they certainly love something for two hours trump supporters have been shouting their praise over the soundtrack hailing his tell it like it is toughness while confessing the frustrations and fears that grip them rising health costs flat wages bankrupt political leadership threats both foreign and domestic most also mention trump s defiance that lack of concern for what others have said is acceptable he doesn t care who he pisses off one supporter explains he says what everyone wants to say but are afraid to say says another trump can feel it too having just flown in from his palm beach estate which aides have already started calling the winter white house the republican nomination by all rights is within his grasp which means the presidency as well which will bring he promises a new national valhalla a chance to make america great again these are glory days for a man who has never tired of self glorification for five months he has been atop the republican polls by a lot dominant in the press coverage big league taunting the political powers with attitude singular authenticity and aggression we are hotter now than we ever were he says on the other side of the curtain the crowd starts singing along to the na na nas of hey jude he will take the stage soon so trump quickly tries to explain his most important talent the thing responsible for bringing him here now his father used to claim it had to do with real estate my boy has the greatest sense of location fred said but trump now understands it s something more profound i have a sense of people he says i understand people i ve made a lot of money because of people because deals aren t anything other than people o k that sixth sense he continues is what led him to focus hard right from the very start on illegal immigration proposing a 2 000 mile border wall and the forcible deportation of 11 million people i just felt it he says i felt it like i do deals the terrorist attacks triggered the same instinctual response immigration has boiled over into syria he says in a telling logical connection the sound system switches to lynyrd skynyrd s sweet home alabama a southern pride anthem with its ambiguous homage to the segregationist wallace there is a mike offstage as there is before a wrestling match ladies and gentlemen the next president of the united states donald j trump blares the announcer there is din bedlam then trump if by chance you have not given over more than an hour this year to watch one of trump s raucous and rambling rallies here is what you missed high political theater subversive irony triumphant bravado stand up improv and a meanness this country has not seen from a politician for generations this time it s not about nice trump likes to say we have to be mean now when the skynyrd fades trump starts in we re going to have a lot of fun he says by that he means the crowd is with him tonight in a world he will always define as binary winners or losers good or bad strong or weak smart or stupid he throws schoolyard insults at his rivals low energy jeb bush pathological ben carson lightweight marco rubio he orders jeers for the journalists on the press risers look at those bloodsuckers back there he calls pointing be ashamed of yourselves he describes in detail vicious crimes allegedly committed by undocumented mexican migrants he tells folks to keep an eye on their neighbors when you see certain people walking in and out all day carrying things inform your local police he remembers back to the world trade center collapse on sept 11 2001 i watched in jersey city where thousands and thousands of people were cheering as that building was coming down he says so something is going on that never happened there is no news report or video footage of thousands of muslims cheering the attacks but the controversy is his oxygen as with his promise to have a religious test for entry into the nation this libelous charge against an entire city for which trump will never apologize allows him to dominate another two weeks of the presidential campaign news cycle pushing him up in the polls once again that is how trump has been doing it he has a sense for people something else happens while he stands onstage mercutio southall a well known birmingham civil rights activist begins shouting in protest from the middle of the crowd this happens a lot at trump rallies with troubling effects at a september event on capitol hill a young latino protester gets spit on and has her hair pulled by an elderly man trying to shut her up in miami in november the crowd kicks and punches at immigration activists dragging them from the room this time trump notices the disturbance and demands a response get him the hell out of here get him out of here he commands get out southall is a large black man shouting in an almost entirely white crowd in a 73 black city famous for some of the most brutal racial clashes of the 1960s soon regular trump supporters are punching and kicking at him he falls to the floor swings back and is choked a video later shows a blond middle aged woman walk up kick him in the stomach and back away even as he is held by a local plainclothes police officer while on the floor southall says he heard racial epithets directed at him the next day trump is asked about the fight maybe he should have been roughed up the u s presidential candidate responds trump s dark accomplishment is all the more dramatic because he did it alone without outside funding or external advice private pollsters or written speeches he now claims the support of about 30 of republican leaning voters who make up about 42 of the nation s electorate that number may grow or fade but his success has already shifted the country making possible ideas once seen as out of bounds by both the established press and elected officials his proposal to ban muslims from the country was condemned with near unanimity by house speaker paul ryan former vice president dick cheney and most of his 2016 gop rivals trump delighted in crossing such lines before cheering crowds he praised the extrajudicial punishment of sergeant bowe bergdahl who deserted his afghan post and was captured by the taliban they beat the crap out of him which is fine trump said trump even retweeted a racist image filled with statistics that falsely claimed that 81 of white murders in america were committed by blacks in fact whites committed 82 of white murders in 2014 true to form he refused to apologize or correct the error there s a big difference between a tweet and a retweet trump told time afterward it s for other people let them find out if it s correct or not his poll numbers continued to climb in a party once known for projecting strength he cowed all comers and gave millions of americans new hope that their lingering sense of decline and injustice might end you have politicians who just sit around and do politics explained michael williams a 44 year old heating and ventilation repairman with six kids who hasn t voted since 1992 but made his way to a trump rally in south carolina in november he will say what needs to be said sometimes it ain t pretty but the truth ain t pretty sometimes three days after the birmingham rally trump invited time back to his fifth avenue office high above manhattan s holiday shopping celebrations i think there is only one person you can pick he said of the upcoming time person of the year issue it s got to be trump for the next 40 minutes he answered questions in his particular way full of digressions rehashed monologues and boasts his outrage at the state of the world showed no sign of abating they have taken over paris and destroyed it he said at one point about the muslim immigrants of europe wait until you see what happens to germany on the details of his most controversial policy proposals however he remained vague at a recent televised debate he cited a 1954 mass deportation program called operation wetback as proof that his own immigration plan would work the program expelled about 1 million people by sending paramilitary federal agents to round up thousands in public squares and at restaurants and other locales place them on buses trains and boats with minimal due process and ship them south families got separated u s citizens were accidentally forced from their country and some died en route most of the people left because they saw what was going on said trump who knows the history it was a very effective plan in terms of illegal immigration but that doesn t mean he would repeat the program in full i m not saying it s a model because there are things i didn t like about the way they did it he said what his exact plans are however remain a mystery he will not say beyond promising they will be humane he also declined to say whether he would have opposed the forced internment of americans with japanese ancestry during the second world war an event caused by racial prejudice war hysteria and a failure of political leadership according to a reparations law signed by ronald reagan in 1988 i would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer he said it s tough but you know war is tough and winning is tough we don t win anymore seventy two percent of u s latinos one of the fastest growing voting demographics view him unfavorably compared with only 11 who view him favorably according to an october poll by the associated press trump doesn t believe such polls saying they are corrupted by undocumented respondents who claim otherwise if they are legally here i m doing quite well he said he also confessed a new plan to gain back support after he secures the gop nomination if i win one of my first pictures is going to be to get all my hispanic employees and take a picture in some area people will be amazed i have thousands he said they love me i take great care of them a few months ago latino protesters dressed in mock ku klux klan paraphernalia appeared outside trump s offices with a sign that parodied his campaign slogan make america racist again a television crew covering the protest captured video of trump s chief of security keith schiller grabbing the sign which was held on the far side of the sidewalk across from trump s property as schiller started walking into the building a protester efrain galicia grasped at schiller s back he wheeled around and punched galicia in the head the protesters sued and won a court injunction over the opposition of trump s lawyers prohibiting any future interference with protests outside trump s offices trump does not apologize for what happened well these guys were tough guys outside trump said of the protesters they had a lot of problems the incident combined with the clashes at his rallies raises questions about how a president trump would handle public criticism in office disruptive protests of candidates are a feature of our current system and for decades candidates and elected officials have simply waited them out asked if he questions the right to protest he answered succinctly no not at all i have protests asked if he could give assurances that even reporters he despised would keep their credentials for the white house briefing room he said oh yeah i would do that it doesn t mean i would be nice to them i tend to do what i do if people aren t treating me right i don t treat them right but there is a larger question of how trump s tough rhetoric and policies might change the country and the world in ways he does not directly control in late august after a red sox game two brothers from south boston allegedly awoke a sleeping 58 year old latino homeless man by urinating on his head they hit him with their fists and a metal pipe police say one of the brothers later explained his actions by saying donald trump was right all these illegals need to be deported trump eventually tweeted a condemnation after a reporter questioned him about his silence we need energy and passion but we must treat each other with respect he wrote i would never condone violence but when asked months later if he worried that his continued aggressive rhetoric might lead to innocent people getting hurt or other human suffering he seemed unmoved by the danger and unhappy with what he called a very unfair question are you ready he asked brusquely a phrase he often uses to preface an impolitic remark people are getting hurt people are being decimated by illegal immigrants the crime is unbelievable there is no conclusive evidence that undocumented immigrants are more likely to commit violence than anyone else a fact that trump does not dispute a september study by the national academy of sciences found that neighborhoods with greater immigrant concentrations generally have much lower rates of crime and violence foreign born men ages 18 to 39 are incarcerated at one fourth the rate of their native born peers people are getting hurt far greater than something i am going to say trump continued people are getting hurt by our stupidity it seemed an important point of clarification after months of escalating calls for confrontation the trump worldview the us against them bravado that has mobilized a sizable share of the nation has at its core a zero sum equation if the only way to alleviate national suffering is to impose it elsewhere even if the people who must pay reside among us then that is the price that he believes must be paid the families will be bombed the muslims banned the oil taken the trade relationships upended the protesters challenged the migrants deported the suspects tortured you know what darling you re not going to be scared anymore trump told an adolescent girl in north carolina in december they re going to be scared you re not going to be scared this is the grim bet of donald j trump he knows how to read people and he believes his nation is ready for a wartime consigliere a tough guy for a scary time he makes no apologies even when he is wrong or people get pummeled his words are weapons slicing through the national consciousness you know what maybe it s good maybe it s not he allowed as he sat in his tower among the trophies of his glorious life and if it s not that s all right they ll get somebody else and you know what s going to happen our country is going to go to hell that s the choice that trump offers it s now up to the american people to decide if they
