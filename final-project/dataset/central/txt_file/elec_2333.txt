columbia s c ap for i s leevy johnson the democrats search for a challenger to take on president donald trump is personal there is what i call an abt mood in the black community anybody but trump said the 77 year old who was the first black graduate of the university of south carolina s law school it has people of color very motivated and excited about voting this time because they know how his administration has adversely affected them now as the election calendar turns to nevada and south carolina states with substantial minority populations that anybody moves closer to being identified but the next stage in the nominating fight will test candidates such as sens bernie sanders of vermont and amy klobuchar of minnesota and pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana their success thus far has come in front of overwhelmingly white electorates in iowa and new hampshire it s also a potential last comeback opportunity for former vice president joe biden he finished poorly in those first two contests but argues he has durable support among the minority voters who will soon make their choices nevada s caucuses are this coming saturday and will feature a growing population of latinos african americans asian americans and pacific islanders yet no single place in the early going is as important as south carolina up to two thirds of voters in the feb 29 primary could be african american biden more than any other candidate must show he can win their allegiance one candidate who will not be tested in nevada or south carolina is mike bloomberg the former new york mayor and billionaire owner of a financial services and media empire bloomberg has spent heavily from his personal fortune in states with sizable minority populations that will vote in the march 3 primaries the super tuesday contests are the first where his name will appear on the ballot it adds up to a muddled field that lacks clarity even after iowa and new hampshire had their turns moderates have splintered their votes and created space for sanders a self described democratic socialist to take on the mantle of a front runner without having reached 30 in either of the first two voting states that intensifies the spotlight as minority voters in nevada and south carolina in trying to clarify the party s search for anybody to match against trump the system is garbage said jason johnson a professor at morgan state university and a high profile african american political commentator he argued that the primary calendar should immediately subject candidates not just to racial and ethnic diversity but also regional and ideological differences and the full city to farm spectrum i m not sure this process actually can identify the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump he said jason johnson said he doesn t blame the candidates because they are merely reacting to a process that harms everybody but i s leevy johnson the south carolina businessman and lawyer said it too easily makes key constituencies in the party an afterthought people of color are tired of these promises that candidates are going to do things and when they make those promises when they get elected they don t perform he said even belatedly the remaining candidates certainly are trying sanders fell short in 2016 to hillary clinton for the nomination in no small part because of his struggles to attract older nonwhite voters for 2020 he has hired as a senior adviser one of the top latino strategists in the party chuck rocha sanders lead surrogates include nina turner a former ohio state lawmaker and leading black progressive and u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york the young progressive icon sanders campaign buoyed by strong grassroots fundraising has invested heavily in social media and radio advertising targeting black and latino audiences including stations on spotify and pandora i think we re going to do very well in the african american community sanders said in a brief interview i think we re going to do well among working people of all races in nevada biden campaigned on saturday in a high school gymnasium covered in signs that read biden trabajando por nevada biden works for nevada the reason why we are here 99 of the african american vote hasn t spoken yet and 99 of the latino vote hasn t spoken yet he hammered away at trump s immigration policies and rhetoric but biden has embraced south carolina especially even skipping out on his new hampshire primary night party last tuesday for a hastily arranged event in columbia the south carolina capital biden is banking on voters such as jean hopkins an 88 year old retired nurse who came to hear him you ll lose some but you may gain more she said of his losses in iowa and new hampshire and he s not going to stop he needs our help biden and sanders lead in endorsements from members of south carolina s legislative black caucus biden also promotes a network of black religious leaders who back his candidacy but he s facing a push from california billionaire tom steyer who has spent considerable sums on advertising in south carolina we are really serious about south carolina we are really serious about nevada steyer said on cbs face the nation on sunday he said those states reflect the kind of diversity that is america and that is the democratic party and i think whoever is going to be the candidate has got to be able to show that he or she can pull together that diverse big tent that is the democratic party in nevada biden has the backing of the state s lone black congressman steven horsford and dina titus who represents the diverse las vegas based district but there s a wild card in south carolina u s rep jim clyburn the highest ranking black member of congress is close to biden but hasn t said whether he will endorse at all clyburn is the rare political figure whose public blessing could matter to voters i think that we re going to have a real spirited contest clyburn told cbs face the nation on sunday he said steyer was doing an incredible job money makes a difference steyer has it he s been spending it and he s reaping the rewards clyburn added that buttigieg is doing very good and biden is leading among african american voters in south carolina by a wide margin buttigieg is dispatching minority surrogates such as mayor quentin hart of waterloo iowa and former iowa state rep deborah berry bloomberg in the same week he spent confronting criticism of his record on race launched a mike for black america effort alongside black endorsers including muriel bowser the mayor of washington d c the chairman of the texas democratic party gilberto hinojosa whose state is among the biggest delegate prizes on super tuesday praised all the remaining candidates but he lamented that several minority candidates including some political heavyweights were forced from the field either before voting began or after the first two contests among them julian castro a former obama cabinet secretary kamala harris a california senator cory booker a new jersey senator and deval patrick a former massachusetts governor in south carolina i s leevy johnson offered similar laments noting that he had supported harris and now must hope a white nominee selects her or another person of color as the vice presidential nominee regardless johnson projected optimism i just don t think people should misinterpret the impact of those two outcomes in iowa and new hampshire he said now he said the sleeping giant of nonwhite voters can emerge if the giant rises up and goes to battle in november someone opposing trump will be victorious barrow reported from las vegas and columbia south carolina associated press reporters alan fram in washington
