them to the nra wall street big oil big insurance and big pharma when it comes to big money influence on our political system and more people are willing to call out their support for netanyahu s corruption and right wing inhumane policies he added good for candidates for taking a stand and we expect that to be a growing trend aipac has been at odds with democratic positions in the past the group lobbied hard against obama s 2015 nuclear deal with iran and some members of the audience booed pelosi when she spoke at the conference in 2007 and criticized the iraq war more recently progressives see aipac as aligned with trump and netanyahu whose policies they despise netanyahu s reelection campaign for example has sparked outrage for moves seen as anti arab including making a deal with a far right political party it s unclear whether any democratic candidates were invited this year an aipac spokesman declined to comment on whether the organization invited any candidates as well as what the organization thinks the pressure for candidates to skip means for democratic policies on israel going forward an official did note on background that we have not had candidates in off years in the past liberal groups though see the decision by some democratic candidates not to attend as a significant development certainly i think this is a notable change from previous years said logan bayroff communications director for j street noting obama s and clinton s appearances while this year s event has several congressional democrats scheduled to attend few if any are considered to be the party s rising stars bayroff said adding that it does send a pretty obvious message about aipac s place among the democratic base j street a liberal advocacy group whose stated mission is to help end the arab israeli and israeli palestinian conflicts has not called on 2020 democrats to avoid the conference with bayroff saying it s their choice to make instead the group has urged those who do attend to denounce netanyahu s policies there are two different ways to distance yourself from netanyahu according to bayroff speak out at the conference or skip it we re seeing one of those outcomes play out right now updated 3 55 p m view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the contents of this site are 2020
