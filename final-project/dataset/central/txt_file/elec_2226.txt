under attack from other democratic 2020 candidates in a televised debate there were sharp exchanges on healthcare and the southern border between the frontrunner and nine other hopefuls on stage in detroit in an echo of the last debate in june senator kamala harris launched another assault on mr biden s record on race but she herself had to defend her actions against drug offenders when she was a prosecutor in california she put over 1 500 people in jail for marijuana violations then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana said hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard and as the candidates were introduced mr biden and ms harris shared their first exchange of the night with the former vice president saying go easy on me kid mr biden was criticised during the last debate in june for being unprepared amid fierce criticism of his ties to two democratic senators who had favoured racial segregation but he seemed better equipped to respond on wednesday it was the second of two nights of debates among democrats vying to win the presidential nomination which will be announced next july at the party s convention tuesday s debate saw heavyweights bernie sanders and elizabeth warren come under attack from more centrist candidates the presidential election will take place in november 2020 the line up was chosen at random by cnn who hosted the event in addition to mr biden and ms harris the debaters were the former vice president came into the detroit debate with a giant target on his back kamala harris had drawn blood with her attacks in the first debate and weakness begets weakness i think democrats are expecting some engagement here biden said to begin the debate and i expect we ll get it he got it alright he clashed with harris on healthcare both harris and cory booker blasted his record on criminal justice reform he took shots from juli n castro on immigration jay inslee went after him on climate change kirsten gillibrand questioned old comments he had made about the place of women in the workplace he didn t have a clean slate by any means there were several moments where he displayed the kind of stumbles that typified his first debate he did however mount a vigorous defence of his record and policies there were moments where he displayed the kind of fire he s had in the past his performance won t put all the questions about his age and political dexterity to bed but it more than steadied the ship read anthony s analysis in full the first question tackled healthcare and medicare for all the single payer health system plan popularised by senator sanders mr biden said that expanding president barack obama s affordable care act was the best way to fix problems in the system quickly in their first back and forth of the debate ms harris answered that her medicare for all plan would allow people to sign up from day one while mr biden s proposal leaves out 10 million americans the former vice president responded that ms harris s policy would cost too much take too long and raise taxes for the middle class and he asked what happens in the meantime the cost of doing nothing is far too expensive ms harris said the candidates next offered their takes on immigration policy which saw mr biden clash with mr castro over decriminalising illegal border crossings mr biden called out mr castro who was also a member of mr obama s administration for not speaking up about the issue at that time he also said decriminalising it would be unfair to people around the world who also wanted to come to the us but had to wait in line when people cross the border illegally it is illegal to do it unless they re seeking asylum mr biden said people should have to get in line another heated exchange followed when the candidates were asked about criminal justice reform this time between mr biden and mr booker since the 1970s every crime bill major and minor has had his name on it mr booker said of mr biden you claimed responsibility for those laws and you can t just now come out with a plan to put out that fire mr biden hit back by criticising mr booker s record during his time as mayor of newark and issues with police corruption ms harris and ms gabbard also shared a sharp debate over criminal justice when ms gabbard said ms harris ought to apologise to those she had jailed as a prosecutor in california ms gabbard accused ms harris of extending jail sentences forcing ms harris to defend her prosecutorial record several candidates called the healthcare and education policies of bernie sanders and elizabeth warren who represent the left most wing of their party unrealistic and not the best way for the party to defeat president trump the politicians disagreed over whether to keep border crossings illegal and whether reparations should be paid to black americans for the crime of slavery but the 10 hopefuls largely agreed when it came to gun violence dark money in politics and the need to urgently address climate change only 10 candidates will qualify for the next debate in september based on polling and fundraising for now mr biden continues to maintain a significant lead in the polls choose a candidate and filter by category this is the first time the social media giant has said president trump s tweet could be misleading have you been getting these songs wrong what happens
