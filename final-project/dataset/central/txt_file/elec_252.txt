counties across the country that will determine the outcome of the 2020 presidential election the critical tipping points are as diverse as the american electorate some are suburban neighborhoods where both trump and former president obama won others are longtime republican strongholds that show signs of slipping still others have voted democratic since the new deal only to be broken by trump

margins democratic success there will be a sign that the party has bridged the divide with its own voters who feel left behind sauk county wis the historical home of the ringling brothers circus has become a political circus itself as once genteel wisconsin politics has descended into acrimonious partisanship the tension is evident in sauk county west of madison where small towns interrupt miles of farmland and where an influx of commuters to the growing capital have set up a clash between the red rurals and the blue sprawl back in the day wisconsin farm country used to more consistently go for democrats said brian reisinger a republican strategist who was raised in sauk county the rural shift toward republicans is partially offset by the number of madison types who are crossing over the county line to live in small towns where taxes are lower and the world makes more sense sauk county has predicted the winner of wisconsin s electoral votes in nine of the past 10 presidential elections trump was the first republican to carry the county in 28 years when he won it by just 109 votes out of about 30 000 cast he carried wisconsin s electoral votes by about eight tenths of a percentage point muskegon county mich the first western outposts established on lake michigan were set up by french traders as the war of 1812 raged muskegon takes its name from the ottawa indian word for marshy river or swamp today its economy is dominated by a struggling manufacturing industry and a growing health care sector though the county has voted democratic in every presidential election since 1992 clinton won it by just 1 200 votes the closest margin of any county in michigan which gave its electoral votes to trump muskegon will be indicative of the statewide vote in the next election said holly hughes who represented the area in the michigan legislature and served on the republican national committee hughes said she had fielded a call from george w bush s campaign in 2000 asking her for results from a county they believed would mirror the statewide results if trump continues making inroads there he would keep michigan s electoral votes in his column maricopa county ariz as partisan politics increasingly break down along urban and rural lines arizona republicans are becoming more nervous arizona is the most urbanized state in the republican column and its most urban county maricopa shows signs of inching left in 2016 trump beat clinton in maricopa county by just 3 percentage points a slightly lower margin than his statewide edge only one republican in recent history has won a statewide election without winning maricopa county the areas most at risk for republicans are middle class precincts where college educated residents tend to make between 50 000 and 100 000 a year said mike noble a republican pollster in phoenix it s in these suburban areas where we are seeing the biggest shift in party voter preference noble said those who are college educated or above is where the gop is currently hurting phoenix s rapid growth is being fueled by young workers in search of a good job who tend to bring their blue state voting habits with them in

troubling trend for the state s dominant republican party their margins of victory are declining even in historically red regions tarrant county home of fort worth is one of those regions republicans there peaked in 2004 when bush scored 62 percent of the vote or 349 000 votes twelve years later trump won just 52 percent of the vote or 346 000 votes two years after that then rep beto o rourke d

the progressive group progress texas there is a greater discomfort among republicans with the rhetoric coming from the president and the party in texas than there might be in dallas or other places tarrant county hasn t voted for a democrat since lyndon johnson won his home state in 1964 but its booming population may change that since republicans began losing market share there about 40 percent of the county s residents are new new hanover county n c some of the first british settlers along the north carolina tidewater settled in new hanover precinct named for the german house that ruled

historic advantage there is shrinking obama came within 1 400 votes of winning new hanover county in 2008 and trump became the first republican to win less than half the vote since george h w bush split the conservative vote with ross perot in 1992 like most of the state s larger cities wilmington has seen an influx of urban white liberals making the city more democratic wrote john wynne a north carolina elections analyst at the same time affluent retirees who tend to vote republican are settling along the beaches trump won the county by 2 9 percentage points he won north carolina by 3 6 points peach county ga about a hundred miles south of atlanta lies one of the country s clearest examples of a combined racial and geographic divide in the middle of rural georgia peach county s residents are about half white and 45 percent african american about half live in its cities and half live in rural areas those divides might as well be partisan stand ins peach county is one of a few hundred pivot counties in america counties that voted for obama twice and trump in 2016 in 1968 the segregationist george wallace took 42 percent of the vote there it s struggling like most rural communities are in georgia said dubose porter a former chairman of the state democratic party we re losing health care providers we re losing hospitals we re losing manufacturing and we re not replacing that with anything in a county of just 27 000 people every vote counts last time around peach county stood as a bellwether for the entire state trump took 50 3 percent of the vote almost perfectly matched his performance statewide 50 4 percent in 2018 republican brian kemp scored 52 percent of the vote in his bid for governor beating out democrat stacey abrams by just under 500 votes washington county minn minnesota represents one of a small number of states that voted for clinton in 2016 that presents trump with a chance to expand his map in 2020 if he wants to win here he must carry washington county along the border with wisconsin the first white settlers arrived along the banks of the st croix river to log its rich forests in 1838 early residents in stillwater the county seat formally petitioned congress to create a new state called minnesota today its residents are more likely to commute to the booming twin cities a fifth of its residents have moved in since 2000 blending its rural roots with exurban sprawl washington county voted twice for george w bush then twice for obama clinton carried washington county by just 1 8 percentage points almost exactly the margin by which she carried minnesota as a whole president trump has already transformed rural politics in his favor so increasing support from suburban voters will be key to the outcome of the election said former gov tim pawlenty r who carried washington county in both his runs for governor hillsborough county n h another opportunity for the trump campaign to pick up electoral votes comes in new hampshire a state clinton won by fewer than 3 000 votes trump could close that gap by winning a bigger margin in hillsborough county the largest in the state where he led clinton by fewer than 500 votes named for the british secretary who oversaw the colonies hillsborough was a historically republican county dating back to the 19th century but party affiliations have changed as more bostonians move north and commute back to the city obama won hillsborough twice and while trump won narrowly in 2016 there are signs of serious discontent the 2018 midterm elections wiped out many hillsborough members of the state legislature today democrats hold two thirds of the state house districts in the county hillsborough tends to represent the state in terms of electoral outcomes said

that makes a difference in such an evenly divided state lincoln county maine lincoln county reflects many of today s most fraught political dividing lines all in one and all well balanced for two centuries it has been a working class hub home of shipbuilding industries and the lobster fisheries that give maine its distinctive contribution to american cuisine at the same time its picturesque
