follow the rahm emanuel 2006 model chicago mayor rahm emanuel the former white house chief of staff was the campaign czar for house democrats the last time they won the house majority in 2006 while a part of emanuel s game plan was to recruit top candidates across the country he also focused on the suburbs a hotbed for moderate voters that dems say will be the key to victory in 2018 many of the

scandal in the months leading up to the election democrats say the political climate is even more poisonous for republicans now for one thing trump s white house is shrouded in the russia investigation and republican incumbents are dropping like flies in the words of one democratic strategist helping to win back the house they re imploding the democrat said all we need to do is let them unravel while holding firm to our issues find the right candidates call this the doug jones rule democrats think jones won in alabama because he was the right candidate to have in the race when

conviction for two ku klux klan members who bombed a baptist church in birmingham in 1963 one of the things we ve got to do is recruit candidates who are compatible with the districts they represent said rep emanuel cleaver d mo if we re ever going to win again in the south we ve got to put candidates up that people in the south will vote for make the politics local while voters are attuned to what s happening nationally what they care most about is what happens in their backyards the research we have done shows that each of these races will be won by focusing on local issues that matter to the day to day lives of voters said former rep ellen tauscher d calif who launched the super pac fight back california aimed at winning seven congressional seats in the golden state voters in these districts are tired of polarizing partisan arguments at the national level they want members of congress to focus on the issues that matter most in their daily lives she said in rep jeff denhamjeffrey

plans to focus on water issues along with jobs the economy and homelessness none of this is to say that trump won t be a big part of the story in november every midterm election in history has had something to do with the president and trump s unconventional presidency will be the biggest overriding issue in november but as democrats talk about the midterms expect them to try to talk about specific issues in their districts in addition to trump cleaver puts it this way let trump demonize himself don t do it for him i don t like the man but i think we make a terrible terrible mistake if our priority is to demonize president trump in new ways he said i think president trump has done a good job of demonizing himself cleaver is speaking to the fears many democrats hold that if their attacks are on trump are too aggressive it could backfire impeachment votes which democratic leaders have sought to contain but which the grass roots loves is an example of the push pull going on in the party we have to tell people what we want and what we believe in cleaver said view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax
