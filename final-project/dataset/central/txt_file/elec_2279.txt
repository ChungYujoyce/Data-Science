comments about mexican immigrants made by real estate mogul and gop presidential candidate donald trump saying that they have no tolerance for discrimination in any form we welcome all customers and respect for the dignity of all people is a cornerstone of our culture the cincinnati based company said in a statement we are disappointed and distressed by recent remarks about immigrants from mexico in light of statements made by donald trump we have decided to discontinue our business relationship trump s menswear collection which includes ties shirts suits and accessories has been sold at macy s since 2004 macy s is the latest company to distance itself from trump who s hoping to win the republican presidential nomination nbc and univision have already cut ties following the comments he made during his presidential announcement speech on june 16 in which he said people coming into the united states from mexico are bringing drugs they re bringing crime they re rapists and some i assume are good people following macy s announcement trump fired back at both the retailer and nbc in a statement released on his instagram account stating that he was the one who decided to cut ties with macy s and on twitter clearly nbc and macy s support illegal immigration which is totally detrimental to the fabric of our one great country trump s statement said both macy s and nbc totally caved at the first sight of potential difficulty with professional agitators who are not looking out for the people they purport to represent but only for themselves later trump tweeted a reminder that macy s last year paid a 650 000 new york state fine to settle complaints including from a treme cast member that store staffers racially profiled shoppers accused of stealing trump overlooked the possibility the embarrassing fine might give macy s a stronger reason not to be associated with trump s rhetoric about mexicans and in other trump trouble his hotel organization confirmed to usa today
