resolution soared after both sides expressed optimism following talks in beijing last week speaking to reporters at the white house at the start of a meeting with chinese vice premier liu he trump said some of the tougher points of a deal had been agreed but there were still differences to be bridged we re getting very close to making a deal that doesn t mean a deal is made because it s not but

liu he according to state run news agency xinhua liu he told trump that xi believed under his and trump s leadership china u s relations will make new and greater progress xi said that in the past

leverage at least for now asked about the benefits of an agreement for china trump said it s going to be great for china in that china will continue to trade with the united states i mean otherwise it would be very tough for us to allow that to happen goods trade between the united states and china the world s two largest economies totaled 660 billion last year according to u s census bureau data consisting of imports of 540 billion from china and 120 billion in exports to china on china s behalf liu cited great progress in the talks because of trump s direct involvement and expressed hope
