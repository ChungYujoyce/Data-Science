something extraordinary happened in the middle east in the wake of this global pandemic palestinians and israelis put aside their differencesand pledged to work together to stop the spread of covid 19 it should be a lesson to all of us if these two adversaries can find a way to stop fighting why can t americans crises have a way of bringing us together but unfortunately partisanship is alive and well in the united states a recentreuterspoll found that fourin 10 democrats view the pandemic as a threat while just twoin 10 republicans agree meanwhile aquinnipiac pollfound similarly sharp divides when it came to the president s coronavirus response to be sure collaboration hasn t been nonexistent house democrats and republicans came together to pass a financial aid bill that awaits consideration in the senate and there appears to bebipartisan supportfor sending stimulus money to americans but too many pundits and politicians are still using covid 19 as an excuse to push partisan politics legitimate concerns have been raised about how the trump administration has handled the response to covid 19 but telling the president that he needs to shut up only serves to inflame an already tense situation likewise calling vice president joe biden a rotting corpse is the kind of juvenile name calling that has no place in government during a time of national crisis shared humanity is what brought palestinians and israelis together and it can do the same for us we lead an organization common ground committee dedicated to highlighting what brings us together here are attributesamericans from the halls of congress to newsrooms to the streets of our cities and towns should adopt in discussions about covid 19 to focus our efforts on getting through this challenge according to theworld health organization there is about 142 times more disinformation about covid 19than there is legitimate information much of that comes from erroneous social media posts but it s also a reminder that we need to leave our media echo chambers according topew republicans were more likely to trust fox news than any other media source while democrats gravitated towardcnn and msnbc at a recent common ground committeeforum we brought together fox news chris wallace andthe new york times maggie haberman one of the most important points they agreed on was the need to improve our media literacy talking it out learning to discuss complicated issues ahead of the election we want to hear from you be a part of the solution to finding solutions tell us here as information about covid 19 spreads consider the source of any information you share make sure it is sourced from a recognized authority such as who rather than someone with an agenda in times like these we must shelve ideological battles and focus on solving the problem approach discussions about coronavirus with an objective of trying to agree on how we can best solve the crisis and make the mental commitment not to push a partisan agenda that s what past members of thetrump and obama administrationsdid when they came together to call for the government to increase the federal medicaid matching rate we re not going to agree on everything nor should we but political objectives should not be a barrier to obtaining and sharing accurate information and productive debate especially when americans are looking to their leaders for stability and solutions we all carry personal beliefs biases and opinions as conversations about the outbreak continue be aware of yours be willing to test them against new information and recognize when they may be closing your thoughts to other views most important be respectful of people s fears and concerns even if you don t agree they are merited if you have a friend or family member concerned by the administration s response to covid 19 your first instinct should not be to lash out because you agree with the president instead take the time to understandwhythey are concerned you may not ultimately agree but you will both better understand each other s perspectives and thereby help each other make better decisions in this uncertain environment if two peoples who have a history as violent as palestinians and israelis can find a way to put their differences aside there is no reason we can t do the same agreeing on bipartisan legislation was a great first step now we need to put political views and objectives on the backburner and focus on doing what is necessary to help ourselves and others successfully make it through this pandemic we all can do this let s make a pledge across the political spectrum to drop political agendas and work together bruce bond and erik olsen are co founders ofcommon ground committee a citizen led initiative focused on demonstrating productive public discourse
