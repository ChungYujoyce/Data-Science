vermont is a front runner in the democratic race for president the registered independent has performed well in the first states to vote and is poised for further victory as millions of americans head the polls on tuesday so who is he senator bernie sanders likes beating the odds his first political victory running in 1981 for mayor of burlington vermont pitted him against the democratic machine that had controlled the city for decades mr sanders won by a margin of 10 votes but the political newcomer still faced formidable resistance from within the city government on vermont s city council 11 of 13 members opposed mr sanders and actively conspired against his agenda this same democratic machine worked to thwart his re election two years later but mr sanders emerged triumphant this time by more than 20 percentage points the battle offered an early taste of mr sanders career which has represented a nearly 40 year challenge to the political establishment bouncing back from a bitter loss to former us first lady and secretary of state hillary clinton in 2016 mr sanders is running again for the top prize this time around he s suffered a heart attack and fundraised more than 167m 130m here s a look at who he is and what the self proclaimed democratic socialist stands for mr sanders was born in brooklyn new york to jewish parents he once said his humble upbringing in a tiny apartment made him class conscious at an early age he attended the university of chicago and in the 1960s and 1970s participated in anti war and civil rights activism like the 1963 march on washington he applied for conscientious objector status during the vietnam war though he was too old to be drafted by the time his application was rejected mr sanders entered politics in 1971 running for a us senate seat in vermont as a liberty union candidate a party with anti war and socialist roots he lost that race along with a couple of campaigns to become governor his first major political success came when he was elected mayor of burlington vermont in 1980 beating a six term incumbent he went on to serve four terms it was during this time that he met and married his current wife jane o meara the former president of burlington college once described as a key adviser in his political career combined they have four children from previous relationships he was first elected to the us house of representatives in 1990 the first independent to do so in 40 years he served there until he ran for and won a seat in the senate in 2007 during that campaign a younger barack obama stumped for him since first arriving in washington mr sanders has assailed republican and democratic politicians alike as being beholden to wealthy donors and industries for this he was sometimes dismissed as a gadfly he is the longest serving independent in congressional history in 2010 he famously stood and spoke for eight and a half hours to attempt to block the extension of bush era tax policies that mr sanders said benefited the rich and worsened the nation s income gap he became the chairman of the senate committee on veterans affairs in 2013 and helped negotiate bipartisan solutions when former soldiers complained of dangerously delayed and inadequate care around the country he was a staunch opponent of the iraq war he is fond of praising the social policies of nordic countries like universal healthcare and paid leave for new parents he wants to make college free and erase all student debt mr sanders has been attacked for his voting record on gun control including his past opposition to various forms of the brady bill which required background checks and waiting periods for gun purchasers now the senator from firearms friendly vermont supports measures like expanded background checks for gun purchases something he voted against in congress in 1993 the world has changed and my views have changed he said this year at the new hampshire presidential debate in 2016 during his last presidential run mr sanders jumped into the democratic race as a long shot candidate squaring off against establishment favourite hillary clinton but once again mr sanders confounded expectations setting fundraising records and for a time casting doubt on the once seemingly inevitable nomination of mrs clinton now anti establishment tone intact mr sanders is running on a characteristically progressive platform featuring medicare for all a 15 minimum wage and tuition free public college he is quick to note that many items on his agenda once deemed radical are now embraced by democrats still some democratic leaders remain sceptical that mr sanders could win their party s nomination a degree of doubt that seems to galvanize him in october his candidacy appeared in peril after mr sanders suffered a minor heart attack and was forced to suspend his campaign the episode reignited criticism that mr sanders is too old to compete for the presidency the vermont senator who will be 79 by election day would be the oldest us president in history but within weeks he was back bolstered by an endorsement from alexandria ocasio cortez the party s liberal darling and youngest ever us congresswoman mr sanders is an unapologetic curmudgeon he shrugged off a claim by mrs clinton that nobody likes him saying on a good day my wife likes me and few other candidates could get away with telling a voter s crying baby to keep that down but mr sanders supporters say it goes to show he is authentic he now draws crowds in the tens of thousands as he makes the case that the 2020 election will be won because of his principle and policy not in spite of it heading into super tuesday in which millions of voters in 14 states will cast their ballot for the democratic nominee mr sanders leads rivals joe biden and elizabeth warren and if the outsider candidate is able to clinch victory in those states he may be poised to beat the odds once again this is the first time the social media giant has said president trump s tweet could be misleading have you been getting these songs wrong what happens to your body in extreme heat
