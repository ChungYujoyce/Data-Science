crowded primary a cnn poll released tuesday found that combating climate change is the no 1 issue of concern for democratic voters beating out health care gun control and action on college admissions the greatest threat we face which will test our country our democracy every single one of us is climate change o rourke said in a statement when rolling out his plan the trump administration has gutted the environmental protection agency rolled back clean air and clean water protections and allowed polluters to go unchecked causing immense harm and suffering by vulnerable communities booker said when announcing his environmental groups see the rollout of the various climate proposals as proof that democratic contenders are both taking global warming seriously and realizing voters do too i think we re seeing these proposals coming because it s clear that americans want leaders who will stand up to the fossil fuel industry that created this climate crisis said charlie jiang a climate campaigner for greenpeace i think all the candidates we re seeing in the field recognize that climate action and climate justice are top of mind for americans in 2020 may boeve executive director of 350 action said the growing support for climate action also means candidates are no longer distinguishing themselves by simply believing in climate change but by developing policies to fix it voters are making clear that climate change is a top priority issue in this presidential election and we will support the boldest vision to transform our economy and stop climate wrecking fossil fuel projects boeve said in a statement we look forward to seeing the candidates debate their climate plans strengthen them and help build a sustainable vision for our future all four candidates have also

inslee s climate plans so far address the overall question of how to stop u s carbon emissions each proposal focuses on a duel purpose of moving the country off fossil fuels and investing in green jobs to grow the economy inslee s plan is similar to the green new deal in that it aims to completely transition to clean energy by 2030 but the governor also leaves open the door to using nuclear power an energy sector to which some environmental groups are staunchly opposed o rourke s plan meanwhile has generated criticism for not setting a shorter timeline to achieve emissions reductions his proposal would invest 5 trillion to cut the country s greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 the sunrise movement a youth action group that backs the green new deal initially knocked that plan for not going far enough ocasio cortez told the hill that it should be more aggressive the sunrise movement later walked back the remarks saying they came out too hot and support the direction of o rourke s plan even if they want to see more o rourke later committed to the group that he would not take campaign donations from the fossil fuel industry the sunrise movement on friday embraced inslee s climate plan calling it a spirited commitment to bold climate action that young people are looking for in our next president inslee is the only democratic candidate running his campaign entirely on climate action yet his relatively low name recognition as a western state governor means he faces an uphill battle in the polls while a focus on the leading issue of climate may work in his favor he s not the only candidate looking for a green boost inslee argues his plan is very achievable and that his focus on climate change is more than a flash in the pan a jab at his democratic rivals it is a plan that has shown a visceral commitment to climate action not just in the past 72 hours but the past decade inslee told the hill in an interview i m the first and only candidate that announced this will be job no 1 inslee said it is the first priority and the top priority and my foremost obligation it can t be something you just do the first day you have to do it everyday view the discussion
