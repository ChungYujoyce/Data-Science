and drug administration recently granted an emergency use authorization of a blood test for antibodies against sars cov 2 the novel coronavirus that causes covid 19 it is the first such test to receive approval for the u s market and it comes at a time when health experts and leaders are embracing immunity as a potential end point to the pandemic in colorado a company that makes a coronavirus antibody test has donated kits to the state s san miguel county so that everyone there can be tested if they want to and in italy politicians want to use antibody status to determine which people will get back to work passes severalambitious surveysto test for these antibodieshave now been launched around the globe theworld health organization s solidarity iistudywill pool antibody data from more than half a dozen countries intheu s a collaborative multiyear projectaims to provide a picture of nationwide antibody prevalence its first phaseis already collectingsamples from blood donors in six major urban areas including new york city seattleand minneapolis and the effort will evolve into three national surveys of donors supported by the centers for disease control and prevention and conducted this fall and in the fall of 2021 unlike diagnostic tests which are used to confirm the presence and sometimes load or amount of the virus antibody tests help determine whether or not someone was previously infected even if that person never showed symptoms widespread use of such assays could give scientists greater insight into how deadly the virus is and how widely it has spread throughout the population it is less clear what those antibody tests mean for real life however because immunity functions on a continuum with some pathogens such as the varicella zoster virus which causes chicken pox infection confers near universal long lasting resistance natural infection with clostridium tetani the bacterium that causes tetanus on the other hand offers no protection and even people getting vaccinated for it require regular booster shots on the extreme end of this spectrum individuals infected with hiv often have large amounts of antibodies that do nothing to prevent or clear the disease at this early stage of understanding the new coronavirus it is unclear where covid 19 falls on the immunity spectrum although most people with sars cov 2 seem to produce antibodies we simply don t know yet what it takes to be effectively protected from this infection says dawn bowdish a professor of pathology and molecular medicine and canada research chair in aging and immunity at mcmaster university in ontario researchers are scrambling to answer two questions how long do sars cov 2 antibodies stick around and do they protect against reinfection early on some people most notably u k prime minister boris johnson who has the virus and is currently in intensive care and his government s scientific adviser patrick vallance touted hopes that herd immunity could be an eventual means for ending the pandemic and although it appears that recovered covid 19 patients have antibodies for at least two weeks long term data are still lacking so many scientists are looking to other coronaviruses for answers immunity to seasonal coronaviruses such as those that cause common colds for example starts declining a couple of weeks after infection and within a year some people are vulnerable to reinfection that observation is disconcerting when experts say it is unlikely we will have a vaccine for covid 19 within 18 months but studies of sars cov the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome or sars which shares a considerable amount of its genetic material with sars cov 2 are more promising antibody testing shows sars cov immunity peaks at around four months and offers protection for roughly two to three years as preeti malani chief health officer and a professor of medicine at the university of michigan said in a video interview with jama editor in chief howard bauchner this period presents a pretty good time line for thinking about vaccines and therapeutics for covid 19 even if the antibodies stick around in the body however it is not yet certain that they will prevent future infection what we want bowdish says are neutralizing antibodies these are the proteins that reduce and prevent infection by binding to the part of a virus that connects to and unlocks host cells they are relatively easy to detect and they are far easier for vaccine developers to generate than the alternative the immune system s t cells in contrast nonneutralizing antibodies still recognize parts of the pathogen but they do not bind effectively and so do not prevent it from invading cells if humans naturally make neutralizing antibodies against sars cov 2 then all we have to do is figure out what sites they are binding on the virus and really target that one little piece of protein and that s our magic bullet bowdish says for sars cov 2 that target site is most likely on the so called receptor binding domain of its spike glycoprotein a protein attached to a sugar that the virus uses to enter cells but bowdish says this spot may present a challenge because human immune systems are not very good at making antibodies against sugar coated substances nevertheless a few small studies of cells in laboratory dishessuggest that sars cov 2 infection triggers the production of neutralizing antibodies and animal studies indicate such antibodies do prevent reinfection at least for a couple of weeks furthermore because some antibodies seem to recognize and react to the spike proteins on multiple coronaviruses including sars cov and mers cov the virus that causes middle east respiratory syndrome or mers researchers can build on knowledge learned from previous outbreaks research on real life immunity to sars cov 2 is in its preliminary stages and uncertainties remain one study found no correlation between viral load and antibody presence leading the authors to question the antibodies actual role in clearing the virus in humans in addition peer reviewed research on sars cov and preprint studies on sars cov 2 report that some nonneutralizing coronavirus antibodies might trigger a harmful immune response upon reinfection with those pathogens or cross infection with other coronaviruses thus while much of the emerging research is promising bowdish cautions against using antibody testing to drive policy until researchers know the proportion of covid 19 survivors who are producing neutralizing antibodies in an ideal world sars cov 2 immunity would resemble that acquired by children who get chicken pox early research suggests we are in for a much more complex scenario but one that time and unprecedented global cooperation might be able to untangle eventually antibody tests could be the key to getting our lives and economies back on track for now they promise to give experts officials and citizens a
