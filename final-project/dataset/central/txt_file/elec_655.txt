i m calling it marco rubio will be the presidential nominee of the republican party he is the bookkeepers favorite albeit a strange one as he is leading neither in the polls he s clocking in at 13 percent per real clear politics polling average nor in fundraising or endorsements there is no early state in particular where he can make a strong showing and propel himself to national victory and yet as sherlock holmes once said when you have eliminated all which is impossible then whatever remains however improbable must be the truth let s get jeb bush out of the way first republican voters aren t that dumb they won t renominate a bush so soon against a clinton especially not one who has been such an underwhelming candidate he has money but money follows success and money can t save a bad candidate then there s donald trump he s trump at some point voters will get a closer look and he ll collapse like a full head of hair under a shower in fact it may already have begun he may do some damage but he won t be the nominee ben carson might be the nominee and might even be president if he was serious i don t mean his outlandish views or questionable statements although they play a role i mean that he is not running for president he is running for pundit in chief so much of the money he raises he spends on raising more money which makes sense if you want to build lists of people to whom you can sell books and dvds down the line but not so much if you want to win a primary with his intense popularity among evangelicals he could conceivably win in iowa and then ride that wave to the nomination but he doesn t want to not really then there s ted cruz the anti rubio cruz the anti establishment candidate in the most anti establishment year on record cruz the oily used car salesman who creeps out as many people including in the gop as he entrances he won t make it with bush doing so badly rubio is on track to become the establishment candidate which usually means a lock on the nomination this year too this year would be the year where the rules of the game change but only if the base unites behind a single excellent candidate which they don t have and the establishment candidate is deeply underwhelming which rubio is not rubio remains a tea party conservative and is recognized as such by the party his only heresy is on immigration but that s never been fatal to a candidate unlike jeb he hasn t maxed out his heresy credit rubio will get the money he ll get the endorsements he ll get the votes he ll keep doing well in debates and on the stump and in town halls he will do well enough in the early states to get the money and the inevitability to win the big contests and he ll wrap it up by a process of elimination it has to be him the quiet intellectual push behind conservatives court coup what the bible really says about government vladimir putin s own goal trump says it s safe to reopen schools i don t believe him trump keeps falsely accusing joe scarborough of murder and it s long past weird officials ask reckless lake of the ozarks partygoers to self quarantine
