to fellow medics warning of a virus he thought looked like sars another deadly coronavirus but he was told by police to stop making false comments and was investigated for spreading rumours i don t think he was rumour mongering hasn t this turned into reality now his father li shuying told the bbc my son was wonderful according to chinese site pear video dr li s wife is due to give birth in june the virus causes severe acute respiratory infection and symptoms usually start with a fever followed by a dry cough most of those killed have been over the age of 60 or have suffered from other medical conditions china s health authorities say dr li s medical history is not known the country s anti corruption body said it would open an investigation into issues involving dr li china s leadership had already faced accusations of downplaying the severity of the virus and initially trying to keep it secret the government has admitted shortcomings and deficiencies in its response to the virus which has now killed 636 people and infected 31 198 in mainland china analysts say it is hard to recall an event in recent years that has triggered as much online grief rage and mistrust against the chinese government news of dr li s death became the top trending topic on chinese social media garnering an estimated 1 5bn views his death has also brought demands for action with wuhan

lives https t co azeirfrgit end of twitter post by chrdnet bbc china correspondent stephen mcdonell says beijing s efforts to manage the coronavirus outbreak have laid bare the worst aspects of china s command and control system of governance under president xi jinping the chinese people will take some convincing that the government knows how to manage such an emergency he adds the number of new cases of the coronavirus has fallen for the past two days official chinese figures released on wednesday reported nearly 3 900 newly confirmed cases the latest figures show just over 3 100 but it is dangerous to read too much into two days worth of data it is impossible to say if cases are really levelling off or if this is a sign of health authorities being unable to keep up with testing or if cases will shoot up again in the next few days realistically it is going to take another week or so before we have a clear picture of whether the outbreak is peaking and there is still a massive mismatch between the figures released by china and what outbreak analysts think is really going on it is widely accepted that the laboratory confirmed cases are just the tip of the iceberg some mathematic models of the outbreak suggest the true size of the epidemic could be 10 times higher than the official figures dr li an ophthalmologist posted his story on weibo from a hospital bed a month after sending out his initial warning he had noticed seven cases of a virus that he thought looked like sars the virus that led to a global epidemic in 2003 on 30 december he sent a message to fellow doctors in a chat group warning them to wear protective clothing to avoid infection four days later he was summoned to the public security bureau where he was told to sign a letter in the letter he was accused of making false comments that had severely disturbed the social order local authorities later apologised to dr li in his weibo post he describes how on 10 january he started coughing the next day he had a fever and two days later he was in hospital he was diagnosed with the coronavirus on 30 january chinese president xi jinping has told his us counterpart donald trump that china is fully confident and capable of defeating the epidemic the country has introduced more restrictive measures to try to control the outbreak the virus has now spread to more than 25 countries but only two of the deaths have been outside mainland china what questions do you have about the coronavirus in some cases your question will be published displaying your name age and
