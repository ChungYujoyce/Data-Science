the stream of hacked wikileaks emails the latest trove dumped thursday from inside hillary clinton s campaign opens up a troubling prospectfar beyond their revelations about the differing public and private faces of the democratic presidential nominee the leaks show that the russian government mightbe trying to interfere with the u s presidential race aimingcyberattacks at the very heart of american democracy its fair and open elections if an fbi investigation proves that to be the case the hacked emails represent an electronic version of watergate the 1972 burglary of democratic national headquarters that ultimately forced richard nixon from the white house only this time the threatcomes from a foreign adversary rather than a presidential administration for now though most of the public attention is on the content of the emails themselves which make clear why clinton balked at releasingtranscripts of the high dollar speeches she deliveredto audiences on wall street and elsewherein 2013 and 2014 assuming the wikileaks emails are accurate clinton portrayed herself to bankers as more supportive of free trade and more flexible on industry regulation than she has beenduringher drive for the presidency sounding like an ardent free trader in a 2013 speech clinton told one group of bankers my dream is a hemispheric common market with opentrade this was consistent with her stance assecretary of state in 2012 when she praised the proposed trans pacific partnership tpp as the gold standard of free trade agreements focus on russia not the emails another view by 2016 however clinton facedpopulist challenges first from bernie sanders and then from donald trump shenow opposesthe tpp and has few good things to say about free trade these days she also proclaims her disdain forincome inequality andwall street having assertedin february that wall street can never be allowed to once again threaten main street and i will fight to rein in wall street that was not her tone three years ago when she told new york s goldman sachs that the industry needs to be a part of fashioning industry regulation and commiserated with the investment bankersover the bias against people who have led successful and or complicated lives true many politicians change positions none more so than trump and some say things in private they never want the public to hear but they pay a price for duplicity when they fail to come clean and the comments ultimately do become public clinton had two ways to inoculate herself against any damaging leaks from her wall street speeches one is that she could have released the transcripts months ago inconvenient as that mighthave been the other is thatshe could have turned down the speaking engagements in the first place as the purported champion of the middleclass clintonmight have thought twice before taking 225 000 what it takes a typical american household four years to earn for an hour or so of work from an industry that helped push the economy to near collapse and forced millions of americans into foreclosure now amid the steady drip of embarrassing private emails the speeches have come back to bite her the wounds would have gone deeper if disclosures of trump s lewd sexual comments and alleged assaultshad not overshadowed them for clinton and other politicians the lesson is if you fear somethingwill become public don t do it or at the very least disclose it yourself rather than let others control the story for american voters the lesson is to beware of foreign governments seeking to damage democracy that harm if confirmed will last far longer thanmemories about the content of particularemails hacked from clinton s campaign manager usa today s editorial opinions are decided by itseditorial board separate from the news staff most editorials are coupled with an opposing view a unique usa today feature to read more editorials go to theopinion front pageor sign up for thedaily opinion email newsletter to respond to this editorial submit a comment toletters usatoday com
