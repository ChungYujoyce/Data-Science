we ve just pulled out of bernie sanders west des moines field office and have barely traveled a block when amy jerman a 54 year old volunteer from rochester n y starts tearing up jerman is a stylish woman wearing a beanie with bernie buttons on it a bernie shirt a kerchief tied around her neck stacks of silver rings on her fingers and ripped jeans rolled up above her duck boots she s normally not emotional she says but sometimes she gets overwhelmed by what sanders and his movement are working toward one of the questions that bernie put out there at one time was are you willing to fight for someone else jerman says everyone is willing to fight for everyone else and it s just so beautiful jerman sits in the passenger seat of a minivan heading out to canvas for sanders she and a friend pulled into des moines the previous night after a long drive at one point they started heading east again after pulling in for gas somewhere around iowa city and didn t realize it until they were nearly back in illinois she twists around to talk to kathleen graves 37 another woman from new york who runs a babes for bernie instagram account and met them at the field office fresh from the airport jerman and graves are among the more than 1 700 out of state volunteers the campaign estimates have descended on iowa to help in the final push to the feb 3 caucuses sanders campaign has nearly 10 000 door knocking shifts scheduled for over the final weekend as of a couple of days ago it says it knocked on more than 400 000 doors in iowa in january alone the campaign s goal at the outset of january was to hit 500 000 and countless volunteers are showing up to help with that effort and make sure their supporters have a plan for the night of the caucuses the campaign s slogan not me us alludes to the grassroots movement that it hopes will lift sanders to victory sanders strength on the ground in iowa is years in the making he s more or less been running for president here since 2015 in the crucial final days before the caucuses the senator has leaned on his supporters to carry the campaign as sanders sat trapped at his desk on the senate floor for president donald trump s impeachment trial sanders has relied on congressional allies as well on friday rep ilhan omar of minnesota kicked off a canvassing shift at sanders des moines field office once she and the television cameras left volunteers lingered those with assignments took off to the various neighborhoods they had to hit first time volunteers stuck around for a training session where a sanders field staffer walked them through how to use the minivan app that the campaign uses to gather information volunteers are instructed to rank the voters on their list on a scale of one through five one means they re supporters three means they re undecided and five means they won t be supporting sanders the volunteers are told to get phone numbers and emails so they can inform voters of any last minute changes to their caucus location before the volunteers pair off to practice their scripts someone asks the staffer if he has any tips he can share since he s done it so much the staffer a young thin man is loaded with advice don t walk through lawns respect the space at the doorway so people don t feel invaded don t linger too long no you re not loitering if they threaten to call the police don t panic because you re not doing anything wrong a three hour shift equals about 50 doors stay away from mailboxes misty rebik the campaign s iowa state director says the campaign has committed to having more than one trained precinct captain in every iowa precinct the second to last weekend before the caucuses yielded 130 000 door knocks in less than 36 hours she added at some point for five consecutive hours we were knocking two doors every second i would be very surprised if any other candidate had those same statistics rebik told reporters tuesday evening none of this will matter if we don t have the largest turnout on monday our strategy has been risky and such but you know in order to beat donald trump we have to expand the electorate and we ve been willing to take that risk door knocking in the cold can be slow frustrating work for the hour i was with jerman and graves as they crisscrossed a neighborhood in waukee iowa no one answers the door it s a friday during the work day and the streets are so silent that their voices echoed at one point while out canvassing jerman trips on a chunk of concrete the size of a fist that s broken off a sidewalk she turns around picks it up and pats it back into place at each house on their list they leave campaign literature and a sticker graves designed and ordered then they reach a door on their list with a pete buttigieg sign in the yard they re torn whether to knock on it at all i m definitely not opposed to talking to them but i almost wonder if that puts people off a little jerman wonders she goes for it but no one answers all i was going to say is that i see you have a pete sign just want to make sure you re planning on caucusing for our democracy we chat as we wind along the street and around the block into a couple of apartment buildings one of the doors has a sign taped onto it no soliciting campaign people don t even try i asked jerman and graves if either had met sanders if we meet him i will literally die jerman says that would just be like a beautiful moment if i could meet him that would be great if i could shake his hand that would be great but like i m just here to work for him because he deserves it he deserves everything he does man write to lissandra villa at lissandra villa time com
