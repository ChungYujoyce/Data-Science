major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more a racist or a white supremacist pointing to his handling of racially divisive and violent incidents in charlottesville va and el paso texas white house hopefuls who previously focused on trump s equivocations in the aftermath of the august 2017 charlottesville white nationalist rally have since expanded that criticism to include the mass shooting in el paso where the suspected gunman allegedly posted a manifesto denouncing an invasion of latinos and reportedly told authorities he wanted to kill mexicans democratic contenders wasted little time tying the shooter s rhetoric to trump s own descriptions of immigrants as thugs and criminals and his characterization of migrant caravans as an invasion trump has given aid and comfort to white supremacists he s done the wink and a nod sen elizabeth warrenelizabeth warrenpentagon

from you because they look like me they look like my family trump s reelection campaign argues that the ratcheting up of racism allegations is nothing more than democrats grasping at straws for two years democrats called president trump a russian agent and now that the russia hoax has fallen apart they ve moved on to white supremacy trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh said in a statement adding that castro s ad was false and ludicrous on its face trump himself has dismissed the allegations of racism and instead accuses democrats and other opponents of using the term racist only when they lack legitimate criticisms of his presidency i don t like it when they do it because i am not any of those things trump told reporters last week when asked whether he thinks it benefits him when democrats call him and his supporters white supremacists i think it s a disgrace he added and i think it shows how desperate the democrats are but as trump and his allies reject the labels as political ploys from potential 2020 challengers they are still working to contain the fallout from the president s response to the deadly unite the right rally in charlottesville that took place two years ago this week the president s comments were widely panned at the time as he ascribed blame to both white supremacists and counterprotesters and democrats are banking on the incident resonating with voters into 2020 as they seek to paint trump as unfit to lead and unable to unite the nation several democratic candidates this week marked the anniversary of the charlottesville rally when white nationalists marched on the university of virginia campus chanting anti semitic slogans protesters later clashed with counterprotesters leading to the death of heather heyer who was killed after a man

no isolated incident the president has been surprisingly willing to revisit his remarks that sparked bipartisan backlash you had some very bad people in that group but you also had people that were very fine people on both sides trump said during an aug 15 2017 press conference at trump tower referencing the group of white nationalist protesters he added that he felt there was blame on both sides for the ensuing violence in april trump insisted that he answered questions about the rally perfectly and that he had been defending the far right attendees protesting the planned removal of a statue of confederate gen robert e lee on wednesday trump again broached the charlottesville controversy he retweeted a video in which former adviser steve cortes contended that the media inaccurately reported the president was referring to neo nazis and white supremacists as very fine people thank you steve trump tweeted in sharing the video the president and his allies have latched onto a moment in the august 2017 press conference at trump tower in which trump says neo nazis and white nationalists should be condemned totally the ongoing defense of trump s charlottesville comments show his willingness to dig in on his remarks even in the face of widespread criticism trump in recent weeks has added to his catalog of inflammatory statements by tweeting that four minority congresswomen should go back to where they came from in addition to attacking baltimore as a rat and rodent infested mess where nobody would choose to live those incidents prompted swift backlash from 2020 presidential candidates a seemingly intuitive response but one that could prove problematic and even distracting down the line according to democratic strategist brad bannon he argued that the

and going through these long cycles where the president says something insulting and hillary clinton responded to it bannon said i think that was a mistake in the clinton campaign as a democratic
