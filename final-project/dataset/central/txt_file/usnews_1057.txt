at a time when washington d c is paralyzed by partisan gridlock and impeachment hearings it can be challenging for lawmakers to focus on their day jobs lawmaking but raja krishnamoorthi a 46 year old second term illinois democratic congressman from the chicago suburb of schaumburg has won bipartisan support for his efforts to curb young people s use of e cigarettes as their surging popularity perpetuates a health crisis among the nation s youth krishnamoorthi a father of three and the son of indian immigrants twice campaigned on promises to strengthen the middle class and grow the economy but as teen use of e cigarettes skyrocketed in recent years he was confronted with a health problem he found impossible to separate from thoughts of his own family kids who vape look like my children he says it compelled krishnamoorthi to launch one of the first congressional investigations into teen vaping and the company most responsible for the surge juul labs in july the house subcommittee on economic and consumer policy which krishnamoorthi chairs held a high profile two day hearing into juul s marketing practices and alleged appeal to children exposing similarities between historical tobacco advertising and juul ads as well as the company s visits to schools and native american reservations the company has since been slapped with a warning letter from the food and drug administration replaced its ceo and halted u s advertising and sales of flavored products his efforts have won important bipartisan support a feat in this deeply polarized government in september he formed an anti youth vaping caucus with two powerful allies democratic sen dick durbin of illinois and republican rep peter king of new york in hopes of producing bipartisan legislation aimed at curtailing teen vaping in october he introduced a bill that would limit the amount of nicotine in vaping products which he says is crucial to preventing children from getting addicted the forces of big tobacco and the e cigarette industry are very powerful unfortunately sometimes it takes a while for people to wake up to just how dangerous some of these products are krishnamoorthi told time in september the trump administration threatened to pull all flavored vaping products off the market in the wake of krishnamoorthi s hearing prompting a number of states and cities to pass emergency vaping bans of their own last month the administration subsequently appeared to change course announcing plans to raise the minimum age of purchase to 21 over concerns that prohibition will drive the industry underground krishnamoorthi s mission to take on big vape comes as an outbreak of vaping related lung diseases has swept the u s sickening almost 2 300 people across all 50 u s states killing 48 and raising the stakes for lawmakers and regulators and though illnesses appear to be linked mainly to bootleg thc products the outbreak thrust the entire e cigarette industry into the national spotlight after years on the fringes of public discourse vaping advocates who see e cigarettes as an important tool for adult smokers trying to quit have come out hard against flavored product bans protesting in droves with chants of we vape we vote and filing lawsuits to fight state actions krishnamoorthi admits he gets trolled a lot by those who oppose his suggested vaping regulations his communications director wilson baldwin who monitors his social media accounts describes it in more colorful language there seem to be a lot of people double fisting with an e cigarette in one hand and their phone in the other it could impact the congressman s bid for re election next year krishnamoorthi has some job security by virtue of running in a solidly democratic state but he ll be doing so with a juul shaped target on his back in a 2019 poll of about 4 700 adults who report vaping regularly 83 said they are likely to base their 2020 vote solely on a candidate s vaping policies and 96 said they d be less likely to vote for a candidate who supports a flavor ban the poll s organizers it was commissioned by the trade group vapor technology association vta and conducted by trump campaign pollsters mclaughlin associates raise concerns about selection bias but its sentiment was enough to make a flavor ban appear politically risky some reports suggest it was even enough to change trump s mind about a flavor ban krishnamoorthi s efforts may have been among the first to pick up the vaping mantle but his work was informed by the decades earlier anti tobacco fight of former democratic california rep henry waxman in 1994 waxman then chairman of the subcommittee on health and the environment convened a hearing that famously prompted seven tobacco executives to claim under oath that nicotine was not addictive he would go on to draft the landmark 2009 legislation that gave the fda the ability to regulate tobacco products before leaving congress in 2015 waxman says he argued strenuously and ultimately unsuccessfully not to allow e cigarettes to go on the market and certainly not with flavors he says he s glad krishnamoorthi is taking up the fight rep krishnamoorthi is doing exactly the kind of thing that i would have done his place waxman says i commend him for it others are taking notice of krishnamoorthi s work too the fda cited his investigation in its september warning letter to juul which directed the company to stop marketing its products as healthier than cigarettes without receiving its authorization to do so representatives for juul did not provide comment by press time he s also become a regular on networks like cnn and msnbc and has received almost 231 000 in campaign contributions from health professionals alone his total cash on hand tops 6 3 million in krishnamoorthi s view the fda is to blame for keeping vaping on the fringes though cigarettes came under fda purview in 2009 the agency didn t finalize its regulatory standards for e cigarettes until 2016 roughly a decade after they began showing up for sale in the u s any brand on the market before 2016 including juul had the luxury of flourishing largely without oversight by federal regulators and without having to apply for fda approval even now companies have until may 2020 to apply the agency didn t propose significant action for limiting youth sales until november 2018 by which time 20 8 of high schoolers vaped according to the national youth tobacco survey since then youth vaping rates have only risen by latest count more than 5 million young americans use e cigarettes according to u s centers for disease control and prevention data the fda overall has unfortunately been kind of awol on this issue krishnamoorthi told time his feelings haven t changed much since after the administration and the fda failed to deliver on initial promises to take flavors off the market krishnamoorthi held another hearing in december this one focused on holding his government colleagues accountable time s up he said during the hearing the fda should get their act together and put this flavor ban out immediately in written testimony fda center for tobacco products director mitch zeller emphasized the agency s commitment to the issue promising that he and others at the agency are doing everything we can to prevent kids from using tobacco products and will continue to develop a policy approach that aligns with that concern krishnamoorthi s efforts are directed at preventing youth use and addiction and he doesn t give much thought to whether adults should use e cigarettes that s a complicated question on which even public health experts can t find consensus some argue e cigarettes are a life saving alternative to cigarettes others think they do little to help smokers quit and introduce new and different health risks i don t know about the broader issue of whether adults should be vaping krishnamoorthi says but this we re sure about youth should not be vaping and we ve got to stop it right now the vaping industry has come out swinging tony abboud executive director of vta argues that raising the legal age for purchasing vaping products would work better to curb youth use than banning flavors banning flavors fails to seriously address the issue of youth vaping while likely precipitating a public health crisis as vapor products users turn to either combustible cigarettes or to black market sources for vapor products abboud says paul blair director of strategic initiatives at the conservative pro vaping group americans for tax reform calls krishnamoorthi s efforts a moral crusade that will make it harder for adult smokers to access products that could feasibly help them quit if a number of progressives in congress get their way marlboros will be among the only choices for adults in convenience stores blair says is that really what they want krishnamoorthi landed in illinois by chance when his parents first emigrated from india in 1973 along with then three month old raja they settled in buffalo n y where his engineer father was to complete his studies and got by with the help of public housing and food stamps eventually krishnamoorthi s father landed a job in peoria ill where krishnamoorthi lived before attending princeton university to study engineering at the urging of his father he said raja you can do anything you want to do in life you can be a civil engineer a mechanical engineer an electrical engineer a computer engineer or a doctor krishnamoorthi laughs krishnamoorthi took to his engineering coursework well and thrived at princeton i got a b s in engineering and i like to joke that i do the b s part now he says krishnamoorthi is full of well worn dad jokes like this one when he graduated in 1995 everyone in the world wanted to be in consulting and krishnamoorthi was no different but his heart was in public policy so he consulted just long enough to save up for law school at harvard after graduating he moved to chicago to clerk for a federal judge and eventually joined a law firm he met his now wife anesthesiologist dr priya bala on a blind date in 2001 after graduating from princeton and harvard law krishnamoorthi first tried his hand at public service when he was appointed illinois special assistant attorney general in 2006 after a brief return to the private sector and two failed campaigns for the role of illinois comptroller in 2010 and for congress in 2012 he ran in 2016 to represent the state s 8th district in congress he won by 17 percentage points with an endorsement from then president barack obama for whom krishnamoorthi campaigned in 2004 and 2008 with his victory krishnamoorthi became illinois first indian american representative when he ran for congress krishnamoorthi talked often about his intention to protect social services and small businesses and once there he joined high profile groups like the house intelligence committee public health was a less obvious but not totally unexpected focus his parents grew up at a time when health problems caused by chewing tobacco were rampant in india leading a whole generation of indian origin people to hate smoking he says some of that also is part of my own dna now that he s a father himself he says that call is stronger than ever and one that he wants everyone to hear protecting our kids cannot be a partisan issue he says it s got to be something that is top of mind for all of us write to jamie ducharme at jamie ducharme time com
