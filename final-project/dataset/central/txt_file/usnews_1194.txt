red flag provisions that would allow authorities to take guns away from people who pose a safety threat an authority that might be paired with requirements that the person receive a mental health evaluation or be committed also under discussion were actions to include more information about criminal and mental health records in databases used for background checks during commercial gun purchases as well as increasing criminal penalties for people who illegally buy guns for someone else known as straw buyers proposals like these would be far more modest than the push for meaningful background checks that the president touted in the wake of the mass shootings in el paso texas and dayton ohio earlier this month and for which democrats have lobbied but the discussions also indicate that there remains a possibility however slim of passing new gun legislation despite a report in the atlantic that trump had backed away from the issue in a phone call with national rifle association

daughter and senior advisor ivanka walked the president through a list of proposed changes at one point vice president mike pence also joined the meeting after hearing out his staff trump surprised those gathered in the room by making an unscheduled request to dial lapierre let s call wayne right now trump said according to a senior white house official let s see what wayne is saying an aide tracked down lapierre and soon lapierre s voice was coming through the gray speaker phone on the resolute desk trump and aides ran down the list of actions the white house is considering the white house tried to impress upon lapierre that trump was in a good place and had staff working on the proposals who were concerned about the second amendment mental health and solving the problem of mass shootings the senior white house official said what we are talking about is meaningful background checks that would actually go to prevent shootings like sandy hook or el paso or parkland those are things we can work on that have cause and effect a second white house official told time this wasn t wayne lapierre dictating to us we were telling him here are the things we are looking at how big of a fight are you going to put up for most of them he was like whatever you say for a couple he said i don t know about that i haven t seen that one yet the president told mr lapierre that he will always stand up for the second amendment and that the administration is exploring measures that will protect the american people and keep communities safe white house spokesman hogan gidley told time within hours of talking to lapierre trump had seemed to back away from his earlier calls for significant gun legislation we have very very strong background checks right now trump told reporters gathered in the oval office tuesday afternoon but by wednesday trump s tune had changed i have an appetite for background checks he said ivanka trump has been pushing her father to take forceful action to expand background checks on gun purchases and has reached out to lawmakers about possible legislation solutions according to an aide but a number of the president s advisers and allies have urged caution pointing out that many of trump s most motivated voters are wary of gun restrictions trump believes the nra s endorsement helped him in the 2016 campaign and there is concern among trump s political strategists that turmoil in the nra could dampen efforts to get its membership out to vote in 2020 white house officials say trump already has shown a willingness to take action on guns in

of the church shooting in sutherland springs texas perpetrated by a gunman who had a domestic violence conviction while in the air force that gunman fatally shot 26 people with a legally purchased
