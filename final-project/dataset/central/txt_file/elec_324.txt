voters he also won a third of democrats a majority of latinos and nearly half of union voters loading november 6 2013 new jersey gov chris christie made an emphatic case to reshape the republican brand tuesday with a rousing 21 point landslide win in one of the most democratic states in the country it was the first time a republican has won more than 50 percent of a statewide vote in new jersey since the presidential election in 1988 bolstering the case that governor christie alone can break through the blue state gauntlet that has stymied gop hopes the last two presidential elections exuding a straight talking tough guy persona not a few have thrown out tony soprano comparisons christie arguably has become the most appealing and charismatic politician in the country as well as the most visible republican presidential hopeful at the moment i did not seek a second term to do small things he said during his victory speech tuesday evening invoking the spirit of sandy the superstorm that ravaged the state a year ago i sought a second term to finish the job now watch me do it it s no longer a job for me he said later in the speech it s a mission a mission is something that is different from a job it s something sacred his democratic opponent state sen barbara buono never seemed more than an afterthought she was ignored by essential donors and practically shunned by democratic party leaders wary of angering the popularly pugnacious governor indeed senator buono struggled simply to make her name known while christie was able to clip a cnn mic to his tie as he stepped into a local diner election morning buono bitterly denounced the bosses and the political machines that have defined new jersey s politics for far too long thanking workers who withstood the onslaught of betrayal from our own political party as christie racked up democratic endorsements this week he won 32 percent of democrats according to exit polls he ended a carefully crafted gubernatorial campaign that barely tried to hide its national focus and its likely further goal in 2016 and his double digit leads in the polls throughout the campaign didn t stop christie from pressing his case right up to election day for the past week the governor has crisscrossed the garden state on a 90 stop bus tour campaigning as if his political life depended on it his object was not simply to win but to make an emphatic statement the bus tour in fact could easily be been seen as the kickoff of his little doubted campaign for the white house with a strategy designed to jump start a republican partythwarted by a growing gender gap and the dearth of any significant minority support christie trumpeted his cross party appeal not only did christie relentlessly court blacks and hispanics during the final days of the campaign he set the chattering classes abuzz when on monday he campaigned with gov susana martinez the moderate republican from new mexico who made history by becoming the first latina ever elected governor in the united states governor martinez in fact is the only other governor christie brought along during his entire 2013 run like him martinez is young moderate in a blue leaning state who has worked with a democratic legislature although unlike her new jersey counterpart she embraced the medicaid expansion of obamacare i need you tomorrow night i need you badly christie said while campaigning with martinez monday we ve got to deliver tomorrow because the whole country is watching everybody the whole country is watching the suggestive and unprecedented pairing of two moderate republican governors would immediately address the electoral hurdles facing any gop nominee in 2016 and given the disgust voters have expressed for the political climate in washington both could hammer home their anti beltway bonafides and that will send a loud and clear message to those knuckleheads in washington d c they re going to see that we do it differently christie said monday imagine this imagine that on one night in our history the whole country is looking to new jersey for leadership his efforts paid off the governor won an impressive 57 percent of women and took a majority of latino voters he even garnered 21 percent of black voters a significant inroad for a republican he also won nearly half of union voters and those under the age of 30 but questions remain conservative republicans point out that the party already nominated a blue state moderate in mitt romney and he was beaten soundly by president obama in 2012 and new jersey s fiscal health remains suspect the state has some of the highest property taxes in the nation its credit rating fell during christie s tenure and poverty has reached a 52 year high and the conservative wing of the republican party fueled by a motivated and angry tea party base has begun to galvanize around texas sen ted cruz and kentucky sen rand paul the most common reference to christie in deep red state territory is rino republican in name only yet christie triumphed resoundingly in bluest of blue new jersey even while ken cuccinelli the tea party favorite in the much more conservative state of virginia lost to democrat terry mcauliffe who was hardly beloved by voters still the governor s jersey pugnaciousness can at times undermine his attempts at bipartisanship this weekend he was caught on camera wagging his finger at a female teacher reportedly saying i m sick of you people after the woman asked why he called new jersey public schools failure factories christie claims he said no matter how much money the state spends it will never be enough for you people get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox the country can expect more of this jersey punch in the next three years see listen we re new jersey christie said during his victory speech we still fight we still yell but when we fight we fight for those things that really matter in
