the debate over the use of anti malaria drug hydroxychloroquineas a possible prevention method or treatment for covid 19 was reignited monday after president donald trump saidhe s been taking the drug for about a week and a half scientists journalists and politicians were quick to criticize the president pointing out the drug s ineffectiveness against the coronavirusin a few recent studies and long list of potentially dangerous side effects multiple government agencies have warned against the improper use of hydroxychloroquine outside a hospital or clinical trial setting yet the president has been touting the drug since early apriloften relying on anecdotal evidence for his arguments you d be surprised about how many people are taking it especially the frontline workers before you catch it trump said so what have we learned about hydroxychloroquine since it was first mentioned during the pandemic weeks ago here s everything you need to know hydroxychloroquine is an arthritis medicine that can also be used as a prevention or treatment of malaria a red blood cell infection transmitted by a mosquito bite according to the mayo clinic it s available in the u s under prescription only in addition to malaria the drug can also be used to treat acute and chronic rheumatoid arthritis discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus the johns hopkins lupus centersaid itcan help control lupus by decreasing the immune system s activity without predisposing it to infection it can also protect against uv light and sometimes even improve skin lesions that don t respond to ointments hydroxychloroquine can be administered either as a pill or by intravenous drip and is marketed under the brand name plaquenil another reason why experts are cautious about using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid 19 is because of its numerous side effects it may also be worth noting that there are over 40 side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine dosage these include dry cough hoarseness fever difficulty breathing and increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmia said john scott chair of the department of pharmacology at the university of washington school of medicine the long list of common side effects of plaquenil hydroxychloroquine include nausea vomiting stomach pain or cramps loss of appetite weight loss diarrhea dizziness spinning sensation headache ringing in your ears nervousness irritability skin rash itching or hair loss the mayo clinic urges patients to contact their doctor if they experience any serious side effects such asmuscleweakness twitching uncontrolled movement loss of balance or coordination blurred vision light sensitivity seeing halos around lights pale skin easy bruising or bleeding confusion unusual thoughts or behavior or seizures this will kill you people are warning others following trump s apparent use of hydroxychloroquine nancy pelosi trump is morbidly obese and should not take hydroxychloroquine two recent observational studies of covid 19 patients suggested the drug has little impact in treating the disease the studies while not the same as a clinical trial suggested that the drug did not significantly reduce complications from the virus or death a study posted on april 23 involving 368 patients with confirmed cases of covid 19 treated at veterans health administration medical centers found there were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquine than those receiving standard care in addition the drug made no difference in the need for ventilators the u s national institutes of health launched a large clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine given in conjunction with the antibiotic azithromycin last week it is among multiple studies underway to see if the drug can help decrease hospitalization and death from coronavirus in a statement on the n i h website about the study dr anthony fauci noted that while where was anecdotal evidence that the drugs might benefit some people we need solid data from a large randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes doctors including fauci have said it s impossible to know if hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine another drug the president has pushed is effective or safe to treat covid 19 a brazilian double blind research study published in mid april found chloroquine to be so dangerous at high doses the trial was shut down after six days the study of 81 patients found one quarter of those taking the anti malaria medication developed potentially deadly changes in the electrical system regulating their heartbeats while a small and imperfect study it highlighted the compelling need for more rigorous data the university of minnesotais also in the midst of a large study of whether the drug can be used prophylactically but it will not be completed until august there is no data that pre exposure prophylaxis is effective in prevention covid 19 the study we re conducting should help us answer the question said mahmoud al kofahi a professor of experimental and clinical pharmacology at the university of minnesota it is not available over the counter at drug stores and must be prescribed by a doctor because it is fda approved for malaria and other conditions physicians are legally free to prescribe it in any manner they want off label meaning not for the reason listed on the drug s label the fda explicitly warned consumers not to buy it from online pharmacies without a prescription from a health care professional hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing covid 19 the fda warned both can cause abnormal heart rhythms and a dangerously rapid heart rate the statement said the drug first came to public attention after severalsmall anecdotal non peer reviewed reportsabout hydroxychloroquinein chinain february none were up to the scientific goldstandard of a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial that would definitively show the drugworked or not trump first spoke about hydroxychloroquine given together with the antibiotic azithromycinon march 19 he went on to tout them numerous times in various media and public events on april 13 he announced his administration had deployed roughly 29million doses of hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile just recently a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that that drug he saidin a briefing since late april trump had toned down his support ofthe drug but during a roundtable discussion with restaurant executives at the white house on monday said he s been taking the drug i happen to be taking it trump said i hope to not be able to take it soon you know because i hope that they come up with some answer but i think people should be allowed to trump who said he has tested negative for covid 19 said he hasbeen taking the drug daily for about a week and a half as an added measure to avoid getting the coronavirus hesaid the white house physician didn t recommend hydroxychloroquine but offered it to him the news comes aftertwo people in the white house who would have been in close contact with him tested positive for covid 19 one was a valet to the president the other is vice president mike pence s press secretary katie miller trump told reporters that along with taking the drug he is beingtested for covid 19 every couple of days the president also said he is taking zinc and took aninitial dose of the antibioticazithromycin as experts race to find a treatment for covid 19 the experimental drug remdesivir is reportedly showing some promise data from a global study released at the end of aprilfound patients given the drug recovered faster and may be less likely to die the study conducted by the u s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases found patients who received remdesivir had a 31 faster recovery time than those who received a placebo while not a knock out fauci said at an oval office meeting the study results were a very important proof of concept remdesivir is an experimental antiviral drug from the american biotech firm gileadsciences inc it was originally tested as a treatment for ebola and other coronaviruses including sars and is now being tested as a possible covid 19 treatment according to scott the drug impairs the ability of the virus to replicate you re decreasing the degree of infection so the immune system can fight it s like taking fuel away from the fire he said however many scientists caution against drawing any conclusions about remdesivir in fact another study published the same day in the british medical journal the lancet found no clinical benefits to the drug early data from a chinese studywasprematurely posted then removedfrom a world health organization website it did not appearto show any difference in outcomes between patients who got the drug and patients who didn t another study that has not yet been peer reviewedfound patients on a10 day remdesivirtreatment plan and a five day treatment planshowed similar improvement gilead said a new symptom tingling in the hands or feet can be associated with covid 19 but not the way you may think beach vacation atlantic beach towns brace for summer vacationers but know it won t be the same a studypublished april 10 in thenew england journal of medicinefound the majority of people who got the drug improved but there was no control group medical news site statreportedearly and incompleteresults from a remdesivir studybeing conducted in chicago the university of chicagoissued a statement saying that drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound remdesivir isone of several drugs touted recently as possible coronavirus treatments convalescent plasmaandimmunomodulators liketocilizumabhave been given to patients with covid 19 in clinical trials but remdesivir is the only treatment that has been shown tohave even a potential effect on the disease contributing savannah behrmann n dea yancey bragg courtney subramanian and john fritze usa today follow adrianna rodriguez and elizabeth
