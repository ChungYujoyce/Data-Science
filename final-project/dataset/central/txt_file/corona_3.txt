president wants to consider said cardin who is also a member of the senate finance committee we have businesses that are going to need grants loans alone aren t going to work that s very clear we have republican support for that so we re going to have to look for a grant program for small businesses he said a senior senate republican aide on friday confirmed that lawmakers will begin working on a

now at some point we will have to provide business relief we will have to provide relief to airlines mark zandi chief economist for moody s analytics who now puts the chances of a u s recession this year at 70 percent said he expects pressure will grow on congress to pass several stimulus packages i think a large timely well thought fiscal stimulus package to avoid recession or to mitigate the severity of the recession that is now likely he said i think they could make it clear very soon that a second stimulus package is coming he said quick hitting temporary relief such as expanded unemployment insurance or tax rebates like the kind congress passed during the great recession are prime candidates for the second round of stimulus zandi said a payroll tax cut is on the list but toward the bottom much more important is to significantly expand out unemployment insurance to workers who don t actually lose their jobs but can t get to work because they re sick or they have to take care of sick family members or their kids can t go to school he said zandi also raised concerns about grants to small businesses loans and loan guarantees are tried and true stimulus and that should be part of any package but that s pretty modest in terms of its stimulus he said john weaver a republican aide who worked on former ohio gov john kasich s 2016 presidential campaign said trump will be pressing congress hard for additional stimulus he s going to be tremendously desperate as we re seeing weaver said noting that trump has hammered the federal reserve to cut interest rates and that they don t have much more room to maneuver weaver warned that trump s chances of winning reelection would be significantly lower if the country falls into and stays in a recession if the economy fails to recover he said i think it will really lock him out of being reelected presidents get the credit when things are going well and they get the blame when things don t weaver added prior to the coronavirus he was definitely on the way to winning reelection said ford o connell a republican strategist i do think the coronavirus puts a curveball into it and i think that he is wise to be pushing back and reminding people that the coronavirus came from china which he s been on for a very long time in terms of decoupling our supply chain he s trying to make the point i m doing the best i can for america with the hand i ve been dealt with o connell added democrats have expressed strong opposition to a payroll tax cut but they haven t ruled it out if it s included in a broader package with some of their top priorities such as expanded unemployment insurance a payroll tax holiday which trump floated to republican senators on tuesday and would temporarily cut payroll taxes to zero would cost too much to win bipartisan support a more modest 2 percent cut however is still on the table congress approved a 2 percent payroll cut in 2011 to bolster the economy heading into then president obama s 2012 reelection bid there s been a lot of discussion about it in the sense of whether we should do it or not i think everybody s got a different opinion sen mike braunmichael braungop faces
