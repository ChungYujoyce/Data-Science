iowa and new hampshire have helped fuel bernie sanders candidacy but as the race moves to south carolina a lot could change after a razor thin victory in the iowa caucuses and a double digit loss to bernie sanders in the new hampshire primary hillary clinton is looking to south carolina for a big win later this month and she s counting on strong black support in that state to give her a definitive victory most polls suggest she ll get that support by some estimates she could garner 80 percent of south carolina s black vote in the feb 27 primary previously even bernie sanders himself admitted as much i don t know maybe he s a fresh face we ve seen hillary jessica tolbert but there may be a hitch increasingly young black college aged voters are turning lukewarm on clinton at a gathering of university of south carolina college democrats this week a group watching the results come in from new hampshire was split fairly evenly between sanders and clinton supporters only one usc student didn t raise his hand for either candidate michael cauthen a junior studying political science he told npr he was undecided angela bassett talks to students at south carolina state university while campaigning for democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton earlier this month sean rayford getty images hide caption but upon further reflection that changed i feel like both of the candidates have pretty similar past platforms cauthen said i think when bernie sanders entered the race he definitely pulled hillary to the left which i think is a good thing and then he said ultimately i m leaning hillary i do like bernie and i think his policies are interesting i don t know whether they re pragmatic cauthen who is black told npr he d vote for clinton in the south carolina primary and in the general election should she be her party s nominee but cauthen was slow if not afraid to admit it he said he still has reservations about some of clinton s past positions like her shift on a 2002 bankruptcy bill earlier this week at claflin university a historically black college in orangeburg student jessica tolbert wavered in her support of clinton as well just before attending a pro clinton rally on campus i m probably gonna vote for hillary tolbert said at first but the more she talked the more she wavered consistency is key for me tolbert said and i think on certain things i hear her say one thing and then i hear her say something else eventually when asked how she d vote if the election were held right then she said if i could vote today maybe it would go to bernie what makes her clinton good for black people now question from student taylor honore to clinton surrogate angela bassett tolbert whose top issue this election is health care said that sanders just feels more consistent though she couldn t exactly put her finger on why it could be in part because he s newer to her she said i don t know maybe he s a fresh face we ve seen hillary and that s the thing young black voters in south carolina who spoke with npr say when they look into clinton s record they don t like all they ve seen at another clinton rally featuring campaign surrogate angela bassett this time at south carolina state university student taylor honore had some tough questions on clinton s record i did my background research on what hillary has really done for the black community honore told npr and it kind of concerned me after students got through initial questions for bassett star of films like waiting to exhale and the tina turner biopic what s love got to do with it about acting and what it s like to star in american horror story alongside lady gaga the actress took a tough question from honore what makes her clinton good for black people now honore pressed bassett on bill clinton s so called crime bill the 1994 violent crime control act which experts claim greatly increased the number of blacks in prisons throughout the country bernie sanders voted for that bill too just after that another student asked about bill clinton s 1996 welfare reform measures and the harm they caused to black families asking bassett as a black woman with two sons why do you advocate on ms clinton s behalf bassett said clinton does care about black families pointing to her work with the children s defense fund and the children s health insurance program the actress also said clinton is ready to have conversations about incarceration and the role of the government pertaining to black families but there was a theme to the students questions a lot of these young black students ambivalence toward hillary clinton was a reaction not just to her but also to her husband s policies and the questions seemed to contradict the belief in clinton s campaign that black and latino voters will help her win the democratic nomination critics are saying clinton is unfairly counting on those votes to serve as a firewall of sorts after seeing a plan that was spelled out in a memo from campaign manager robby mook earlier this week clinton s campaign seems to be aware of increasing criticism from some young black voters on wednesday her staff organized a conference call featuring black state legislators and naacp members to discuss clinton s and sanders records on behalf of the african american community in the call those surrogates said sanders has been absent on issues affecting black america with all the scrambling for black votes ahead of south carolina s primary it s important to keep in mind that young black voters in south carolina aren t all black voters in south carolina jaime harrison chairman of the state s democratic party says they may not even be the majority in 2008 56 percent of the vote in the democratic primary was african americans more than half he said of that demographic harrison says black women were the most powerful but not young black women it s sort of our mothers ages i would say 35 to 60 that age is the sweet spot so bernie sanders has to figure out how do you communicate and talk to those folks and right now harrison says with those older black voters men and women they re still leaning toward clinton the mood on college campuses he said is very different from what i see in the churches and the barbershops with older african americans it is not yet clear whether sanders can change those older black voters minds but one candidate eight years ago did just that what he sanders could do and this is something that barack obama was very effective in doing was mobilizing his young people to convince their parents and to convince their grandparents to support him and that may be the big question in south carolina s democratic primary later this month and perhaps throughout the rest of the country as well how well can 2016 bernie sanders channel 2008 barack obama quote marks that were around the word firewall have been removed because they could make it seem as if the word was used in the memo written by clinton campaign manager robby mook the word has been used by critics and media but mook did not use that word quote marks that were around the word firewall have been removed because they could make it seem as if the word was used in the memo written by clinton campaign manager robby mook the word has been used by critics and media but mook did not use that
