less than five weeks ago a deeply divided senate acquitted president donald trump almost entirely along partisan lines now that same polarized body must come together to reach a consensus quickly on a massive spending plan to bring relief to the millions of americans suffering from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic normally congress spends weeks and often months hashing out this type of legislation but as the disease spreads across the country simultaneously infecting thousands of americans and ravaging businesses lawmakers are moving to provide massive aid to americans and stabilize the u s economy within days the heightened sense of urgency and the glimmers of bipartisanship around the effort underscore just how imposing the economic and financial threats of covid 19 are and how alarmed federal authorities are as the disease brings whole sectors of the economy to a halt we occasionally have these great crises and when they occur we are able to rise above our normal partisanship and in many times our normal positions because these are not normal times mcconnell told reporters on tuesday in a briefing room that was rearranged to put physical distance between participants this is not an ordinary situation so it requires extraordinary measures earlier this month congress passed an 8 3 billion spending package as the virus was popping up in some states but its reach within the u s was still unknown that funding which was more than triple what the trump administration initially requested was meant to help government agencies in halting the spread and to fund vaccine developments but as the number of infections rose it became rapidly evident more was needed on wednesday the senate passed a second major stimulus package offering economic relief to americans whose lives have been disrupted by newer developments like restaurant closures the shuttering of entire states schools and self imposed quarantines discussions are also underway for a third bill likely with the highest price tag that would offer assistance to struggling small businesses and could also include sending individual checks to americans all told the total cost to taxpayers could exceed 1 trillion the legislation now heads to president donald trump s desk to sign into law speaking from the senate floor after the bill passed on wednesday mcconnell said this bill was a very important step but not the final one indicating that a third package was imminent mcconnell said republicans would be working with the white house to ensure a unified front and would then begin negotiating with the democrats we are moving rapidly because the situation demands it mcconnell said but as a sign of a fractured congress ahead plans in the senate to pass the measure stalled on tuesday amid a minor republican insurrection by wednesday the critics of the speedy spending relented and allowed a vote the measure passed with an overwhelming 90 votes the house passed the relief bill with overwhelming bipartisan support on march 14 but house speaker nancy pelosi and treasury secretary steven mnuchin had to work out an additional technical correction that ended up scaling back its paid leave provision a sticking point during negotiations over the bill the house unanimously approved the new version on monday under the version of the bill proposed by house democrats on march 11 full time workers would have been eligible to accrue seven days worth of sick leave on a permanent basis and 14 additional days of paid leave during public health emergencies republican lawmakers though were concerned those benefits would impose a burden on small businesses and lead to layoffs in the final version there is no permanent sick leave provision and businesses with fewer than 50 employees would be able to ask the department of labor for exemptions to the two weeks of coronavirus related leave included in the final version the bill also includes free coronavirus testing for anyone who needs it expands programs like food assistance for children who rely on school meals and employment insurance and increases medicaid funds for overworked state and local governments even with the final tweaks republican senators expressed misgivings about the paid leave component of the bill some of mcconnell s rank and file members had hoped to amend the house s version and expand on it as tuesday began but mcconnell told lawmakers that help for hotels that are suddenly emptied can be part of the next bigger stimulus package we all know a bigger proposal is necessary mcconnell said as he told colleagues uncomfortable with the house s 100 billion plus bill to gag and vote for it anyway republican lawmakers appeared poised to heed mcconnell s call what they ve done in the house i don t think can be changed by republicans in the senate said sen lindsey graham of south carolina conceding that the senate would likely just vote on the package and move on to the next one aides at both ends of pennsylvania avenue know the bill before the senate now whenever it passes will not be the last measure congress takes to help americans weather the pandemic mcconnell has deputized his colleagues into three task force operations to draft a follow up package that could put cash directly into americans pockets help businesses survive the downturn and enable banks to be able to continue lending this is where wall street and main street alike would find help the airlines alone are asking for 60 billion in assistance the politics of such a big package are expected to be fraught the broad call for unity and urgency did not translate into unanimity everyone has their own version of what the next and possibly biggest package should look like senate democratic leader chuck schumer on monday unveiled a 750 billion package that carried his party s ambitions for a recovery mnunchin offered an 850 billion package which included some overlaps with democrats requests and at the white house the president indicated that the total price tag to taxpayers was going to top 1 trillion for now mcconnell is assembling his proposal with only republican input and the fast changing dynamics are making senators nervous this is a herculean task from a legislative point of view to craft something this significant with 53 people it just you know can t be done mcconnell told reporters as a first step toward senate republicans package senators susan collins of maine and marco rubio of florida on wednesday introduced a 300 billion plan that would help small businesses cover payroll costs and overhead they announced at the capitol that they were branding it the restoring economic security confidence and user endurance businesses act of 2020 or rescue act in a sign that things were very much changed they streamed their press conference on it via facebook the final cost could be staggering particularly for republicans who usually pride themselves on fiscal responsibility republicans seemingly overnight shifted their orthodoxy away from small government market based capitalism to full throated championing of corporate subsidies asked what had changed mcconnell likened the situation to others he has faced in the senate including the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks the 2008 stock market crash and the 2013 fiscal cliff which threatened spikes in taxes and massive cuts in government spending mcconnell told colleagues that they should prepare to stay in washington for the near future once dispersed to the states re assembling the aged chamber could be a challenge and even a life threatening exercise mcconnell said he would take precautions such as longer windows to vote so as to avoid a jumble at doors or crowding on the floor but he wants his colleagues together we re not going to leave this building until we get the job done sen mitt romney of utah told reporters at a largely deserted capitol on tuesday it may take us a few days or a few weeks but we re going to get the job done with reporting by abby vesoulis columbus ohio write to alana abramson at alana abramson time com and philip elliott at philip elliott time com
