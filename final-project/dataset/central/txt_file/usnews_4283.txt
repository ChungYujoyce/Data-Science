washington the supreme court posed tough questions to both sides tuesday inlandmarkdisputes pitting president trump against house democrats and new york prosecutors over access to trump s personal and corporate financial records on one hand the court s liberal and some conservative justices challengedthe president slawyersand the justice department to defend trump s refusal to comply with subpoenas seeking information from his accountant and bankers the house wants the documents in pursuit of legislation the prosecutors for a grand jury investigation on the other hand all the conservatives and some liberal justices wondered whether the subpoenas go too far in seeking a decade of private data involving not only the president but members of his family they suggested such extensive probing could harass and distract both trump and future presidents after nearly 3 hours of debate it seemed likely that the twotitanic battles will not yield the unanimous verdicts against presidential immunity that befell two of trump s predecessors richard nixon and bill clinton at the hands of the high court the dilemma was summed up best by the newest associate justice brett kavanaugh near the end of the debate over thehouse subpoenas how can we both protect the house s interest in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency kavanaugh asked house general counsel douglas letter icymi supreme court hears argument in cases over congressional subpoenas the dramaticoral arguments conducted by telephoneamid the coronavirus pandemic and broadcast live could result in landmark rulings on a president s immunity from investigation while in office andcongress oversight powers right in the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign in previous separation of powersbattles over documents or testimony the supreme courtruled unanimously againstnixon in 1974 and clinton in 1997 with their nominees in agreement the decisionsled eventually to nixon s resignationandclinton s impeachment that history raises the pressure on today s high court which chief justice john roberts has said should seek unanimity wherever possible on tuesday it seemed like a tall order why should we not defer to the house s views aboutits own legislative purposes associate justice neil gorsuch a trump nominee asked the president s lawyer but even liberal associate justice stephen breyer notedthe subpoenas go way way beyond tax returns a concern voiced by several conservative colleagues at some point there s a straw that breaks the camel s back associate justice clarence thomas said at some point it debilitates the president thelegal battles pit trump against three house committees controlled by democrats that have issued subpoenas foreight years of financial documents a separate fight involvesmanhattan district attorney cyrus vance s subpoena for similar documents as well as the tax returns that trump unlike recent predecessors has not released in the new york case trump attorney jay sekulow argued that the president has absolute immunity from a criminal investigation while in office a position that got pushback from several justices sekulowsaid allowing the manhattan district attorney to obtain trump s financial records would empower some 2 300 local district attorneys in the country most of whom were elected totarget sitting presidents for political purposes associate justice sonia sotomayor seemed highly skeptical contending that the president was asking for a broader immunity than anyone else gets i find it odd that you want us to rule that there is essentially an absolute immunity from investigative powers the height of a state s subpoena police powers she said roberts questioned sekulow about why the subpoena can t move forward saying the court had previously allowed clinton to be sued by a former employee you focus on the distraction to the president roberts told sekulow but in clinton s case the court was not persuaded that the distraction in that case meant that discovery could not proceed carey dunne general counsel for the manhattan da s office rejected sekulow s claim that allowing the subpoena would empower an army of local prosecutors he noted that the subject of the probe the trump organization is based in new york city associate justice samuel alito warned that local prosecutors routinely leak information to the press but dunnesaid he s not aware of any kind of real pattern or practice of leaking grand jury materials solicitor general noel francisco arguing for the justice department did not push for absolute immunity instead he said state prosecutors like federal prosecutors should be required to show why the documents they re seeking are critical to the charging decision icymi high court considers manhattan da s efforts to get trump s financial records lawmakers in the congressional cases claimthe records will help determine the need for future legislation in areas such as campaign finance law bank loan practices and efforts to prevent foreign influence in elections that view won support from associate justice ruth bader ginsburg one must investigate before legislation ginsburg said the purpose of investigation is to frame the legislation trump s lawyer inthose cases patrick strawbridge accused lawmakers of setting a dragnet to see if the president is guilty of tax fraud or money laundering without limits he said nothing would prevent lawmakersfrom seeking even trump s medical records or dna these subpoenas are overreaching they are an obvious distraction strawbridge said they are going to multiply if this court accepts the path that the house is attempting to lay three liberal justices ginsburg and associate justices sonia sotomayor and elena kagan appeared to take the house s side while thomas and alitoleaned toward the president that left roberts gorsuch breyer and kavanaugh closer to the middle roberts summed up the dispute over the breadth of the house subpoenas by noting congress has aright to seekpersonal records but at some point he said it can lead to harassment and become a distraction for the president most presidents throughout their term have a pretty long to do list he said all three branches of government have much at stake the political earthquakethat some justices may be seeking to sidestepwould be most acutely felt if the president loses and the documents aremade public during his reelection campaign for nearly five years since declaring his candidacy in 2015 trump has managed to keep his tax returns and much of his financial data from prying eyes congress has much at stake as well its oversight authority could be constrained by a ruling in trump s favor setting a precedent for future investigations particularly those viewed as partisan there also arehigh stakes facing the high court if it sides with trump along ideological lines withfive justices named by republican presidents in the majority and four named by democrats in dissent itcould emerge as damaged goods in the eyes of the public risky supreme court battle over donald trump s finances carries risks for all three branches the congressional subpoenas emanate from three house committees rather than one or both houses of congress a potential shortcoming trump s lawyers have sought to impress upon the supreme court the house
