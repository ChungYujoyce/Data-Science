doris kearns goodwin lives surrounded by american history her home in concord mass is minutes from the site of one of the first battles of the american revolution the house itself cool on a day that broke heat records in nearby boston is full of history too what was once a three car garage is now a library abraham lincoln books are in there and franklin roosevelt is nearby the section on theodore roosevelt is upstairs a small room with exercise bikes is devoted to memoir fiction has its place too and at the end of one hallway there s a section that might surprise visitors to the home of one of the nation s most famous historians business and psychology books on leadership that section is new these and the papers in dozens of colorful three ring binders in a nearby room were research materials for goodwin s new book leadership in turbulent times out sept 18 leadership guru is a role goodwin 75 has filled informally for years as a frequent speaker on lessons gleaned from the presidents who have been the subjects of her award winning biographies in her new book goodwin has taken her guys lincoln both roosevelts and lyndon b johnson and crafted elements of their parallel stories into a comparatively slim volume read nearly 500 pages counting the bibliography for history buffs and c suiters alike goodwin says the writing experience reminded her of graduate school when she and her friends would talk about how their studies might offer a path forward in their own lives it felt like coming full circle she says and allowed her to feel like she was paying something of a debt to the leaders she has chronicled over the years each time i finished a project i had to move that guy s books to another room and i always felt i was vaguely betraying him goodwin says this time i could keep them all where they were in leadership each president gets his start faces obstacles personal and national and achieves success some moments stand out teddy roosevelt s handling of a strike or fdr s road map for the first 100 days which became a staple for future presidents first terms from lincoln comes the idea of writing hot letters never to be sent to get out one s anger it s hard to imagine goodwin angry she won t let time take an unsmiling photo of her but she says anyone can use that tip and a coda to lbj s story about his lack of leadership on vietnam neatly highlights the stakes of her lessons goodwin has a close up perspective on johnson having helped with his memoirs following a fellowship in his white house but that s not the only reason leadership is personal in ways a presidential biography can t be the subject demands to be related to one s own life and goodwin isn t immune lincoln s praise for his team was a reminder to thank her own helpers even more each of the four presidents she profiles had to return from at least one big setback similarly she faced plagiarism accusations in the early 2000s which she has attributed to mistakes caused by a faulty note taking system goodwin retreated briefly from public life before returning with team of rivals the best selling lincoln biography that inspired both steven spielberg it s a basis for lincoln and then senator barack obama who called her to discuss it there was also an overlay of personal sadness goodwin was writing an epilogue about the presidents deaths just as her husband jfk and johnson adviser richard n goodwin faced the final stages of cancer he died in may and she says it was helpful to reflect at that time on what it meant to leave a legacy knowing that he felt that he had an extraordinary life and that the world understood that too she says was just such a comforting factor over lunch at a concord inn that s older than the united states goodwin returns to a favorite story about fdr in 1940 he set a target for u s warplane production that seemed impossible to hit and yet that goal would ignite the imagination of the aviation industry the moral is that leadership involves presenting others with a vision of what they might achieve the new book also means to offer an instructive new perspective its most urgent lesson isn t found in any specific example of how a great man faced down a great problem rather she says it s in seeing just how massive their problems were this has become more apparent over the past couple of years we re going to ignore history at our own peril she says i d like to think it would give people reassurance to know that if you think we re in the worst of times right now it isn t the worst yes these times qualify as turbulent she says although she didn t know how much when she started the book about five years ago beyond any specific failures of leadership in its capital she sees the u s as overwhelmed by polarization the four examples she uses may help citizens recognize good leadership when they see it but even more she hopes citizens will remember that greater obstacles have been overcome before it s like being in war so long you don t know what peace is like goodwin says we ve been at each other s throats so long in washington to know and remember what bipartisanship is like that s what i want people to see we had it that possibility of a better world isn t limited to politics all of her subjects earn her praise for taking time to retreat reflect and pause amid crisis if you think work emails arriving in your inbox during vacation makes that impossible think again if lincoln during the civil war can go to the theater a hundred times and if fdr during world war ii can have a cocktail hour every night where you can only talk about books you ve read and gossip and if teddy roosevelt can take two hours every afternoon to exercise she says none of us has an excuse we just keep thinking our time is more complicated it is because we ve made it so goodwin is pretty good at pausing too when she watches her beloved boston red sox she says she thinks about only baseball and she has made a ritual of eating out with friends multiple times a week the historic tavern where we had lunch is their thursday spot she s big into mysteries and she makes time for family and neighbors one of her sons lives in concord with his family and their town is the kind where people stop to say hello including five separate times during our postlunch visit to the concord bookshop she s also taking a slower paced approach to the question of what comes next she wants to finish the book her husband was writing when he died which she describes as a love letter to the idea of america several film projects based on her work are in progress spielberg has moved on to her teddy roosevelt william howard taft book and a miniseries drawn from her fdr work may happen too and she has started a production company with her manager she s not sure she wants to spend another decade on a biography if the right person came along maybe but that would mean moving her books again and that doesn t feel right not yet it s still just too close to this one she says i d feel like i was betraying these guys before they d even come back to life this appears in the september 17 2018 issue of time
