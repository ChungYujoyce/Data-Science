of fear and false information here s how people are working to address that loading march 18 2020 it s one thing to quarantine people it s another to contain the fear and false information that s gone viral in the world s first social media pandemic conspiracy theories have spread faster than the virus itself scientific papers are being hastily released and debunked the trump administration has alleged a foreign disinformation campaign to spread fear as everyone from data scientists to pastors try to address this parallel challenge dubbed an infodemic by the world health organization many see an opportunity for society to come together in this crisis and emerge the stronger for it sometimes a crisis can give us a lot of fear but it can also prompt us to think deeper and to think better says dr kristen lee a behavioral science expert at northeastern university in boston who cautions against hype contagion she advocates limiting social media consumption and finding opportunities to help others and live in a purpose driven way when we re using our skills resources and capacities to contribute to the betterment of society she says that really is known to elevate and protect our well being through times of difficulty one thing quarantines can t stop is the spread of false information and fear on facebook and other popular platforms in the world s first social media pandemic that presents a parallel set of challenges for citizens and leaders alike many have found social media an effective tool for rapidly conveying official guidelines and recommended practices as well as for connecting with each other and supporting the most vulnerable in society but mixed in has been a torrent of misguided advice and inaccurate claims including from supposedly scientific studies this false information has amplified concerns in ways that have made it difficult to ascertain clearly the scope of the global health challenge and how best to address it the director general of the world health organization has called on governments companies and news outlets around the globe to tackle an infodemic of fake news which he characterized as being as dangerous as the coronavirus itself the u s state department s foreign propaganda busting center has compiled a report on some 2 million tweets spreading conspiracy theories about the epidemic concluding that at least some of the activity was due to coordinated campaigns involving fake accounts according to the washington post and amid the swirl of dire predictions a microbiology professor in spain has deemed this a pandemic of fear editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall indeed fear and false information have gone viral everyone from data scientists and doctors to psychologists and pastors are weighing in on how to contain this infodemic and its attendant effects many see an opportunity for society and individuals to come out of this crisis the stronger for it sometimes a crisis can give us a lot of fear but it can also prompt us to think deeper and to think better says kristen lee a behavioral science professor at northeastern university in boston who cautions against hype contagion to avoid the sometimes paralyzing effects of fear she advocates limiting social media consumption and finding opportunities to help others and live in a purpose driven way when we re using our skills resources and capacities to contribute to the betterment of society dr lee says that really is known to elevate and protect our well being through times of difficulty carl bergstrom a biologist at the university of washington says half jokingly that he was pre designed for this crisis with a background in studying novel infectious diseases as well as how information spreads through networks from ant colonies to facebook as he s monitored false information online about covid 19 he s seen everything from anti china conspiracy theories including the intentional development of coronavirus as a bioweapon to snake oil salesmen peddling fake cures those cures have included special toothpaste and potions prompting a spoof from comedian john oliver who offered premium werewolf solution for 49 99 one of the challenges of combating false information is the underlying architecture of social media and the algorithms that drive it what goes viral doesn t have a lot to do with what s true it has to do with what s shocking says professor bergstrom who commends social media companies for trying to prevent misinformation from spreading on their platforms on the one hand kudos to them for doing that on the other hand the problem exists in an ecosystem of their making in addition to the often well intentioned sharing of unverified information that turns out to be false another threat is organized disinformation campaigns designed to distract distort and deceive when the crisis ramped up last week there was a four to five day window in which official communication channels were relatively unfettered by such campaigns says marc ambinder a digital fellow at the university of southern california studying disinformation and cybersecurity around elections but he adds if the number of cases spikes there s going to be more anxiety and the purveyors of disinformation in this arms race are going to regain their footing very quickly the trump administration has alleged that a foreign disinformation campaign is underway to sow fear this past weekend the national security council tweeted text message rumors of a national quarantine are fake there is no national lockdown governors and mayors have issued similar missives and the pentagon has called out china for spreading false absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of covid 19 blaming u s service members an internal european union document describes a significant disinformation campaign by russian state media and pro kremlin outlets regarding covid 19 in numerous languages designed to exacerbate confusion panic and fear and thereby undermine public trust in authorities and national health care systems messages in spanish for example advance apocalyptic stories blame capitalists for trying to benefit from the virus and emphasise how well russia and president vladimir putin are dealing with the outbreak according to a financial times report nicholas christakis a physician and sociologist at yale who has become a prominent voice on covid 19 complained on twitter of having gained the unwanted attention of lots of russian bots their intent seems to be to waste my time their psychological tricks are incredible he wrote toomas hendrik ilves the former president of estonia which is a leader in countering disinformation responded that attempts to disrupt disinform and dismay are par for the course he tweeted back no need to interact block ever since i started tweeting useful and accurate information about coronavirus i seem to have attracted the attention of a lot of russian bots with 50 followers and nutty twitter streams their intent seems to be to waste my time their psychological tricks are incredible in this turgid information environment it has been difficult for leaders to find a healthy balance between conveying calm and being frank about troubling facts as former treasury secretary henry paulson jr advised in a washington post op ed last week imparting lessons he learned from helping to steer the nation through the 2008 economic crisis he called fear as big an enemy as the virus itself to be sure minimizing or ignoring information from official sources carries its own dangers and there is disagreement about what constitutes an appropriate level of fear some say fear spurs people into necessary action but it can also lead to poor decision making and unnecessary worry and negatively affect one s health after working for 45 years in the field of psychiatry i have seen fear cause a lot of long term consequences in people s lives says dr mary moller associate professor of nursing at pacific lutheran university in washington and the 2018 american psychiatric nurses association s psychiatric nurse of the year ultimately over time it can lead to compromising your immune system in addition to mental health professionals efforts to help people address their fears faith leaders are also pointing seekers to spiritual sources and encouraging them to minister to their neighbors there s not only a physical toll but there s a psychological emotional and spiritual toll that we need to be aware of and we need to pray through says derwin gray lead elder pastor of transformation church in indian land south carolina citing scriptural promises of reassurance when we are serving other people s needs that s when we tend to be the most healthy coming together to work through this crisis could be a catalyst for human progress says virologist anjeanette roberts who worked on sars for three years and serves as a research scholar with reasons to believe it s the crises that have the ability to bring out the very best in us because it makes us lay aside what we tend to focus on that can divide us says dr roberts a public advocate of her christian faith who is deeply concerned about the level of polarization in american society today we have gotten really far away from the idea of do unto others as you would have them do unto you now with a global health challenge that has neighbors leaning out their windows and singing together younger people going grocery shopping for their older neighbors little kids leaving drawings in every mailbox in their neighborhood and many other examples of people helping each other some see an opportunity not only to survive the crisis but come out stronger for it get the
