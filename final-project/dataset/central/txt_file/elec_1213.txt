on tuesday quinnipiac released a poll in which several democratic challengers lead president donald trump with former vice president joseph biden ahead 53 40 percent quinnipiaclast thursday democratic candidate joe biden declared that he no longer supports a long standing congressional ban on using federal health care money to pay for abortions this came days after his campaign had indicated he supported the ban ap newson monday biden told lobbyists and donors at a fundraiser that republicans in congress know better than to align with president donald trump and declared that wall street bankers can be positive influences in the country wall street windowon tuesday democratic candidate pete buttigieg gave a speech on foreign policy c span the left is encouraged by the polling continues to be critical of biden and offers thoughts on buttigieg s speech especially bleak is the fact that trump s approval rating is more than a dozen points underwater in wisconsin michigan and iowa all states he won in 2016 of course a lot can change between now and november of next year and in fairness to trump it is true that state level polls underestimated his support in 2016 it s undeniable however that the 2020 polling taken in its totality doesn t look good for trump right now aaron rupar vox the head to head polling doesn t really tell us much about events 18 months in the future but it does tell us there s no counterintuitive process whereby trump secures the votes of tons of people who say he s doing a bad job as president the public is mostly saying they want to vote for any democrat and the strongest pattern so far indicates better known democrats do better than the more obscure ones rather than being either complacent or paralyzed by fear democrats should probably take a modest amount of reassurance from trump s bad polls and try worrying about everything else for a minute matthew yglesias vox many argue that biden is wrong to imply that if only trump is gone republicans in congress will immediately negotiate with a democratic president in good faith in fact senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky brags that he will continue to be the grim reaper and destroy any legislation from a democratic president while promising to further pack the supreme court if a vacancy arises during an election year biden and democratic candidates for the presidency house and senate should run against the hugely unpopular grim reaper mcconnell and the trump republicans in washington brent budowsky the hill does biden believe in his own powers of persuasion or is he attempting to woo prized obama to trump voters not to mention upscale white suburbanites reported to be appalled by trump s behavior but there s another crowd this stuff appeals to as well a group that would rather not discuss the economic issues that contributed to trump s victory that would be the donor class of the democratic party there s lots of evidence to suggest that biden really does think he brings unique skills at bipartisanship to the presidential table he did make deals with the republicans aplenty in the 1970s 1980s and 1990s but they were deals like the hyde amendment and bankruptcy reform that made life harder for people in financial trouble or struggling with student debt though not for the wealthiest if members of the democratic donor class are putting their faith in biden it s hard to blame them the real question is whether voters will continue to support biden as it becomes clearer and clearer that his promise of bipartisanship is simply another more politically palatable way of saying that the rich will continue to come first helaine olen washington post regarding buttigieg s speech some argue he is an heir to obama s cautious and intellectual worldview except that while obama was at heart a realist influenced by the writings of reinhold niebuhr and the actions of brent scowcroft buttigieg is more motivated by values buttigieg is at heart a liberal internationalist who is looking beyond interventions to challenges posed by great powers bridging the gap between the obama and clinton wings of his party he fears that left untended threats to liberty abroad will ultimately threaten liberty at home buttigieg still has a lot of work to do to unpack what this means but if he sticks to it and is bolder than he was on tuesday he may be able to articulate the alternative he promised thomas wright the atlantic others contend buttigieg wants to set a generous narrative of national identity against trump s cramped and cruel vision and against the progressive hostility to any national identity at all it won t be easy he speaks of the compassion of his indiana neighbors toward refugees their desire to be part of a greater project than just america first but the strongest political emotions of the moment are fear disillusionment and hatred as impressive as he is personally buttigieg hasn t yet found the words the music and the policies to make his appeal convincing george packer the atlantic the right is skeptical of polls this early in the campaign and offers thoughts on biden s candidacy the right is skeptical of polls this early in the campaign and offers thoughts on biden s candidacy regarding the quinnipiac poll i m skeptical these numbers would actually be representative of the general election according to the poll trump would barely edge out biden among white voters 47 to 46 in 2016 trump beat hillary clinton by 20 points among white voters and this was not unheard of mitt romney beat the obama biden ticket by 20 points among whites in 2012 and john mccain won whites by 12 points in 2008 quinnipiac also found that sen kamala harris d calif would get within eight points of trump among white voters not since 1996 when bill clinton came within two points of bob dole has any democrat come within single digits among whites it s just hard to see harris having the best performance among whites in 24 years running against trump who has built his successful electoral career around white identity politics philip klein washington examiner we are 17 months away from the election at this point in the 2016 election season polls showed hillary clinton ahead of trump by huge margins an associated press poll published on 10 25 16 two weeks before the election gave the race to clinton by 13 points the same margin that quinnipiac gives to biden today elizabeth vaughn redstate iowa democratic voters have seen and heard much more from the contenders than almost any other state and thus are much less likely to base their preferences largely on name identification for biden that hasn t been a good thing the state s ideological lean also hampers biden sixty eight percent of 2016 democratic caucusgoers were liberals according to the entrance poll that s bad news for biden whose national lead rests on moderate voters there are simply many fewer potential biden voters in the state than there are in the nation as a whole this places organization at a premium as it is crucial for him to turn out every last potential vote if biden can t win in iowa he s unlikely to be able to catch up later henry olsen washington post some argue the only democratic candidate with real national stature is former vice president joe biden but biden has always been a weak self destructive candidate and he is still a weak self destructive candidate from defending the chinese to sniffing people s hair to plagiarizing others there is a bidenness that plagued his first two campaigns for president and will probably destroy this one if biden does fade and recent iowa polls certainly make this possible the democrats will have no national candidate newt gingrich fox news others contend biden s decision to change his position on the hyde amendment is actually something abortion supporters should welcome because it is a tribute to the power they hold pro lifers loved george h w bush when he flip flopped and just look at the behavior of evangelicals in relation to trump on social issues making converts out of politicians is what activism is all about punishing someone for joining you is politically insane even for people who often seem politically insane the truth is that biden is running a nearly perfect campaign in the early going based on one implicit message i can beat trump because i can speak to his voters and i m not a crazy socialist like some of these other folks john podhoretz new york post still others point out that a recent npr marist poll finds only 18 percent support third trimester abortion yet every democratic senator running for president voted against a bill requiring doctors to help infants who survive a late term abortion senator kirsten gillibrand n y says there s no room in the party for a democratic candidate who does not support women s full reproductive freedom that s slamming the door on a majority of voters the democratic contenders are espousing policies few americans support and giving moderate and conservative members of their own party the cold shoulder democrats eyeing the white house need to get real by writing off moderate and conservative members of their own party they re boosting trump s chances of reelection then again trump s reelection may be the gut punch that brings the democratic party back to its senses betsy mccaughey national review a massive krispy kreme flagship store is opening in times square complete with a glaze waterfall people
