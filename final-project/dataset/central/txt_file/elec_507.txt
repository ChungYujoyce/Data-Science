the funniest strangest and otherwise noteworthy ads of the campaign season by d angelo gore posted on november 4 2014 we ve been diligent little fact checkers all year long well not today it s election day folks and we ve done all we can do to help educate voters about the candidates and their positions now it s time to have some fun here for your reading and viewing pleasure we recognize some of the political ads that made us laugh dance gasp cringe or some combination thereof this year s award recipients include an entertaining ad about a politician gone mad a trailer for a bad fake film about loan sharks a racy parody of erectile dysfunction commercials and an ad featuring an endorsement from a bible carrying gun toting celebrity now on with the show peeved politician award winner illinois state rep mike bost in a democratic congressional campaign committee ad kudos to thedccc for this hilarious in our opinion ad featuring clips of republican state rep mike bost losing his temper during an illinois house session in 2012 bost was a tad upset about the handling of a pension bill he didn t get to read or something and voiced his frustration in an epic rant directed at the democratic house speaker he yelled and gestured wildly he compared himself to a slave in egypt and smacked at a stack of papers in mid air it was awesome the dccc uses footage of the tirade to make the case that meltdown mike as the dccc calls bost is unfit to represent illinois as a u s congressman mike bost keeps melting down in springfield the ad s narrator says as video of bost having a fit plays in the background the ad closes with the narrator saying now bost wants to be in congress he d make washington worse perhaps but he might make it more entertaining too imagine if bost and angry pat murphy whose assault on a rose adorned microphone in the iowa house is featured in a national republican congressional committee ad are elected to congress we were perplexed by one thing in the dccc ad though who are those people completely unbothered as bost s theatrics played on their tvs we couldn t look away from our computer screens and hit the replay button more than a few times ad most likely to get you fired winner j d winteregg former congressional candidate in ohio former tea party candidate j d winteregg had a bit of a hit with this suggestive web ad poking house speaker john boehner for erectile excuse us electile dysfunction sometimes when a politician has been in d c too long it goes to his head and he just can t seem to get the job done the ad s narrator says other signs of electile dysfunction may include extreme skin discoloration the inability to punch one s self out of a wet paper bag or maintain a spine in the face of liberal opposition the narrator continues taking more jabs at the longtime ohio congressman who claims his tan is ahem natural the ad just brimming with sexual innuendo parodies commercials for products like levitra and cialis that combat erectile dysfunction you see some people tend to mispronounce boehner s name as joy behar repeatedly did on her talk show get it anyway the ad as clever as it was couldn t get the job done either winteregg lost to boehner in the primary by nearly 50 percentage points and that s not all he lost cedarville university the ohio baptist college that employed winteregg as an adjunct professor decided not to renew his contract beyond 2014 citing the ad as the reason least anticipated fall film winner gary peters loan sharknado sharknado great sharknado 2 the second one even better gary peters loan sharknado terrible we know that just from this 30 second faux trailer the cartoon like ad from the michigan republican party attacks peters the 14th district congressman running for u s senate for having ties to loans sharks it was obviously inspired by the satirical syfy films that were so over the top bad they were good dark clouds are gathering and gary peters is in the eye of the storm the narrator says in his best movie trailer voice over voice then an animated peters is seen outrunning a tornado as cash vomiting loan sharks fall from the sky that is we think peters is running based on the way his arms are moving he could very well be dancing or driving an invisible car the narrator goes on to accuse peters of being funded by a convicted felon connected to a loan shark ring run by an international gangster who also contributed to peters campaign there s some truth to that but this is the awards piece we re not here for a fact check there s no evidence the gop paid to run the ad on tv it probably hoped the cheap looking video would go viral it didn t about 47 000 youtube views so far but the huffington post did call it this cycle s best worst campaign ad that s not nothing the helen reddy i am woman award winner joni ernst candidate for u s senate in iowa is there anything joni ernst can t do not according to her campaign ads the mother soldier and conservative senate candidate is no everywoman i grew up castrating hogs on an iowa farm so when i get to washington i ll know how to cut pork ernst says in the squeal ad that made her a gop star and only cost 9 000 to air who knew hog castrating was a skill voters looked for in a candidate surely not her opponents in the republican primary or they would have thought to use it in an ad first but that s not all as her follow up ad shot demonstrates ernst can ride a harley davidson is really good with a pistol and wears an oversize leather jacket like nobody else she even knows the secret to making a great biscuit according to another ad she must also be a bit of a psychic based on references to what she ll do when not if she gets to d c about the only thing ernst can t do as far as we can tell is shake the claim that she would privatize social security if she can do that we ll really be impressed biggest fan of mitch mcconnell winner kentucky sen mitch mcconnell here s an advertisement only elaine chao could love and not just because she makes a cameo or two this video is nothing but annoyingly upbeat music and chao s husband senate minority leader mitch mcconnell for two minutes and 22 seconds look there he is at his desk making notes signing important papers and giving us his version of a smile there he is again shaking hands giving speeches and doing interviews if only we could hear what he s saying and there he is once more wearing his casual best walking talking and being social with college students he s so cool the video isn t actually an ad for mcconnell s reelection campaign that s good because we can t imagine anyone sitting through it it was designed to legally provide super pacs and other outside groups with b roll of the five term senator that could be used in ads either propping up mcconnell or tearing down his challengers never mind that the footage was also used by mcconnell s democratic opponent in a web ad against him comedian jon stewart also had some fun with it as it turns out mcconnell s wasn t the only team to produce such a video the campaigns of democrats kay hagan bruce braley and mark begich put together similar reels for their candidates but to us mcconnell s was the best i e the most awkward and the only one to have the whole internet mcconnelling for those reasons it should be rewarded best auto tuned dance party ad winner kentucky sen mitch mcconnell team mitch was on it this year giving us two ads worthy of recognition including this web video with acatchy song that would make t pain envious the ad begins with alison lundergan grimes mcconnell s democratic challenger thanking herself with the help of spliced togethervideo clips and a lot of auto tune i wanna thank me me me i wanna thank me me me i wanna thank me me me i wanna thank alison lundergan grimes she raps trust us you must watch the ad to get the full effect our writing just doesn t do it justice the ad then asks repeatedly what rhymes with alison lundergan grimes what what rhymes with alison lundergan grimes for those stuck like we were the ad then says not ready for prime time sticks to party line and left wing mime yes those three do rhyme so does dance party time now that we think of it the oh no she didn t award winner wendy davis candidate for texas governor oh wendy davis what were you thinking trailing badly in the polls davis a democrat released this controversial ad that rubbed a lot of people the wrong way it opens with a shot of an empty wheelchair as a narrator says a tree fell on greg abbott he sued and got millions since then he s spent his career working against other victims that s a reference to davis republican opponent who s paralyzed and uses a wheelchair let s just say the image didn t go over well abbot s campaign called the ad disgusting the state s republican party chairman called it the most offensive and despicable ad he had ever seen and demanded davis apologize ben dreyfuss writing for mother jones magazine called the ad nasty and said it shouldn t exist she s basically calling abbott a cripple he wrote davis didn t apologize instead she called abbott a hypocrite and defended the ad in a press conference surrounded by several of her supporters who use wheelchairs the ad may have been in bad taste but we ll note that we didn t find that it made any factually challenged claims about abbott that s one positive thing we can say about it the stating the obvious award winner alison lundergan grimes candidate for u s senate in kentucky not to be outdone by her republican opponent alison lundergan grimes wins her own award for an ad that we think is a bit of a misfire raise your hand if you mistook grimes for a six foot tall black man yeah us neither yet grimes bought tv time to run this ad letting mitch mcconnell and other kentuckians know she s not the president of the united states mitch mcconnell wants you to think i m barack obama grimes says while shooting skeet i m not barack obama i disagree with him on guns coal and the epa we can vouch for grimes on coal and the epa and she looks pretty comfortable firing that gun not that anyone ever confused this president with teddy roosevelt sure obama talked of skeet shooting all the time at camp david but the only proof the white house provided was a photo of him in tinted shades holding a smoking shotgun but after seeing grimes in action you don t have to be sherlock to consider this case of mistaken identity closed best celebrity endorsement winner phil robertson duck commander this ad stars phil robertson of duck dynasty fame telling louisianans why he s supporting 5th congressional district candidate zach dasher a hint god and guns hey louisiana robertson starts saying louisiana in a way we ve never quite heard before bibles and guns brought us here and bibles and guns will keep us here he says while holding an assault rifle and a bible held together by duct tape zach dasher believes in both that s why i m voting for him he concludes that s funny we thought it might have something to do with the fact that robertson is dasher s uncle but we suppose bibles and guns are good reasons too other contenders for this award included alabama frontman randy owen who sort of sings in ads formitch mcconnell and republican senate candidate thom tillis as well as brett favre who channeled owen s look and hit the gym hard real hard for his own appearance in a u s chamber of commerce ad supporting sen thad cochran creepiest ads opposing obamacare winner generation opportunity talk about a government takeover of health care this generation opportunity ad made us grateful for our employer sponsored health insurance thank you upenn a young man new to obamacare is shown talking to a doctor who instructs him to drop his trousers hop up on a table and bring his knees to his chest is this necessary the now bare bottomed and vulnerable man asks the physician at this point we were also wondering what had brought him to the doctor s office that day the doctor leaves the room and then a giant grinning uncle sam appears to perform a rectal examination there was a similarly disturbing ad with uncle sam set to give a pelvic exam to deter young women from signing up for plans on the exchanges the ads say don t let government play doctor you don t have to tell us twice the creepy uncle sam ads were just one part of the conservative group s campaign to educate young americans about alternatives to obamacare there were parties at over 20 college campuses and a traveling circus too we re not sure how effective those efforts have been however in may the obama administration reported that 2 2 million young adults ages 18 34 had signed up for exchange plans during the initial enrollment period including 1 2 million who signed up in march several months after the ads went up in september 2013 we ve heard our share of obamacare horror stories but don t recall any about the personification of american government mr i want you himself playing doctor the ad about nothing award winner terri lynn land candidate for u s senate in michigan we close with a word of advice to those who will be running for office in 2016 do not we repeat do not do what terri lynn land did this year if you make a 30 second tv ad to defend yourself against claims that you re waging a war on women you better do more in that ad than have a beverage and check the time but that s exactly what land a republican senate candidate did in her ad responding not at all to claims made by her democratic opponent i m terri lynn land congressman peters and his buddies want you to believe i m waging a war on women she says to the camera really she asks before telling ad watchers to ponder that thought for the next 13 seconds while elevator music plays land does nothing other than drink coffee we think from a mug shake her head and look at her watch when she finally decides to speak she wastes two more seconds giving her name as if we forgot before saying i approve this message because as a woman i might know a little bit more about women than gary peters that s it nothing else to see here republican pollster frank lutz called it the worst ad of the political process the ad he said doesn t give any message it doesn t tell you anything about her and it doesn t communicate any sense of substance she s a challenger she has to prove where she stands she doesn t do it that ad should be off the air but frank tell us how you really feel

rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
