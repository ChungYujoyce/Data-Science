in late februaryas coronavirus infections mounted in wuhan china authorities went door to door for health checks forcibly isolating every resident in makeshift hospitals and temporary quarantine shelters even separating parents from young childrenwho displayed symptoms of covid 19 no matter how seemingly mild caretakers at the city s ubiquitous large apartmentbuildings were pressed into service as ad hoc security guards monitoring the temperatures of all residents deciding who could come inand implementing inspections of delivered food and medicines outside drones hovered above streets yelling at people to get inside and scolding them for not wearing face masks while elsewhere in china facial recognition software linked to a mandatory phone app that color coded people based on their contagion risk decided who could enter shopping malls subways cafes and other public spaces daily coronavirus updates first thing in the morning to your inbox sign up for usa today s daily briefing here we couldn t go outside under any circumstances not even if you have a pet said wang jingjun 27 a graduate student who returned to wuhan from the chinese coastal province of guangdong which borders hong kong and macau in mid january to live withher elderly mother and grandparents those with dogs had to play with them inside and teach them to use the bathroom in a certain spot as the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic has movedto the usa chinese officials and public health experts insist that even if president donald trump were to immediately adopt all the strict testing and lockdown measures that western scientific advisersadvocate these actions would still not be sufficient to stem the spread of a disease that is swiftly approaching a million worldwide cases mike pompeo americans abroad wanting to return home should do so immediately more severesteps are needed in the usa these officials say although they cast doubt on whetheramericans could do what the chinese did for a mixture of reasons political will and deep rooted cultural inclinationsamong them to help quell its outbreak beijing embarked on one of the largest mass mobilization efforts in history closing all schools forcing millions of people inside quickly building more than a dozen vasttemporary hospitals deploying thousands of extra medical staff to wuhan and the surrounding hubei provinceand meticulously testing and tracing anyone and everyone who may have encountered the virus it did a lotmore than that lockdowns bans on gatherings basic quarantines testing hand washing this is not enough huiyao wang a senior adviser to china s government told usa today in a phone interview from beijing you need to isolate people on an enormous scale in stadiums big exhibition halls wherever you can it seems extreme it works no one left behind was the slogan in wuhan he said no one in the usa trump urged americans to avoid gatherings of 10 or more people and suggested the worst affected states should shutterschools bars and restaurants overall hehas left it to individual states and cities to decide whether to close businesses or explicitly order people to stay at home despite evidence from countries in asia such as china singapore south korea and taiwan that aggressively limiting public gatherings and social interactions can help stop transmission of covid 19 when done in combination with extensive testing and tracing of the disease fact check can trump use the stafford act to order a mandatory 2 week quarantine trump said he expects to see u s cases peak around easter although his claims about how quickly the usa can overcome the outbreak and bounce back contradict assessments from top health officials such as anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases fact check study projects coronavirus peak then moves the dates afternew york city became the new locus of theoutbreak trump announced sundayan extension of federal guidance on social distancing measures through april and issued a strong travel advisory urging residents of new york new jersey and connecticut to refrain from nonessential travel for 14 days to help limit thespread of the virus the u s centers for disease control and prevention said the new restrictions would help slow the spread of the respiratory illness which has infected more than 190 000 americans and killed more than 4 000 the daily death toll in the usa may not dip below 100 per day before june according to a study by the university of washington africa s paradox it may be the worst and best place to ride out coronavirus wang the chinese government adviser said the example of wuhan where authorities have started lifting some of their stringent anti virus controls that kept tens of millions of people at home for two months illustrates that the usa and west more generally need to take far more radical virus dampening actions that many people outside china might find culturally logistically and emotionally unpalatable it was not just families being isolated together in wuhanbut individuals being isolated away from their friends and families said andy mok a fellow at the center for china and globalization a public policy think tank based in beijing china s response to the outbreak was truly a nationwide response systematic comprehensive and coordinated this is why china was able to flatten the curve so dramatically he said referring to social isolation measures aimed at keeping the number of coronavirus infections at a manageable level for hospitals and medical workers who would otherwise be overwhelmed with sick patients poorest will suffer safety net health clinics cut services amid coronavirus epidemic mok said that even in beijing about 750 miles north of wuhan coronavirus rules were established requiring residents to have a formal pass to get in and out of their apartment buildings and homes at the outbreak s height in wuhan nobody was allowed in or out of the city and access to food stores was limited to once every few days video footage published by the australian broadcasting corp the country s state funded broadcaster showed chinese authorities in wuhan welding doors to entire apartment buildings shut with residents inside to enforce quarantines the footage collected from chinese social media users could not be independently verified by usa today mok questioned whether americans raised on a diet of individualism and civil liberties that has informed every aspect of life from travel to economic institutions would be willing to abide by invasive virus detection and containment methods that requirea strong commitment to collectivism and abridged freedoms global action great recession showed nationscan t fight coronaviruscrisis alone europe has adopted some but not all of china s most restrictive steps in france residents must fill out of a signed attestation to justify leaving their homes or apartments police hand out large fines to anyone who doesn t follow the rules it s a very clever form of social engineering for civic purposes it forces you to think about and justify to yourself as well as to the world why you are leaving the house said sarah maza a french history professor and u s citizen living in france for the year yang junchao a member of a chinese delegation of covid 19 doctors and medical experts assisting italy in halting its coronavirus infections the worst in europe said its epidemic will be controlled as long as the italian public cooperates some american public health officials have acknowledged that to bring the virus under control outside of a vaccine breakthrough actions that overstep the bounds of what most americans would be comfortable with such as mass quarantines and other severe restrictions on movement may be necessary the approach we should be taking right now is one that most people would find to be too drastic because otherwise it is not drastic enough francis collins the director of the national institutes of health said in a usa today interview it may bea country like china has a more top down ability to insist on certainbehavior changes but we ought to be able to do it in our way in a bottom up fashion he said nih chief francis collins on covid 19 q a with top u s health official though china s official figures show that transmissionof the coronavirus has all but ended in most ofthe country s regions unverified reports and online photos circulate suggesting that china s death toll primarily in wuhan could be far higher than the 3 312figurepublished by china s national health commission the beijing based caixin newspaper reported march 27 significantly elevated official cremation rates in wuhan possibly indicating a more substantial death figure though the report acknowledges the increases were inconclusive it is not clear how extensivelychina has counted asymptomatic cases though it is tracking them trump administration officials have repeatedly condemned china s initial suppression of warnings about the outbreak and questioned the accuracy of beijing sinfection figures trump impeachment probably distracted him from fighting coronavirus china s central government has dismissed persistent allegations that it tried to downplay the severity of infections althoughit has not denied initially detaining whistleblowing doctors and citizen journalists in december who tried to speak out about the mysterious virus in wuhan china s national health commission said tuesday it will start includingasymptomatic coronavirus carriers in its daily figures as of wednesday china recorded less than half about 82 000 the number of u s coronavirus cases it may be bracing for a potential second wave of infections over the past few days china has reclosed some public spaces and businesses such as movie theaters amid spiking clusters of cases mostly imported the chinese are trying to paint the narrative that the model they have pursued has been a huge success and that we are failing because of our mode of governance j stephen morrison director of the global health policy center at the center for strategic and international affairs csis a washington think tank said in amedia briefing morrison said there s significant evidence that the chinese government s handling of the crisissparked widespread discontent and dissatisfaction pointing to the case of dr li wenliang who was detained when he tried to alert other health care providers about the novel coronavirus he died from the virus concern has grown over the whereabouts of ai fen the head of emergency at wuhan central hospital she is the doctor who first alerted wenliang about the spread of the virus an australian investigation team that interviewed fenlast week said she has disappeared possiblydetained by the chinese government chinese doctor censured his crime warning about the novel coronavirus heather conley the director of the europe program at csis said that although the response in democratic countries such as the usa may look chaotic there s strength in that approach you have neighbors helping neighbors and you have states making decisions sometimes it s the federal level having to catch up with those decisions and that s a much more dynamic nimbleand resilient response she said ppe types of personal protective equipment used to combat covid 19 jan renders 29 a graduatestudent who was studying chinese politics at central china normal university in wuhan and was airlifted out feb 1to his home in belgium said the chinese response was too harsh and lacked transparency in wuhan when everything went into lockdown nobody could come or go and that included patients the hospitals were overloaded and i m sure people died because they couldn t be transported to other hospitals where there was room he said noting that german hospitalsstarted taking coronavirus patients from overcrowded hospitals in italy where more than12 400people have died of covid 19 the most anywhere covid 19 these countries are doing the best and worst jobs fighting coronavirus edward tse the hong kong based founder of the gao feng advisory co a management consultancy with roots in mainland china said his perception is that on the whole most people in china supported the government s tough measures including systematically isolating and quarantining carriers of the virus even if they were from the same family or had a very mild or only suspectedcoronavirus infection isolation is the key he said it just depends on how you do it the chinese government decided to do it in a certain way it turned out to be quite effective a british video blogger posted a video on china s twitter like weibo platform last week that explained how china implemented the softer side of its policy of ling jiechu which translates as zero contact it allowed neighborhood committees to take charge of arrangements for shopping and deliveries highways were made toll free with no limits to the number of cars on a road for those without a car customized bus routes were set up andoperated according to demand tickets could be purchased on a smartphone app and capacity was set at 50 many restaurants installed basicbut effective pulley systems to maintain employee customer distance wang the student who returned to wuhan from guangdong to live with herelderly relatives said many people in china have the idea and maybe it s a stereotype thatmedical care in the usa and europe ismore advanced than in china i am worried about places like new york city and milan she said i don t know why the deaths are so much higher there i hope they will be strong and keep calm hjelmgaard reported from london
