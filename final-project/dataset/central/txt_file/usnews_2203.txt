so concerned after the exchange that he notified his agency s attorney lt col alexander vindman the top ukraine expert at the national security council planned to tell investigators that he twice reported objections to trump s ukraine policy according to a copy of his opening remarks obtained by time a purple heart recipient vindman arrived on capitol hill for his testimony clad in full military uniform vindman is the first white house official who listened to the july 25 call to testify before the three house committees conducting the impeachment inquiry tuesday according to his draft statement vindman will tell investigators and lawmakers that he brought concerns about trump s interactions with ukraine to the national security council s attorney john eisenberg the first time vindman says he reported his concerns was after a debriefing following a meeting with ukrainian official oleksandr danylyuk when e u ambassador gordon sondland stressed the need for ukraine to investigate joe and hunter biden burisma the gas company where joe biden s son hunter previously sat on the board and the 2016 election he felt compelled to report concerns again after trump s phone call with zelensky i am a patriot vindman s statement says and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics the first instance in which vindman notified the national security council s attorney will raise questions about ambassador gordon sondland s testimony sondland told the committees earlier this month that when he brought up ukraine with trump the president urged him to talk to his personal attorney rudy giuliani sondland said giuliani mentioned extracting a commitment from ukraine to investigate burisma and the 2016 election but sondland added that he did not piece together that hunter biden was on the board of burisma and that the request could be construed as intervening in the 2020 election vindman s testimony contradicts that statement according to vindman s opening remarks at a debriefing following the danylyuk meeting in july sondland specifically emphasized the importance that ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election the bidens and burisma an attorney for sondland declined to comment while vindman listened to the july 25 call he emphasized in his opening remarks that he never had any direct contact with the president and he is not the whistleblower who revealed trump s ukraine campaign vindman s remarks will likely provide investigators with a fuller picture of the way policy toward ukraine was continually wrested away from career diplomats and given to political appointees vindman s statement were first reported by the new york times read the full remarks here mr chairman and ranking member thank you for the opportunity to address the committees concerning the activities relating to ukraine and my role in the events under investigation i have dedicated my entire professional life to the united states of america for more than two decades it has been my honor to serve as an officer in the united states army as an infantry officer i served multiple overseas tours including south korea and germany and a deployment to iraq for combat operations in iraq i was wounded in an ied attack and awarded a purple heart background since 2008 i have been a foreign area officer specializing in eurasia in this role i have served in the united states embassies in kiev ukraine and moscow russia in washington d c i was a politico military affairs officer for russia for the chairman of the joint chiefs where i authored the principle strategy for managing competition with russia in july 2018 i was asked to serve at the national security council the privilege of serving my country is not only rooted in my military service but also in my personal history i sit here as a lieutenant colonel in the united states army an immigrant my family fled the soviet union when i was three and a half years old upon arriving in new york city in 1979 my father worked multiple jobs to support us all the while learning english at night he stressed to us the importance of fully integrating into our adopted country for many years life was quite difficult in spite of our challenging beginnings my family worked to build its own american dream i have a deep appreciation for american values and ideals and the power of freedom i am a patriot and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country irrespective of party or politics for over twenty years as an active duty united states military officer and diplomat i have served this country in a nonpartisan manner and have done so with the utmost respect and professionalism for both republican and democratic administrations introduction before recounting my recollection of various events under investigation i want to clarify a few issues i am appearing today voluntarily pursuant to a subpoena and will answer all questions to the best of my recollection i want the committees to know i am not the whistleblower who brought this issue to the cia and the committees attention i do not know who the whistleblower is and i would not feel comfortable to speculate as to the identity of the whistleblower also as i will detail herein i did convey certain concerns internally to national security officials in accordance with my decades of experience and training sense of duty and obligation to operate within the chain of command as an active duty military officer the command structure is extremely important to me on many occasions i have been told i should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities i believe that any good military officer should and would do the same thus providing his or her best advice to leadership furthermore in performing my coordination role as a director on the national security council i provided readouts of relevant meetings and communications to a very small group of properly cleared national security counterparts with a relevant need to know my service on the national security council when i joined the white house s national security council nsc i reported to dr fiona hill who in turn reported to john bolton the national security advisor my role at the nsc includes developing coordinating and executing plans and policies to manage the full range of diplomatic informational military and 3 economic national security issues for the countries in my portfolio which includes ukraine in my position i coordinate with a superb cohort of inter agency partners i regularly prepare internal memoranda talking points and other materials for the national security advisor and senior staff most of my interactions relate to national security issues and are therefore especially sensitive i would urge the committees to carefully balance the need for information against the impact that disclosure would have on our foreign policy and national security i have never had direct contact or communications with the president the geopolitical importance of ukraine since 2008 russia has manifested an overtly aggressive foreign policy leveraging military power and employing hybrid warfare to achieve its objectives of regional hegemony and global influence absent a deterrent to dissuade russia from such aggression there is an increased risk of further confrontations with the west in this situation a strong and independent ukraine is critical to u s national security interests because ukraine is a frontline state and a bulwark against russian aggression in spite of being under assault from russia for more than five years ukraine has taken major steps towards integrating with the west the u s government policy community s view is that the election of president volodymyr zelenskyy and the promise of reforms to eliminate corruption will lock in ukraine s western leaning trajectory and allow ukraine to realize its dream of a vibrant democracy and economic prosperity given this perspective and my commitment to advancing our government s strategic interests i will now recount several events that occurred relevent events when i joined the nsc in july 2018 i began implementing the administration s policy on ukraine in the spring of 2019 i became aware of outside influencers promoting a false narrative of ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency this narrative was harmful to u s government policy while my interagency colleagues and i were becoming increasingly optimistic on ukraine s prospects this alternative narrative undermined u s government efforts to expand cooperation with ukraine april 21 2019 president trump calls ukraine president zelensky on april 21 2019 volodymyr zelenskyy was elected president of ukraine in a landslide victory president zelenskyy was seen as a unifying figure within the country he was the first candidate to win a majority in every region of the country breaking the claims that ukraine would be subject to a perpetual divide between the ukrainian and russian speaking populations president zelenskyy ran on a platform of unity reform and anti corruption which resonated with the entire country in support of u s policy objectives to support ukrainian sovereignty president trump called president zelenskyy on april 21 2019 i was one of several staff and officers who listened to the call the call was positive and president trump expressed his desire to work with president zelenskyy and extended an invitation to visit the white house may 21 2019 inauguration delegation goes to ukraine on may 21 2019 i was directed by ambassador bolton and dr hill to join the delegation attending president zelenkskyy s inauguration when the delegation returned they provided a debriefing to president trump and explained their positive assessment of president zelenskyy and his team i did not participate in the debriefing oleksandr danylyuk visit july 10 2019 oleksandr danylyuk the secretary of the national security and defense council for ukraine visited washington d c for a meeting with national security advisor bolton ambassadors volker and sondland also attended along with energy secretary rick perry the meeting proceeded well until the ukrainians broached the subject of a meeting between the two presidents the ukrainians saw this meeting as critically important in order to solidify the support of their most important international partner amb sondland started to speak about ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting with the president at which time ambassador bolton cut the meeting short following this meeting there was a scheduled debriefing during which amb sondland emphasized the importance that ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election the bidens and burisma i stated to amb sondland that his statements were inappropriate that the request to investigate biden and his son had nothing to do with national security and that such investigations were not something the nsc was going to get involved in or push dr hill then entered the room and asserted to amb sondland that his statements were inappropriate following the debriefing meeting i reported my concerns to the nsc s lead counsel dr hill also reported the incident to the nsc s lead counsel election call july 25 2019 on july 21 2019 president zelenskyy s party won parliamentary elections in a landslide victory the nsc proposed that president trump call president zelenskyy to congratulate him on july 25 2019 the call occurred i listened in on the call in the situation room with colleagues from the nsc and the office of the vice president as the transcript is in the public record we are all aware of what was said i was concerned by the call i did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a u s citizen and i was worried about the implications for 6 the u s government s support of ukraine i realized that if ukraine pursued an investigation into the bidens and burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained this would all undermine u s national security following the call i again reported my concerns to nsc s lead counsel conclusion the united states and ukraine are and must remain strategic partners working together to realize the shared vision of a stable prosperous and democratic ukraine that is integrated into the euro atlantic community our partnership is rooted in the idea that free citizens should be able to exercise their democratic rights choose their own destiny and live in peace it has been a great honor to serve the american people and a privilege to work in the white house and on the national security council i hope to continue to serve and advance america s national security interests thank you again for your consideration and now i would be happy to answer your questions write to alana abramson at alana abramson time com
