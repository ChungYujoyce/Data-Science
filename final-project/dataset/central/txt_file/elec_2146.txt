supporters on tuesday ms harris explained that her campaign simply did not have the finances to continue but a lack of funding is a symptom not a cause and political analysts all point to one cause to explain her campaign s demise the lack of a consistent core message i don t think she ever developed a coherent message you could see that in the tag lines that kept changing i think the last one was justice for all says former democratic consultant robert shrum still the white house may not be out of the question for the former california prosecutor and attorney general mr shrum describes her as a serious possibility for the vice presidential nominee in iowa jane gasperi a retired des moines real estate agent is still too shocked to consider which other candidate she might back right up until she heard the news she had been convinced my candidate is going to be on the ticket and perhaps she will be just not as president at least not this time on monday evening kamala harris des moines headquarters was humming with activity millennials sat with laptops at folding tables twinkly christmas lights above their heads purple and yellow for the people signs spelled out iowa in a giant floor to ceiling display the campaign was hitting all of its outreach targets to finish in the top three in the iowa caucuses senator harris state communications director said over breakfast with a reporter tuesday morning promising to follow up about a candidate meet and greet in decorah not long after she texted the office is closed sorry the suspension of the california senator s presidential bid shocked her supporters here and around the country yes her poll numbers had plummeted and recent media reports had portrayed a poorly run campaign plagued with internal divisions but she had performed well in the last debate and was all in in iowa packing the house at a recent event in indianola her momentum was changing says janelle rettig the johnson county supervisor who just endorsed ms harris on sunday in a letter to staff and supporters on tuesday ms harris explained that her campaign simply did not have the finances to continue i m not a billionaire i can t fund my own campaign she wrote in a subtle dig to ultrawealthy late entrants michael bloomberg and tom steyer but a lack of funding is a symptom not a cause and political analysts all point to one cause to explain her campaign s demise the lack of a consistent core message senator harris never really had a rationale for her campaign says phil trounstine co editor and publisher of calbuzz she had positions but she never really had convictions and people saw that which is why she never caught on she bowed out in time to remove her name from the california ballot saving herself from an embarrassing showing and perhaps making her a more viable vice presidential pick says mr trounstine but kamala was an inherently weak candidate because she s a show horse albeit a good one senator harris launched her campaign with a bang drawing an enthusiastic crowd of more than 20 000 people at her january kickoff in oakland the former california prosecutor and attorney general had achieved rock star status after her sharp questioning at last year s supreme court confirmation hearings for brett kavanaugh a gifted personable speaker and personification of the american immigrant dream her mother was from india and her father from jamaica she generated positive reviews from voters and the media the campaign coverage was absolutely glowing until it wasn t says a former harris staffer as reporters and voters kicked the tires many found them deflated she has never been tremendously strong on policy once you get down into the details the senator changed positions on medicare for all one of the most controversial issues in the campaign at the june debate she got a boost after zinging front runner joe biden over school busing but then adjusted her position on that as well for a time she seemed to be running in the progressive lane then moved more to the moderate lane i don t think she ever developed a coherent message you could see that in the tag lines that kept changing i think the last one was justice for all says former democratic consultant robert shrum who now teaches at the university of southern california telling voters that she can prosecute donald trump is not a sufficient message in this primary senator harris is not the first upper tier candidate to drop out former texas rep beto o rourke who almost defeated republican sen ted cruz in 2018 also entered the presidential race with high expectations only to exit before the voting began like ms harris he had a problem defining himself says dianne bystrom the former director of the carrie chapman catt center for women and politics at iowa state university in ames mr o rourke wound up focusing on gun control after this summer s shooting in el paso but it wasn t enough he dropped out nov 1 for lack of funding dr bystrom who heard senator harris speak in council bluffs iowa a few weeks ago says her message of pay equity for women and teachers was strong but failed to resonate that combined with poor polling and the spate of negative media coverage about internal campaign troubles sunk her people don t want to give money to people they think are not viable an hour flipping through tv channels in des moines on a recent weeknight reveals ads for mr steyer and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg who has shot to first place in recent polls there as well as forformer new york mayor bloomberg despite the fact that he s not even competing in the early states the big spenders in the race rankle some harris supporters jane gasperi a retired des moines real estate agent had planned to host a house party for senator harris on monday evening but says she had to cancel because of difficulties in getting people to respond to an unrecognized number when a reporter rings her doorbell on tuesday to ask her about ms harris dropping out ms gasperi s hands fly to her mouth and her eyes brim with tears her television was off and she had not yet heard no she s so qualified and then there s bloomberg out there with all of his money she says i m just so sad that it all came down to money at a coffee shop in iowa city ms rettig the county supervisor explains how she and her wife read all of the candidates books and interviewed them before endorsing ms harris she sees her as smart tough as nails and maybe the best listener i ve seen run for president they too frown on the billionaire money pouring into their state though they think it may backfire iowa doesn t typically let you buy elections says ms rettig here you have to work for it attention is already turning to what s next for senator harris and her supporters mr shrum describes her as a serious possibility for the vice presidential nominee if former vice president biden who is leading in the national polls or mr buttigieg win the nomination there will be pressure on them to select a woman particularly a minority woman to add diversity and boost turnout he says ms harris messaging inconsistencies wouldn t matter in that role because the message is set by the presidential campaign and her prosecutorial experience could be a huge plus since often it s the vice presidential candidate who gets tapped to go on the attack vice president biden already appears to have glossed over their debate sparring over busing from his no malarkey bus tour in iowa on wednesday he said the contest lost a really good one in senator harris saying she is capable of being president or vice president or on the supreme court or attorney general as for her followers at least one of them tracy van houten a democratic party activist in los angeles county says she will support massachusetts sen elizabeth warren i will go for warren because i will 100 be voting for a woman in the primary scrolling through her social media feeds after the heartbreaking news on tuesday ms van houten says many of the senator s backers seem to be flocking either to senator warren or to julian castro of texas many democratic voters are dismayed that so far the next democratic presidential debate features a lineup of all white people mostly men in iowa ms gasperi the retired real estate agent is still too shocked to consider which other candidate she might back but she knows that it won t be mr biden or sen bernie sanders whom she describes as the old democratic party i heard the other week that 7 out of 10 of us are supporting someone now who is not going to be the candidate and we have to be prepared for that i heard that and i was like oh i agree but i m not one of those my candidate is going to be on the ticket get the
