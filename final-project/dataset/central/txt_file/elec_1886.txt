following it very closely at this stage of the race even though there is a contested nomination race on the democratic side democrats and democratic leaning independents are no more likely than republicans and gop leaners to say they re following the news about the candidates closely six in ten democrats 60 say they re following it closely including 24 who are following it very closely that compares with 61 of republicans including 23 who are following it very closely americans ages 65 and older are about three times as likely as adults under 30 to say they re following the news about the candidates very closely 39 vs 12 and white adults 26 are more likely than black and hispanic americans to say this 17 and 16 respectively 2 around a third of americans 32 believe there were major efforts to purposefully delay the results of iowa s democratic caucuses in february this is only slightly lower than the share of u s adults who believe there were unintentional problems that caused delays but not major efforts to purposefully delay the results 39 republicans are more likely than democrats to say there were efforts to purposefully delay the results of the iowa caucuses 41 vs 25 democrats are more likely than republicans to say there were unintentional problems but no intentional efforts to delay the results 47 vs 33 3 in the weeks before joe biden s strong performance in south carolina and on super tuesday americans considered him the democratic presidential candidate with the worst recent news coverage around a quarter of u s adults 27 said biden had received the worst news coverage in the weeks leading up to the survey smaller shares said this about michael bloomberg 20 bernie sanders 13 tulsi gabbard 11 and the other candidates republicans were slightly more likely than democrats to say biden had received the worst news coverage 31 vs 25 as for which democratic candidate had received the best news coverage the largest share of americans pointed to sanders 39 considerably smaller shares said this about bloomberg 24 pete buttigieg 13 biden 8 and other candidates on this question around four in ten democrats as well as republicans said sanders had received the best coverage 41 and 37 respectively of course perceptions about the positivity or negativity of the news coverage surrounding each candidate are likely related to that candidate s performance in the early presidential caucus and primary states sanders had strong showings in iowa new hampshire and nevada while biden s commanding victory in south carolina didn t happen until feb 29 near the end of the survey s field period 4 most americans say they followed trump s impeachment proceedings closely around six in ten americans 59 say they followed the news about trump s impeachment and trial closely but only 24 followed it very closely democrats and republicans are about equally likely to say they followed the news about trump s impeachment and trial closely 60 vs 62 including similar shares who followed it very closely 24 vs 26 older people are much more likely than younger people to say they followed it very closely while white adults are slightly more likely than black and hispanic adults to say this 5 partisans have nearly opposite perspectives on whether the news of the past few weeks has been good for trump or bad for him a 55 majority of republicans say the news over the past couple of weeks has been very or mostly good for the president while a 57 majority of democrats said it has been very or mostly bad for him the survey was mostly conducted before concerns over the coronavirus escalated in the united states there are even wider differences on this question when looking at americans main source for political news for example 68 of those
