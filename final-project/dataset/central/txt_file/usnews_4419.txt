the head of a research group that studies bat borne coronaviruses in china similar to the covid 19 strain that sravaged the globe has warned that a u s government decision to cut funding to his organization imperils american public health ecohealth alliance s research grant was abruptly terminated last month by the national institutes of health the primary agency of the u s government responsible for biomedical and public health research ecohealth alliance s researchin china is focused on identifyingand warningaboutcoronaviruses dangerousto human health i m really concerned about where this leaves us said peter daszak director of thenew york based organization in a usa today interview once we ve overcome covid 19 what about covid 20 what about covid 21 who is going to go out and find those our grant was specifically designed to locatewhere these viruses are and to stop them from harming americans he said the national institutes of health confirmed ecohealth alliance s 3 4 million grant distributed over six years was canceled on april 24 but it would not discuss details about how the decision was made daszak a respected disease ecologist said he received a letter from the national institutes of healthstating the award was terminated for convenience because it didn t fit with the agency s goals ecohealth alliance has collaborated with the wuhan institute of virology a state run chinese lab in the city where covid 19 first emerged in december the institute has attracted negative attention because of hypotheses connectingit to unanswered questions about the origins of the virus these questions center around the lab s biosecurity interpretations of circumstantial evidence that link the lab toearly infections and china s unwillingness to shareinformation about some aspects of the outbreak politico which first reported on the grant cancellation on april 27 said a few days prior to the termination of ecohealth alliance s funding national institutes of health deputy director for extramural research mike lauer informed the organization it needed to know all sites in china that have been in any way linked to this award ecohealth alliance has been studying coronaviruses in bats in china for more than a decade in that time it has established deep links and worked closelywith the wuhan institute of virology thechinese research lab has fallen under a cloud of suspicionbecause president donald trump and senior u s officials such as secretary of state mike pompeohave persistently linked it with unproven theories about covid 19 s origins no evidence has emerged to support trump s accusations nor are they backed by infectious disease experts u s intelligence agencies have concluded coronavirus was not man made they haven t reached any conclusions about whether the disease emerged from a lab in china or was transmitted to humans through animals trump us investigatingif coronavirus spread afterlab mishap cites no evidence daszak has not been able to secure clarification over why the award was cut ecohealth alliance hasreceived funding from the national institutes of health since at least 2002 ecohealth alliance was the primary awardee of the 3 4 million grant the sub awardees were the wuhan institute of virology the east china normal university in shanghai the institute of pathogen biology in beijing and the duke nus medical school in singapore a sub awardee means ecohealth alliance acted as an intermediary between these institutions and the u s government for the purposes of funding joint research into bat borne coronaviruses it did not pay them directly ecohealth alliance has not been accused of any wrongdoing and it has not carried out any research in china since the outbreak began in wuhan late last year founded in 1971 by a british conservationist more than 90 of ecohealth alliance s annual budget of 16 million in 2018 came from government grants according to the most recent available financial accounts published on its website the remainder of its funding came from a mixture of donations from scientific foundations corporations and private individuals the grouphas worked in the u s and nearly 30 countries around the world on projects ranging from forest health in liberia to bio surveillance in western asia charity navigator which evaluates the transparency accountability and governance of non profit organizations gives it a 4 star rating its highest mark fact check obama administration did not send 3 7 million to wuhan lab the state department which is obliged to conduct background checks on any foreign organization that is a recipient of u s government funds for research did not respondto a requestfor comment addressing the reasons for the grant s termination the title of ecohealth alliance s research proposal first awarded under the obama administration and then re approved under trump in july last year is called understanding the risk of bat coronavirus emergence that s exactly what we re all suffering from now daszak said one of ourgoals for the study was to find out more about the genetic sequences of coronaviruses in bats and to get these into the hands of people who design vaccines and drugs we had just begun work on this when the pandemic happened he said the wuhan institute of virology has become a focus for trump and some in his inner circle partly because it houses a lab equipped to study coronaviruses and other dangerous pathogens and partly because of its relative proximity to a seafood market in wuhan where some but not all of china s coronaviruses were first detected last year china s lack of transparency over how the virus first spread has amplified that focus beijing has also circulated on social media and in official statements false rumors and misinformation that the u s military may have brought coronavirus to china trump said during a press conference on april 17 he was aware of ecohealth alliance s grant and he intended to end it very quickly asked on april 30 whether he had seen evidence justifying theories the virus may have originated in the lab trump answered affirmatively yes i have days later during a fox news town hall on may 4 trump said his administration was waiting on a very strong report about whether the lab was involved in the pandemic my opinion is they made a mistake they tried to cover it he said referring to an alleged attemptby china s authorities to hide information about the nature and origins of the virus china denies it withheld or suppressed these details critics of china have also accused it ofconcealingthe extent of its coronavirus outbreak by under reporting both total cases and the deaths it hassuffered from the disease dangerous dynamic coronavirus threatens new cold war between us and china adding to the maelstrom pompeo insisted wednesday there was no obvious contradiction in his competing assertions that we don t have certainty about where the virus originated yet there is significant evidence that this came from the laboratory for more than a month senator sen bob menendez the top democrat on thesenate foreign relations committee has been calling to no avail he said for pompeo to share details of u s intelligenceon the origins of the coronavirus menendez wrote another letter to pompeo on thursday stating that the answers to these questions are critical as they may inform ongoing efforts to stop any further spread limit any subsequent waves of infection and help us prepare against future pandemics linfa wang director of emerging infectious diseases at duke nus medical school in singapore one of ecohealth alliance s sub awardees said scientific understanding about why and how viruses jump from animals to humans is relatively poor but improving all the time he said theconsensus among mainstream researchersis that fewer than 1 of viruses that affect mammals have been discovered fifty years ago nobody was even looking at bats it was all about mosquitoes and rodents he said noting thatover time bats have evolved to be particularly effective reservoirs of viruses deadly to humans but not necessarily themselves because of their unique physiologies that undergo extreme stress in order to be able to fly can we predict where the next jump from animals to humans will come from no still daszak said funding for on the ground overseas coronavirus research was needed now more than ever becausethe viruses thatposethehighest risk to public health don t originate in the u s but in the world s most populous country if we want to know anything about the next pandemic we need to be working in china he said daszak described the southeast asia regionas a hot bed fornew viruses in peoples imaginations there might be this image ofone person in a lab in china who drops a petri dish and that somehow leads to a massive outbreak it s just not like that every yearthere are millions of peoplegoing in bat caves and hunting and eating wildlife it happens every day they are being exposed to bat viruses every day it only takes one of these people to go to a city cough and spread a virus he said the aim of ourwork is to directly benefit u s national security and public health if we don t do this we are going to be on the front line again when the next virus hits contributing john fritze deirdre shesgreen
