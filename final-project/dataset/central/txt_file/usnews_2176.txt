there is plenty of data about twitter hashtags but not many hashtags about data the one exception i know of is iowacaucussowhite which is both blunt and correct around 87 of iowans are white and non hispanic compared to just 61 of the country as a whole yet every four years the state gets to fire the starting gun in the presidential primaries and caucuses the hashtag dates back at least to 2016 but resurfaced this week in the headline of a los angeles times column that suggests beginning the primaries with either a more diverse state like nevada or south carolina now the third and fourth contests or even just holding all primaries and caucuses on the same day those changes the thinking goes could help candidates who appeal to a wider array of americans gain early momentum going into the rest of primary season especially ahead of the all important super tuesday many others have made this argument including some democratic candidates like juli n castro who along with nearly every other nonwhite democratic presidential candidate dropped out of the race ahead of the iowa caucus and this all was before the spectacular disaster that was monday s iowa caucus any discussion of iowa s blanched population usually also implicates new hampshire where the population is even less diverse by a small margin the state which has long held the second primary contest in presidential election years is 91 non hispanic white by my calculations the percentage white population goes up a few ticks in both states when one tallies only the voting eligible population still a time examination of the demographics and schedules of every democratic primary since 2004 found that in fact the primary and caucus schedule as a whole is reasonably well distributed between states of different profiles it has even historically back loaded whiter states by a small factor putting aside the question of who gets to be line leader for a moment the process overall is marginally less unfair than it looks as the brooking institute s william h frey recently wrote the batches of states that vote in march are when considered together fairly well distributed in demographic makeup as a group super tuesday voters which include those from the nation s two largest states california and texas are more racially diverse than the nation and somewhat younger frey found in his analysis if a consensus candidate is still not chosen by super tuesday the rest of march s primary calendar comes closer to the nation in their demographic make up time s analysis which i discussed with frey tried another method of quantifying unfairness in the voting schedule for each democratic primary in the five contests between 2004 and 2020 we pulled contemporary demographic data on just the voting eligible population for 2020 we used 2018 data which is the most recent available we also reconstructed the calendar via the green sheets then we assigned each state a delay factor equal to the number of days after iowa that the official primary or caucus was held for example in 2008 when the iowa caucuses were held on jan 3 the three contests on feb 12 washington d c maryland and virginia had delays of 40 the delay in iowa is always 0 last we looked for evidence of a correlation between this delay and a state s percentage of white non hispanic individuals eligible to vote in each election a primary that heavily favored whiter states would turn up a negative number since a high population of white voters would correspond to a lower delay correlations run from 1 to 1 with figures close to zero meaning there s virtually no relationship between the two things you re measuring against one another in 2004 the correlation was 0 19 and in 2008 it was 0 25 neither of these are strong relationships but they suggest that in fact states with higher percentages of white voters were slightly more likely to go later since 2012 the correlation has been largely negligible while my method is statistically crude it suggests that while the current process of assembling a primary calendar is not necessarily fair it is sufficiently disorganized to distribute states of different demographic compositions reasonably well a conclusion in line with frey s analysis of the 2020 calendar this doesn t resolve the question of whether two very homogenous states should always go first and second it s understandable that some candidates feel that they should not given the first contests momentum generating ability but for states i would argue that holding a contest very early in a primary season diminishes a state s influence overall naturally the argument for a state holding an early primary or caucus is that the state will lend attention and overall momentum to the eventual winner influencing every future contest but there is a reason one does not often encounter the phrase as goes iowa or new hampshire so goes the nation neither state it turns out is much better at picking the eventual winner than a groundhog meanwhile states that wait at least until super tuesday to have their primary or caucus have far greater odds of contributing to a consensus on which candidate will amass enough delegates to secure a party s nomination in recent election cycles several contests have extended well past this typically critical day which this year includes california after two cycles in which the delegate rich state waited until june to vote with a crowded democratic field and at least several strong candidates it s perfectly plausible that voters in some of the large states slated for april will not be limited choosing from a single candidate left standing in any case iowa and new hampshire will be distant memories both home to voters who will not have a chance to cast a primary ballot with the benefit of everything we ll learn about the candidates as the cycle moves along still someone has to go first fixing the process is extremely simple randomize the order i don t foresee this happening fortunately there is sufficient entropy that the order at least by demographics appears fairly random when should a state aim to hold its primary this year is so atypical because of the large field frey said when asked what his move would be were he negotiating on behalf of a state but everything is always so fluky that it s hard to say he noted that there are fairly few contests in early april which might be a good time for a state to wield maximum influence and garner attention from both the campaigns and the press though he acknowledged our counterpoint that the first state to hold a primary in april accepts the hazard of many references to the waste land with so many viable candidates april may be if not the cruelest month at least a circus write to
