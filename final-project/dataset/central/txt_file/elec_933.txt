washington former vice president joe biden finally got the win he needed after nearly a month of underperforming in iowa and new hampshire and finishing in a distant second in nevada biden sealed a definitive win in the south carolina primary with black voters pushing him to victory it s the first primary win ever for biden who is running for president for the third time according to exit polls 64 of black voters supported biden sen bernie sanders came in a distant second with black voters at15 followed closely by billionaire activist tom steyer at 13 here are some takeaways from the south carolina democratic primary south carolina voters also turned to a key endorsement to make their decision according to exit polls six out of 10 primary voterstook into account rep jim clyburn s endorsement of biden clyburn is a democratic icon in south carolina andtold cnn on friday we will have to sit down and get serious about how we retool this campaign following saturday s primary biden s win gives him a much needed boost going into super tuesday whereabout 33 of national pledged delegates are up for grabs he has now leapfrogged into second place among national delegates following sanders one hurdle biden will face however is competing with former new york city mayor mike bloomberg for the first time this primary season the two candidates are competing for much of the same center left base as is former mayor pete buttigieg and sen amy klobuchar but biden s win will likely encourage voters and donors to move forward with supporting his campaign many of whomhave been wary of the candidate following his low standing in other early states sandersis holding his lead in national delegates but it s clear the race is changing saturday s nights distant second place shows sanders might see some troublewith some black voters who make up one of the largest voting blocs in the democratic party only 15 of black voters supported sanders in the south carolina primary according to exit polls but nationally sanders has seen an increase in support among black voters he stands at 29 with black voters nationally following biden who is leading at 31 according to an nbc news wall street journal poll in 2016 sanders only wonabout 26 totalin south carolina compared to his then democratic opponent hillary clinton at about 73 more joe biden posts a convincing and quick win in south carolina primary more sanders supporters denounce news outlets calling sc primary for biden with 0 of the vote in addition sanders is opting out of attending thebridge crossing jubilee in selma alabama which commemoratesbloody sunday on march 7 1965 thatlead to the passage of the 1965 voting rights act alabama s primary is part of super tuesday although sanders is holding a lead in polling both nationally and in several super tuesday states it s unclear whether biden s win saturday will push some voters to turn to the former vice president sanders a democratic socialist appeals mostly with younger voters who have traditionally not voted on the levels of older voters however in 2018 18 29 year olds made up the largest increase in voter turnout one state that could keep sanders on top is california the vermont senator holds a huge lead in polling in the state which has415 delegates candidates need to get at least 15 across the state to win delegates andsanders is the only one who passed that threshold in a recent cnn poll where he stood at 35 tom steyer who invested millions into the south carolina primary including about 18 million in tv ads alone couldn t break past biden s firewall steyer ended his campaign after finishing in a distant third place saturday i said if i didn t see a path to winning that i d suspend my campaign and honestly i can t see a path where i can win the presidency he told supporters during a rally in columbia s c prior to dropping out steyer had seen an increase in polling among black voters he also received several high profile endorsements in the state includingjohnnie cordero chair of south carolina s black caucus steyer didn t earnany delegates in iowa new hampshire or nevadabefore dropping out according to exit polls from the washington post biden won with a whopping 60 share of the votes cast by african americans in south carolina who accounted for more than half of the ballots in the palmetto state that level of support is even higher than expected after recent polls showed him with about 40 support among black voters biden s large share of the african american vote couldforeshadow good things if it carries over into super tuesday states with large populations of african american voters such as north carolina and alabama that voting bloc who made up about a quarter of the votes cast in the 2016 democratic primary could prove key to making biden competitive against sanders on super tuesday black voters in saturday s primary represented a lower percentage 56 than those who turned out in 2016 when they made up 61 of the south carolina vote but total turnout that year was 370 904 compared with 528 720 and counting votes in 2020 meaning about 60 000 more black voters cast ballots in this contest than four years ago if that level of turnout continues that could be goodnews for the biden campaign moving forward more donald trump says mike bloomberg should end joke of a campaign after south carolina primary it wasn t a good night for former mayor pete buttigieg sen amy klobuchar or sen elizabeth warren buttigieg who saw strong finishes in iowa and new hampshire fell flat in south carolina this comes a week after placing a distant third in nevada in the weeks leading up to south carolina s primary buttigieg continued to strugglewith black voters staying in the single digits among that bloc this could spell trouble for buttigieg going forward where many of the states in super tuesday have a large population of black and latino voters warren has continued to plateau as the primary continues the massachusetts senator underperformed in new hampshire after placing third in iowa she also didn t do well in nevada despite having electric debate performances in the past two weeks warren has yet to find momentum at the polls klobuchar hasn t been able to keep her momentum after a surprising third place new hampshire win earlier this month the minnesota senator has also struggled with voters of color staying in the single digits with black and latino voters it s unclear whether she will be able to break through the pack of the still crowded field of eight candidates but her home state of minnesota is among those that vote tuesday
