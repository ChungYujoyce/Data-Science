washington senate republicans met monday with senior trump administration officials to discuss countering the economic damage from the coronavirus pandemic and came away with a sense of urgency to act senators talked behind closed doors with treasury secretary steven mnuchin who has been the lead negotiator between the administration and the house and white house economic adviser larry kudlow who attempted to ease concernsseveral republicans have voiced with the pending coronavirus bill passed in the house both officials underscored the need to pass the measure quickly they understood kudlow said of senators after the meeting they understood the urgency you know we re trying to keep people from getting laid off and we re trying to help people on sick leave or take care of their families whatever the case may be and we ve got some pretty distressed industries the officials also expanded on what is to come offering a preview of the next package the trump administration wants congress to take up that would help workers and families but also give a boost to the healthcare and airline industries sen marco rubio r fla left the meeting with a sense of urgency noting the need to pass a third coronavirus package as soon as this week due to concerns the senate might not be able to reconvene if the virus worsens i don t think we can assume that we can keep reconvening the senate every week like the way we did it this week i just don t think we can make that assumption with the orders that are out there what might happen with airlines with travel schedules with individual members having to go into quarantine or being exposed he said i don t think we can operate as if we can just bring the senate and the house back together whenever we want he said help for airlines would be central to the next package calling it a potential national security threat if airlines halt operations he said bailouts for specific industries differed from the financial rescue during the 2008 economic crisis the bank bailout proved unpopular with many americans who viewed as unfair to help the companies whose risk taking sowed the seeds for the worst financial crisis since the great depression this is not an example of industries that have failed and made bad decisions and are asking for the taxpayer to bail them out rubio said we are asking we re begging people not to go out not to go shopping not to go to restaurants not to go to bars and clubs and not to take trips we are imposing restrictions for and rightfully so there is economic costs associated with that christal hayes the house of representatives passed an amended version of its coronavirus legislation after all day negotiations and one lone republican withdrawing his objection rep louie gohmert r texas blocked the bill from passing in the chamber under unanimous consent earlier monday a move that could have forced the house to hold a full vote on technical changes it made to the legislation the what are being called technical corrections make the bill better than it was when it got passed in the wee hours saturday morning so because of that gohmert said on the house floor i will withdraw my objection the legislation will now move to the senate if it passes it will head to trump s desk the bill will provide sick leave to american workers and bolster unemployment insurance along with making coronavirus tests free for all who need them christal hayes senators were considering monday whether to add or change a coronavirus relief bill that passed the house saturday that measure would require paid leave for workers who need to stay home because of the virus sen ron johnson r wis has raised concerns that the bill s provisions expanding paid sick leave would exacerbate financial hardships for small business by forcing them to pay wages they cannot afford johnson said he s worried not only about potential layoffs but also about incentivizing people to not show up for work either people are going to have to work people do need to recognize the fact that this is not ebola this is not mers it s not quite the seasonal flu johnson said but we have to keep things in perspective and we got to keep our economy in addition to the paid leave provisions the house measure would also increase money for food programs utah gop sen mitt romney said some of his colleagues are floating the option of adding to the relief measures inthe house bill to address other sectors of the economy there s some who think no no we d better do phase three at the same time because we may not you know be coming back if somebody gets the coronavirus or whatever happens romney said maybe we need to get phase three done before phase two is out the door president donald trump meanwhile mentioned help for the struggling airline industry as among the priorities he is seeking in the next phase of the rescue package christal hayes white house press secretary stephanie grisham is working from home in what she describes as an abundance of caution she was around members of thebrazilian delegation that visited mar a lago in early march i feel good but with my proximity to the president it s better to be safe

jackson vice president mike pence has not been tested for the coronavirus he said monday two days after the white house announced that the president s test had come back negative pence said that the

with symptoms and health care workers people people should consult a doctor before getting tested he added that s what my family is doing as well he said before that disclosure at a white house briefing president donald trump was asked if he and pence are trying to stay separate to protect the chain of command in case one of them gets sick we haven t thought about it trump said we re very careful we re very careful with being together even the people behind me they ve been very strongly tested i ve been very strongly tested maureen groppe president donald trump appeared to suggest foreign groups could be behind a disinformation campaign that circulated rumors the government was close to placing the u s on lockdown when asked if he agreed with u s officials who warned that foreign entities are behind a disinformation campaign to stoke fears of a nationwide quarantine trump said i think it could be that you have some foreign groups that are playing games but it doesn t matter we haven t really determined to do that all hopefully we won t have to the president said the administration was not at the point taking that step he also said u s officialsmay look at restrictions for specific areas where there s an outbreak of coronvirus or certain hot spots as they call them trump s comments came after theu s health and human services department confirmed monday it was targeted in a cyberattack over the weekend as the agency battles thecoronavirus pandemic that has killed 69 people across the u s the attack prompted the national security council to issue a

transmission to close schools in affected and surrounding areas bars restaurants food courts gyms and other venues where groups of people congregate should also be closed in states with evidence of community transmission according to the guidelines each and every one of us has a critical role to play trump said at a news conference with members of his coronavirus task force if everyone makes these critical changes and sacrifices now we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus he said among the other guidelines earlier monday the white house pushed back on news reports that it is considering imposing curfews and a national quarantine in the wake of the spread of the coronavirus epidemic this is not correct tweeted katie miller a spokeswoman for vice president mike pence who is heading up the coronavirus task force michael collins and david jackson president donald trump said americans could be hunkered down and practicing social distancing at least until july or august to confront the coronavirus pandemic during a white house briefing on monday trump was asked whether the administration had any estimate of how quickly the country would turn this corner many americans have been working from home and states are increasingly closing schools businesses and prohibiting large gatherings of people people are talking about july august or something like that trump told reporters were spaced every other seat in the white house briefing room to practice distancing the president did not discuss specific practices that would have to be implement for that long but the question was posed in terms of the steps that the country is currently taking trump said it could take at least that long until the virus washes through a term he has used before that he acknowledged monday that some around him don t like reporters pressed trump on whether the work from home order and closes would be the new normal until the height of the summer they think august could be july trump said could be longer than that the answer to that question could have enormous implications for not for people s daily lives but for the economy the white house

of testing kits among other programs to prepare for the virus a coronavirus relief bill the house hustled to pass early saturday morning which expands paid sick leave and covers the cost of testing

regular trading hours following sharp losses kudlow also said the administration would continue to push for more economic stimulus to inject money into the economy including a payroll tax cut while trump has pushed the payroll tax holiday it s not included in a stimulus bill currently pending in congress and has met with lawmaker skepticism including among some republicans the payroll tax holiday is a serious proposal a very serious proposal kudlow said kudlow also said a future stimulus should include assistance to the hardline airline industry if they get into a cash crunch we re going to try to help them kudlow said i see it as a liquidity fix not as a bailout he also said there are a lot of ideas floating around to counter the economic problems wrought the coronavirus we are going to be challenged kudlow said there s no question about that responding to concerns about a global recession kudlow also said we have a big challenge i ve been saying that and i ll continue to

includes americans following the federal government s guidance surgeon general jerome adams said on fox friends monday when you look at the projections there s every chance that we could be italy adams said but there s every hope that we will be south korea if people actually listen if people actually social distance if people do the basic public health measures that we ve all been talking about as doctors all along such as washing your hands such as covering your cough and cleaning surfaces adams said there will be more guidance coming about the previous recommendation that people consider postponing elective surgeries to free up the system to respond to the coronavirus and we re going to be talking more today to try to figure out how we can give more guidance because elective doesn t mean non urgent he said of his recent conversations with the american college of surgeons and the american hospital association adams noted that his wife just through cancer treatment which is not something that can be delayed for six months but procedures like hip and knee replacements need to be put off until we can get a handle on this and we aren t taking up icu beds and hospital beds and then saying we re going to have to put our coronavirus patients out in tents in the streets adams said people will start to see new testing sites in their communities including in his hometown of cumberland md where a hospital is starting drive thru testing he said there will be 30 to 40 new pods in up to 19 sates that will enable drive thru and walk thru tests but the testing willfocus first onthose most at risk including health care workers and then people over age 65 who have a fever or other symptoms we are hopeful that if we lean into this then maybe in about six to eight weeks we ll get over the majority of the pain we will have flattened the curve and we can start to slowly get back to life as normal he said maureen groppe the supreme court announced monday it is postponing oral

richard wolf the coronavirus relief bill the house hustled to pass early saturday morning to confront the intensifying crisis could still be days away from reaching president donald trump who has already indicated he would sign it the families first coronavirus response act which expands paid sick leave and covers the cost of testing for all americans needs a technical correction that leaders of both parties have agreed to but the bill would be brought up on what s known as unanimous consent or uc meaning only one member would have to object to force a full vote by the house problematic because the house lawmakers are back in their districts due to the recess and not due back until next week and at least one member is objecting rep louis gohmert the texas republican was one of 40 gop lawmakers who voted against the bill early saturday morning it passed 363 40 reporter laura litvan of bloomberg news tweeted after speaking with gohmert that he doesn t know if his concerns can be solved today he hasn t seen final text and doesn t appreciate the rushed process for passing the bill saturday an email to his office seeking comment was not immediately returned monday afternoon if

lady melania trump s office announced in a news release monday that the 142nd annual celebration was canceled out of an abundance of caution the health and safety of all americans must be the first priority especially right now the first lady said i deeply regret this cancellation but we need to make difficult decisions in the short term to ensure a healthy country for the long term during this time i encourage everyone to listen to state and local officials and follow cdc guidelines in order to help protect the health and well being of everyone the annual tradition brings hundreds of children to the white house south lawn to hunt for eggs and play games this year s celebration had been scheduled for april 13 the easter egg roll officially dates back to 1878 and the presidency of rutherford b hayes but first hand accounts suggest that informal festivities began with egg rolling parties under president abraham lincoln according to the white house website the easter egg roll was not held from 1917 to 1920 because of world war i and was canceled again from 1943 to 1945 during world war ii food conservation and construction on the white house prevented any celebrations from 1946 to 1952 as well president dwight eisenhower reinstated the tradition in 1953 michael collins washington while the house voted overwhelmingly to approve coronavirus legislation early saturday and president donald trump strongly endorsed it senators have voiced reservations about because of the impact on smaller businesses the senate could approve legislation immediately with unanimous support but sen ron johnson r wis said he would prefer that the senate change the bill to improve it or approve nothing at all he suggested that workers who fall ill or are quarantined should use state unemployment benefits although mandating that all employers must pay for sick leave might sound good we need to consider the unintended consequences of this legislation johnson said i fear that rather than offering a workable solution the house bill will exacerbate the problem by forcing small businesses to pay wages they cannot afford and helping them go further into debt the national federation of independent business which advocates for 325 000 small businesses wrote to congressional leaders friday that coronavirus has already hurt 23 of its members and 43 expect an impact within three months but the group criticized several elements including mandating small businesses comply while exempting those with at least 500 workers struggling small businesses could apply for a waiver from the secretary of the labor department but the exemption process is poorly defined according to the group federal tax credits to reimburse businesses for paid leave might not arrive quickly enough according to the group businesses experiencing cash flow difficulties due to disruptions caused by covid 19 combined with new federally mandated paid family and medical leave may not stay afloat until the next quarterly payroll tax credit is claimed said the letter from kevin kuhlman the group s senior director for federal government relations by requiring small businesses to shoulder additional burdens and costs small businesses who cannot afford to keep up will close treasury secretary steven mnuchin who negotiated the legislation with house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said on fox news sunday said businesses would be able to get a cash advance from the internal revenue service to avoid delays in reimbursements we were very focused we need to get the money to people quickly mnuchin said we don t want them to have to deal with big bureaucracy the house and mnuchin had announced that technical corrections were needed before the legislation moves to the senate but amid reports of broader concerns from small businesses mnuchin said he was working with the senate to resolve them we hope they pass this bill mnuchin said if not we ll work with the center on whatever minor changes we need senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said the senate would work to approve legislation swiftly i know senators on both sides are carefully reviewing the details and are eager to act swiftly to help american workers families and small businesses navigate this challenging time mcconnell said bart jansen members of the coronavirus task force are scheduled to hold a press briefing at

discussions about giving guidance on elective surgeries amid heightened concerns about the disease which has been named covid 19 we regoing to be talking more today to try to figure out how we can give more guidance because elective doesn t mean non urgent adams said things like tonsils things like total hips and total knees we need to pull those down until we can get a handle on this and flatten the curve so that we aren t using up our ppe personal protective equipment that s going to be necessary to respond to coronavirus cases he continued more an elbow bump nod to coronavirus talk
