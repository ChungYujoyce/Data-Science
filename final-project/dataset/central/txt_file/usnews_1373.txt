anticipation over several high stakes midterm elections across america will carry into the following days and perhaps weeks in a handful of states where tight races have gone into overtime some of the most closely watched midterm elections races in georgia florida mississippi and arizona were too close to call as of wednesday afternoon those races could head to a recount or runoff in which candidates are forced to face each other at the polls again the highly contested battles that are still in limbo include the governor s race in georgia where long lines and technical issues on tuesday marred voting sites in a traditional red state that gained national attention over concerns of voter suppression in mississippi senate candidates have advanced to a runoff while u s sen bill nelson who is seeking re election in florida has called for a recount in his close bid against florida gov rick scott as election results continue to unfold here s what to know about some of the biggest elections with razor thin margins a winner in the gubernatorial race has yet to be determined in georgia where more than 3 8 million people cast votes for a governor this midterm election according to the state s unofficial results while thousands of mailed ballots still need to be processed democrat stacey abrams is currently trailing her opponent republican brian kemp kemp georgia s secretary of state who oversees elections including his own currently has 50 35 percentage points to abrams 48 7 but experts say the race could head to a runoff if there is no clear victor in georgia a gubernatorial candidate must receive more than 50 of the vote to win according to the state s election laws kemp s current percentage could drop below that threshold if abrams secures about 15 000 votes from untallied ballots triggering a runoff says abrams spokeswoman lauren groh wargo abrams campaign said up to 77 000 mail in ballots many from heavily democratic counties still need to be counted as well as absentee and provisional ballots in a conference call with reporters wednesday morning groh wargo said counties may certify outcomes by early next week a runoff if one is called would take place dec 4 but aides for kemp do not foresee that as a possibility the candidate s campaign declared victory during a conference call with reporters on wednesday evening even though the associated press has not yet officially called the race the message here is pretty simple campaign official austin chambers said this election is over and the results are clear abrams could become the nation s first black female governor if elected on wednesday she refused to concede vowing to fight for every vote make no mistake she wrote in a tweet this race is not over it s also too close to call in two separate congressional races in georgia in the 6th district where republican karen handel is fighting for re election the incumbent has 49 55 percentage points while democrat lucy mcbath has 50 45 in a tweet wednesday mcbath touted her slight lead but said the two candidates are locked into a recount over in the 7th district republican rob woodall and democrat carolyn bourdeaux are also in a near tie woodhall has 50 23 percentage points while bourdeaux has 49 77 a recount could be called in either race if the final vote margin between the contenders is 1 or less according to the associated press both campaigns are waiting for absentee ballots to be counted democratic u s sen bill nelson who is trying to hold onto his senate seat in florida claims the race is headed to a recount as he narrowly trails his rival republican florida gov rick scott who has already declared victory in a news release wednesday nelson said he s behind by about 34 500 votes out of the 8 1 million total ballots cast since that margin is less than a one half percentage point difference the candidate says state law requires the votes to be tallied again we are proceeding to a recount nelson said in a statement florida s secretary of state ken detzner oversees elections in the state and is the only one who could officially call for a recount according to state election laws in an email wednesday his office said detzner has not yet ordered a recount but one could be determined as early as saturday according to the state s timeline for election certifications meanwhile chris hartline a spokesman for scott s campaign criticized nelson s attempts to hang onto what he sees as a losing battle this race is over hartline said in a statement it s a sad way for bill nelson to end his career he is desperately trying to hold on to something that no longer exists another showdown between republican sen cindy hyde smith and democrat mike espy who are both vying for a senate seat in mississippi will take place on nov 27 in a runoff sparked after neither candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote according to the new york times hyde smith who was endorsed by president

win arizona residents will have to wait a little longer to see which candidate will make history as the state s first female senator that title will either go to democrat kyrsten sinema who got 834 135 votes or republican martha mcsally who received 850 043 votes according to the associated press hundreds of thousands of ballots still have to be tabulated it s unclear how long that process will
