when gavin newsom was the lieutenant governor of california in 2013 he joked about his duties with late night host jimmy kimmel you wake up every morning you read the paper looking for obituaries for the governor s name that s pretty much it newsom was known for poking fun at his own post while a los angeles times reporter shadowed newsom a woman recognized him and asked him to pose for a picture with her son what s a lieutenant governor the boy asked i ask myself that every day newsom responded newsom who is now running for governor of california said recently that he regretted his dismissive comments about his own role but he s not the only one to take a crack at the job i think there is something of a joke that lieutenant governors just wait around and see if something happens to the governor in which case they would become governor said geoffrey skelley a political analyst at the university of virginia s center for politics now a coalition of democratic lieutenant governors is trying to turn that reputation around forming a national organization to advocate for their political goals the democratic lieutenant governors association broadly the group s mission is to back liberal candidates seeking election to the post and then support their members as they promote progressive ideals our focus is electing more democrats to lieutenant governors all around the nation said justin fairfax the first chairman of the dlga and the current lieutenant governor of virginia we re going to provide support to candidates in terms of staffing and research and polling and other on the ground partnerships to support them in their elections right now there are only 14 democratic lieutenant governors in states and one in a u s territory that s a substantial minority out of the 45 states that host the office five states do not have the position at all we want to increase those numbers said fairfax republicans on the other hand have 31 lieutenant governors in office they already created their own equivalent organization the republican lieutenant governors association in 2002 the conventional wisdom is that republicans have done a better job at understanding in recent times the importance of down ballot races the importance of state level offices and getting people elected to those offices and thus influencing public policy at the state level which in turn has influenced it at the national level to some degree and has also created a very strong bench of republican office holders to run for other offices said skelley fairfax noticed that disparity during his recent 2017 election he recalled how republican organizations including the republican lieutenant governors association were able to pour money and other resources into his opponent s campaign fortunately our message and the energy really carried the day he said but it did highlight that there needed to be a resource on our side to support candidates who are running to make sure that they have what they needed to amplify their message to re promote the number of voters and ultimately to win a similar democratic lieutenant governors organization had existed years ago but went completely dormant until a seedling of the idea to recreate it arose during recent conversations between leaders montana s lt gov mike cooney the chair of the bipartisan national lieutenant governors association is on the executive committee for the dlga as i got more involved in the national lieutenant governors association i was kind of seeing our counterparts on the republican side and they had a very active republican association and i just thought why are democrats not doing that he said we needed to reorganize this and breathe some life into this and see if we could help make a difference in future elections this election cycle there are 30 states holding lieutenant governor contests in 20 of those states the lieutenant governors and governors are paired as a single ticket in the remaining 10 the battle for lieutenant governor is separate the dlga will help democratic candidates in both types of races although though the organization is new the dlga has already hit the ground running ahead of the november elections we ve already started we are engaged with a lot of our campaigns and we re looking to connect with all of them said roshan patel the executive director of the dlga who was formerly the finance director of the democratic governors association they ll reach out to even more candidates once the remaining states hold primaries to determine their democratic nominees the dlga also hopes to support lieutenant governors once elected we really want to be there to support current and future leaders said bethany hall long the lieutenant governor of delaware and a member of the dlga executive committee and i think it s important that we would be able to be an organization that would be a resource to provide policy advice and to assist other democrats with resources as they are serving in office in office however lieutenant governors inhabit a gray space in local politics where their duties depend largely on the state they serve and the governor to whom they report the duties vary extremely from state to state said mick bullock the director of public affairs for the national conference of state legislatures who formerly served as communications director for mississippi lieutenant governor and later governor phil bryant you ve got the lieutenant governor in louisiana who is in charge of the tourism commission whereas just next door for us in mississippi the lieutenant governor is the presiding officer or the president of the senate in texas he added many people would say that the lieutenant governor is more powerful than the governor because of the position s significant legislative responsibilities in some states he says the responsibilities of the lieutenant governor are formalized in the state constitution in others they are dictated by the rules of the state senate often their job just depends on what tasks the current governor is willing to delegate in a lot of cases the lieutenant governor doesn t even have a very clear role skelley said lieutenant governors skelley explained are in an unusual position because they are a step away from being governor but also don t have many assigned duties in a lot of states referencing a famous quote from former vice president john nance garner skelley said i do think there is some truth to the idea that the lieutenant governorship at least in a lot of states is not worth a warm bucket of spit if spit is what john nance garner said however he also noted that if the governor steps down resigns during a scandal or is appointed to another post the lieutenant governor will immediately assume the highest political office in the state and the position can lay the groundwork for future career advancement because of the nature of their position they do have the opportunity to build up name recognition so if they want to run in their own right in the future they can sometimes have the necessary support to be successful skelley said the dlga thinks that investing in democratic lieutenant governors is important fairfax explained that lieutenant governors can cast tie breaking votes in the state senate sit on boards and commissions that shape public policy or advocate for ideas from their platform you really do have lgs that have broad portfolios that have significant input impact on the most pressing policy issues of our time he said at a time when federal level has produced nothing really but stagnation and infighting the state is taking the lead on policy and they can build a pipeline of future democratic leadership because i think we have that reputation i think we always are eager to point out that look if you re a democrat and you know the names john kerry or howard dean or tim kaine then you are well aware of lieutenant governors said cyrus habib the lieutenant governor of washington because all of them at one point were lieutenant governors and that was a critical step for them to get to where they eventually ended up so it matters he said making investments early in these campaigns is important contact us at editors time com
