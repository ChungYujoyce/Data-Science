in advance of the first primary the candidates twisted the facts on gun manufacturers health care iraq iran and military spending by factcheck org posted on february 8 2020 four days before the new hampshire primary seven democratic presidential candidates debated we found factual distortions on several issues the feb 7 debate was hosted by abc news wmur tv in new hampshire and apple news biden said sanders voted to allow gun manufactures to not be sued for the crimes they have created the law that sanders originally supported does allow lawsuits in some cases biden the biggest mistake that sen sanders made he voted to give the gun manufacturers the only major industry in america a loophole that does not allow them to be sued for the crimes they have created sandersvoted in favor oftheprotection of lawful commerce in arms act of 2005 whichlargely protectslicensed manufacturers dealers sellers of firearms or ammunition and trade associations from civil lawsuits over the misuse of guns or ammunition but as thecongressional research service wrote in a 2012 report the legislation which president george w bush signed into law included six exceptions where civil suits could still be brought the exceptions include cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence cases involving the transfer of a firearm with the knowledge that it would be used to commit a crime and cases in which manufacturers and sellers marketed or sold a firearm in violation of state or federal law for example in november the supreme courtdeclined to dismissa 2015 lawsuit the families of victims of the sandy hook shooting filed against remington arms co for the way it marketed the assault style rifle adam lanza used to kill 26 people in the 2012 school shooting a connecticut judgesaidthe case will go to trial in 2021 more than a decade after he voted for the 2005 bill sanders switched positions andsigned on as a cosponsorof an unsuccessful bill that sought to repeal the law he helped enact klobuchar accused buttigieg of flip flopping on support for medicare for all citing a 2018 tweet in which buttigieg said he supported it indubitably and affirmatively buttigieg does not support the medicare for all plan proposed by sanders but buttigieg maintains that his plan to offer medicare as an option in the affordable care act exchanges would put the u s on a glide path that leads to a medicare for all environment klobuchar and pete while you have a different plan now you sent out a tweet just a few years ago that said henceforth forthwith indubitably affirmatively you are for medicare for all for the ages and so i would like to point out that what leadership is about is taking a position looking at things and sticking with them buttigieg just to be clear the truth is that i have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering health care for every american here s the tweet klobuchar was referring to gosh okay i pete buttigieg politician do henceforth and forthwith declare most affirmatively and indubitably unto the ages that i do favor medicare for all as i do favor any measure that would help get all americans covered now if you ll excuse me potholes await pete buttigieg petebuttigieg february 19 2018 at the time buttigieg was the mayor of south bend and not yet a candidate for president as a candidate buttigieg has proposed a more centrist health care proposal than some democrats he does not support themedicare for allplan proposed by sanders which would expand medicare which nowcoversprimarily those age 65 and older and some with disabilities to everyone creating a new universal single payer health care system in the united states rather buttigieg is proposing what he calls medicare for all who want it it would essentially allow people to buy into medicare through the affordable care act exchanges those who are eligible would get subsidies to pay for it and the cost would be capped at 8 5 of a person s income but it would not force people into medicare if they choose to keep the private insurance they currently have only in the last few months did it become the case that medicare for all was defined by politicians to mean ending private insurance and i ve never believed that that s the right pathway buttigieg said in an interview with thenevada independenton oct 25 i still think that we should move toward an environment of medicare for all sandersintroduceda version of his medicare for all plan in his 2016 presidential campaign and it has always meant ending private insurance but there have beenseveralpublic plan options proposed in congress that seek to make progress toward universal coverage buttigieg maintains that his commitment to universal health care remains and that his plan will ultimately lead to universal medicare because over time he believes people will choose it and i really do believe the public alternative will be better buttigieg said ina cnn interviewon sept 19 it could well be the glide path that leads toa medicare for all environment i believe that politicians who talk about things like medicare for all should have some account of theglide pathto get there buttigieg said inan interviewwith rachel maddow on msnbc on april 15 that s why i described how i think if we design it in the right way making a version of medicare available on the exchanges for people to buy into as an option will be the pathway to get there steyerclaimedthat obama got iran to give up its nuclear ambitions this is a matter of dispute iran s intent is unknown but the iran nuclear agreement could also be viewed as curbing or delaying the country s ambition not ending it thejoint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa was implemented in 2016 its aim was to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon it attempts to do this by requiring iran to reduce the number of operating centrifuges and its stockpile of uranium while allowing international atomic energy agency inspectors to monitor iran s declared nuclear facilities in exchange iran won relief from international sanctions and the ability to continue to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes however the deal contained sunset provisions which lift physical restrictions on iran s nuclear activities over a period of 10 15 years as explained in a67 pageguidebookpublished by the belfer center for science and international affairs at harvard university if fully implemented the physical constraints and verification provisions of this comprehensive nuclear agreement will effectively prevent iran from producing fissile material for nuclear weapons at its declared nuclear facilities for at least 10 to 15 years the belfer guide to the iran deal says the nonpartisan arms control association said something similar in itsaugust 2015 analysisof the agreement no single element blocks iran s pathway to nuclear weapons but taken together the nuclear restrictions and monitoring form a comprehensive system that will put nuclear weapons out of iran s reach for at least 15 years the arms control association analysis said under trump the u s haswithdrawnfrom the nuclear agreement and reimposed sanctions on iran the president and other republicans have criticized the deal for allowing iran to continue to enrich uranium and giving it access to billions of dollars in frozen assets inanother reporton the nuclear deal the belfer center summed up the arguments for and against the iran deal those who believe the deal does not prevent iran from acquiring nuclear weapons say the nuclear agreement does not represent a strategic shift away from nuclear weapons only a tactical decision to postpone those ambitions in order to get relief from international sanctions the report said inannouncingthe deal in august 2015 obama described it as a detailed arrangement that permanently prohibits iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon but even obama has acknowledged that the deal may not end iran s nuclear ambitions but delay it essentially we re purchasing for 13 14 15 years assurances that the breakout is at least a year obamatoldnpr in august 2015 and then in years 13 and 14 it is possible that those breakout times would have been much shorter but at that point we have much better ideas about what it is that their program involves sanders repeated several of his go to lines about health care that don t entirely reflect the facts first citing high health care costs the vermont senator said we are spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country he has made some version of this claim since at least 2015 including in a cnntown halllast year and theseptemberandjanuarydemocratic debates it s still not true according to the most recent organization for economic cooperation and developmentdata which is for 2018 u s per capita spending on health care totaled 10 586 that s twice as much as every country except for six sanders is correct that the u s spends a lot more than other nations it spends more than double the 3 992 average for oecd countries but switzerland norway germany sweden austria and denmark all pay a little more than half of what the u s does later in the debate sanders said there were 87 million people uninsured or underinsured and 500 000 people going bankrupt for what reason because they have cancer or heart disease or alzheimer s as we haveexplainedbefore the 87 million uninsured or underinsured number comes from a commonwealth fundsurvey which generally backs the figure but the tally includes 19 3 million people who were insured but had experienced a gap in coverage in the prior year sanders also didn t give the whole story behind the 500 000 people going bankrupt figure something he has donebefore he presented those bankruptcies as entirely due to health problems and medical bills but the number stems from a survey that counted the number of bankruptcies in which medical expenses or medical problems either somewhat or very much contributed the survey which was published as an editorial article in theamerican journal of public health found that 66 5 of the participants who declared bankruptcy between 2013 and 2016 cited medical reasons as a contributor the half a million estimate is derived by applying that percentage to the750 489 non business bankruptcies filed in 2019 biden repeated his standard and inaccurate defense of his 2002 vote to authorize military action against saddam hussein s iraq biden i trusted george bush to keep his word he said he was not going to go into iraq but president george w bush made no such promise to the contrary bush said publicly in aspeechon oct 7 2002 that war was a possibility i hope this will not require military action but it may and military conflict could be difficult that wasjust a few days beforethe senate voted 77 23 in favorof the resolution with biden then chairman of the senate foreign relations committee in the majority furthermore biden opposed a moveby other democrats to require that bush either win united nations approval of military action or return to congress for a second authorization biden said on the senate floor that it would strengthen the president s hand in pressing the u n for more aggressive inspections of possible weapons of mass destruction if the president could say i am already authorized if you fail to do that to use force against saddam hussein we addressed this biden claim at greater length in our jan 15 story factchecking the january democratic debate biden also spun his role in bringing troops home from iraq when he was vice president biden the president obama turned to me with the entire security apparatus and said joe i want you to organize getting 156 000 troops out of iraq i did that i did that it s true that in 2009 biden chaired a committee that oversaw the troop withdrawal while also keeping an eye on economic and political issues in iraq the biden committee included representatives from the defense department the joint chiefs of staff the treasury department and other agencies but what biden fails to mention is that later in obama s second term with biden still vice president the u s sent troops back into iraq to combat the islamic state fighters who had occupied much of the country near the end of the obama administration in late september 2016 the number of u s troops deployedexceeded 5 000 warren referenced her proposed wealth tax twice during the debate both times calling it a 2 cent wealth tax it s true that part of her plan includes an annual tax of 2 cents on every dollar of wealth over 50 million but she didn t mention that her amended plan would call on those with more than 1 billion of wealth to pay triple that amount warren s original plan included the 2 tax on net worth over 50 million and a 3 tax on net worth over 1 billion but she later introduced aplanto pay for medicare for all that included increasing the higher threshold tax to 6 warren aims to spend the money raised by those taxes largely on improving education as wedetailedin june she says her plan would cover universal child care for every child age 0 to 5 universal pre k for every 3 and 4 year old higher wages for child care workers and preschool teachers tuition and fees for all public technical schools 2 year colleges and 4 year colleges 50 billion for historically black colleges and universities and forgiveness of student loan debt for 95 of those with such debt it would also provide 100 billion over 10 years to combat the opioid crisis and make down payments on a green new deal and medicare for all however some economists have questioned whether her plan would raise as much as she expects as we ve written before the penn wharton budget modelprojectedthat if implemented in 2021 the taxes would raise between 2 3 trillion and 2 7 trillion over 10 years that s about 1 trillion to 1 4 trillion less than the warren campaign s estimate pwbm also estimated that the wealth tax would reduce gross domestic product in 2050 by about 1 2 depending on how the money is spent the wealth tax though is a frequent talking point for warren who mentioned it on the debate stage during a discussion of racism in america and highlighted it in her closing remarks saying warren everyone says they love the kids but here s the deal it s time to come up with real plans to make that happen i ve talked before about a 2 cent wealth tax but the whole idea behind it is we could do early childhood education and good quality child care universal pre k for every 3 year old and 4 year old in america and we can stop exploiting the people largely black and brown women who do this work and raise the wages of every child care worker and preschool teacher in america maybe so but it would cost those with more than 1 billion in net worth 6 of their wealth over that amount not 2 biden and sanders argued over the cost of sanders medicare for all plan biden criticized sanders for not providing a price tag for his plan and said it would cost double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the united states sanders said what biden wanted the status quo would cost 50 trillion over the next 10 years both have a point we ll go through the numbers sanders hasn t provided a price tag for his plan and many of the details would need to be ironed out before a solid estimate could be calculated several organizations have come up with varying estimates in an estimatepublished onlineby sanders 2016 presidential campaign gerald friedman a professor of economics at theuniversity of massachusetts amherst saidthe plan would increase government spending by 13 8 trillion over 10 years but that s the low end of the estimates othershave rangedfrom 25 trillion to 34 trillionover 10 years that s more than double what the federal government now spends on health care programs total federal health care spending was 1 trillion in 2018 according to the centers for medicare medicaid services and a projected 14 trillion over 10 years 2018 2027 seetable 16 under projections that would put the cost at double current federal health care spending sanders meanwhile cited the projection from cms for total national health care expenditures which includes all government employer individual and insurer spending that totals a projected 47 trillion over 10 years nearly 50 trillion what biden ignores is that federal health spending would be nearly all health spending under medicare for all so payments by insurers individuals employers and even state and local governments would shift to the federal government what sanders ignores is that some estimates on the cost of his plan expect total national health spending to increase from the status quo a recent estimate by the urban institutefounda single payer plan like sanders would increase national health spending by 720 billion in 2020 there s still guesswork involved without more concrete details on the plan such as what rates it would pay health care providers a february 2019 analysis by the committee for a responsible federal budgetsaidthat total national health spending would likely change by no more than a few trillion dollars over the decade and whether that change was up or down would depend on the whether the increased cost of expanding coverage by making health insurance more generous and offering it to more people is larger or smaller than the amount saved from lower provider payments drug payments and administrative spending in discussing his hope to galvanize international support to collectively combat climate change sanders inaccurately characterized a statistic on global military spending here is my dream maybe it s a radical dream sanders said but maybe just maybe given the crisis of climate change the world can understand that instead of spending 1 8 trillion a year collectively on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other maybe we pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change that 1 8 trillion represents spending on more than just weapons the figure is the2018 total world military expenditure as calculated by the stockholm international peace research institute a think tank that researches conflict armaments and more military expenditure refers to all government spending on current military forces and activities including salaries and benefits operational expenses arms and equipment purchases military construction research and development and central administration command and support the organizationsaysof the figure sipri therefore discourages the use of terms such as arms spending when referring to military expenditure as spending on armaments is usually only a minority of the total byeugene kiely brooks jackson lori robertson robert farley d angelo gore jessica mcdonald saranac hale spencer angelo
