2020 democratic primary debate the debate which was hosted by cnn in detroit opened with an intense discussion of how to expand health care to all americans and then saw the candidates tackle immigration gun control race relations trade and even climate change many voters had noted they wanted to see more focus on climate change after the first round of debates in june something the cnn moderators noted when brought up the topic tuesday night in addition to sanders and warren tonight s cnn debate stage includes south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg and former texas rep beto o rourke two of the youngest candidates in the race minnesota sen amy klobuchar former colorado gov john hickenlooper ohio rep tim ryan and former maryland rep john delaney will also be on stage along with montana gov steve bullock making his presidential debate debut and returning self help author marianne williamson on many of the questions moderates including delaney ryan hickenlooper and bullock went after sanders and warren calling their ideas unrealistic or even downright bad policy the moderators also prompted warren to criticize sanders at times but she avoided taking the bait instead the two liberal senators aggressively explained their policies and largely agreed as they took on their fellow candidates jabs read more 10 things we learned from night one of the democratic debates in detroit the debate took place amid the context of president donald trump s recent tweets targeting the city of baltimore and rep elijah cummings and his racist comments toward four progressive congresswomen of color which several candidates referenced during the second night of the cnn debate tomorrow breakout moments could come from former vice president joe biden and california sen kamala harris who will once again face off during the second night of the debates harris confronted biden about his previous positions on school busing during june s debates and the two candidates along with new jersey sen cory booker have traded barbs about race relations and criminal justice in the weeks since the stakes are particularly high this time as candidates will have to meet polling and donor thresholds that are twice as high to make it to the next round of debates that means round two could be more contentious than the first debates last month as candidates take one of their last opportunities to stand out in front of a national cable audience here are live updates from night one in detroit the first question of the night from cnn moderator jake tapper was about medicare for all and it inspired a fierce back and forth between sanders and delaney and then many of the candidates on the stage tapper asked sanders about delaney calling his medicare for all plan bad policy and how the vermont senator would respond to his fellow candidate sanders initially responded by simply saying you re wrong which received applause from the audience he then recited statistics about how many people do not have insurance in the united states and emphasized one of his signature talking points that health care is a human right delaney hit back arguing that sanders plan would remove choice why do we have to be the party of taking something away he asked after the two engaged in a heated debate about the merits of the plan warren jumped into the fight defending sanders and making her own case for medicare for all in one of the more explosive moments of the early section warren accused delaney and tapper of using republican talking points to talk about health care look let s be clear about this we are the democrats we are not about trying to take away health care from anyone that s what the republicans are trying to do and we should stop using republican talking points in order to talk with each other about how to best provide that health care she said read more where the 2020 democratic candidates stand on medicare for all when asked what specifically he would do to address gun violence the south bend ind mayor got personal this is the exact same conversation we ve been having since i was in high school buttigieg said citing that he was a junior in high school at the time of the 1999 columbine shooting when klobuchar blamed the nation s gun problems on the nra s political power buttigieg argued it s because of a lack of common sense gun control and universal background checks that shootings continue to happen across the country and that things haven t changed since columbine i was part of the first generation that saw routine school shootings we have now produced the second school shooting generation in this country buttigieg said we dare not allow there to be a third buttigieg also had a message for his younger constituents back home who have shared with him their fears of school shootings we re supposed to be dealing with this so that you don t have to high school is hard enough without having to worry about getting shot he said moderator dana bash asked buttigieg why he did not support sanders 1 6 trillion plan to wipe out all student loan debt in america even though the mayor and his husband chasten buttigieg would stand to have six figures of debt forgiven through the plan well it d be great for us the mayor replied but then the next day there would be a student loan program people would be taking out student loans instead buttigieg advocated for expanding pell grants and the public service loan forgiveness program read more here s how 2020 democrats student loan debt proposals compare klobuchar also critiqued sanders plan my problem with some of these plans is that they would literally pay for wealthy kids for wall street kids to go to college she said however sanders plan found a defender in williamson who argued that the best thing you could do to stimulate the u s economy is to get rid of this debt she also fired back at the others for criticizing the plan i ve heard some people here tonight i almost wonder why you re democrats she said you seem to think there s something wrong about using the instruments of government to help people asked to respond to trump s recent attacks on people of color who have criticized him and his strategy of stoking racial tensions candidates discussed their ideas for handling systemic racism we ll call out his racism for what it is o rourke said moderators then asked warren to how she would combat the rise of white supremacy in the u s she echoed o rourke we need to call out white supremacy for what it is domestic terrorism she said warren cited her plan to address education through which she said she d put 50 billion in historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt to help narrow the racial wealth gap in the u s the conversation moved on to reparations which williamson has made a major part of her campaign platform williamson outlined her proposal of paying 200 to 500 billion in reparations for slavery and systemic racism as part of an attempt to heal the injustice that continues form a toxicity underneath the surface of the u s people heal when there is some deep truth telling williamson said in support of her reparations plan we need to recognize that when it comes to the economic gap between blacks and whites in america it does come from a great injustice that has never been dealt with that great injustice has had to do with the fact that there was 250 years of slavery followed by another 100 years of domestic terrorism williamson invoked the forty acres and a mule promise made to former enslaved people to provide them reparations after the civil war in explaining her plan by giving reparations she argued americans can face the darkness wrought by racism what makes me qualified to say 200 500 billion she said if you did the math of the forty acres and a mule given that there was four to five million slaves at the end of the civil war and they were all promised 40 acres and a mule for every family of four if you did the math today it would be trillions of dollars and i believe that anything less than a hundred billion dollars is an insult when debate moderators appeared to encourage warren to go after sanders by asking if calling herself a capitalist was an attempt to separate the two candidates she made a big moment with a searing remark against delaney instead we can t choose a candidate we don t believe in just because we re too scared to do anything else warren said and we can t ask other people to vote for a candidate we don t believe in democrats win when we figure out what is right and we get out there and fight for it i am not afraid and for democrats to win you can t be afraid either delaney rebutted with a shot at warren s progressive politics i think democrats win when we run on real solutions not impossible promises when we run on things that are workable not fairy tale economics the former congressman added that encouraging the government the private sector and the nonprofit sector to work together should be our model going forward but warren who says corporate corruption is the biggest problem in washington had her own comeback you know i don t understand why anybody goes to all the trouble of running for president of the united states just to talk about what we can t do and shouldn t fight for she said to uproarious applause from the detroit audience i don t get it a question submitted by a michigan voter asked what the candidates would do to prevent another flint klobuchar who noted that she was the first of the candidates to release an infrastructure plan committed to a trillion dollar investment that she said she would paid for by upping the capital gains rate trump she added had promised that he was going to do that on election night if anyone remembers and then he hasn t followed through williamson also criticized trump s inaction on the issue saying we have an administration that has gutted the clean water act but she also appeared to take a swipe at her opponents for focusing on policy details if you think any of this wonkiness is going to deal with this dark psychic force of the collectivized hatred that this president is bringing up in this country then i m afraid that the democrats are going to see some very dark days hickenlooper the former colorado governor went on the attack several times during the debate gunning for trump as well debate opponent sanders hickenlooper said trump s presidency was committing malpractice by hurting farmers harming manufacturing jobs and creating international crises it s negligent improper illegal activity for doctors or public officials google it check it out donald trump is malpractice personified hickenlooper said hickenlooper also argued that he is better equipped to take on trump than sanders he took aim at several policies sanders has championed especially at sanders medicare for all proposal he argued that americans will resist a policy that would take away their current health insurance he also said the green new deal s policy of guaranteeing people government jobs would be a disaster at the ballot box in a viral moment hickenlooper turned to sanders and told him that his proposals are not going to happen and that sanders should throw his hands up although julian castro won t be onstage until tomorrow night his call to decriminalize border crossings during the june debates became a litmus test for tonight last month castro directly went after fellow texan o rourke for treating border crossings as a criminal offense rather than a civil one when asked directly about decriminalization warren argued in favor of it while o rourke doubled down on his stance against it saying that he would institute policies to help central americans so they don t need to make the journey but also reserve the right to criminally prosecute them meanwhile buttigieg offered a noncommittal answer saying that the decision between civil and criminal proceedings would depend on the circumstances warren and delaney offered differing visions as to how they d increase taxes on the wealthy warren promoted one of the signature components of her platform the wealth tax she argued that she would tax 2 cents on every dollar of assets above 50 million that the wealthy have warren argued that the tax could fund universal preschool expand the pell grant program provide 50 billion for historically black colleges and universities contribute to higher wages for childcare workers and preschool teachers and eliminate the majority of student debt it tells you how badly broken this economy is that 2 cents from the wealthiest in this country would let us invest in the rest of america warren said cnn s don lemon pointed out that delaney s 65 million fortune would make him subject to the wealth tax and asked the former congressman whether wealthy people should face higher taxes delaney responded that while he feels the wealthy should face higher taxes it should be through a capital gains tax there is no reason the people who invest for a living should pay less than the people who work for a living delaney said he argued that warren s wealth tax is unrealistic the wealth tax will be fought in court forever it s arguably unconstitutional and the countries that have had it have largely abandoned it because it s hard to implement delaney said as candidates debated health care policy many struggled to get their points across in the allotted time with moderators continually interjecting to clip them off cnn s rules allowed a 60 second response for a question from a moderator and a 30 second response for a rebuttal for those who watched the first debate in june there were be many familiar faces almost all of the candidates who qualified for the june debate made the july debates in part because both debates had the same qualifications candidates had to register at least 1 in three polls from a predetermined set of surveys as well as recruit 65 000 individual donations the one exception montana gov steve bullock was new to the stage bullock is replacing california rep eric swalwell who dropped out of the race on july 8 the candidates who qualified are in alphabetical order cnn divided the candidates into two nights of 10 candidates during a live airing of their debate draw on july 18 the debate s second night will include front runner biden harris booker castro and more former pennsylvania rep joe sestak joined the race just days before the first round of debates in june and didn t qualify for either of the first two debates tom steyer the billionaire hedge fund manager and democratic donor who launched his campaign earlier this month massachusetts rep seth moulton and miramar fla and mayor wayne messam also failed to qualify for the cnn hosted debate read more a quick guide to the big ideas in the democratic primary the latest national polls show biden holding on to his favorability lead with an average of 29 warren and sanders are in a virtual tie for second at around 15 each though harris isn t far behind them at 12 buttigieg is registering at a more distant 5 while the rest of the field is
