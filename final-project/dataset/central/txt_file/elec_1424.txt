clash between hillary clinton and bernie sanders of the entire 2016 campaign why is that because the stakes are high former secretary of state clinton continues to lead the race but can t shake the dogged senator sanders and this is the last scheduled face to face meeting between the pair it s likely they ll air all their differences over the course of two hours beginning at 9 p m e d t on cnn time for the obligatory odd number list of things to watch for we ve scratched out three that are almost certain to come up beyond that predictions get chancy who s the real new yorker given that the new york primary is tuesday and the debate is in new york and sanders was born and raised in new york and clinton was a new york senator we re pretty sure there s going to be a struggle over who s the true new yorker edge sanders he s got more new york years he s got a new york accent and he s never professed fanship for the chicago cubs as has illinois native clinton clinton s best play might be to present herself as a new yorker in the statewide sense after all she represented the state not the city in the senate and spent lots of time in upstate towns who s the most qualified to be president last week sanders said clinton was not qualified to sit in the oval office because her associated super pac takes corporate contributions she voted for the war in iraq and she supports free trade agreements he s since walked that back he says it s really her judgment that is at issue with these positions edge clinton yes really it s qualified that s the problem for sanders he disagrees vehemently on some policy issues with clinton but in terms of variety of presidential prep job experience the former congressional watergate panel staffer first lady and national legislator has got more lines on her r sum than he does she ll likely bring up this jibe as a means to remind voters of all the jobs she s had the 225 000 verizon speech sanders hasn t made an issue of clinton s use of a personal e mail server while secretary of state but he has attacked her over her personal ties to wall street including her acceptance of big fees for speaking at bank and corporate events so expect him to bring up the 225 000 honorarium clinton received in may 2013 for speaking at a verizon event it was a big applause line at sanders s wednesday night rally in washington square park unionized verizon workers are on strike in new york and both candidates have visited them in an attempt to show solidarity sanders will use the speech money to try and call into question the sincerity of clinton s appearance edge sanders she s been asked about them for over a year but clinton still does not have a great answer as to why she raked in such big speech bucks what she said to earn them and whether they constitute a conflict of interest get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox ok enough with the politics as sports aspect of the program beyond that there is one large underlying factor to keep in mind while watchingtonight sdebate sanders needs the dynamic of the race to change or he will lose clinton is happy with the status quo as we ve written before that s because bernie needs blowout wins to have any hope of catching hillary he s still hundreds of delegates behind and democrats award delegates proportionately so he needs to sweep big states and fast otherwise he s got no hope of making up his delegate deficit link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to the christian science
