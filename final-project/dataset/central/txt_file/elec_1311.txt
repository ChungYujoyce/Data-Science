up mexican president enrique pe anieto on an offer extended to both us presidential candidates by making a quick visit to mexico on wednesday just hours before he is expected to a deliver major immigration speech in arizona i have accepted the invitation of president enrique pena nieto of mexico and look very much forward to meeting him said mr trump in a twitter post on tuesday night trump s ascent to the nomination owes much to his antagonism of the united states southern neighbor launching his campaign with remarks that belittled immigrants from mexico and claiming that they have contributed to international humiliation for the us they re not sending us their best he said inhisjune 2015 speechannouncingthat he was seeking the republican presidential bid they re sending people that have lots of problems and they re bringing those problems they re bringing drugs they re bringing crime they re rapists and some i assume are good peoplebut i speak to border guards and they tell us what we re getting when do we beat mexico at the border he continued they re laughing at us at our stupidity and now they re beating us economically they are not our friend believe me but they re killing us economically in march mr pe a nietocriticized trump s strident tone likening his brand of populism to that of fascist leaders like adolf hitler and benito mussolini he later told cnn that there was no way that mexico would ever pay for the construction of a border wall as trump has insisted it should on tuesday pe a nietoseemed to preempt criticisms over the invitation writing on twitter that he believed in dialogue to promote the interests of mexico in the world and principally to protect mexicans wherever they are the purpose of the visit he wrote was to discuss bilateral relations a preferred topic for a president who has made attracting foreign investment a priority his comments in march aside the mexican president has been characteristically circumspect in his remarks about the us elections describing them as a matter to be decided internally i have never made any remark or rating about any of the candidates today in the democratic competition of the united states he said in july according to local media any point or statementthat i have made has been taken out of context i have always expressed absolute respect for the process in april the christian science monitor noted that despite the vast expense and formidable array of practical obstacles involved in building walls along the border politicians in the us continue to use the idea to soothe anxieties over immigration the value of the wall some experts say is much more as a political idea than an actual structure the border wall remains a powerful symbol for people on both sides of the immigration debate either as a sign of security taken seriously or of fear and misunderstanding run amok it s something that has gained a lot of political value the idea that you can wall the united states off from the rest of the rest of the world particularly in this case mexico says rachel st john author of line in the sand a history of the u s mexico border trump s visit comes as he appears to retreat from his earlier insistence that he would marshal a deportation force to expel all of the country s roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in recent meetings with hispanic supporters the candidate suggested that he might be open to letting some of those people stay though his staff has appeared to contradict that in subsequent interviews get the monitor stories you care about
