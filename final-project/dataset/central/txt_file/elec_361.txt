nominee donald trump meets with supporters after a campaign event thursday at gilley s in dallas things are not going well for donald trump on monday he fired his campaign manager corey lewandowski lewandowski ran the campaign on a shoestring budget and a strategy that was largely built off and fueled by the candidate s say whatever personality and brand that worked great in a primary not so much in a general election but trump s problems are far deeper than an embattled campaign manager who just four months ago was described as trump s alter ego trump s family stepped in monday in a scene that could have been ripped from the apprentice lewandowski was summoned to a morning meeting but it was a setup new york magazine s gabe sherman reports shortly after it began trump s children peppered lewandowski with questions asking him to explain the campaign s lack of infrastructure their father grew visibly upset as he heard the list of failures finally he turned to lewandowski and said what s your plan here lewandowski responded that he wanted to leak trump s vice president pick and with that lewandowski was out tension has persisted in the campaign between lewandowski and a faction led by veteran political operative paul manafort a former ronald reagan aide who was brought on in the spring to manage a potential battle for delegates at the convention but doubts started to grow about lewandowski s management the bottom line is lewandowski didn t run a campaign that could win a modern day presidential campaign here were some of the problems cash on hand totals are through may filed june 20 for hillary clinton and donald trump and as of march 31 for gop senators seeking re election in november domenico montanaro npr federal election commission hide caption money trump didn t need much of it in the primary campaign he was able to get himself on tv without much problem but trump who claims to be worth 10 billion vowed not to fund his general election campaign that combined with trump s lackluster fundraising has made lots of republicans wring their hands at the end of may trump s campaign had just 1 3 million cash on hand and owed trump himself 45 7 million that figure is so paltry it s less than every republican senator up for re election in competitive races in something of an exit interview on cnn monday after his firing lewandowski bragged twice that the money is pouring in he said the campaign had raised some 6 million to 8 million at recent events trump would have to raise that amount of money every single day for two to three months to total the 500 million he said he would need to fund a general election campaign and that s half of what most real campaigns for president would need nowadays in 2012 romney and obama spent roughly 2 billion combined travel trump wasted a monthlong advantage over hillary clinton when he had vanquished his rivals and she was still battling bernie sanders instead of focusing on traditional swing states trump traveled to states where he is likely to win or likely to lose staff trump s campaign has fewer than 100 staffers he boasts how efficient his operation is with 73 employees clinton is estimated to already have around 800 paid staffers those are people who can be used to register voters and then get them to the polls in key states you could believe trump s boast that his campaign is more efficient and that his constant presence on tv compensates for a smaller staff or you could look to history by august of 2012 obama had 901 people on his payroll mitt romney had 403 and never mind the size of the staff what is the campaign doing with them trump has eschewed data and behavioral analytics so far that s something the clinton team not only is all over but something the republican party recognized was a problem after losing twice to obama the president broke the mold on this and republicans have tried hard to make up ground in the use of data ads hillary clinton and groups supporting her are spending more than 23 million on ads in eight key battleground states according to nbc smg delta donald trump a grand total of zero zip nada for those who think it s still early it s not really consider 2012 back then romney and his allies were on air with almost 40 million in ads compared with obama and his supporters with 45 million and one of the lessons of 2012 was that romney allowed his opponents to define him with negative advertising early on trump s negatives are far worse than romney s were at this point in the campaign stunning team clinton has a 100 ad spending edge in battlegrounds in june 2012 it was 54 46 for obama pic twitter com 0odrbxfsyu but here s the reality blame the campaign manager all you want he s not really the problem trump s problems go well beyond a campaign manager and straight to him problems in a campaign usually stem from the top and that s especially true in this one message trump has myriad problems including a lack of policy depth a dereliction of facts and an overall message especially when he talks about race and identity that has offended lots of voters he didn t have to worry about in a nearly all white republican primary but a general election is a whole different ballgame some 14 million people voted for trump in the primaries a record but obama won almost five times as many votes in the 2012 general election 66 million image trump may have been the teflon don with gop voters but he was velcro with the rest of the country coming out of the primary trump s negative rating is higher than any other presidential candidate in history and it has gotten worse in the past month following 1 his inflammatory comments that the presiding judge in the trump university fraud case was biased because of his mexican heritage and 2 the veterans fundraiser imbroglio trump donated 1 million only after the washington post reported there was no evidence he had done so as promised that led to a press conference at which trump called reporters names like sleaze and derisively a real beauty both reporters are children of cuban immigrants disunity all of that has led to a split with republican party leaders never before has the sitting speaker of the house called his party s presumptive nominee s comments racist as paul ryan did with trump s comments on the trump u judge senate majority leader mitch mcconnell chided trump to get on message and stick to the script one republican senator said he would not entertain any more trump questions and others are refusing to defend him and even threatening not to support him inconsistency and a lack of discipline trump himself months ago had promised to be more presidential than anybody other than the great abe lincoln back in march on the night of the michigan primary and five days after he became the first presidential candidate in history to defend the size of his genitalia during a live national presidential debate trump vowed i could be more presidential than anybody i can be more presidential if i want to be i can be more presidential than anybody he called it easy it s proved to be not so easy instead trump seems to have an internal conflict choosing which self he wants to be he delivered two wooden speeches reading from a teleprompter twice in a week after gop disunity came to a head and then he was back to his free wheeling self at a rally in atlanta on wednesday his rambling speech went on for more than an hour with trump sometimes ducking out of incomplete thoughts midway through a sentence sometimes coming back to them much later you just never know which trump you re going to get and both have their flaws polls trump is now facing a minor collapse of his poll numbers against hillary clinton after trump wrapped up the nomination he pulled even with clinton according to the real clear politics average of the polls that was when the democratic race was not yet settled over the past month trump has dipped below 40 percent clinton holds on average a 6 point lead polls this far out are hardly predictive of what will happen in the fall but the trend is unmistakable and worrying many in the gop besides the horse race numbers are other worrisome figures for the gop an abc washington post poll found 70 percent of americans dislike trump including 56 percent who have a strongly unfavorable view that s unheard of what s more 9 in 10 hispanics have an unfavorable view of trump including more than three quarters who said so strongly a cbs new york times poll found that 41 percent said they thought clinton had done something illegal with her emails and private server setup in her home yet trump was pulling in only 37 percent against clinton s 43 percent in a head to head matchup that means trump isn t even getting all of the people who thought clinton had done something illegal all of this has led to free the delegates the latest of the stop trump never trump dump trump movements it s good news for us bad news for the trump supporters contended kendal unruh a delegate from colorado speaking monday on msnbc of lewandowski s ouster she s one of the leaders of free the delegates which is encouraging the republican national committee to change its rules and allow delegates to vote their conscience at the convention donald trump walks toward the 11th tee at trump national golf club los angeles in rancho palos verdes calif gary friedman la times via getty images hide caption donald trump walks toward the 11th tee at trump national golf club los angeles in rancho palos verdes calif there is not a campaign there is not an organization unruh said of the trump team adding it would be impossible to win against hillary clinton with trump on the ticket but free the delegates like past stop trump efforts is unlikely to succeed it too has little organization and perhaps most importantly no candidate zero chance of success unless ted cruz who controls almost 1 000 delegates joins in is how veteran gop operative charlie black described the effort black worked for john kasich s presidential campaign but also has ties to manafort with whom he founded the lobbying firm black manafort stone kelly this likely will calm down before the convention another veteran strategist called it unlikely that the rnc rules would be changed to derail trump and said it is highly improbable that most of the delegates would go against the will of millions of republican primary voters the ball is the hands of one person donald trump said danny diaz who managed jeb bush s presidential campaign if he proves he can campaign without attacking fellow republicans and employing divisive rhetoric he will have few issues becoming the nominee despite getting grudging support on the floor of the convention if trump continues to be critical of fellow republicans however it s possible there could be at least a protest vote on the floor of the convention sure trump would still be the nominee but the last thing the party wants is a demonstration of disunity shown live on national television months before voting either way trump has a lot of work to do and it starts with himself npr thanks
