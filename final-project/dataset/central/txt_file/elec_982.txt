there s that dark little cloud when it comes to trustworthiness she says but on this mapa is certain i am voting against trump the biggest swing in the american electorate this yearis happening among white college educated voters like mapa they are a big and growing group an estimated 23 of the electoratefour years agoand expected to be a bit more this year and they have voted republican in every presidential election since at least 1952 four years ago mitt romney won their support by a solid 14 percentage points according to surveys of voters as they left polling places but in the latest pew research center poll taken last month clinton led among whites who have a college degreeby 14 points that may be the most dramatic partisan shift by a major demographic group from one presidential election to the nextinmodern american history the deciders a look at 8 key counties that are going to help decide this election in places like chester county in pennsylvania douglas county in colorado delaware county in ohio wake county in north carolinaand fairfax county in virginia those changing allegiances createformidable problemsfor trump in states he needs to winthe white house while national polls give the businessman and reality tv star a 2 1 lead among white voters who don t have a college education democrats traditional appeal among minority voters and their newstrength among better educated whites especially women risk making an electoral majority all but out of reach for him pennsylvania is a crucial state trump clinton and running mates mike pence and tim kaine all have campaigned here since the democratic convention and the clinton campaign also has sent invice president biden and former president bill clinton on a sunny saturday near summer s end the weekly farmersmarket tucked on an open lot in downtown west chester is bustling with shoppers eyeing stacks of tomatoes and corn six kinds of apples early pumpkins and gourds and homemadepies and cobblers margot mckee who works in real estate sales and describes her age only as old enough to know better bought a maple oat muffin to eat later in april shevoted for trump in pennsylvania s gop primary he trounced his rivals winning 57 of the vote over texas sen ted cruz 22 and ohio gov john kasich 19 but now she anguishes overwhat to do in november i think he s done a great job in getting people s attention to some issues that have been neglected and congress is dysfunctional and politicians are dysfunctional and they don t seem willing to do their jobs shebegins but she says trump needs to grow up and learn to keep his mouth shut first describinghim as impossible and then calling him an unprintable epithet what about clinton mckee sighs i mdrawn to her because of her experience and her even manner but i m not sure that she s honest adding unhappily that the clintons seem to know how to duck and bob i m so disgusted i m thinking that maybe i m not going to vote she muses something she s never done before butthen that s a cop out the four collar counties around philadelphia bucks chester delaware andmontgomery in the past haveprovided republican margins to help neutralize the democratic advantage in the city itself in the past 12 presidential elections chester has voted for the democratic candidate only once in 2008 but democrats have become increasingly competitive in the suburban counties which include about a third of the state s voters in 2012 romney lost the other threeand carried chester by just two tenths of a percentage point the closest margin in the state or as west chester mayor carolyn comitta a democrat ruefully recalls 529 votes the county has a population of about 516 000 and half have college degrees the highest proportion in the state average household incomes are well above the state average unemployment is well below and voter turnout is high four years ago seven in 10of the voting age citizens in chester cast ballots the county s residents are overwhelmingly white just 6 are african american 7 latino even so it is trump s provocative rhetoric about mexicans muslims and immigrants that seems to havecreated the biggest backlash among chester county voters typically here it s having a fiscal conservative that s most important to chester county voters but this race is transcending traditional issues chester county republican chairman val digiorgio a lawyer says what s important here and determinative here is whether donald trump can show himself to be someone who reaches out to a broader segment of the population as opposed to what he did during the primaries we re still waiting to see whether that s the case digiorgio who endorsed florida sen marco rubio in the republican primary now supports trump and is putting all our efforts to make sure he s elected president he says the new york billionaire has drawn more volunteers than usual to the local gop organization but the republican county committee s home page which among other things offers gop brandedwine made from grapes grown in chester county on monday didn tmention trump s name or the presidential race the website stab listing 2016 candidates includedstatewide and local contenders but not the top of the ticket to be fair the home page of the chester county democratic committee didn t mention clinton either though she was listed on the 2016 candidates tab but a banner across the top of the page declared if you don t vote the whole ballot you are not doing your full part against trumpism just how much impact trump could have down the ballot is a worry for republicans and a hope for democrats in a statewide franklin marshall college poll taken last month clinton led trump by 7 points 47 40 and democratic senate challenger katie mcginty led incumbent republican pat toomey by 5 points 43 38 the hard fought keystone staterace is one of a handful expected to determine control of the senate the fact is she s the beneficiary of clinton emerging into the lead g terry madonna director of the poll and a professor of public affairs says of mcginty i think if it s five points or less toomey has a good chance of winning but if clinton wins the state by more than 5 points trump may leave toomey with too much ground to make up among voters willing to split their ticket comitta who is challenging three term republican incumbent dan truitt forthe state house of representatives enthusiastically backs clinton but she generally tries to talk about local and state issues not the national race as she campaigns she stopsby the farmers market after a morning of walking door to door on this recent day distributing fliers that don t mention party affiliation instead describing her as mom educator mayor i hear from some people who love her some people who would never vote for her and some who will vote for her because they can t imagine trump being president she says of clinton because the two candidates are so polarizing and i have to win my race i m not going there that s a whole other conversation truitt didn t return calls seeking comment trump does have enthusiastic supporters in chester county and linda ives is one of them you look at a human being as a body of work and i think that the gentleman has without a doubt provided opportunities job opportunities for hundreds of thousands of people and after watching his children at the convention i was most impressed says ives 54 a retired u s army captain who now works as a consultant she also is motivated by fierce opposition to clinton she calls the former secretary of state a criminal for her role in the 2012 deaths of four americans in benghazi libya and her carelessness with sending classified information on her private email server if i had sent one unclassified email like that i would be at fort leavenworth right now i would be in jail ives says she is concerned about trump s delivery but she also says unfair news coverage is contributing to his problems i think people are embarrassed to say they re supporting trump she says i think what s happening is sorry guys the liberal media is just pushing the whole the man is a ridiculous clown i mean he s getting portrayed as a ridiculous clown and the only people who aregoing to vote for him is the young uneducated male so people are then i m an educated person why would i be stupid enough to vote for trump indeed the electoral shift among college educated whites in just four years has been of historic proportions particularly for such a large group of voters in donald trump you have a perfect storm of a candidate in terms of pressing buttons to sending white college educated voters particularly women in the other direction says ruy teixeira co director of states of change anonpartisan project that studies the impact of demographic trends on elections these are not voters who are protectionist or anti immigrant he represents a type of republicanism or strand of the republican party that they probably like the least what s not clear yet is whether republican leaning voters like those in chester county who plan to vote for clinton this time will stick with democrats down the road some of this is peculiar to trump but i do think that trump s success reflects the way the bases of the two parties have changed says political scientist alan abramowitz of emory university the 2016 race may accelerate long term trendsthat are reshapingthe historic perceptionof democrats as the party of blue collar workers and republicans as the party of white collar workers especially at the presidential level now republicans are the party of the white working class abramowitz says meanwhile lisa cromley 53 a middle school english and history teacher shops at the farmers market andthen drops by a democratic campaign storefront around the corner i am so concerned about trump that i don t know where to begin she says then ticks off a list i m concerned that he doesn t know any issues he s not a politician he doesn t have a legal background he really has a business background and the business background he has isn t even something that i think translates i m concerned about his attitude toward most of the people who make up our pluralistic nation our multicultural nation i m concerned that he doesn t think before he speaks she picksup a yard sign and a bumper sticker for clinton hoping the public displays of support willencourage voters who may be reluctant to support her buti try not to talk to people about this campaign cromley adds it s so
