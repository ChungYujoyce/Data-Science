 jul 30 2019 at 5 58 am a fivethirtyeight chat filed under 2020 election welcome to fivethirtyeight s weekly politics chat the transcript below has been lightly edited sarahf sarah frostenson politics editor it s hard to believe it s been a month but the democratic primary debates are baaack and on tuesday and wednesday evening 20 candidates 10 each night will take the stage with one potentially big new showdown elizabeth warren vs bernie sanders on the first night and one big rematch kamala harris vs joe biden on the second night for reference here s tuesday s lineup bernie sanders elizabeth warren pete buttigieg beto o rourke amy klobuchar marianne williamson john delaney john hickenlooper tim ryan steve bullock and wednesday s joe biden kamala harris cory booker andrew yang juli n castro tulsi gabbard michael bennet jay inslee kirsten gillibrand bill de blasio so yes let s talk about the lineups and matchups but first let s also take a step back to talk about the role of primary debates how do they change the race nrakich nathaniel rakich elections analyst i think it s clear that debates can change the race but the effects might be fleeting as after one debate the race might move in one direction while subsequent debates might push things in a different direction natesilver nate silver editor in chief debates also tend to ramp up in importance as the campaign goes along it might feel like we ve been covering this race forever but we re still in the rather early stages as far as voters are concerned julia azari julia azari political science professor at marquette university and fivethirtyeight contributor i think i might have a slightly different take on this than nate my sense based on the research is that the debates will produce diminishing returns as opinions become solidified but that might apply more for minor candidates than for contention between major ones like harris and biden though there s still a notable big name recognition gap between the two nrakich i m with julia on this one in 2016 the first democratic primary debate had the highest ratings natesilver but in some sense the purpose of these early very inclusive debates is to see if any of the minor candidates can break through which didn t really happen after the miami debates although you could argue the case for castro i guess sarahf castro was interesting his favorability numbers shot up but he didn t really see as much of a swing in support or at least that is what we found in our poll with morning consult nrakich but castro is a great example of someone for whom the debates could build on each other to increase his support he got people s attention in the first debate maybe with another good moment this week he ll start to get their support or at least get enough backing to clear the third debate thresholds natesilver i m skeptical that castro is likely to break through i mean shouldn t we take the opposite lesson from the first debates in fact that you can have a good debate and it doesn t help you break through because the top of the field is pretty entrenched nrakich we didn t say he was likely to though just that the possibility existed he s already at 130 000 donors the threshold for the third debate in large part due to his first debate performance natesilver i guess i m just saying that i think people are maybe underestimating how much voters like the top tier candidates when they say they expect a middle tier candidate to break out julia azari what we ve seen so far leaves me questioning whether the top tier is really open to newcomers at this point i think there s contention over who will be in that second tier of candidates who meet the requirements for the fall debates but most of those candidates won t come close to winning the nomination sarahf or maybe even making the next debate this might be the last time we see many of these candidates on stage because september s qualifying thresholds will be difficult for them to meet candidates must have at least 2 percent support in four recent qualifying polls1 and 130 000 unique donors 2 natesilver there are a lot of middle tier candidates so what are the odds that at least one of them will break into the top tier at some point in the race maybe fairly high let s say it s 60 percent just to make a number up but that 60 percent is divided between a lot of different candidates sarahf ok so as to this top tier vs middle tier debate let s look at night one and unpack some of the dynamics there as a reminder night one includes sanders warren buttigieg o rourke klobuchar williamson delaney hickenlooper ryan bullock so given the lineup there s potential that some of the more moderate candidates say buttigieg o rourke and klobuchar maybe try to position themselves against warren or sanders right and that can maybe help them break through to the top tier or at least make the top tier look less fixed julia azari yeah can a middle tier candidate move up seems like the unofficial slogan of night one sarahf more so than night two julia azari i think so but i reserve the right to flip flop if one of you convinces me nrakich agreed and in fact i d pay even closer attention to the lower tier candidates hickenlooper ryan bullock delaney they know that this is their last chance to make a splash before the third debate s stricter thresholds and they all have little love for sanders s socialism warren s progressivism i think they will lash out pretty hard julia azari and in fact i might convince myself to flip flop because of the timing if buttigieg o rourke or klobuchar has a strong performance say on the level of castro last time and emerges as the official biden alternative for the heartland moderate or whatever don t me i think there s still a strong chance that something else happens on night two that overshadows it nrakich i also think the potential for sanders warren fireworks is overrated despite their ideological similarities they aren t really competing for the same bloc of voters warren supporters are more likely to be higher income or have a college degree while sanders s support is more working class natesilver i strongly disagree with rakich on the sanders warren lanes thing sarahf nrakich natesilver sarahf finally the two in house nathaniels fighting julia azari i m just here for the ratio natesilver but ok i don t think looking at the characteristics of sanders s current voters is the right way to go about it because he s lost a shit ton of support since his last presidential run roughly two thirds of his supporters from 2016 have gone to other candidates we know that because he got more than 40 percent of the vote then and is now polling in the mid teens and a lot of those voters probably went to warren probably some went to buttigieg biden etc too nrakich indeed according to an emerson poll conducted earlier this month 25 percent of sanders s 2016 voters still support him but 20 percent now support biden 15 percent support warren and 9 percent support harris natesilver i m just saying sanders has already lost a lot of the voters that he was gonna lose to warren maybe he lost most of them at the start of the cycle and then a few more as she s gradually gained ground the voters who are still with sanders now might be fairly lukewarm on warren but that reflects a type of selection bias they re the ones who haven t defected to warren yet nrakich i take your question nate and i agree with you generally that sanders needs to go on the attack more but that doesn t necessarily mean he will especially when he and warren are reportedly good friends natesilver friends schmends people are trying to win the presidency sarahf and what does that mean for the debate does sanders have an incentive to go hard on warren natesilver sanders probably maybe definitely needs some of warren s current voters to have a shot at the nomination it doesn t necessarily mean he needs to go after her though which could fairly easily backfire his staff at times has seemed a little prickly about warren maybe they thought it was sanders s turn he was the second place finisher last time after all but she s the one who seems to have momentum and whose chances the media is taking more seriously but again that doesn t necessarily mean it s a good look for sanders to go after her i m not sure what he d even say exactly he has at times tried to emphasize his electability vis a vis warren a strategy that i think is a bit dubious nrakich i feel like that won t win him a lot of friends among people who already don t like the way he treated the last woman he faced in a primary natesilver he has sometimes tried to act like he was the og democratic socialist and she s stepping on his turf which i don t think is a particularly compelling message either julia azari one thing i want to note about warren and sanders is how we media voters everyone understand what goes on within parties in a nomination contest because you essentially have two people competing who have somewhat different approaches to their shared ideological lane so is this competition about candidates and their personalities or is it about which approach gets to bear the standard for the economically left wing of the party it s kind of remarkable that we re seeing public contestation at this level not just between factions but within them nrakich i definitely think it s a competition of personalities not ideologies i think a lot of elites who support warren really don t like sanders because of his revolution rhetoric and somewhat ornery personality sarahf what are some other dynamics we expect on night one do we think tactically speaking it makes sense for the other candidates to position themselves against the front runners i e warren and sanders natesilver i think it makes sense for klobuchar to push back against them nrakich yeah i think it makes a lot of sense for the moderates like klobuchar hickenlooper and delaney to set themselves up as a foil against sanders or warren julia azari the smart move for klobuchar o rourke buttigieg is to try to emerge as the leader of that pack i think if we conceptualize the nomination as a process of coalition building there s potential for klobuchar to build on her status as a woman a midwesterner and a pragmatic candidate but the staff stuff may have sunk her i don t know natesilver klobuchar might actually have a shot at the nomination i m not sure i care what delaney does though nrakich delaney should be at center stage nate did i do that right natesilver i don t think you can troll effectively with delaney it s not like yang or williamson where there s something inherently trollish about their candidacies sarahf and steve bullock while i don t think he has a shot at winning the nomination could still be an interesting addition at the very least he wasn t in the first debate so voters won t have heard him make his case yet nrakich yes bullock is a strong candidate on paper two term governor of a red state and he has some institutional support in iowa unlike some of the other lower tier candidates you can see a path to the nomination for him however faintly but i would guess that virtually no one has heard words come out of his mouth so this week will be big for him julia azari bullock also has anti establishment cred from being excluded from the first debate will anyone care i don t know as someone writing about party legitimacy i m way into watching that unfold natesilver overall the moderates would rather be on the stage against biden no nrakich yeah i think so nate but with sanders they ll still have material to work with sarahf is the idea here it s better to be on a stage where you can show what you have in common with someone who s polling better than you rather than showing how you re different julia azari yeah i think this debate might be a good test of whether it s good for these kinds of candidates to be on a stage with the front runner in their lane or if it s better to go up against the front runner not in their lane to establish themselves as the main alternative nrakich i think it s just because you can make the most effective attack on biden in person as harris showed and if it lands you re likely to be the beneficiary natesilver i think a lot of the moderates need biden to implode to have a shot so you d rather just be on the stage with him so that you can benefit directly from him imploding it s harder if you have to count on a parlay of you doing well in one debate and then biden doing poorly in the other debate but somehow none of the candidates from the other debate get credit for dismantling biden sarahf ok on to night two reminder the stage is biden harris booker yang castro gabbard bennet inslee gillibrand de blasio nrakich all of the nonwhite candidates are debating on this night i find this fascinating also biden sharing the stage with them is fascinating harris and booker in particular have shown that they are eager to attack biden on racial justice issues sarahf right and we ve got the potential for a rematch on our hands what are the non probabilistic odds you think that harris and biden spar again nrakich high and i think biden will be readier for it or at least he should be he has no excuse now natesilver i think harris biden round 2 is fairly likely to be the headline that emerges yeah sarahf my bet is that booker joins the headline largely because as nathaniel mentioned earlier he s also taken biden to task on issues of race booker also is a pretty strong debater i think natesilver could harris in theory rely on booker to be the more aggressive one and try to remain a bit above the fray i m not saying it s a good strategy or a bad strategy but it s one she could consider biden is still very popular with democrats and she doesn t necessarily want to alienate his voters julia azari i think that s definitely a possibility and a strategy she could consider the dilemma with tackling biden s record on race is that candidates may want to do it as long as something like reparations isn t pinned to them when the general election rolls around not saying this is right or wrong morally or strategically but i do think it s a calculation and to some degree i think that s sorta the larger dilemma of this primary i m really liking the word dilemma today leaning into it how does one compete fiercely in this kind of field without alienating the supporters of other candidates sarahf and as we ve talked about before if biden were to falter both harris and booker have some chance of benefiting from supporters switching to them instead so it will be a fine balance between weakening biden while not alienating his base too much nrakich fwiw i think harris s attack in the first debate was excellent precisely because it conveyed respect to biden while also totally destroying him sarahf yeah she even started her attack by saying how much she respected biden natesilver ohhhh i don t really think it conveyed much respect i mean it wasn t out of bounds but saying you respect someone as a rhetorical strategy is only loosely correlated with actually conveying respect julia azari i m not sure about the respect thing either but i think it was a great piece of political theater and there s some evidence that debates are good for changing people s impressions of how viable or electable a candidate is harris perhaps helped people envision her on a debate stage with trump nrakich i have no idea if harris actually respects biden but it s about how people interpret it and i think she managed to land a devastating attack in a way that didn t come off as mean so i don t think it alienated anyone but the most diehard biden fans who think he is above reproach harris s unfavorable rating went up just 1 4 points after the debate according to our tracking poll so few voters seemed put off by her approach sarahf ok let s wrap top line what will you be looking for on tuesday and wednesday nrakich it s kind of a boring answer but i ll again be looking to see if any of the middle or lower tier candidates have a moment that earns them a burst in support otherwise it s going to be the same old cast of characters on the september stage and you ll probably see multiple people drop out note that may happen anyway natesilver i d be interested in if o rourke buttigieg and or klobuchar explicitly play to the center klobuchar seemed reluctant to do that in the first debate julia azari the four things i ll be looking for are 1 movement among top tier candidates 2 the porousness of the top tier i e can anyone else get into it 3 who is competing against whom e g what lanes emerge and 4 what issues emerge as the ones that will define the primary race because how the candidates link themselves to and prioritize issues might give us a sense of how fault lines will emerge
