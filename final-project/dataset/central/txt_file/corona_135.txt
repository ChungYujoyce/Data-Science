today s five selected stories cover shifting u s values in a pandemic a canadian profile in leadership history lessons about navigating financial hardship challenging misinformation with an african song and what nature teaches us about resilience i have a soft spot for the drive in movie my first glimpse of that big screen magic came on a tropical summer night as a 4 year old in pj s peering out the back of our ford station wagon my first date with the girl in high school who became my wife was to a drive in movie my daughters and their friends grew up loving the premovie picnic and pickup soccer before settling in for a double feature now this almost forgotten american pastime is seeing a renaissance people are desperate to get out in some states it may violate the spirit of shelter in place but one florida drive in owner argues that your car is really an extension of your living room many open air theaters have closed their concession stands to uphold social distancing rules in queen creek arizona schnepf farms just put a movie screen on a tractor trailer in a field to help replace its lost wedding and festival business at 15 per carload the new 60 car drive in has sold out every night since opening two weeks ago the popularity caught us by surprise mark schnepf told kpho tv in phoenix it shouldn t have really for me the drive in represents family bonding a silver lining to this tragic pandemic is that a new generation is being introduced to a unique community event and getting to experience the childlike anticipation that builds as the sun slowly sets and the air fills with a chorus of crickets and the perfume of popcorn link copied the coronavirus may not significantly alter the course of history but it will likely change how we live our lives and what we value as a society as america continues to fight the coronavirus it seems increasingly likely that when we look back the pandemic of 2020 will be a time when the world changed in sudden and profound ways it will affect everything from where we live and work to how we communicate with others and even what counts as patriotic service if there s one thing the covid 19 pandemic is almost certain to shift into hyperdrive it s the movement of more and more of our activities online but reliance on digital connection will also leave many behind life in american cities may not be the same many urban areas have been shrinking for decades the pandemic may accelerate this movement as people flee to the perceived safety of open spaces the nation s sense of what constitutes patriotic service may change after covid 19 which demonstrated that not all heroes wear camo it is everyday americans from doctors and nurses and emts to grocery workers and delivery drivers who are putting their health and lives at risk to protect and provide for everyone else as history professor margaret o mara says great crises can change the rules of the game and people s attitudes about political possibility really fast as america continues to fight the covid 19 virus it seems increasingly likely that when we look back the pandemic of 2020 like 9 11 and the 2008 financial crash will be a time when the world around us changed in sudden and profound ways it will affect everything from where we live and work to how we communicate with and relate to others and even what counts as patriotic service worthy of the nation s salute that does not mean the post coronavirus world will be different beyond recognition the pandemic will not change the basic direction of history so much as accelerate it according to richard haass president of the council on foreign relations the importance of the united states to other nations may decline while that of china increases but that is happening in some form already our screen time may skyrocket along with reliance on zoom facetime and other video connectors but that basic trend preexists manufacturers may diversify suppliers to create redundant globalized production chains but far sighted managers have pushed this for some time nor are coming changes completely predictable the influenza epidemic of 1918 turned the world upside down and ravaged the u s population what followed was not a new seriousness of national purpose but the roaring 20s a free spending decade remembered today as one of the shallowest eras of american life editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall but crises can shake up the status quo they override tendencies toward inertia open room for the consideration of new ideas and push aside past impediments the ideas for the big government programs that became the new deal had been bouncing around u s politics for years before franklin roosevelt became president says margaret o mara a professor of history at the university of washington in seattle it took the shock of the 1929 stock market crash and the onset of the great depression to make them law great crises can change the rules of the game and people s attitudes about political possibility really fast dr o mara says if there s one thing the covid 19 pandemic is almost certain to shift into hyperdrive it s the movement of more and more of our activities online the most obvious of these changes are occurring in the midst of the outbreak as tens of millions of people struggle to keep up some semblance of their old routines virtual schooling is now part of the curriculum for many of the 124 000 plus u s schools affected by a coronavirus shutdown for instance in the past many school systems have resisted widespread online learning or found it difficult to integrate into existing lesson plans now they have little choice but today s basic diet of zoom lectures and student show and tells don t fully reflect what online education can do say its advocates for instance a more sophisticated integration of virtual and live instruction could help high schools match the achievement gains primary education has made in recent years meanwhile telemedicine is exploding right now doctors are still struggling with such basic questions as how online health care fits into existing billing practices but in the future it could allow much greater collaboration among diverse team members and health organizations and of course online ordering of everything from soup to bolts is for many people the new normal related to this acceleration of the digital is the increasing importance of big tech to the national welfare if this moment in history is the moral equivalent of war are microsoft amazon google facebook and twitter emerging as the new arsenals of democracy as gm ford and chrysler did during world war ii after all bill gates shed of his corporate responsibilities at microsoft is increasingly outspoken about fighting all manner of health crises amazon is america s delivery backbone facebook is the new radio the way an isolated society communicates and receives news president donald trump turned to a google division to construct a website for locating covid 19 test sites though that hasn t progressed much so far the tech companies are really part of this now says dr o mara author of the recent book the code silicon valley and the remaking of america this could mean a significant shift in big tech s image dr o mara notes until recent years silicon valley has largely ignored politics as well as any concerns about the more unsavory aspects of its impact on society then tech itself became a political headline with mark zuckerberg hauled before congress to defend facebook policies on issues such as data sharing and election security it became very clear that tech was not only not adequate to address some of our most complicated social problems but that it was not changing the world in the right way says dr o mara then america was struck by a grave public health threat whose effect on society is unmatched by any crisis since world war ii and perhaps could surpass even that for its sheer breadth leadership at the top of government with some exceptions has struggled to meet the challenge the economic fallout will ripple through every sector of the economy devastating some such as airlines hotels and restaurants the only sector that may come out of this with more money in the bank is tech says dr o mara with their global workforces and global reach tech firms are uniquely situated to provide moral leadership and a global perspective she says yet their preexisting problems remain worries about the privacy of personal data and the little checked spread of false information it s also important to remember that a continuing digital revolution will leave many people behind laptops and wi fi connections are expensive many low income families can t reliably connect for telework or virtual education some 42 million americans and a quarter of all rural residents don t have access to broadband internet according to a recent report frombroadbandnow research life in american cities may not be the same after the coronavirus recedes at the least things probably won t return to anything resembling the old normal for a long time many urban areas have been shrinking for decades as their populations migrate to inner ring suburbs and more distant areas it s possible the pandemic will accelerate this movement as people flee to the perceived safety of larger open spaces some wealthy americans packed up and left new york and other central cities for second homes or hotels in the hamptons or the catskills or on cape cod a percentage of these may not return if their work and family situations allow similar dispersions may happen elsewhere around the globe say some experts we may now be witnessing the outlines of a new and necessary dispersion of population not only in the wide open spaces of north america and australia but even in the megacities of the developing world wrote joel kotkin executive director of the urban reform institute in an article in the publication quillette in late march but this may not mean cities per se are set to wither or that their attributes will become less attractive to people drawn to the pulse of urban life the terrible flu pandemic of 1918 did not destroy hard hit cities after all pittsburgh was ravaged as was detroit both thrived afterward the point is that no pandemic in history and many have been worse than covid 19 has been enough to derail the force of urbanization says richard florida an urbanist and professor at the university of toronto s rotman school of management and school of cities the clustering of people clustering of ideas and trading with one another have made the world a more productive and innovative place what the coronavirus will do is reshape the way people work and interact in cities at a micro level for a midrange period of time until a vaccine is able to bring it under control says dr florida it s hard to anticipate exactly what these changes will be he says people may be worried about returning to city offices and taking mass transit so it s possible they will opt to live in center cities and walk or resume driving to work creating more traffic congestion small businesses will look different with restaurant tables placed farther apart hair salon chairs dispersed or divided from one another and so forth children will return to very different schools dr florida predicts with temperature checks at the door and social distancing in the lunch room other changes that he believes will need to take place before cities reopen for business include retrofitting airports convention centers and other infrastructure for screenings and personal separation and financial support for arts and cultural institutions that help provide urban areas with vitality we have to prepare our communities our playgrounds our arenas to get up and running safely dr florida says in the post pandemic world some types of urban areas might do better than others los angeles a big world class city built around the concept of sprawling neighborhoods of single family homes could benefit from people s desire to insulate themselves in a bit of space so could smallish cities that offer some cultural amenities but are close enough to bigger places to serve as a type of satellite one example of this might be hudson new york up the river from new york city people can experience different degrees of density despite living in the same city based on their relative wealth and class dr florida says about a third of the workforce nationwide is wealthy enough to afford extensive deliveries of food and other staples and to carry out much of their jobs through telework another third is composed of blue collar workers who stock the produce aisles drive delivery trucks and otherwise are at risk on the pandemic front lines the last third are poor people who have little choice but to hunker down yes the richest of the rich can jet to their second or third homes moving to physically distance themselves from any health threat but could they actually root themselves in their chalets if they have school age children they might not find local educational options attractive in any case the isolation they see as a buffer might be illusory rural health care options are often limited and rural counties with attractive recreational amenities such as the ski slopes of colorado have had a high per capita incidence of covid 19 dr florida points out coronavirus refugees have also sparked fear and resentment among those who live in rural areas full time in one infamous incident on the maine island of vinalhaven a group of locals cut down a tree on march 27 in an attempt to forcibly barricade several new jersey residents inside the home they were renting dr florida says such conflicts could become bitter if they pit states against states one of the things that worries me is these border battles in general he says the nation s sense of what constitutes patriotic service may enlarge and change after covid 19 for years many of america s red white and blue rituals have centered on celebrating the military there s the honor guard for the national anthem the f 22 flyovers for home openers the line of greeters saying thank you for your service to the troops disembarking at airports for leave it s meant to honor people who have agreed to risk their lives to protect the larger community some of it derives from the memory of the vietnam years when protesters in a bitterly divided u s turned their backs on veterans and worse but not all heroes wear camo in the coronavirus pandemic it is everyday americans from doctors and nurses and emts to grocery workers and delivery drivers who are putting their health and lives at risk to protect and provide for everyone else hopefully we ll have maybe a more inclusive sense of patriotism after the pandemic says mark lawrence schrad an assistant professor of political science at villanova university and author of vodka politics alcohol autocracy and the secret history of the russian state dr schrad says he s come to this conclusion a roundabout way one of the things he teaches his students about is nationalism and a part of nationalism he says is constructing the we that defines the nation against the them that stand outside it patriotism is one aspect used in building that we but in the current situation the them isn t the soviet union or al qaeda or humans at all it s amorphous and as dangerous to our geopolitical adversaries as it is to us dr schrad believes that if the nation is in such a new place maybe it needs a new kind of patriotism election monitors serve the country and in wisconsin recently working amid the pandemic bravely so teachers serve the community and now so do ups drivers and postal workers and agricultural field hands and hospital orderlies and a whole range of people whose jobs require them to continue to work with others despite the dangers and lockdowns maybe grocery workers will be honored at halftime during nfl games when the league restarts maybe the nurses of community hospitals will march at the front of small town july fourth parades but even before then we can all start thanking them for their service they didn t sign on for this dr schrad says the coronavirus crisis is certainly bringing us closer together in some ways but also pushing us apart technology has ensured that everybody remains booked at least everybody who has high speed internet and wants to remain connected to friends and relatives zoom this zoom that it s the book club on mondays conversations with grandmother on tuesdays then the parents group and the church rummage sale committee that doesn t even include all the work related videoconferencing isolation has never seen such togetherness noted sherry turkle a professor of the social studies of science and engineering at the massachusetts institute of technology in a recent appearance on the public radio show on point online communication has long meant trying to present our best selves pictures cropped and filtered subjects curated to make our lives look as exciting as possible but the new online look is more of a human experience all of us striving to maintain the authentic connections developed in real life according to dr turkle author of reclaiming conversation the power of talk in a digital age but online meetups can be exhausting it s hard to say no excuses to avoid online chats are more limited than for getting together in real life and there s something about them that is just more restrictive they can t really duplicate the full experience of personal connection and real life conversation has more to it there are things you can t duplicate via video screen there are subtle pauses looks being quiet together without saying anything dr turkle calls these communication extras friction in this sense friction refers to the messiness of politics of the dinner table the intimate conversation the playground the public square when the pandemic is over we may come out of it not hooked on the ease of transferring all our conversations to the infosphere but missing and honoring the small glitches and unspoken connections that real life entails empathy requires conversations with friction says dr turkle editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall partisanship is part of canadian politics but the pandemic has brought newfound unity our reporter looks at the premier of ontario who epitomizes how a crisis can inspire leaders to rise to the occasion while the pandemic is serving as a super sized object of partisanship in the united states canada is striving for consensus it s a unity that s not immutable but officials at all levels have put aside politics to address the coronavirus no relationship demonstrates that better than that of ontario s premier doug ford to his opponents mr ford has battled teachers over cuts to public education cut toronto s city council in half during municipal elections and raged against the federal government s carbon tax to address climate change in march his government didn t appear to take the coronavirus seriously before schools spring break he told families to travel and have fun but as the risks of the pandemic grew mr ford shifted his stance at his daily press conferences he speaks plainly and defers to the health experts surprising critics and prompting their praise in return marie henein a high profile defense attorney in toronto has written op eds both for and against mr ford today she sees his change as an antidote to a larger problem in north america and beyond somehow acting without evidence and acting contrary to information is viewed as being authentic she says but evidence based leadership is not contrary to strong powerful and decisive leadership his political foes on the left labeled him donald trump of the north not entirely accurate but ontario premier doug ford has been known as a brawler the government spent most of this academic year battling with teachers over cuts to public education it cut toronto s city council in half during municipal elections which was decried as undemocratic mr ford has raged noisily against the federal government s carbon tax to address climate change in march his government didn t appear to take the coronavirus seriously before spring break he told ontario families to travel and have fun but as the risks of the pandemic grew mr ford shifted his stance he still rails but now it s not against political rivals but at price gougers or at no one in particular saying the buck stops here about ontario s lagging behind on testing for example at daily press conferences he speaks plainly and defers to the health experts on the stage surprising critics and prompting their praise in return editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall canada s deputy prime minister chrystia freeland of prime minister justin trudeau s liberal government told the toronto star that she and mr ford have come to describe one another as each other s therapists andrew weaver former green party leader of british columbia tweeted while i can t say i have historically been a fan of fordnation i have to say he is doing an incredible job on the covid 19 file he has shown strong decisive and compassionate leadership at a critical moment in ontario s history the media arguably his biggest foe have earned his praise and they ve given it right back while the pandemic has generated a bitterly partisan divide in the united states with protests over lockdowns that president donald trump has appeared to endorse canada has strived for consensus that unity is not immutable and stressors have already built up but many canadian politicians have put aside politics to address the threat of covid 19 and no relationship demonstrates that better than that of mr ford to his opponents his government came into office being completely obtuse about criticism just completely unwilling to listen to people and doing things almost belligerently because they could says tim abray a political communications expert in ottawa and i think that tone has disappeared mr abray says premier ford has always been a street level politician with a skill for talking to people even if foes failed to see it the thing i m pleasantly surprised about is that he s making the most of his grassroots ground level political instincts while at the same time paying attention to expert advice as citizens rally around leaders approval ratings generally go up in a time of crisis and this pandemic is no different although president trump s approval has gone down to 43 according to a gallup poll an angus reid institute poll in march showed 74 of respondents in ontario saying the provincial government was handling the crisis well over the weekend canadian protesters calling for an end to lockdowns in toronto did get a scathing rebuke from mr ford when he called them a bunch of yahoos marie henein a defense lawyer in toronto has not been a fan but in the april 9 opinion pages of the globe and mail she penned a piece describing her new uncomfortable reality it is not easy to heap praise in his direction she wrote in fact 18 months earlier she wrote a warning to the ontario premier about bullying so here is your final lesson mr trump is not a good example to follow do not forget premier ford we are canadian and inherently decent to a fault the rough and tumble populist appeal to which you apparently aspire has long term negative consequences for the country today she says that as mr ford has listened to experts speaking authentically and with empathy in a crisis she has come to gradually shift her view and sees his change as an antidote to a larger problem with politics in north america and beyond somehow acting without evidence and acting contrary to information is viewed as being authentic and i think what is important is really to remember that that is very much contrary to what effective leadership is she says evidence based leadership is not contrary to strong powerful and decisive leadership mr ford has been a voice for cooperation across the political aisle in the ontario legislature he told politicians in march now is the time to put politics aside no matter what our political stripe we must all be team ontario and team canada a survey by the media ecosystem observatory reflected consensus at the national level showing no differences along party lines in views on distancing measures or the seriousness of the threat of covid 19 while mr abray cautions that politics will return and break some of the consensus he says that canada still has room for bipartisan friendships like that of mr ford and ms freeland even if in recent years more partisanship has crept into canada s system cristine de clercy a political science professor at western university in ontario says that canada is smaller than the u s and has a unique political structure that marries federalism to a parliamentary system because the premier or the prime minister sits among the legislators with the cabinet that creates a very top heavy executive dominant political system which in normal times we complain about but in times of crisis can act quickly and efficiently she is cautious about defining mr ford s leadership at this early stage mr ford released a roadmap monday for ontario s economic reopening to mixed reviews still grappling with among the nation s highest infection rates ontario is currently under a spotlight for funding cuts and low wages that have made long term care facilities particularly vulnerable along with quebec ontario requested that canada s armed forces be sent into nursing homes to reinforce care mr ford choked up last week during a daily press conference saying we can do better when it comes to covid 19 hitting long term care homes he also revealed that his mother in law who is 95 and lives in a home has tested positive but what i would credit him for is that he followed the lead of other leaders like mr trudeau in terms of accepting input from his science and health policy advisers and paying rapt attention to their predictions about the seriousness of covid says professor de clercy is that a low bar on the normative question should he listen to his scientific advisers of course one presumes political leaders ought to especially in the case of a pandemic but empirically we know that many have chosen not to she says many american governors still are refusing to listen to their scientific advisers to force citizens to isolate to shut down key industries editor s note this story was updated tuesday morning april 28 studying past economic crises can help us to navigate the current downturn in this video

naturally look to their civic leaders for solutions in the united states that is true except for one institution that has had to do far more starting in mid march the federal reserve decided to go beyond its mandate as america s central bank in ensuring adequate job growth and safe inflation with its ability to take on debt more than 4 trillion in recent weeks it launched unprecedented programs to rescue both wall street and main street from the loss of customers and investments caused by the mass lockdown the fed s motive was clear people are undertaking these sacrifices for the common good we need to make them whole said fed chairman jerome powell in early april we should be doing that as a society they didn t cause this their business isn t closed because of anything they did wrong they didn t lose their job because of anything they did wrong it turned out however that the fed s sentiment toward making americans whole led to a decision to help others achieve the same with much of the world reliant on the u s dollar for international commerce the fed also had to deal with a panic in global financial markets all at once in march both individuals and governments were seeking economic safety by trying to buy greenbacks long the world s most stable currency the panic was like a bank run one with potential blowback on the american economy the global dash for cash hit a record according to the institute of international finance in addition the financial consequences also threatened to hurt the struggle against the coronavirus in many countries that couldn t pay their bills on the world stage the federal reserve was suddenly seen as indispensable on march 15 it opened up swap lines with 14 foreign central banks this allowed them to inject additional dollars into their economies allowing a currency liquidity that would help quell financial fears but that was not enough later nine more countries were given access to dollars by march 31 many more countries were included in a special program to let them repurchase dollars with its great advantage as keeper of the preferred currency the u s had to recognize its responsibility to the rest of the world today much of the world economy still faces a severe slowdown yet the financial panic is largely gone the fed s decision to be an emergency backstop for the world not just for the u s was critical by

promise god made to jacob that truly applies to us all i am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest for i will not leave thee genesis 28 15 contrary to how it may sometimes seem time spent alone can be a time in which we feel anything but lonely when we glimpse how god never ever leaves us we can start to feel quite connected with god and centered in divinity s pure goodness it s actually impossible to distance oneself from our divine source god is always fully present to begin to acknowledge this even just a little bit makes us feel so much less alone a friend of mine just returned from working several months in antarctica she had very little contact with the outside world when i asked her what inspired and comforted you when you felt isolated she cited a line from hymn 278 in the christian science hymnal pilgrim on earth home and heaven are within thee p m adapt csbd it helped her realize that as she put it i didn t have to be in my home in north america to feel loved connected comforted or safe wherever i was god s love and the home god gives me were already there recognizing this spiritual reality gave her purpose each day while also providing comfort and a sense of god s abiding love christian science reveals that god who is divine spirit creates and consciously maintains each of us not as mortals but as immortal spiritual individuals safe in god monitor founder mary baker eddy explains in her book science and health with key to the scriptures infinite space is peopled with god s ideas reflecting him in countless spiritual forms p 503 it is such a joy to learn that it is in this oneness with divine spirit that we actually reside as spirit s ideas we are without isolation infection or insufficiency since these traits could never be in the divine source that we reflect it s beautiful and powerful to glimpse how the essence of spirit is expressed in us as god s creation we each exist to show forth god s love wholeness intelligence purity joy whether in person online or simply in the solitude of quiet communion with god since these divine qualities are present and active in us we can t be the least bit separated from their divine source i ve also been inspired to realize that as the ideas the spiritual offspring of spirit we are always with one another spiritually mary baker eddy puts it this way where god is we can meet and where god is we can never part the first church of christ scientist and miscellany p 131 yes there is no parting from god s love companionship or endless goodness a desire to open our eyes to the holy
