donald trump is the first president in american history to run for re election after having been impeached we should expect his second presidential campaign to be as singular as everything else in his still astonishing political career has been there is another sense however in which his second campaign looks very familiar externally speaking trump is an ordinary incumbent president who should enjoy all the benefits traditionally associated with such a position despite the warnings of economists earlier this year there has been no recession his approval rating is about even with barack obama s at this point in his first term his party appears more united behind him than it has at any point since his inauguration including the confirmation of brett kavanaugh to the supreme court no republican defections are expected during his senate trial though it is possible that a handful of democrats may vote against his removal from office meanwhile several recent polls show him ahead of his democratic rivals nationally is this what having been impeached is supposed to look like trump s rhetoric on the campaign trial will be familiar to his supporters and his detractors alike he will insult his enemies and rail against the corruption of national institutions technically under his authority including our intelligence services he will weaponize immigration and insist that his impeachment was illegitimate but he will also be able to produce a list of actual accomplishments among them some that democrats would be foolish to discount despite having spent a third of his term under divided government and subject to an endless series of hearings and investigations that ultimately culminated in impeachment he was able to renegotiate nafta earning the approval of major labor unions who also approved of his shuttering of the trans pacific partnership he signed a sentencing reform bill that has already brought about the release of thousands of inmates from our prisons one that will probably go down as the most significant piece of criminal justice legislation since the clinton administration whose legacy it will largely undo he cut taxes for millions of working families he eliminated the individual insurance mandate the least welcome provision of the affordable care act while preserving the expansion of medicaid which continues to be favored by everyone save for a handful of right wing governors he spared us a war in syria and tore up a feel good nuclear deal with iran that had done nothing to check the regime s atomic ambitions he took the world historically important if largely symbolic step of meeting in person with the north korean dictator he has begun the long painful process of remaking our unbalanced trade relations with china at home wages are increasing for the first time since the great recession and the unemployment rate in state after state is historically low there is only so much here that trump s opponents will be to explain away it is a truth universally acknowledged by politicians of both parties that unfavorable economic indicators are always the fault of the president currently in office while good ones are the delayed result of wise decisions made by the previous administration but what about the new trade deal the process that led to the u s mexico canada agreement was undertaken entirely on trump s own initiative stalled for months and only reluctantly approved by his opponents in the middle of impeachment proceedings countering trump s vicious rhetoric should be less important to democrats in 2020 than figuring out a way to argue that his campaign is lacking in substance it will not be easy want more essential commentary and analysis like this delivered straight to your inbox sign up for the week s today s best articles newsletter here how social conservatives traded causes for clich s we should be grateful for good news in georgia a predictable catastrophe in michigan brazil s bolsonaro accepts little blame for his country s covid 19 disaster but he wears a face mask trump denies wanting to move the republican national convention to his doral resort citing ballroom size trump insults marine veteran rep conor lamb calls him an american fraud
