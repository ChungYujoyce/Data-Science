7 min read hong kong reuters earlier this summer carrie lam the chief executive of hong kong submitted a report to beijing that assessed protesters five key demands and found that withdrawing a contentious extradition bill could help defuse the mounting political crisis in the territory the chinese central government rejected lam s proposal to withdraw the extradition bill and ordered her not to yield to any of the protesters other demands at that time three individuals with direct knowledge of the matter told reuters china s role in directing how hong kong handles the protests has been widely assumed supported by stern statements in state media about the country s sovereignty and protesters radical goals beijing s rebuff of lam s proposal for how to resolve the crisis detailed for the first time by reuters represents concrete evidence of the extent to which china is controlling the hong kong government s response to the unrest the chinese central government has condemned

affair lam s report on the tumult was made before an aug 7 meeting in shenzhen about the hong kong crisis led by senior chinese officials the report examined the feasibility of the protesters five demands and analyzed how conceding to some of them might quieten things down the individuals with direct knowledge said in addition to the withdrawal of the extradition bill the other demands analyzed in the report were an independent inquiry into the protests fully democratic elections dropping of the term riot in describing protests and dropping charges against those arrested so far the withdrawal of the bill and an independent inquiry were seen to be the most feasible politically according to a senior government official in the hong kong administration who spoke on condition of anonymity he said the move was envisioned as helping pacify some of the more moderate protesters who have been angered by lam s silence the extradition bill is one of the key issues that has helped drive the protests which have drawn millions of people into the streets of hong kong lam has said the bill is dead but has refused to say explicitly that it has been withdrawn beijing told lam not to
