spaces here are the most likely ramifications of this palin development loading march 12 2013 yes sarah palin is writing a book about christmas the former alaska governor has inked a deal with harpercollins to produce a happy holiday is a merry christmas scheduled for november release the semi memoir will include details of palin christmases past while criticizing the over commercialism and homogenization of christmas according to a publisher news release this will be a fun festive thought provoking book which will encourage all to see what is possible when we unite in defense of our faith and ignore the politically correct scrooges who would rather take christ out of christmas ms palin said in a statement released by her publishers as you might imagine this development has led to an explosion of comment in america s social media spaces given the unrestrained nature of electronic communication much of this discussion has been less than profound it ranges from sarah supporters chanting 2016 2016 to opponents expressing gratitude that something will soon fill empty remainder bins at the remaining brick and mortar barnes noble stores calm down everybody neither nirvana nor the apocalypse has arrived let s run through the most likely ramifications of this fizzy development christmas won t change conservatives such as bill o reilly have been railing against the war on christmas for years it s a fox news staple once fall wanes a quick search for war on christmas books produces a lengthy list including john gibson s the war on christmas how the liberal plot to ban the sacred christian holiday is worse than you thought published in 2005 yet over commercialization starts earlier every year retail chains have become ever more dependent on holiday season shopping palin might have better success sparking a political revolt against the war on thanksgiving squeezed between halloween candy and costume sales and black friday shopping sprees the simple family turkey dinner of yore is truly endangered palin s not coming back she s always been right here some pundits are putting two and two together and getting political comeback palin s got a new book coming out and she s been given an extra long speaking time at this week s conservative political action conference could it be time for a mini comeback you betcha writes daily beast d c bureau chief and veteran washington pundit howard kurtz no and can we stop with the you betcha it s funny when tina fey does it you re no tina fey palin is one of the most polarizing figures in the history of modern us politics her positives are high and she has millions of excited supporters but her negatives are really low and she has tens of millions of excited opponents who love to read bad things about her like how she screwed up the story of paul revere s ride she didn t run in 2012 because she would have lost she won t run in 2016 because she would still lose she s got stiff competition from rep michele bachmann among others for the role of gop folksy firebrand she is what she s been since the end of the 2008 campaign a celebritician or polebrity if you will she combines conservative political positions with personal fame to advance both ideological positions and the palin brand mr kurtz writes that palin does need a bigger platform than twitter or facebook if she s going to get back into the cultural relevancy game great call when you find a bigger platform than facebook we ll open an account if only she d signed on with newsweek oh right palin lost her speaking gig on fox news because she s not impressive as a commentator she got an extra long spot at cpac because she s great at giving set speeches end of story it s all about the wilsons the highest denomination of us currency ever printed was a 100 000 bill featuring the portrait of woodrow wilson though only issued for a few months in 1935 the wilsons illustrate our point that besides whatever ideology motivates palin this is mostly about making money it does not mean she s desperate the very funny alexandra petri writes in her washington post humor column christmas books are like christmas albums they are not things you make and announce in march when your career is going anywhere good not true bob dylan issued a christmas album in 2009 although we don t know when he announced it he s not exactly kenny g get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox as the associated press story on the palin book notes the terms of her contract were negotiated by washington lawyer robert barnett what it does not say is that mr barnett is the most insider establishment blue chip book attorney in the nation s capital he s negotiated lucrative deals for everybody from bob woodward to a then little known lawmaker named barack obama that means palin will be making a hefty sum probably via a lucrative holiday speaking tour as well as pure book sales that s the barnett way link copied get
