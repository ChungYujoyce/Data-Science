 by eugene kiely posted on december 8 2016 president elect donald trump again discounted the possibility that russia was behind the hacking of u s political organizations including the democratic national committee s servers despite evidence to the contrary all 16 government intelligence agencies and at least three private security firms have independently investigated the security breaches and concluded that the russian government in the words of the u s intelligence community directed the hacking to interfere with the us election process trump made his statement during a nov 28 interview with time magazine which named the president elect its person of the year in the interview which the magazine posted to its website on dec 7 trump said of russia i don t believe they interfered russia has denied any involvement trump nov 28 it could be russia and it could be china and it could be some guy in his home in new jersey trump s latest comments are similar to those he made during the second presidential debate they now come as some in congress are seeking to conduct congressional investigations into the security breaches and russia s role in them so we ll look at the evidence that exists that ties russia to the hacking of the dnc s servers it was first reported on june 14that hackers had gained access to dnc servers the dnc announced that it had learned of the security breach six weeks earlier and hired the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike to investigate shawn henry ceo of crowdstrike told msnbc that it discovered two separate intelligence efforts by the russian government or operating on behalf of the russian government the next day crowdstrike co founder dmitri alperovitch provided details of the firm s work in a blog post on its website he reported that crowdstrike immediately identified two sophisticated adversaries on the network cozy bear and fancy bear he wrote that both adversaries engage in extensive political and economic espionage for the benefit of the government of the russian federation and are believed to be closely linked to the russian government s powerful and highly capable intelligence services crowdstrike was able to identify the two hackers because the methods and techniques that they used to attack the dnc servers and cover up their electronic tracks were similar to past cyberattacks carried out by cozy bear and fancy bear alperovitch wrote that china was among the past victims of cozy bear and fancy bear undermining trump s claim that china may have been behind the attack malware programs used in the attacks were similar topast attacks by these same groups as were the techniques and methods used to hide their electronic tracks on june 20 the washington post reported that at least two other cybersecurity firms fidelis cybersecurity and mandiant conducted independent reviews of the security breach and have seconded crowdstrike s conclusion washington post june 20 based on our comparative analysis we agree with crowdstrike and believe that the cozy bear and fancy bear groups were involved in successful intrusions at the dnc michael buratowski a senior executive at fidelis saidin a blog postmonday fidelis analyzed samples of the malicious software used in the dnc hack the malware samples matched the description form and function that was described in the crowdstrike blog post fidelis stated in addition they were similar and at times identical to malware that other research firms have associated to these actor sets mandiant a cyber forensics firm owned by fireeye based its analysis on five dnc malware samples in a statement to the washington post mandiant researcher marshall heilman said that the malware and associated servers are consistent with those previously used by apt 28 and apt 29 which are mandiant s names for fancy bear and cozy bear respectively in his blog postthat day michael buratowski senior vice president for security consulting services for fidelis wrote that its independent review settles the question of who was responsible for the dnc attack it was disclosed in august that the democratic congressional campaign committee s servers were also hacked and then on oct 7 wikileaks began to release emails that were obtained from the campaign account of clinton campaign chairman john podesta on oct 7 the department of homeland security and office of the director of national intelligence on election security issued a joint statement saying that the u s intelligence community which includes 16 member agencies was confident that recent hacks into the email systems of the democratic party were directed by the russian government joint statement oct 7 the u s intelligence community usic is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of e mails from us persons and institutions including from us political organizations the recent disclosures of alleged hacked e mails on sites like dcleaks com and wikileaks and by the guccifer 2 0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian directed efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russia s senior most officials could have authorized these activities after the election at a house hearing on nov 17 director of national intelligence james clapper said the intelligence community did not release a statement until october nearly four months after the dnc hack was publicly disclosed because it wanted to have enough evidence before going public with such an allegation against russia we gave considerable thought to diming out russia clapper said with that statement we waited until we felt we had sufficient basis for it and we did both from a forensic and as well as other sources of intelligence that led us to that statement u s intelligence officials have provided little information on how theyarrived at thatconclusion nbc newsquoted an unnamed government official saying that the intelligence officials were able to determine russia s involvement based on the signature of the attacks which hackers may not have realized they left behind seven members of the senate intelligence committee sent a letter nov 30 to president obama requesting more information the letter in full said we believe there is additional information concerning the russian government and the u s election that should be declassified and released to the public we are conveying specifics through classified channels six of the seven are democrats and one sen angus king of maine is an independent who caucuses with the democrats in the house rep elijah cummings the ranking democratic member of the house oversight and government reform committee has called on the committee chairman to hold bipartisan hearings into russia s involvement in the elections on dec 7 cummings said he introduced a bill that would create an independent bipartisan commission to investigate so far the effort to investigate russia has been largely limited to democrats however one republican sen lindsey graham of south carolina said on dec 7 that he would not only join but lead an investigation of russia and its role in hacking into the servers of u s political parties and officials i am going to lead the charge to investigate russia s role not only in the elections but throughout the world graham told cnn i think they re one of the most destabilizing influences on the world stage i think they did interfere with our elections and i want putin personally to pay a price the president elect of course has a different opinion butthe evidence does not support trump s position q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
