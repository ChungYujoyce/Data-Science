i have no hope that donald trump will ever behave like a president of all 50 united states but i ask one simple thing from him and his son please stop trying to get my fellow americans killed it s impossible to keep track of all the norms trump is petulantly stomping on as he runs for reelection amid the highest unemployment rate since the great depression as the american death toll from covid 19 has moved closer to 100 000 he hasfired inspector general after inspector general the only independent watchdogsinside the executive branch his lawyers have argued before the supreme court that this president should essentially be immune from all prosecution and oversight denying taxpayers the right to know whetherhe s even a taxpayer and realdonaldtrump has gone into overdrive with his wild tweets and rhetoric which he has to know could make his more unhinged supporters think he s hoping they ll get violent and someseem to be getting the message detroit real estate agent robert sinclair tesh has beenarraignedon a terrorism charge after he made what authorities determined were credible death threats against michigan gov gretchen whitmer and attorney general dana nessel we can t say for sure whetherthe man behind the alleged threats was a trump fan but he does appear to be a fan of the conspiracy theory known as qanon having used hashtags associated with the movement this arrest ties together two of the most dangerous threads of what rhetoric professor jennifer mercieca describes as trump s argument ad baculum in her forthcoming book demagogue for president the rhetorical genius of donald trump these appeals to the stick or implicit threats of force or intimidation are used by a demagogue to attack and overwhelm opponents mercieca writes trump has literally incited michiganders to rise up against their governor with a liberate michigan tweet that former assistant attorney general mary mccord called illegal and he hascheered on the so called protesterswho ve garnered national attention by flooding into michigan s capitol brandishing firearms something you d never be allowed to do at an nra convention when vice president mike pence is speaking but it s the connection to the qanon movement that s most troubling about this arrest while thereare always oaky traces of a death cult inside the republican party pro lifers fulminating for unnecessary wars and executions the calls to sacrifice american especially older americans to the economy have become audible as the death toll from covid 19 has risen but qanon is a literal death cult it imagines crimes often cannibalism and pedophilia that would justify the arrestand even execution of the president s opponents and enemies and it s also a domestic terror threat according to liberal fake news sources such as the fbi what republicans don t get donald trump is our biggest obstacle to coronavirus recovery either violent people are attracted to this fantasy which originally touted trump as anall powerful crusader bound to take down international child sex rings and now seems more interested in spreading covid 19 misinformation to justify trump s panoply of failures orindividuals who are into q just happen to enjoy making criminal threatsor killing a family member with a sword of course the big joke of all thisis that trump is the guy who started a teen beauty pageant and several former contestants said trump walked in on them while they were in various states ofundress and the one big name child sex offenderthis administration has arrested former trump playmate jeffrey epstein died mysteriously in the custody of trump s department of justice an unresolved crime that stinks of a real conspiracy still the deluded qanon cult chugs on as an implicit threat on trump s behalf and the president has rewarded itsfealty with at least 131 retweets anyone paying any attention knows that when donald trump jr makes a joke about former vice presidentjoe biden being a pedophile he s trying to tickle the death cult bone of his dad s fan base and when don jr pretends to back off by then reiterating the charge he s showing that he haslearned his daddy s i m not saying i mjust saying rhetorical trick of paralipsis mercieca says that s what demagogues use to circulate rumors and accusations to ironically say two things at once and to build a relationship with supporters i get the desperation the trumps best attempt at digging up foreign dirt on biden resulted in impeachment and the revelation that biden was actually leading the international community s efforts to fight corruption in ukraine they haven t found any attack on biden yet that tanks him the way they smeared a woman for using personal email and older voters are telling pollsters that they may be abandoning trump maybe because they ve heard that some republicans think they should stop complaining about covid 19 and start dying trump impeachment intimidation weaponized twitter feed die hard fans who get the code this is all bound to get more intense as trump feels the risk of losing the one job in the united states that prevents him from being indicted the question is how many people the trumps are willing to take downwith them the president s steaming rhetoric may have influenced his superfan cesar sayoc who was convicted of mailing bombs to 13 trump opponents including hillary clinton barack obama and joe biden the only thing thatsaved us from thistrump fan carrying out one of the worst terror attacks in american history was his incompetence but as trump s election proved competence isn t necessary for success so please mr president stop trying to get us killed covid 19 is bad enough on its own jason sattler a writer based in ann arbor michigan is a member of usa today s board of
