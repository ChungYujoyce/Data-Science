us work said one sign taped to a vehicle liberate virginia said another the anti lockdown protests began in lansing michigan and spread to madison wisconsin this weekend last week s rally in richmond offers a flavor of the frustration there were elements of a trump rally but the purpose went beyond supporting the president bringing together like minded people to call for a change was good to remember we re not alone noted a facebook post a recent yougov yahoo news survey found that 60 of respondents oppose the protests virginia governor ralph northam a democrat says the protests aren t going to influence him but the rally s organizer isn t expecting to go away i wanted this protest to be one and done he says but that s not going to be the case one side of east broad street looked like many downtown roads across covid 19 america empty sidewalks locked restaurants a handful of cars but last wednesday the other side of the richmond street the lanes leading to the virginia statehouse had 12 blocks of bumper to bumper honking cars with passengers waving posters out of sun roofs the noise was so loud it was hard to hear anyone from three feet away much less the social distancing guideline of six it was a protest calling for the reopening of america s economy one of many such demonstrations in state capitals in recent weeks most are drive by only to stay within the new distancing of the covid era it s time to let us work reads one sign taped on the side of a vehicle liberate virginia says another the state is not god reads a third editor s note as a public

wisconsin in the latest installment the richmond protest offers a window into the mounting frustration and the motivations of those turning up to demand an end to lockdowns overall the american public does not appear to support the protesters a yougov yahoo news survey conducted from april 17 to 19 found that 60 of respondents opposed protests aimed at ending sheltering in place republicans as a group did not support them either a plurality of 47 of gop respondents thought they were a bad idea according to yougov opponents note that cases of the novel coronavirus haven t peaked in many places making the lockdown restrictions essential many also charge that the protests have been partly organized by conservative business interests but many attendees interviewed at gridlockrichmond on april 22 seemed genuinely frustrated with the lockdown we have a right to life and liberty and the government can t infringe in that in the purpose of keeping us safe says marisa nance a mother from nearby glen allen virginia who circled the statehouse in a gray van with liberty is essential written in scrolling cursive across the back window this is a great opportunity to demonstrate to our kids what we ve always taught them as citizens we are responsible ms nance adds perhaps unsurprisingly in today s polarized america this general frustration blended with an array of political issues that are important to the right from supporting president donald trump to anger about gun control measures giving the protest an overall air of a maga rally we asked people to not fly the trump flags that we just wanted to open virginia says david britt one of the rally organizers but then he adds laughing people are going to do what they want to do mr britt who works in a mental health facility in fairfax virginia was growing more and more frustrated with the state s stay at home lockdown after governor ralph northam in mid april extended it until at least june 10 but it wasn t until the anti lockdown protest in lansing that mr britt started thinking about organizing something similar in virginia after a conference call with other interested friends and groups he created the facebook group reopen virginia which soon grew to almost 400 members in some ways the resulting protest resembled a maga rally not just in appearance but in effect like mr trump s raucous gatherings it seemed to become a visible way for like minded conservatives to feel part of a larger movement after it was over participants left comments and posts on facebook groups run by reopen virginia to the effect of was so great to see everyone yesterday and was good to remember we re not alone still at the rally itself many protesters didn t cite support for the president among their reasons for protesting they talked about friends who are struggling to pay their bills or their kids who are struggling with learning from home the rules seem unfair and arbitrary says jenny karnes who drove almost six hours roundtrip from her home in roanoke virginia to participate in the protest after learning about it from her cousin on facebook you can go to walmart target gas stations and it s like nothing is happening with these big chain stores but yet the hairdresser and small business owner have to shut down says ms karnes it s not fair for the others who don t have a choice virginia shouldn t have the same guidelines as a hotspot like new york say protesters blanket restrictions for the state neglect economic anxieties and constitutional liberties they added we should look at places individually even northern virginia shouldn t be treated the same as us out here says melissa hipes a protest participant from the small town of greenville in western virginia the devastation on the economy is going to end up being far worse than the virus vycki midgette is a nurse from the eastern shore of virginia who joined the 337 member facebook group virginians against excessive quarantine at the invitation of a friend she thought the group could benefit from a nurse s perspective she thinks the lockdown should continue as long as it takes to guard virginians safety my right to live is more important than your right to assemble says ms midgette who voted for mr trump in 2016 and plans to support him again in 2020 so far governor northam a democrat appears to agree with that assessment he s said the protests did not influence him in recent days he s extended the time that state department of motor vehicles offices will remain closed among other things last friday he released a plan for beginning to open some businesses in early may if new covid cases and hospitalizations decline for 14 days mr britt of reopen virginia says he is not deterred get the monitor stories you care about
