to normality the united states has seen its highest death tolls to date in the epidemic with roughly 2 000 deaths a day reported for the last four days in a row the largest number in and around new york city even that is viewed as understated as new york is still figuring out how best to include a surge in deaths at home in its official statistics graphic tmsnrt rs 2w7hx9t public health experts have warned the u s death toll could reach 200 000 over the summer if unprecedented stay at home orders that have closed businesses and kept most americans indoors are lifted when they expire at the end of the month most of the curbs however including school closures and emergency orders keeping non essential workers largely confined to home flow from powers vested in state governors not the president nonetheless trump has said he wants life to return to normal as soon as possible and that the measures aimed at curbing the spread of the covid 19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus carry their own economic and public health cost speaking by telephone with fox news on saturday evening trump said he would make a decision reasonably soon based on the advice of a lot of very smart people a lot of professionals doctors and business leaders he said instinct would also play a role people want to get back they want to get back to work we have to bring our country back he said trump s trade adviser peter navarro told fox news that purist medical professionals who took the position that the only way to minimize loss of life was to shut down the economy and society until the virus was vanquished were half right he said that will minimize the deaths from the virus directly but added that economic shocks also killed people through higher depression and suicide rates and drug abuse so that very tough decision this president is going to be making is to have to weigh the balance and figure out which path does more damage in new york the state s governor and new york city s mayor engaged in a fresh squabble over their efforts to combat the virus in what is now the global epicenter in this instance over how long schools might stay closed the state was sometimes slower to impose social distancing curbs than elsewhere notably california while new york s two most powerful officials both democrats sometimes disagreed over matters of jurisdiction and the best terminology for certain measures they have not appeared in public together since march 2 on saturday morning mayor bill de blasio declared that new york city s public schools would no longer reopen on april 20 but stay closed for the rest of the academic year saying it was the right thing to do new york governor andrew cuomo however later used his widely watched daily news conference to dismiss the mayor s edict as merely an opinion and say he would make his own decision on school closures the current federal guidelines advocating widespread social distancing measures run until april 30 trump who is seeking re election in november will then have to decide whether to extend them or start encouraging people to go back to work and a more normal way of life trump has said he will unveil a new advisory council possibly on tuesday that will include some state governors and will focus on the process of reopening the economy the number of americans seeking unemployment benefits in the last three weeks surpassed 16 million as weekly new claims topped 6 million for a second straight time last week the government has said the economy shed 701 000 jobs in march that was the most job losses

mostly featured services livestreamed or broadcast to worshippers at home with many churches already short of funds untouched collection plates at a usually busy time of the year add pressure on their finances a handful of holdout u s churches planned to hold in person services on easter sunday saying their right to worship outweighed public health warnings but there have been glimmers of hope dr anthony fauci the government s top infectious disease expert and other health officials have pointed to falling rates of virus hospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units particularly in new york state as signs that social distancing measures are paying off the stay at home orders imposed in recent weeks across 42 states have taken a huge toll on commerce and raised questions over how long business closures and travel curbs can be sustained the trump administration renewed talk of quickly reopening the economy after an influential university research model cut its u s mortality forecasts to 60 000 deaths by aug 4 down from at least 100 000 assuming social distancing measures stay however new government data shows a summer surge in infections if stay at home orders are lifted
