washington one of the flowersrepresentskenialeon s mother an immigrant from cuba who worked in school cafeterias for 20 years leon s mother was one of those people who talked to anyone and everyone leon 39 of las vegas remembers a caring woman petronila leon who was known as mery volunteered with after school programs to help support the students beyond the lunchroom her daughter said but in april leon s mother died dueto complications from covid 19 as leon and other family members also suffered from the virus since the outbreak first began in the united states at least 82 000 people have died from covid 19 and many epidemiologists say that number is much lower than the actual death toll due to shortages of testing and people not seeking care in a hospital setting to memorialize the lives lost while also drawing attention to what critics have said is an inadequate response to the virus by the trump administration moveon a progressive advocacy group placed thousands of white roses in front of the u s capitol on wednesday while playing video of president donald trump praising federal action on the virus very sadly the u s has become the epicenter globally of the coronavirus and by far the most deaths in the world are here saiddavid sievers the campaign director of moveon while that s tragic that s also not an act of nature it s a result of decisions that have been made and unfortunately mismanagement and botched efforts or a lack of response leon said her mother first got sick in late march days later she was in an intensive care unit and her family could no longer speak with her leon suffering from covid 19 as well andalmost hospitalized herself said she and her family relied on a daily call from staff on her mother s floor i think that s the hardest part kind of waiting for a phone call leon said you try not to think about it but you also think about it leon s mother died april 10 but it wasn t until may 8 that her family was able to hold a memorial due to social distancing restrictions leon is not alone as many people hoping to bury or memorialize loved ones who died from covid 19 have been forced to delay their plans sievers said the lack of a national mourning was part of the impetus for the demonstration wednesday the roses in front of the capitol aim to capture the feeling of empathy many have given each other during the pandemic as well as the deaths sievers said but that stands in sharp contrast to the words and actions oftrump he added the demonstration outside of the capitol also comes after protesters in recent weeks have stormed state capitols to show their opposition to stay at home orders in states like michigan photos showed protesters congregating in their capitols in some cases armed with rifles in efforts to sway governors to reopen their economies sievers said the protest outside thecapitol is different because organizers worked to ensure everyone stayed six feet apart and large crowds weren t formed he also called it a false dichotomy to compare the protest to those in the state capitols we want americans to be able to have jobs too but ithink the real question is whether we re going to recover once and recover safely and that s done by having a science based loosening of safety measures he said leonsaid seeing people laud the united states efforts and push for reopening without doing so safely sparks unbridled anger in her when i hear the word success it triggers in me this sense of what s happening right nowis genocide thatthe people that are dying are expendable leon said noting that people of color have died at disproportionate rates from the virus follow usa today s ryan miller on twitter ryanw miller
