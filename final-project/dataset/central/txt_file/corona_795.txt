medical officer of the american foundation for suicide prevention a variety of stressors including job loss poor health self isolation and quarantine and general anxiety and uncertainty could negatively impact mental health some people may also be struggling with existing conditions such as substance use disorders or depression but people are resilient said vaile wright a clinical psychologist and researcher at the american psychological association we can adapt she said we can get through this here are some strategies for coping normalize any intense uncomfortable emotions you re having right now said joan cook a clinical psychologist and yale school of medicine associate professor who studies traumatic stress don t judge yourself if you feel mild anxiety or depression loneliness boredom frustration or anger this is an unprecedented time for all of us she said and there are a lot of unknowns while it s important to ground ourselves by remembering to count our blessings and be grateful for our lives and any privileges we have it is equally important for us to acknowledge that social distancing quarantine or isolation is hard cook said and know that you are not alone in finding the consequences of social distancing like losing our jobs or being physically distanced from family and friends also very difficult give yourself credit if you are following the social distancing directives of federal state and local health officials cook added it s important that we give ourselves the recognition when we do a good job she said you re reducing the possibility of transmitting the virus and protecting those who are most vulnerable you may be out of a job or working from home but you still need to mind your basic human needs establish a routine wright said get enough sleep get dressed in the morning take a shower and eat a healthy diet exercise she added even if it s just by going outside for fresh air build structure into an otherwise loose day by scheduling all of these needs moutier said mental health is not only critically important to pay attention to during covid 19 for its own sake moutier added but because the brain is connected to the body how well we re managing our mental health will directly affect our physical health for example things even like the strength of our immune system stay in connected with friends and family through phone calls text messages facetime aapl 0 44 video calls and social media we all need to put in extra effort right now wright said if you are struggling with tough emotions reach out to the most trustworthy person in your life to share how you re feeling moutier said that simple act could be a game changer laughter and play are critically necessary during this time moutier added moments of humor might be harder to come by right now but try to prioritize them if you lack an existing social support system now is the time to go out and find connection with others even if you don t know who they are wright said seek out online support groups or social media communities related to your interests after all social distancing is actually physical distancing moutier said socially we can remain even closer stay informed about the pandemic especially at your local level but try to get off your devices too wright said find the bit of the news that either empowers you or doesn t drive up your anxiety she said wright for example has found that tv pundits and twitter twtr 3 51 tend to make her more anxious absolutely do not read the news or check stuff before going to sleep she added the federal government has expanded access to telemedicine in response to covid 19 as have some states if you are in therapy or mental health treatment make sure that you continue it and ask your provider specifically if they re providing video chat or telehealth moutier said if you believe your mental health is deteriorating seek help there s evidence that shows that telehealth can be as effective as in person treatment in many instances she said the present situation could be a tipping point for not just acceptance for telehealth but also removing the barriers to it around reimbursement and access wright said look for an app that has scientific backing as well as mental or behavioral health experts who served as subject matter experts wright said understand the app s privacy policy and where your data might go and look through the reviews experts praise the department of veteran affairs line of health apps which includes apps for ptsd coping and mood boosting is your anxious mind racing at 100 miles per hour theresa nguyen the chief program officer for the nonprofit mental health america suggested the mental heath technique of grounding grounding is a technique to use your five senses and just bring your attention to the present moment she said it s very effective because your mind can only think about one thing at a time if you re gardening for example put your hand in the soil and just focus on that touch whatever is around you or try reciting a mantra to yourself and remember to breathe deeply we sometimes hold our breath when we are anxious or working hard which can also exacerbate our anxiety mental health professionals say engage in activities you know will help you feel healthy and centered moutier said whether it s exercise like yoga walking or running or hobbies like reading crafting or music relax yourself with deep breathing exercises not everyone is a nature person but there is a fairly common experience that being in nature is grounding in and of itself she added one hundred percent if you re in crisis call a hotline wright said to access coronavirus related crisis counseling from the substance abuse and mental health services administration s samhsa disaster distress helpline call 1 800 985 5990 or text talkwithus to 66746 you can also reach the national suicide prevention lifeline at 1 800 273 8255 the
