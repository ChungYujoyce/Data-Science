last month criminal justice reform became an issue in the 2020 presidential elections in a manner befitting the trump era through a series of tweets from the president on memorial day insulting his potential democratic rivals trump first declared that anyone associated with the 1994 crime bill the sweeping legislation known for exacerbating mass incarceration was unelectable he then pronounced himself to be responsible for criminal justice reform because he signed the first step act into law even though some of the most ardent supporters of the federal sentencing and prison reform bill say the legislation is but an incremental step trump is of course no reformer one can look at his actions before he became president when he publicly campaigned for the execution of the wrongfully accused and later convicted central park five or consider that his first attorney general was jeff sessions who rolled back virtually every meaningful reform effort from the previous administration rather trump is an opportunist who is taking advantage of the void left by the current crop of candidates who have failed to discuss criminal justice reform on the campaign trail in a meaningful way senator cory booker of new jersey has been by far the most vocal about the need to reform the system and senator amy klobuchar of minnesota published an op ed describing some of her policy ideas other candidates have weighed in on single issues but by and large criminal justice reform has been cabined off to a question at the cnn town halls about whether people who are currently incarcerated should have the right to vote answer they should the lack of engagement on this issue by 2020 candidates is shown starkly in an interactive piece that the washington post published in april the post listed 15 broad topics such as healthcare economic inequality and climate change along with criminal justice and measured the candidates share of words on social media posts about each of the topics of the 15 issue areas 13 had at least two candidates devote a double digit percentage of their social media posts to the topic the only two issues that did not meet this low threshold were infrastructure and criminal justice read more commentary joe biden reduced murders reformed criminal justice policy and made america safer criminal justice reform is great but where s the data to show us whether it s working criminal justice reform we can improve expensive ineffective system by lowering recidivism these numbers likely have changed since april but overall those running for the highest office in the country are underestimating the importance to the electorate of reforming the criminal justice system just look at recent polling from the battleground state of ohio which shows that 64 of ohioans overall including 78 of democrats and 68 of independents believe that the criminal justice system needs significant improvement moreover 70 of democrats and 60 of independents believe too many people are in prison while only 24 and 26 respectively think there are too few or about the right number or people incarcerated against that backdrop it remains unclear why so few candidates are talking about criminal justice reform perhaps they don t consider mass incarceration to be a crisis even though there are nearly 7 million people locked up in prisons and jails across the country or otherwise supervised by the system for context that s the size of los angeles and houston combined or maybe candidates think the criminal justice system grew naturally because more people committed crimes but they do not realize that national crime rates are near historic lows and the system s expansion is the result of deliberate policy choices to criminalize more behavior and to do it in a harsher fashion it could be that candidates don t talk about criminal justice because they don t see the connection with other traditionally major policy areas like the economy but mass incarceration has been a key driver of poverty that has led to depressed physical mental and social outcomes especially for children and especially african american children growing up in distressed communities thus criminal justice reform can and should be considered an important tool for social mobility perhaps candidates are listening to the wrong people or at least defining relevant stakeholders too narrowly the conventional approach has been for politicians to consult mainly with judges prosecutors and law enforcement on public safety and criminal justice matters but candidates must recognize and learn from victims and survivors people who have been incarcerated and their families the expertise of those who have been impacted by the system must be valued as much as if not more than those who work to maintain it criminal justice reform must be integral to the candidacy of anyone running for elected office instead of merely a wedge for trump to exploit candidates need to develop substantive policy platforms and cast a vision for how they are going to address the crisis of mass incarceration it s an issue voters care about and one for which candidates will be held accountable if they take it for granted
