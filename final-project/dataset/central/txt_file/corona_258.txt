 may 16 2020 topics taleon diegues shutterstock may 16 2020 to face them we need new definitions of security and a global approach covid 19 is not a black swan for years foresight expertshave been warningabout the potential emergence of a pandemic while public health experts have been calling the attention of the international community to the dangerous security impact of globaloutbreaks the novel coronavirus is however a canary in the coal mine the pandemic is the harbinger of a security landscape marked by the rise of non traditional security threats these challenges will act as threat multipliers further exacerbating existing security dilemmas and the complexity of the 2020s covid 19 is the template for what lies ahead that is unless we take action the sooner we understand the fundamental transformation ahead of us the sooner we can adapt our concepts and institutions to guarantee the safety of people states and the internationalcommunity in many ways covid 19 is a threat foretold as early as the 1970s policy experts have been calling for attention towards a new category of threats their realization as intuitive as it was conceptually novel was that insecurity stems from much more than outright conflict and threats to people s wellbeingcan have security implications for communities and states alike the awareness that there is an indelible yet complexlink between development peace and security caught on unequally in thepolicy world getting the most traction in capacity building and stabilizationmissions the basic idea then and now is that orthodox security frameworks failed to capture a particular novel type of threats they are callednon traditional security threatsand espouse three characteristics first they arestateless born out of a symbiosis of systemic factors they aretransnational whereby their effects spill over borders even if their causes may be localized finally and crucially they havenon military origin traditionally security threats were considered to emerge as a result of the accumulation of military capability and states intentions to change the balance of power by using force today however threats to international security have primarily economic and social causes though they directly lead to loss of life and violence and indirectly to stateinstability subscribe receive daily email updates subscribe to the defense one

corruption fit the bill and of course pandemics these threats are not one off crises they are all part of a broader category of risks which are and will continue reshaping the international system in this light covid 19 becomes the bellwether ofchange when covid 19 hit it presented a stark reminder that insecurity is a global affair as of may 4th in just over 6 months the pandemicaffected215 countries and territories while also showing that non military security challenges can permeate the artificial dividing line between developed and developing countries while historically developing countries were considered to be a fertile breeding ground for such issues due to state weakness and inability to provide public services covid 19 has turned that logic on its head making the impact visible everywhere from sofia toseoul covid 19 can be a bleak template of how non traditional security threats ravage the international system without action we may see in the future a worrying pattern of extensive loss of life compounded subsequent shocks and even outright conflict in 2015 regional events like the migration flow to europe during 2015 2016 from the middle east and north africa wasarguably a key factorin social polarization and the renaissance of the extreme right in places like germany france poland and hungary today the pandemic is leaving in its wake one of the worst economic crisessince the great depression continued levels of low growth combined with high levels of unemployment can be arecipefor rising populism and further political fallout in the new decade in the future the consequences of unmitigated climate change could similarly lead to economic decline resource scarcity and political instability while each of these issues is unique and context specific they will all undoubtedly change the securitylandscape indeed with non traditional security challenges the danger is twofold the immediate ecosystem is the first line of impact causing violence and loss of life for instance the lives of countless civilians are engulfed in the crossfire in countries with an outbreak of criminality however counterintuitively the secondary set of shocks is much more pernicious non traditional threats have wicked downstream consequences leading to economic crises social fragmentation political instability and at the extreme conflict in a word they aremultipliersof existing vulnerabilities both in peaceful and conflictsettings as globalization continues and humans relationship with the environment remains strained non traditional threats are only poised to increase in troubling fashion take climate change on our current trajectory the global temperature isexpected to riseabout 3 2 degrees celsius far above the target of 1 5 degrees one articlefoundthat the risk of climate induced violence is fivefold under a business as usual scenario 4 degree c increase up from the 5 percent average effect over the past century similarly resource scarcity and other diseases transmitted from animals to humans will likely persist as we encroach upon nature s systems through extended unsustainableexploitation the rise of non traditional threats coincides with continued social and economic interconnectedness dwindling investments in social security and expanding geopolitical fragmentation this mix is hollowing out the international system exacerbating existing security dilemmas and leading at best to intractable situations and at worst to disaster to create an alternative future we need to expand our security concepts adapt our institutions and support international state and sub statecooperation first we should develop and implement more holistic concepts and benchmarks for security the coronavirus pandemic has proven yet again that simply defining security as the absence of conflict is not enough researchers should integrate human wellbeing factors into their analytical frameworks at the policy level more collaboration among the development and security communities is fundamental our metrics and indicators should also follow suit capturing nuanced cross field data to assesssecurityor the lackthereof second from an institutional perspective the military need not be primarily responsible for managing the rise of non traditional threats even if they pose security concerns if policymakers focus on addressing these types of threats upstream at their root they can be tackled before escalating into outright conflict with this approach the solution lies in enhancing civil military cooperation and increasing domestic and foreign investments in human capacity building social security healthcare etc finally the nationalist lens through which covid 19 was managed need not be the approach we shouldespouse moving forward global cooperation is essential in managing and preventing non traditional threats since their effects concern broad coalitions of countries actors like the european unionare on the right side of history in making this very case however the absence of the united states from the table should not preclude action there is immense potential for sub state level cooperation building on local expertise and community know how putting people first is the strategic and moral way ahead and the only way to ensure sustainablesecurity subscribe receive daily
