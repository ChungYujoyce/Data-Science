map podcast america interrupted courtney vinopal courtney vinopal as novel coronavirus spreads around the world some u s officials seem to be downplaying the potential global scope and severity of the disease by comparing it to a common illness influenza in a press conference wednesday president donald trump softened the severity of the covid 19 outbreak saying that the virus is a little bit like the flu we ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner he said referring to efforts to develop a vaccine for the disease according to experts like dr anthony fauci who directs the national institute for allergy and infectious diseases it s still likely to be at least a year before a vaccine is ready for human use trump also noted that far more americans die from the flu each year than have been infected by the coronavirus thus far but experts say comparing covid 19 to the flu understates what s at stake it s a confusing tone that the president set said lawrence gostin a professor georgetown university who also directs the world health organization collaborating center on national and global health law he said the world health organization and the centers for disease control and prevention have underscored the seriousness of the virus but trump s comments appear to fluff it off as if it s a common cold nancy messonnier director for the cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases has warned that transmission of the virus in the u s is inevitable that it is not so much a question of if but when so far there are millions of cases of the flu worldwide compared to about 84 000 novel coronavirus cases as of friday afternoon but public health officials warn that there is still a lot they don t know about the new virus including the various ways it s transmitted how pathogenic it might be and how it could alter genetically that uncertainty creates an added urgency to containing the virus and if those efforts fail preparing for it to infect large swaths of the global population here s what we know now about the way these two infections compare in terms of transmission deadliness and scope both the flu and covid 19 are spread from person to person transmitted through respiratory droplets that are formed when these people cough sneeze or talk according to the cdc covid 19 may also be transmitted when people touch surfaces that are infected but this has not yet been confirmed we know these viruses can potentially survive on surfaces depending on the number of hours or days said dr brian garibaldi the director of the biocontainment unit at johns hopkins medicine we don t know yet if it s more likely that you re going to get covid 19 by coming into contact with droplets in the air neither the flu nor covid 19 can be treated with antibiotics garibaldi added that the one way it may be useful to compare covid 19 with the flu is when talking about prevention the method you can use to try to protect yourself from the flu is also going to help prevent you from getting the coronavirus he said practicing good hygiene by throwing out tissues covering your cough and washing your hands will help prevent the spread of both diseases of the 83 652 covid 19 cases confirmed thus far there have been 2 858 deaths according to the world health organization a total of 2 791 of those deaths were within china so far 15 covid 19 cases have been reported in the u s with zero resulting deaths thus far another 47 americans contracted the disease abroad and have been brought back to the u s to be quarantined by contrast the cdc estimates that at least 18 000 people in the u s have died from the flu since october and at least 32 million have been infected globally the flu kills hundreds of thousands of people annually a 2017 study published in the lancet a leading medical journal estimated that between 291 000 and 646 000 people die from seasonal related respiratory illnesses each year nevertheless just because the flu is a more severe threat to americans than covid 19 right now doesn t mean that the virus couldn t grow to become just as or more deadly in the future it s precisely because the flu kills so many people that we should worry about coronavirus we don t want a mass circulating virus that kills that many people gostin said harvard epidemiologist marc lipsitch estimates that between 40 percent and 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes covid 19 gostin said that these sorts of predictions are exactly why we need to take it seriously a recent study estimated that the mortality rate from covid 19 is 2 3 percent more than 20 times the death rate from the flu it should be noted that the vast majority of covid 19 cases confirmed by china 81 percent as of feb 11 are mild meaning they did not involve pneumonia symptoms could be so mild that they are confused with the common cold which is in the same family of viruses as covid 19 health officials caution that the fatality rate is dynamic and will likely change particularly if more mild cases are confirmed and as public health officials collect more data about cases in a growing number of countries there have got to be a lot of infections out there that are not detected just because they are mild if you add another 100 000 people then the rate drops said gary kobinger the director of the infectious disease research center at laval university in a briefing on tuesday dr michael ryan of the world health organization warned against reading too much into high fatality rates as the virus spreads to other countries when asked about iran which recently reported an 11 percent mortality rate ryan said we need to be very careful in the first wave of infections and any newly affected country because we may only be detecting severe cases and the deaths will be over represented in that as researchers work to bolster our understanding of covid 19 that disease currently appears to be more deadly to the smaller swath of the population it has infected in contrast with so many more known annual infections the mortality rate from the flu is about 0 1 percent annually to put the current covid 19 estimates in context the 1918 spanish influenza pandemic one of the deadliest of all time infected about 500 million people and killed more than 2 5 percent of all those infected the fact that there is not yet a vaccine available for covid 19 also makes the threat level different from that of the flu at least for now should the u s see transmission pockets start to form before a vaccine for covid 19 is developed garibaldi said americans could experience fatality rates that are just as severe as china s the chinese health system is fantastic they have all the technology that we do he said there s no reason to suspect that we re going to do better than china if the mortality rate is 1 2 percent left a woman wears a mask on wall st in new york on feb 28 2020 photo by
