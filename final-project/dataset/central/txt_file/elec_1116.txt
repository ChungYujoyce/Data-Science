states o rourke said as his wife amy sat next to himin their114 year old home where more than a century ago mexican revolutionary leader pancho villa met u s army gen hugh scott to discuss stopping mexico s civil war along the border o rourke said he believes the countryis ready for a better more nuanced view of the border than the picture painted by trump whose build the wall slogan helped propelhim to the presidency o rourke points tohis upbringing on the border as anasset in challengingtrump a firsthand perspective and experience from the border is missing from the conversation said o rourke whooften sits at a table on his front porch that has views ofju rez mexico to write makephone callsand doother work trump went after o rourke in comments from the white house on thursday he s got a lot of hand movement trump said i ve never seen so much hand movement i said is he crazy or is that just the way he acts o rourke gained national attention challenging republican u s sen ted cruz he lost by less than 3 percentage points a margin closer than the state had seen in decades the el paso native had notyet given his concession speech when supporters shifted their focus toa more ambitious goal apresidential run o rourke the father of threechildren ages 8 to 12 said he needed time offto spend with his family during the grueling senate race hevisited each of texas 254 counties and traveled across the country for interviews he and amy who have been married nearly 14 years said that in the monthsafter the election they focused on spending time together as a family going to baseball practices and basketball games preparing for science fairs getting homework done hiking inthe franklin mountains andbackpacking in the gila wilderness by the end of january the couple said theybegan to talk about what they would do next election night or even before election night when people were asking about 2020 it just seemedsurreal almost like you re just caught up in the moment amy sanders o rourke said after the election our immediate need was to be together as a family and to really finish out the congressional term whichi know was incredibly important to beto butthen to just like sleep eat healthy and really give our family the attention that we had not had together for a long time she said andso it was hard to even process thinking about what the next steps could potentially be i would say well into january the couple said the decision for o rourke to run was jointly made as they ve made all decisions in their marriage we really want to come to conclusions together and if we can t both get there then we just won t do it whether that s you know having whataburger for dinner or whatever it is beto o rourke said the couplepurposely did not discuss the potential presidential run with their children he said instead theyallowed their children who heard talk of a potential run on the radio and read about it in the newspaper to reach their own conclusions each onedecided that their fathershould run they re excited and i wasn t all the way expecting that to be the case given how hard the last campaign was for everybody o rourke said molly 10 was the first to jump on board i was driving her to school in early mid february and she said you know if dad s going to run for president he better get started because he was already running for senate at this point in 2017 amy o rourke said with a smile o rourke was a prolific fundraiser in his senate race despite swearing off contributions from political action committees hegained a national following after a video of him discussing his support of nfl players who kneel during the national anthem in protest went viral o rourketold the timeshis promise stands to not accept money from pacs corporationsor special interest groups in his run for president o rourke didn tsayhe wouldnot employconsultants and suggested he would usepolls in certain cases i am going to do everything it takes to win consistent with my values i will never employ a pollster or take a poll to find what i believe or what i want to say o rourke said i ll never use a consultant to come up with the words i speak at a town hall or a rally for better or for worse and amy can probably think of some times that it s been for the worse i say what i think and what i believe i have the courage of my convictions and i m also hopefully smart enough to know there s so much more for me to learn and i can only learn by listening to the people of this country they will be my consultants o rourke said his presidential campaign will be headquartered in el paso and those who want to join his team will have to move to the border city he said he would no longer swear off hiringconsultants giving an example of a single mother in the dallas area who was unable to join his senate campaign because it would haverequired her to close her business my preference is to find people who can move to el pasoand work on this campaign full time he said but in order to get the breadth of experience and wisdom and diversity that we really need in a campaign that will look like everyone i want to remain open to different employment situations it doesn t fit on a bumper sticker but it will ensurethat i get the greatest talent possible o rourke hasalready drawn anattack adfrom the conservativeclub for growthin iowa where heis scheduled to go this weekend to beginhispresidential campaignand help iowa democrat eric giddens who is running in a special election for a statesenate seat the ad says o rourke s background is as a privileged white man with a rich father in law el paso businessman bill sanders who helped his political career o rourke said he hadn t seen the adbut that s an unfortunate part of politics that he doesn t favor or use to some degree it s a form of flattery that the attack ad airedeven before heannounced his candidacy he said the only antidoteto that attack ads is to be there and show up and listen to people and answer questions and introduce myself in person he said o rourke didn t promise to visit every county in the usaas he did in texas but hepromised to run a national campaign for everyone i m going to continue to demonstrate that everyone in every state is important to the future of this country and no one can be written off or taken for granted based on where they live or howthey voted in the past or whether they voted at all he said jennifer mercieca a professor at texas a m university who specializes in political discourse said o rourke excels at connecting with votersat his events and delivering emotional appeals that win people over mercieca said people are drawn to o rourke because he comes off as authentic and honest the same reason many trump supporters got behind the president during his campaign part of the reason trump was so appealing was that he was perceived as very authentic mercieca said o rourke also has that authenticity although it s very different than what trump shows us one way of thinking about trump is that he trades in irony he s always being ironic always saying two things at once beto seems like he is always being earnest and that kind of comparison would be interesting to see shannon bow o brien a government lecturer at the university of texas austin said that despite his charisma and ability to connect with people o rourkestill has a strike against him it was close it was extremely tight for texas she said but a loss is still a loss at the end of the day and the party has got to back candidates that you re going to see a success rate on o rourke has clashed with trump over his plans to build a wall along the nation s southern border with mexico since before the 2016 election when the democrat served as el paso s congressional representative the friction between trump and o rourkeintensified in the weeks leading up to o rourke s announcement reaching new heights when trumpmade el paso the centerpiece of his argument for the effectiveness of a border wall trump visitedthe city for his first campaign rally of the year where he pledged to finish that wall o rourkepositioned himself as trump s antithesis speaking at a counterdemonstration to trump s rally trump has been successful in turning the country s focus to the border o rourke told the times and now that the country s watching us let s share with them who we are and what we represent and what the future could look like when we make the most of every single person who wants to contribute before o rourke can challenge trump he will face an intense primary election fight against a large field of democrats the crowded democratic primaryraceincludesvermont sen bernie sanders who narrowly lost the democratic nomination to hillary clinton in 2016 california sen kamala harris massachusetts sen elizabeth warren new jersey sen cory bookerand a fellow texan juli n castro who served as housing secretary under
