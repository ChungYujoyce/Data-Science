sladky ap hide caption a voter in delray beach fla is seen during last month s primary election more voters are expected to request mail in ballots for the august primary and november general election with an election year pandemic mail in ballots may become an increasingly popular way to vote especially in states like florida that allow any voter to use them while those ballots accounted for nearly 1 in 4 of all ballots cast in 2018 president trump this week said he wasn t in favor of expanding the practice during the present health crisis even as he used one himself when he voted presumably for himself in florida s presidential primary last month during the white house coronavirus briefing tuesday trump said i think that mail in voting is a terrible thing and followed up the next day with several tweets calling on republicans to oppose statewide mail voting claiming without evidence that the practice hurt gop candidates and was susceptible to widespread fraud at least in florida i think he s being a little misguided said mac stipanovich a longtime republican strategist in florida who recently left the gop because of trump mail in ballots have also been a key tool in other republican friendly states such as arizona and utah for more than 40 years stipanovich helped republicans win campaigns and come to dominate florida politics absentee ballots he said are typically republicans friends in florida in 2002 florida began allowing anyone who requests a mail ballot to receive one a change stipanovich said republican strategists and campaign managers immediately embraced people recognized that was a mine of gold that you could control he said campaign strategists could figure out who got the ballots contact them and try to make sure they got their

democratic primary election in miami last month mail in voting is increasingly popular in florida and likely to be more so amid the coronavirus pandemic in florida a state nearly evenly divided among republicans democrats and independents elections are often decided by the narrowest of margins in many races both local and statewide mail in ballots have provided republican candidates with the votes to win for many years it was republicans who pushed voting by mail said daniel smith a political science professor at the university of florida who has studied how mail in voting has been used in the state their electorate happens to be older on average than democrats happens to be more affluent smith said of republicans it happens to have a more permanent residency in terms of less transient less mobile population which makes the delivery and return of absentee ballots easier in recent elections democratic campaigns in florida have also begun relying on mail ballots they allow campaign staffers to know who has received a ballot so they can call and encourage the voters to return it campaigns also know when people have returned their ballots enabling operatives to focus their attention on less reliable voters said smith who may not vote in every election and need a little more cajoling to get out to the polls that strategy helped trump narrowly carry florida in 2016 smith said after securing the mail in ballots republicans were able to concentrate on getting their occasional voters out to the polls in florida and elsewhere mail ballots have been involved in election fraud but smith and other experts say it s rare a bigger problem according to smith is the relatively high percentage of mail ballots that are disqualified because they arrive too late or the voter s signature doesn t match the one on file in a study he conducted after the 2016 election in florida smith found the rejections disproportionately affect minority voters and young people with two elections coming up in the next several months a statewide primary in august and the general election in november florida election officials are expecting a surge of requests for mail ballots i think every county in florida is gearing up on that said bill cowles the election supervisor of orange county fla which includes orlando we re also putting pressure on our vendors our mail houses for doing it with the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic democrats and voting right groups have been pushing for an expansion of the use of mail in ballots some republicans including the governors of nebraska new hampshire and ohio have also backed major expansions of mail in voting in response to the pandemic in florida a state vital to both parties presidential hopes this fall elections officials have asked florida s gov ron desantis for more time to mail out and count ballots but they ve also said that it won t be possible to conduct an all mail ballot election this year npr thanks our sponsors
