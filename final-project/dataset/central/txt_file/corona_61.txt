 by lori robertson and eugene kiely posted on may 12 2020 flanked by large signs proclaiming america leads the world in testing president donald trump said at a may 11 press conference we ve prevailed on testing while the united states has done more total tests for covid 19 than any other country it doesn t lead when testing is measured by other metrics at the same press briefing adm brett giroir the assistant secretary for health at the department of health and human services who is in charge of the government s testing efforts said no matter how you look at it america is leading the world in testing let s take a look as he has stated repeatedly trump touted the total number of tests conducted in the u s as being the most of any country in the world this week the united states will pass 10 million tests conducted nearly double the number of any other country he said it s true that the u s by far has conducted the most tests for covid 19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as measured in raw numbers in the press conference giroir showed a graph similar to the one below by our world in data a project based at the university of oxford that demonstrated this as of may 11 the u s had conducted 9 35 million tests the country with the second highest number was russia with 5 8 million tests as of may 12 we d note that our world in data cautions comparisons of different countries may not be apples to apples it notes t here are substantial differences across countries in terms of the units whether or not all labs are included the extent to which negative and pending tests are included and other aspects but the u s has a much larger population than most countries which would make a per capita comparison a better gauge of countries testing efforts as we ve explained before testing a higher proportion of the population increases the ability to control the spread of covid 19 making the per capita metric an important one both trump and giroir cited per capita measures but made misleading claims leaving out countries that have done better than the u s in this regard we re testing more people per capita than south korea the united kingdom france japan sweden finland and many other countries and in some cases combined trump said after giroir showed the graphic on total tests he said if you look at per capita everyone talks about south korea being the standard today we will have done more than twice their per capita rate of testing that was accomplished in south korea no matter how you look at it america is leading the world in testing but he didn t show a per capita graph such as the one below which refutes the idea that the u s leads no matter how you look at it the u s was at 26 31 tests per 1 000 people as of may 9 that s more than south korea but less than iceland denmark italy new zealand switzerland austria australia canada belgium germany russia and spain among others worldometer a data aggregation website listed 39 countries and territories with higher per capita testing rates than the u s as of may 12 south korea used to have a higher per capita testing rate when trump first made misleading comparisons to the country in late march it s noteworthy that the u s did ramp up testing and by april 17 surpass south korea by this measure but the two countries reported their first cases of covid 19 around the same time onjan 20and21 yet south korea began aggressively testing earlier than the u s as this graph shows south korea has been held up as an example as giroir mentioned of how early testing can enable countries to identify and isolate cases flattening the curve while the u s is now doing more testing the two countries are at different trajectories in the spread of the disease line graphs on the number of confirmed cases show the u s on a sharp curve up beginning in late march while south korea s cases spiked earlier in late february and early march and the number remained relatively flat through april economic researchers at the federal reserve bank of st louis noted in an april 22 paper that south korea s early testing seems to have paid off while u s inaction resulted in more confirmed covid 19 cases testing early and often seems to have paid off for south korea the st louis fed researchers wrote the weeks lost due to inaction in the united states during the early stages of the covid 19 pandemic resulted in rationing of tests to those with severe symptoms thus the united states had a large number of confirmed cases relative to south korea another way of comparing countries is by the number of tests each has performed per confirmed case by this measure the u s lags far behind most nations according to our world in data the map below shows that the u s as of may 9 had done only about seven tests per confirmed case far fewer than south korea 61 russia 28 canada 16 and japan 14 for example note the data is updated regularly so use the slider to change the date to may 9 jeffrey shaman an epidemiologist at columbia university s mailman school of public health told us for a previous story that per capita test numbers are not as informative as looking at testing per positive infection identified comparing the u s to south korea for example shaman said they re testing 10 times as many per infection found we downloaded the data for may 9 and found that the u s ranked 59th out of 64 countries in tests per confirmed case as of that date in april the rockefeller foundation issued a testing action plan that called for rapidly expanding testing capacity to 30 million tests per week over the next six months in the u s cnbc april 21 the rockefeller plan says that more testing must be done to accurately capture the level of covid 19 infections in the u s in taiwan there have been 132 tests conducted for every confirmed case in australia the number is 62 in the united states it is five an executive summary of the plan notes as of may 9 the u s has conducted about seven tests for every confirmed case while taiwan has conducted about 153 we can also look at this measure in percentage terms the test positivity rate or the share of total tests that are positive as we wrote recently if a high percentage of tests are positive that suggests only the sickest patients are being tested and mild cases are likely being missed a johns hopkins websiteexplains the world health organization has recommendedthat countries aim for about a 10 test positivity rate to make sure there s enough testing being conducted to detect all cases the u s is now at a 14 2 test positivity rate as of may 11 that s not leading the world either editor s note factcheck org does not accept advertising we rely on grants and individual donations from people like
