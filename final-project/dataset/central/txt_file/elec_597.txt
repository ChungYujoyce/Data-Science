presidential race joshua lott afp via getty images hide caption former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg left and minnesota sen amy klobuchar are throwing their support behind former vice president joe biden in the democratic presidential race updated at 9 40 p m just ahead of the single most important day of the democratic primary former vice president joe biden picked up the endorsements of two former rivals pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend ind who ended his own white house bid sunday night appeared with biden at a barbecue restaurant in dallas monday evening i am delighted to endorse and support joe biden for president buttigieg said biden 77 said buttigieg 38 reminded him of his late son beau earlier monday minnesota sen amy klobuchar announced she is suspending her presidential campaign and would endorse biden standing on stage with biden in dallas klobuchar said a unified party is crucial if democrats want to beat president trump i believe that we are never going to out divide the divider in chief she said biden she said will help democrats win big he will not just govern with his head she said he will also govern with his heart her decision came just one day before her home state is set to vote on super tuesday in total 14 states and one territory will head to the polls tuesday on a day when more than a third of all delegates in the democratic primary will be up for grabs their endorsements could play a key role for biden as the former vice president is trying to coalesce the more moderate wing of the party behind him in an effort head off vermont sen bernie sanders who leads the current delegate count sanders has held sizable polling leads in the two largest states voting on tuesday california and texas but if biden is able to pull in significant portions of both buttigieg s and klobuchar s coalitions his prospects could brighten considerably but the sanders campaign disputes the notion that one candidate s support simply transfers to another like minded candidate i think people are far more complicated in their ideology than pundits like to suggest sanders campaign manager faiz shakir told npr indeed before the endorsement polling seemed to indicate that buttigieg s supporters could split to a number of candidates including a sizable amount to sanders a morning consult poll found that sanders was the second choice for 21 of buttigieg supporters followed by biden and warren with 19 while biden who s second in delegates has lagged behind sanders financially and in national polls in recent weeks he has led the field in endorsements throughout the campaign ahead of the south carolina primary he got a key endorsement from rep jim clyburn exit polls indicated that was a major factor in his decisive win klobuchar and buttigieg sparred often during democratic debates as both candidates strove to present themselves as the best pragmatist option not named joe biden in the end it was biden who outlasted them both biden received another endorsement monday from former senate majority leader harry reid who said he believes biden is the candidate best able to defeat president trump a midwestern moderate drops out sen amy klobuchar d minn at a campaign event in cedar rapids iowa she has ended her presidential bid patrick semansky ap hide caption sen amy klobuchar d minn at a campaign event in cedar rapids iowa she has ended her presidential bid klobuchar saw a surge of momentum and fundraising after a strong debate performance and a third place showing in the new hampshire primary but like buttigieg she struggled to expand or sustain that support as the primary moved into larger more diverse states she finished sixth with just 3 of the vote in south carolina on saturday the senator from minnesota had campaigned heavily in next door iowa she had held nearly 200 events in the state and traveled to all 99 of its counties she ended up finishing fifth there in iowa and elsewhere during the campaign klobuchar often stressed her midwestern roots and more moderate democratic policies she said she was a candidate who was able to get things done and win in battleground areas and she made jokes she often talked about getting big money out of politics by telling the story of her first senate race and how she had so little money that she would call people she d dated to fundraise i raised 17 000 from ex boyfriends she said at a debate last year and i d like to point out it is not an expanding base she also touted several newspaper endorsements including a co endorsement with massachusetts sen elizabeth warren by the new york times an endorsement by the quad city times in iowa and endorsements by a few new hampshire outlets including the union leader in manchester but early in her campaign she also faced questions that took the spotlight off her policy positions and put it onto how she treated her staff anecdotes swirled about hair comb salad forks and flying binders i cried i cried like all the time said one former staffer according to buzzfeed in an interview with npr last march klobuchar argued that voters should not be worried by the accusations she acknowledged that she does push people hard but her campaign denied the specific allegations and argued that she is just a tough boss with high standards klobuchar was one of four senators still running for president while also serving as jurors in the impeachment trial of trump the trial s schedule disrupted the final weeks of campaigning around the hawkeye state with additional reporting by npr s benjamin swasey npr thanks
