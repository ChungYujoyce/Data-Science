it s the sunday after the friday that the deputy attorney general of the u s has been accused of talking about secretly tape recording the president to help preserve the republic and i m sitting in bob woodward s dining room in washington discussing which commanders in chief contended with the most rebellious advisers woodward s latest book fear trump in the white house sold more than 1 1 million copies in its first week partly because it s by woodward who has been reporting this kind of behind the scenes stuff for years and partly because his latest volume includes hair curling tales of top officials working behind the scenes to foil and undermine a president they consider to be unstable still neatly dressed from a television appearance earlier in the morning woodward has welcomed me into his georgetown home poured some coffee added a generous dose of milk and made sure my tape recorder is working o k he says let s get to work so i ask do white house aides leak more and resist more than when you first talked to richard nixon s advisers during watergate 45 years ago woodward thinks back nixon s aides went along they resisted some things but basically they got with the program obviously a lot of trump s aides former and current are not with his program but then he adds the word resistance i don t know if that s the right word i think it s defiance fear lays bare so many shortcomings of trump s decision making that it s hard to contain them trump insists on actions but rarely follows through he has so much trouble telling the truth that his lawyer calls him disabled the president undercuts and insults his aides while expecting loyalty in return instead they call him an idiot and a moron woodward s sources tell him that trump knows little about economics trade capital flows global supply chains defense spending mutual security or nuclear strategy and dismisses anyone who says they do top aides ignore or dismiss trump s orders conspiring to remove decision memorandums from his desk rather than run the risk of letting him sign them much of the internal warfare goes to a clash of two very different world views at the heart of the trump presidency the president a handful of aides and a big segment of the gop base seem convinced that trade and defense alliances are robbing our nation of untold riches and that we are being played for chumps when we help keep the peace overseas allied against them are mainstream republicans economists and a fair number of admirals and generals who believe that the rules based system set up after world war ii has made the nation stronger and invested the american people in shared global security the story of the administration so far is one of trump trying to advance his populist instincts and the establishment head butting back trump is shown to be frustrated but unschooled in how to use the office and its powers in one passage woodward reprints a margin note clearly taken from a speech text in which trump has handwritten trade is bad and though trump never comes out and says that in the speech the phrase is a perfect distillation of what he actually thinks where does that idea even come from it reflects that nationalistic isolationistic instinct he has says the author not only america first but america only for every example of trump aides quietly conspiring to slow things down there are others where it seems to happen organically explains woodward speaking a little cryptically which he has after all earned the right to do some of these people know each other and work together others he says don t at 75 robert upshur woodward doesn t need to keep doing this his status as the best investigative reporter of his generation o k maybe any generation is assured and in writing fear he sometimes asked himself why he kept at it like the night he found himself driving uninvited to a trump official s house at 11 for an unscheduled interview that late night conversation lasted until nearly dawn ours won t go nearly that long today in part because woodward s story is already well known he grew up in illinois attended yale joined the navy served on a ship off the coast of vietnam and then abandoning the idea of law school moved to washington to become a newspaperman the post hired him in 1971 and within a year he and carl bernstein were reporting the watergate break in two years later nixon had resigned while he and bernstein had become world famous fear woodward admits was harder to write than many of his 18 previous books because he was trying to record and make sense of a chaotic presidency even as it was unfolding other books were done in the middle of presidencies he says but not with this kind of intensity woodward has lost little of the midwestern optimism or the fierce objectivity that has marked his career ever curious he seems interested in everything and everyone he still reads proceedings magazine the geeky technical bible of naval officers and yet it is hard to miss the concerned tone in his voice when he reviews the stakes of this moment people need to wake up he has said repeatedly he is worried about what a president with a disruptive bent will do in a genuine crisis and he is aware too that americans by a wide margin don t trust the media he acknowledges that his omniscient narratives based on multiple background interviews may pose a greater challenge for readers in an era of fake news than they did when he wrote about previous presidents that s a reminder that woodward has reported on and written books about all of the past nine presidents a fifth of the grand total late in the conversation we discuss how every president is a prisoner of the one who came before presidents live in the unfinished business of their predecessors he says we know for example that barack obama warned trump about the challenges that north korea poses and fear shows that trump felt obama wasn t up to them but while trump has tried both childish bluster little rocket man and negotiation to meet the same challenges he has yet to unravel the peninsular knot easily the most dramatic passage in fear involves a meeting in the super secure pentagon tank in july 2017 where trump s two white house camps nearly come to blows over what to do about u s troops in south korea both sides walk away exasperated it is hard to imagine how trump unable to make peace among his factions can do a deal with north korea s kim then there is russia fear s final chapters describe how trump s personal attorney john dowd tried for months to talk trump out of testifying to special counsel robert mueller about the russia investigation lest he perjure himself or worse dowd came to believe trump was incapable of telling the truth and would by testifying only risk being indicted woodward reports on the astonishing steps dowd took to keep trump from speaking under oath including role playing a conversation for mueller between his prosecutors and a clueless president dowd says woodward may have opted for the only road to save trump from himself which of course trump does not know how to do by himself when that failed dowd quit and there woodward stops until his next volume appears he names a bunch of top trump aides generals and lawyers and then notes they are all trying to save trump from himself and to save the country
