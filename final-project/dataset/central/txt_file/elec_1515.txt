hillary clinton formidably extended her lead over sen bernie sanders loading march 16 2016 the once improbable prospect of a trump clinton general election showdown just got stronger democratic front runner hillary clinton dealt a crushing blow to bernie sanders s presidential hopes in tuesday s primaries beating him in four contests and leading in the fifth missouri which remains too close to call on the republican side donald trump boosted his front runner status winning the most delegates at stake tuesday and forcing florida sen marco rubio out of the race by handing him a humiliating defeat in his home state but mr trump failed to sweep losing in ohio to the state s governor john kasich it was governor kasich s first win of primary season giving him cause to stay in the race even as he was mathematically eliminated from contention kasich s only hope is for a contested national convention in july where he somehow emerges as a unity candidate for now though trump dominates in the delegate race with 621 of the 1 237 needed to secure the nomination as of early wednesday texas sen ted cruz sits in second place with 396 to reach the magic number of 1 237 before the republican convention in cleveland trump would need to win some 58 percent of the remaining delegates a tough task in a three person race but not impossible a contested convention remains a 50 50 proposition but should trump fall just shy of the magic number the gop will be contesting him at its own peril says republican strategist ford o connell tuesday s results revealed and reinforced several points about the strength of both trump and clinton for trump tuesday s victories came in spite of the front runner s unwillingness to condemn acts of violence by supporters at his rallies which party leaders have urged him to do last weekend trump canceled a rally in chicago after anti trump protesters infiltrated the venue and threatened to shut it down leading to skirmishes between pro and anti trump activists trump went on to win the illinois primary tuesday by 9 points beating senator cruz 39 percent to 30 percent trump supporters are known to back him early and not budge from their position and on tuesday exit polls showed continued popularity for his views some 52 percent of voters said they wanted an outsider for president and of those trump won 69 percent of the vote trump also won the majority of voters who want to deport undocumented immigrants are angry at the federal government favor a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states and are falling behind financially he also won 47 percent of voters who oppose free trade all are impressive results in a multi candidate race writes pollster gary langer in ananalysis for abc news in remarks tuesday night to reporters and invited guests at his mar a lago estate in palm beach fla trump highlighted the millions of dollars of negative ads that his primary opponents and outside groups funded by the republican establishment have run against him to seemingly little effect my numbers went up trump boasted i don t understand it still trump remains a deeply divisive figure in the republican party as tuesday s exit polls showed among republicans who did not vote for him this tuesday night 61 percent said they d seriously consider a third party candidate if it were trump vs clinton in november mr langer notes indeed in another question 45 percent of non trump supporters flatly said they would not vote for him in november if he were the party s nominee the prospect of trump causing a formal split in the republican party seems as real as ever if he goes into the convention with a majority of delegates or close to a majority but party regulars are at a loss over how to resolve the issue advisers to trump and cruz categorically rule out the idea of even allowing kasich to compete in a contested convention according to politico if trump has hundreds more delegates than the runner up almost certainly cruz and he is over 1 000 delegates it will be exceedingly difficult to deny him the nomination write analysts atsabato s crystal ball in fact to do so would be to guarantee a meltdown of historic proportions in cleveland in tuesday s democratic contests former secretary of state clinton beat senator sanders handily in florida ohio and north carolina beat him narrowly in her native state of illinois and fought him to a virtual tie in missouri most important she recovered her balance after losing to the vermonter the week before in a stunning upset in michigan sanders had hoped to continue his rust belt incursion with victories in illinois ohio and missouri with his message of economic populism and opposition to free trade but he failed clinton won big among racial and ethnic minorities as usual but in ohio also won big among white voters a cohort she had lost in michigan among white women in ohio she won 61 percent to 39 percent langer notes clinton found her footing in ohio on issues as well to some extent defanging sanders on free trade she won antitrade voters a group sanders took in michigan langer writes as many saw him as too anti business as saw her as too pro business and four in 10 called his policies unrealistic twice as many as said so about hers in her victory speech tuesday evening clinton pivoted toward a general election message that echoed both sanders and trump repeatedly promising creation of good jobs get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox good paying jobs are the tickets to the middle class and we re going to stand up for the american middle class again clinton said we re going to stand up for american workers and make sure no one takes advantage of us not china not wall street and not overpaid corporate executives still despite a big deficit in pledged delegates sanders is certain to take his fight for the democratic nomination all the way to the party s convention in philadelphia in july he is still drawing large crowds and money is still pouring into his campaign the bottom line rule for candidates in both races is this have money will campaign link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber
