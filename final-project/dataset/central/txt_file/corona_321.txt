kinds of togetherness canadian photographers are capturing that duality with porchraits loading april 3 2020 a new phenomenon is sweeping the photography community in canada porchraits these family portraits often taken on porches are one way of marking the physical isolation that many are feeling right now but they also highlight a renewed embrace of togetherness felt by many families people are together in a way they haven t been in a long time says erik mcritchie a brand photographer in calgary alberta mr mcritchie is part of a network of photographers using the hashtag porchraits to inspire one another to get out and document their communities many of the images are whimsical poking fun where they can one family poses on their porch with rolls of toilet paper around their wrists other photos aremore stark revealing the stillness and solitudeof the social distance era by sharing these images on social media mr mcritchie hopes his work can serve as a buoy for others stuck at home when we see people are celebrating laughing and having fun and families that are together he says it s reminding us of the strength we can find together the children s hands push into the glass pane as the family of five poses behind their front door in some photos family members peer over their fences only their eyes visible many of the portraits play on space and distance each member hangs a head out of a separate second story window for example welcome to a new phenomenon sweeping the photography community in canada porchraits these family portraits often taken on porches are one way of marking the physical isolation that many are feeling right now but they also highlight a renewed embrace of togetherness felt by many families we re living through a unique period of time for all of us says erik mcritchie a brand photographer in calgary alberta people are together in a way they haven t been in a long time that s something families are keen to hold onto judging by mr mcritchie s busy calendar at the middle of last week he had done 25 shoots and had 40 more to go editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall mr mcritchie is part of a network of photographers inspired by one in yellowknife northwest territories who started taking photos of residents through their windows using the hashtag porchraits photographers have inspired one another to get out and document their communities and the practice has started to pop up in the united states though there s a bit of debate over how to spell the new termand they are sometimes called doortraits or isolationportraits many of the images are whimsical poking fun where they can one family poses on their porch with rolls of toilet paper around their wrists even the dog gets one around its paw others dress up in costumes or party attire taking a break from the stress and worry that the coronavirus pandemic has unleashed around the world other photos aremore stark revealing the stillness and solitudeof the social distance era and even today in the midst of it it s easy to see that these collections growing across north america and europe could easily hang on museum walls the way exhibits of stoic settlers of the dust bowl or cities in the great depression do a century later these are really interesting documents at this time says carol payne a professor of the history and theory of photography at carleton university in ottawa while many of the journalistic photographs of the era revolve around barriers adults separated from elderly parents in nursing homes or isolated healthcare workers who can only see their children through windows porchraits give subjects a sense of agency she says and in the end will show how ordinary people coped together they are telling their future selves what it was like to live through what is really an historic crisis professor payne says people are writing their own social histories visually not the history of politicians and nation states but the history of individual people and how they got through it many of the photographers like mr mcritchie aren t making money from it if families can he is encouraging them to donate to a local food bank it s really just trying to take a moment of difficulty and turning it into something positive he says and see if it can be replicated and grown into something bigger jon neufeld s family is the one outside the glass door last week in their residential community in calgary he says they were hamming it up just having a bit of fun about being stuck inside all day it also happened to be the day they were supposed to have their daughter s 5th birthday party instead she dressed up in pink and they ate birthday cake on the front steps mr mcritchie was invited one of four front porch birthday parties he d celebrated that week mr neufeld says it s been fun to see the other portraits posted around social media but collectively it tells a deeper tale the kind of struggle is implicit in the fact that if you look through the collection we re all on our porches we re all on the front steps of our houses he says where we are spending 99 of our time that s posed technical problems for photographers who are more used to scenic backgrounds or studios where lighting possibilities are limitless but through this work mr mcritchie says he has documented something new a family togetherness and a return to slower living when he arrived at one house two little children were sitting at their front window with a campfire they made from cardboard they were pretending to roast marshmallows in between his shoots he s noticed more teens out walking with their parents that s weird right he says before mom or dad would go for a walk and ask you guys want to come and the kids are like no not a chance but now they re out together get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox it s just so easy to be occupied with the negativity right now and any break from that in a positive way is uplifting he continues when we see people are celebrating laughing and having fun and families that are together it s reminding us of the strength we can find together
