the debate to criticize his handling of the officer involved in eric garner s death wednesday s democratic presidential primary debate in detroit was interrupted twice by protesters in the audience who were trying to draw attention to immigration and policing issues the first happened only minutes into the debate which was broadcast live on cnn during new jersey sen cory booker s opening statement a few audience members began yelling fire pantaleo the chant was a reference to staten island n y police officer daniel pantaleo who was involved in the 2014 death of eric garner garner who was black died after being placed in a chokehold by pantaleo who is white police had approached garner suspecting he was illegally selling cigarettes video of the incident which captured garner saying i can t breathe became another rallying point in the ongoing tensions between the african american community and law enforcement it appears the protest burst was actually aimed at new york city mayor bill de blasio who has been criticized for not pushing for pantaleo s dismissal particularly after the justice department declined to bring criminal charges against pantaleo on july 16 de blasio does not legally have the power to fire pantaleo the new york times reports but his handling of the issue has contributed to his low approval ratings from his constituents other city leaders say de blasio who often talks about race issues through the lens of having a biracial son and who touted halting stop and frisk during his own opening statement needs to speak up new york city public advocate jumaane williams told the times that the mayor needs to do something or don t mention eric garner s name ever again you cannot be president you cannot be the democratic nominee if daniel pantaleo is
