president donald trump s tweeted claim on aug 20 that american jews who vote for democrats show great disloyalty provoked disgust and dismay among many jewish commenters in the u s and israel who accused him of invoking a centuries old anti semitic trope trump s tweet came just days after he urged israel to prevent democratic congresswomen rashida tlaib and ilhan omar from visiting the country claiming the progressive lawmakers hate israel and all jewish people on aug 21 he doubled down on his assertion that voting for democrats was disloyal to jewish people and very disloyal to israel in a speech to reporters that also made reference to a right wing conspiracy theorist s description of trump s being beloved to israelis like he s the king of israel or the second coming of god questions of loyalty have a long history as an anti semitic trope having for hundreds of years dogged jewish diaspora communities and foregrounded political persecution in europe in the u s similar claims of dual loyalty provided a pretext for dismissal of jewish american leaders calls for earlier intervention in the second world war which some isolationists saw as principally a jewish cause and as recently as march this year senior democrats rebuked omar over comments many saw as an invocation of the dual loyalty trope in his book we stand divided the rift between american jews and israel on sale sept 10 american born israeli writer daniel gordis explores the roots of the complex relationship between the state of israel and american jews in a conversation with time edited for length and clarity in the wake of trump s remarks gordis discussed how the president has further complicated that already fraught relationship and why his use of israel as an election wedge is so dangerous time let s start with president trump s use of the word disloyal in reference to american jews who vote democrat why is that term so loaded gordis since early modernity jews have faced the challenge of seemingly being accepted in the societies in which they live but at the same time being suspected of being not entirely of those societies the greatest example of that is of course germany at the beginning of the 20th century where jews were doing very well they were welcomed into some of the professions and making their way in academia but underneath the surface there was always this question of are the jews really german can you really be a german or a frenchman or what have you if you re a jew and of course in europe that exploded in the early 20th century and then with the third reich went beyond anything anybody had imagined so for jews this notion of dual loyalty has always been a red flag how different were the circumstances faced by jewish people who emigrated to the u s in the early 20th century in terms of this notion of dual loyalty it seemed that america was going to be the exception to the longstanding issue but it was never quite that simple woodrow wilson said not just to jews but to millions of immigrants making their way to america that you can t have any other nationalist loyalties and still be really american on the surface of course there s nothing problematic about that here s a president welcoming immigrants but he s saying if you want to be in we want you all in then comes the balfour declaration of british support for a jewish state and that puts american jews in an exceedingly difficult position the way american jews chose to manage the tricky road between the declaration of a jewish state on the one hand and their loyalty to america on the other was a kind of soft pedal zionism they gave money and made other contributions but they were not the enthusiastic embracers of zionism many jews in eastern europe became it appeared that this worked it seemed for a long time that jews in america were really an exceptional diaspora community in the sense that their situation was an exception to the hundreds of years old pattern trump and some of his jewish american supporters later suggested he was referring to disloyalty to israel rather than to the united states how do you read that even if trump did mean disloyal to israel which i don t think he did who is the president of the united states to tell american jews about their loyalty to an entirely different country it s worth remembering that a couple of months ago trump met with a group of american jews shortly after he had spoken to netanyahu he said to them i ve just spoken to your prime minister of course netanyahu is not their prime minister they re american citizens not israelis in we stand divided you quote israeli essayist a b yehoshua who said american jews are partial jews while israelis are totally jewish while also examining depictions from writers like amos oz and philip roth of what it means to be israeli or american jewish where do trump s statements fit in the spectrum of views on that subject american jews have a longstanding fraught relationship with israel for the reasons mentioned above and in recent decades it s gotten more complicated because of the israeli palestian conflict american jews especially the 70 something percent who vote democrat are looking at the relationship with israel through almost suspicious eyes how is israel going to embarrass us how is it going to compromise our progressive values how is it going to compromise our standing with african americans and so forth what trump has done is made israel a partisan political issue american jews now worry that this is becoming something like abortion or gun control that the policy needle is going to shift depending on the who the president and congress are doesn t netanyahu bear some responsibility for that politicization his campaign team put up pictures of him with trump in tel aviv during the campaign season and it appears that he caved to trump saying israel should ban congresswomen rashida tlaib and ilhan omar from visiting friends in government tell me israel really was going to let the two congresswomen in they weren t going to be happy about it but they were going to do it because they understood that not doing so looked terrible a lot of people believe it was that trump tweet that drew a line in the sand i do think netanyahu going to a joint session of congress in the obama years when he was not wanted by obama was a big mistake but at the moment he is trying to navigate uncharted waters with trump it s important to remember that the typical israeli sees the u s recognizing israeli sovereignty over the golan heights and the moving of the embassy to jerusalem and they think trump is our friend portraying himself as trump s partner serves netanyahu well in election season we stand divided discusses the differences between israel as a particularist state in its jewishness and the u s as a universalist one but the u s is clearly struggling now with questions of who gets to be american is that dynamic changing america s greatness was emma lazarus give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free america was so good to the jews because it was fundamentally welcoming of everyone who wanted to make the best of what america had to offer the minute you undermine america s universalist acceptance you undermine the very bedrock of what has made america such a safe haven for the jews when you couple that with the distinctly anti jewish sentiment of white supremacists and with the synagogue shootings president trump s rhetoric is making america a very different place much less hospitable and much less safe for jews as an american born israeli author who spent the first 40 years of his life in the u s how do you personally feel about trump s questioning of jewish american loyalty as someone who is very american and israeli at the same time i can say that it s a sad sobering and somewhat frightening time trump is at the core of that trump making israel one of his pet issues is going to make american jews relationship with israel more fraught and more complicated and in the end that s just not good for the jewish people jewish people have always stuck together through thick and thin no matter what they disagreed about politically or theologically trump is a much greater danger to the future of the jewish people than most people recognize write to
