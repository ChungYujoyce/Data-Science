some major faction of a fractured party loading april 6 2016 ted cruz accomplished what he set out to do in the wisconsin republican primary beat front runner donald trump soundly winning most of the state s delegates and raising the probability of a contested gop convention in july but senator cruz s big victory he beat mr trump by 13 points 48 percent to 35 percent doesn t prove that he is uniting the republican party as he claimed in his victory speech tuesday night it merely demonstrates that the texas senator is consolidating his role as the anti trump in a presidential nomination race that has plunged the gop into crisis the wisconsin exit polls tell the story more than half of cruz s supporters and two thirds of ohio gov john kasich s said they were scared of what trump would do in the white house a remarkable rejection of the leading candidate in the race write analysts for abc news notably among cruz s own voters only a quarter were excited about what he d do as president further suggesting that he garnered substantial anti trump not necessarily pro cruz support governor kasich underperformed in wisconsin with only 14 percent of the vote but he remains adamant about taking his campaign to the convention as the only mainstream republican still in the race the effect though has been to split the anti trump vote perhaps more troubling for the gop were responses to how wisconsin republicans would vote in the general election if trump is the party s nominee against democrat hillary clinton only 61 percent of gop primary voters said they would vote for him 19 percent said they would vote for a third party candidate 10 percent said they would vote for mrs clinton and 8 percent said no one if it s cruz vs clinton in november only 66 percent of wisconsin republicans said they d back cruz 18 percent said they d vote third party 6 percent said clinton and 6 percent said no one these numbers are similar to national polling that shows a deep divide within the gop between trump supporters and republican voters who oppose him it s also true that inevitably as election day nears many unhappy voters will surely end up holding their nose and voting for their party s nominee anyway clinton in particular inspires revulsion among many republicans but trump is no mere republican candidate the brash billionaire inspires rock solid loyalty among a third of the gop electorate including the first time voters he has lured into the process with his populist nativist message if trump is not the nominee many of his supporters say they will abandon the party altogether especially if they believe trump is treated unfairly at the convention on the issue of fairness one exit poll question was particularly devastating to the republican establishment if no one wins a majority of the delegates before the convention whom should the party nominate voters were asked a majority 55 percent said the candidate with the most votes in the primaries only 43 percent said the candidate who the delegates think would be the best nominee in short the republican party can t win in all likelihood donald trump will go to the convention with the most delegates wisconsin doesn t really change that says matthew kerbel chairman of the political science department at villanova university in philadelphia if trump arrives at the convention without a majority of the delegates then it becomes easier to deny him the nomination but the cost of denying him is to split the party says professor kerbel and the cost of not denying him is it becomes his party and donald trump becomes the face of the party that could have a profound impact on other republicans on the ballot among general election voters trump has sky high negatives cruz and clinton also have high negatives but not close to trump s kasich argues he s the most electable and general election matchups bear that out but his path to the nomination through a contested convention is impossibly narrow he ll need to convince a deadlocked convention that a candidate who finished at the back of the pack deserves to jump the line his argument is electability polls do show him performing better than trump or cruz against clinton but tuesday s exit polls showed electability held little sway with voters get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox the next test comes in two weeks with the new york primary home turf for both trump and clinton who like trump needs to overcome an embarrassing defeat in wisconsin clinton s 13 point loss to bernie sanders 56 to 43 percent was nevertheless expected wisconsin s electorate is largely white and very liberal both playing to the vermont senator s strengths trump also wasn t a good fit for wisconsin both demographically and culturally before wisconsin new york polls showed both trump and clinton well ahead of their top competitors if either underperforms it will be clear that wisconsin was a turning point both will be damaged but still on track to head to their respective conventions with the most delegates the math at this stage in the race is almost impossible to overcome link copied get
