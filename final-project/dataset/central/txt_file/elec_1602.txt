 if a new poll turns out to be a good prediction it shows donald trump leading hillary clinton by only 6 percentage points in texas i m going to get to vote in a competitive state this november thrilling of course it will be only my second time in nine presidential elections like most states texas typically isn t competitive at the presidential level strike one against the electoral college is that it turns voters in such states into bystanders that s why some want to abandon the electoral college and let the popular vote totals determine election outcomes i get it in my first presidential election ronald reagan took arizona where i voted by 34 percentage points that s the biggest blowout i ve voted in but other states where i ve voted for president arizona twice california twice texas three times have had margins of 21 13 13 21 23 and 16 percentage points the exception to these landslides was when i lived in indiana in 2008 barack obama prevailed by a single percentage point just under 20 000 votes donald trump may cost the gop a generation of voters donald trump s failure to attract young voters is likely a result of his assault on racial and religious tolerance strike two against the electoral college is that the only way a state like indiana or texas gets close is if the national election is a blowout texas will only be contested if clinton maintains a national lead of close to 10 percentage points which means she ll win far more than the necessary 270 electoral votes regardless of what happens in the alamo state so if we want every voter to cast a meaningful vote we should get rid of the electoral college right well it s more complicated than that in indiana in 2008 we were treated to a hard fought campaign but even though the contest was a nail biter i couldn t pretend that my vote actually made a difference even in the 2000 election in florida where george w bush s official margin of victory was only 537 votes no single vote which would ve cut bush s margin to 536 or increased it to 538 mattered to the result a national vote for a single office in a nation of some 325 million people just can t be set up in such a way that one vote makes a difference that would still be true if the electoral college were reformed or eliminated many elections do come down to one or at least a handful of votes but that happens almost exclusively in local elections with small constituencies the point isn t that people shouldn t vote i vote in every election no matter how big or small the point is that you shouldn t mistake voting for democracy it s simply one of many avenues of democratic engagement as i ve said before voting is democracy with training wheels if you really want to influence election and policy outcomes you need to do more generally by getting involved in a party or interest group i ve always voted republican but i won t be voting for donald trump hillary clinton has the qualities a good leader must possess donald trump does not the resources that campaigns find valuable money expertise phone calls labor are generally portable across state lines so even if texas isn t competitive we texans can still contribute elsewhere u s political parties are open source any people can walk in off the street and get involved and if they stick around they can eventually influence the priorities or even the policy preferences of a party interest groups are less open to change the national rifle association isn t going to support gun control and naral pro choice america won t oppose abortion rights no matter how many new members join but the larger an interest group becomes the more influence it can have best of all local elections are the easiest of all to influence that the electoral college gives the smallest states disproportionate strength is a legitimate criticism but it s a less weighty issue once you recognize that you can exert political influence beyond voting because with or without the electoral college your individual vote is unlikely ever to be decisive bloomberg view jonathan bernstein is a bloomberg view columnist covering u s politics
