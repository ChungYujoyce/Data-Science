lewd disgraceful statements made by the candidate but the impact such recordings could have on his candidacy may be limited mr trump s colorful and often controversial comments have characterized his campaign he has made offensive remarks regarding muslims immigrants the african american community women and prisoners of war many of which have led establishment republicans to turn their backs on the gop nominee but his tell it like it is attitude has also resonated with groups of disenchanted voters imploring them to put their trust in trump and defend or ignore his alienating remarks the greatest crisis of trump s political career to date came friday when the washington post released a lewd tape from 2005 in the recording trump makes disparaging comments about his sexual conduct with
