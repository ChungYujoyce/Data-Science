5tn green new deal that he says would create 20 million jobs and pay for itself over 15 years including through 3tn of taxes on oil companies he has generated controversy by supporting the idea of population control through widening access to abortion and contraception for women in poor countries and last year tweeted fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused 3 college should be free education must be an economic right for all not a privilege for the few sanders wrote in an opinion piece last year his 2 2tn plan to make college free is like much of his policy platform the most far reaching in the democratic field it would include paying off all student loans for some 45 million americans regardless of their income or assets

system is broken sanders one of two independent us senators has been at times as unsparing in his criticism of the democratic party he hopes to lead into this election as he is of the republicans he has long condemned the washington duopoly saying both parties are beholden to corporate money some say sanders rejection of both congressional parties has left him politically alienated but his outsider status is the touchstone of his appeal to supporters 9 fly economy mostly photos of sanders flying coach class on commercial airline flights have been held up by supporters as evidence that he s a humble everyman but a recent picture of him apparently flying first class triggered conservative cries of hypocrisy 10 universal healthcare sanders proposes that all americans would receive government run health insurance which he says would cost about 30tn over a decade though his costing for the policy medicare for all is under intense scrutiny sanders idea to nationalise us health

payroll he argues would be more than offset by their health cost savings 13 anti war the american people are sick and tired of endless wars which have cost us trillions of dollars sanders said during a tv debate in iowa in january it s a sentiment president trump has often echoed but unlike trump sanders was against the us invasion of iraq from the outset back in 2002 sanders stands by that decision today calling the conflict the worst foreign policy blunder in the history of this country 14 personal style is a waste of time sanders wife jane o meara once quipped that if her husband has seven sweaters that s three too many for him when questioned about his frequently rumpled coiffure sanders was brusque the media will very often spend more time worrying about hair than the fact that
