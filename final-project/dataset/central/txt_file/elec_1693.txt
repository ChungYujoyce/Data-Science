fallacies lobbed so far in this year s presidential campaign it s a good thing presidential campaigns aren t college debates because politicians routinely spout arguments on the stump and in their ads that would never pass muster on the university rostrum campaigns are rife with logical fallacies aimed at whipping up voters and herding them to the polls some are deceptively difficult to recognize while others are familiar but no less seductive fallacies are used all the time in campaigns says sam nelson director of forensics at cornell university s school of industrial and labor relations human beings are busy we have all kinds of information around us all the time we don t have time to logically think through every argument so we re looking for short cuts nelson says the issue is whether you can recognize these short cuts that are really fallacies and avoid falling for them as we head into the final months before november elections with party convention bluster brutal ad wars and debate posturing americans will almost certainly be exposed to a lot more pretzel logic so with the help of cornell s nelson and storey clayton a debate coach for rutgers university debate union here s an election season primer to help people at home spot the top five logical fallacies so far in this year s presidential campaign the latin is optional what it means there s nothing like name dropping a founding father a former u s president or a nobel laureate to boost your argument but that still doesn t change the substance of the argument why it works it s the devil we know as opposed to something new which we ve never tried nelson says there s always risk in change some people are big risk takers but most people seek safety examples from the campaign trail ronald reagan was one of our great foreign policy presidents he did not come from the senate he did not come from the foreign policy world he was a governor the take away as reagan s presidency has grown more distant his star has sort of grown he s a very appealing authority figure clayton says you do not have to take my word for it just today an independent nonpartisan organization ran all the numbers on gov romney s plan this wasn t my staff this wasn t something we did an independent group ran the numbers the take away this is a shortcut for most citizens who aren t willing to do the hard policy analysis obama is saying these people did the work so you don t have to nelson says what it means the argument attempts to turn simple correlation into false or questionable causation a textbook example because the birds sing every morning before the sun rises the birds singing causes the sun to rise why it works it s a very appealing intuitive fallacy clayton says a lot of the arguments that people make around presidential campaigns for example are essentially drawing the inference that whatever happened in one s time in office is their responsibility whether or not they were actually responsible examples from the campaign trail we have fewer jobs under president obama then there s unemployed and underemployed that s gone up that s in red because that s a bad direction then we have the unemployment rate that s bad too that s why that s in red the take away what you re trying to do in a presidential campaign is take relatively complex issues that there s a lot of division on and simplify it so that everyone understands what you re trying to say nelson says everyone understands the idea of a report card holding it up visually even makes it better now is that report card based on reliable information we don t know when mitt romney and bain closed the plant i lost my health care my family lost their health care a short time after that my wife became ill she passed away in 22 days the take away someone responsible for a business is not necessarily responsible for every single decision or every single aspect that s made within that business clayton says but that s exactly what this ad is trying to argue it s a classic example of giving someone responsibility over foreseeing every possible effect or every possible outcome what it means anyone who s ever been verbally taunted or bullied in a schoolyard is familiar with argumentum ad hominem basically a fancy debate term for name calling its purpose like that of all fallacies is to divert attention away from substantive arguments why it works it short circuits the thinking part of your brain and makes you think this guy s an idiot says rutgers university s clayton nelson of cornell agrees saying ad hominems are funny and memorable and that the person launching one often benefits from being perceived as a fighter it appeals to aspects of american culture that we got on the schoolyard and we still have when we re adults he says the take away these examples basically reduce everything to name calling clayton says they cut through the logic and all the rational arguments examples from the campaign trail gov romney would ask the middle class to pay more in taxes to give another 250 000 tax cut to people making more than 3 million a year it s like robin hood in reverse it s romney hood we ve been watching the president say a lot of things about me and my policies and they re just not right and if i were to coin a term it would be obamaloney what it means falsely creating an overly simplistic or undesirable argument because it s easier to defeat than the real argument why it works it basically works like an inoculation nelson says just like a vaccine uses a weakened version of a virus to stimulate an immune response you tell the person a weakened version of an argument so that when the real thing appears they have an idea how to answer it you explain someone s argument in a way that doesn t give it full strength and then you knock it down examples from the campaign trail president obama said something which really reveals what he thinks about our country about our people about free enterprise about freedom about individual initiative about america i just want to say it exactly as he said it speaking about small business and business of all kinds he said this if you ve got a business you didn t build that somebody else made that happen the take away in his speech romney takes obama s remark out of context to reduce a complex argument about the collective nature of success to a simple straw man clayton says he adds so he is characterizing the argument that obama did make but he s taking the worst possible least relatable version of what obama was saying and defeating that we re certainly not going to follow mr romney s lead and go back to the days when women didn t have control of their own health care choices the take away obama hyperbolizes romney s position making it sound like you re going back to the 1300s and that women would have no control over their health care choices whatsoever clayton says so he s making the most dramatic worst case version of the argument then it s easy for him to make the case that his policies are better what it means this is pretty self explanatory it plays on someone s fear of a real or imagined undesirable consequence why it works fear motivates people especially if they re already nervous says nelson if you ve just lost your job or think you are going to lose your job and someone says things are going to get worse that will get your attention examples from the campaign trail last week we found out that gov romney expects you middle class families to pick up the tab for this big tax cut economists say gov romney s tax plan would actually raise taxes on middle class families with children by an average of 2 000 the take away he s basically playing off the fears of the middle class and saying romney s going to saddle you with a larger and larger tax burden clayton notes i wish i could tell you the world is safe today it s not iran is rushing to become a nuclear nation pakistan is home to some 100 nuclear weapons china s on the road to becoming a military superpower the take away not only are you telling your story but you re trying to saddle your opponent with another narrative so the narrative you re trying to saddle obama with is he s weak because he just wants to get along nelson says you re saying he s naive about the real threats and he s not minding the store npr thanks our sponsors become an
