well now it s time to find out announcer tonight round one new jersey senator cory booker former housing secretary julian castro new york city mayor bill de blasio former maryland congressman john

tomorrow the breakdown for each was selected at random the candidates will have 60 seconds to answer and 30 seconds for any follow ups holt because of this large field not every person will be able to

making sure the candidates stick to time tonight guthrie all right so with that business out of the way we want to get to it and we ll start this evening with senator elizabeth warren senator good evening to you warren thank you good to be here guthrie you have many plans free college free child care government health care cancellation of student debt new taxes new regulations the breakup of major corporations but this comes at a time when 71 percent of americans say the economy is doing well including 60 percent of democrats what do you say to those who worry this kind of significant change could be risky to the economy warren so i think of it this way who is this economy really working for it s doing great for a thinner and thinner slice at the top it s doing great for giant drug companies it s just not doing great for people who are trying to get a prescription filled it s doing great for people who want to invest in private prisons just not for the african americans and latinos whose families are torn apart whose lives are destroyed and whose communities are ruined it s doing great for giant oil companies that want to drill everywhere just not for the rest of us who are watching climate change bear down upon us when you ve got a government when you ve got an economy that does great for those with money and isn t doing great for everyone else that is corruption pure and simple we need to call it out we need to attack it head on and we need to make structural change in our government in our economy and in our country guthrie senator klobuchar you ve called programs like free college something you might do if you were quote a magic genie to be blunt are the government programs and benefits that some of your rivals are offering giving your voters people a false sense of what s actually achievable klobuchar well first the economy we know that not everyone is sharing in this prosperity and donald trump just sits in the white house and gloats about what s going on when you have so many people that are having trouble affording college and having trouble affording their premiums so i do get concerned about paying for college for rich kids i do but i think my plan is a good one and my plan would be to first of all make community college free and make sure that everyone else besides that top percentile gets help with their education my own dad and my sister got their first degrees with community college there s many paths to success as well as certifications secondly i d used pell grants i d double them from 6 000 to 12 000 a year and expand it to the number of families that get covered to families that make up to 100 000 and then the third thing i would do is make it easier for students to pay off their student loans because i can tell you this if billionaires can pay off their yachts students should be able to pay off their student loans guthrie that s time thank you guthrie congressman o rourke what we ve just been discussing and talking about is how much fundamental change to the economy is desirable and how much is actually doable in that vein some democrats want a marginal individual tax rate of 70 percent on the very highest earners those making more than 10 million a year would you support that and if not what would your top individual rate be o rourke this economy has got to work for everyone and right now we know that it isn t and it s going to take all of us coming together to make sure that it does speaking in spanish o rourke right now we have a system that favors those who can pay for access and outcomes that s how you explain an economy that is rigged to corporations and to the very wealthiest a 2 trillion tax cut that favored corporations while they were sitting on record piles of cash and the very wealthiest in this country at a time of historic wealth inequality a new democracy that is revived because we ve returned power to the people no pacs no gerrymandering automatic and same day voter registration to bring in more voters and a new voting rights act to get rid of the barriers that are in place now guthrie congressman o rourke o rourke that s how we each have a voice in our democracy and make this economy work for everybody guthrie congressman that s time sir i ll give you 10 seconds to answer if you want to answer the direct question would you support a 70 percent individual marginal tax rate yes no or pass o rourke i would support a tax rate and a tax code that is fair to everyone tax capital at the same right guthrie seventy percent o rourke that you you tax ordinary income take that corporate tax rate up to 28 percent you would generate the revenues guthrie ok that s time o rourke you need to pay for the programs we re talking about guthrie that s time thank you guthrie senator booker there is a debate in this party right now about the role of corporations as you know senator warren in particular put out a plan to break up tech companies like facebook amazon and google you ve said we should not quote be running around pointing at companies and breaking them up without any kind of process why do you disagree booker i don t think i disagree i think we have a serious problem in our country with corporate consolidation and you see the evidence of that in how dignity is being stripped from labor and we have people that work full time jobs and still can t make a living wage we see that because consumer prices are being raised by pharmaceutical companies that often have monopolistic holds on drugs and you see that by just the fact that this is actually an economy that s hurting small businesses and not allowing them to compete one of the most aggressive bills in the senate to deal with corporate consolidation is mine about corporate consolidation in the ag sector so i feel very strongly about the need to check the corporate consolidation and let the free market work and i ll tell you this i live in a low income black and brown community i see every single day that this economy is not working for average americans the indicators that are being used from gdp to wall street s rankings is not helping people in my community it is about time that we have an economy that works for everybody not just the wealthiest in our nation guthrie but quickly senator booker you did say that you didn t think it was right to name names to name companies and single them out as senator warren has briefly why is that booker well again i will single out companies like halliburton or amazon that pay nothing in taxes and our need to change that and when it comes to antitrust law what i will do is number one appoint judges that will enforce it number two have a doj and a federal trade commission that will go through the processes necessary to check this kind of corporate concentration at the end of the day we have too much of a problem with corporate power growing we see that with everything from citizens united and the way they re trying to influence washington it s about time that we have a president that fights for the people in this country guthrie that s time sir booker we need to have someone that s a champion for them guthrie thank you senator senator warren i mentioned you are you picking winners and losers warren so the way i understand this it s there is way too much consolidation now in giant industries in this country that hurts workers it hurts small businesses it hurts independent farmers it hurts our economy overall and it helps constrict real innovation and growth in this economy now look we ve had the laws out there for a long time to be able to fight back what s been missing is courage courage in washington to take on the giants that s part of the corruption in this system it has been far too long that the monopolies have been making the campaign contributions have been funding the super pacs have been out there making sure that their influence is heard and felt in every single decision that gets made in washington where i want to start this is i want to return government to the people and that means calling out the names of the monopolists and saying i have the courage to go after them guthrie thank you holt secretary castro the next question is for you democrats have been talking about the pay gap for decades what would you do to ensure that women are paid fairly in this country castro thank you very much for that question lester you know i grew up with a mother who raised my brother joaquin and me as a single parent and i know what it s like to struggle i know what it s like to rent a home and to worry about whether you re going to be able to pay the rent at the first of the month and to see a mom work very very hard and know that moms across this country are getting paid less simply because they re women i would do several things starting with something we should have done a long time ago which is to pass the equal rights amendment finally in this country and also pursue legislation so that women are paid equal pay for equal work in this country it s past time that we did that and you know we have to do this if we want to be the most prosperous nation in the 21st century we need to make sure that women are paid what they deserve holt all right thank you i want to put the same question to congresswoman gabbard your thoughts on equal pay gabbard first of all let s recognize the situation we re in that the american people deserve a president who will put your interests ahead of the rich and powerful that s not what we have right now i enlisted in the army national guard after the al qaida terror attacks on 9 11 so i could go after those who had attacked us on that day i still serve as a major i served over 16 years deployed twice to the middle east and in congress served on the foreign affairs and armed services affairs for over six years i know the importance of our national security as well as the terribly high cost of war and for too long our leaders have failed us taking us from one regime change war to the next leading us into a new cold war and arms race costing us trillions of our hard earned taxpayer dollars and countless lives this insanity must end as president i will take your hard earned taxpayer dollars and instead invest those dollars into serving your needs things like health care a green economy good paying jobs protecting our environment and so much more diaz balart mayor de blasio good evening you re the mayor of the biggest city in the united states but it s also one of the cities in the country with the greatest gap between the wealthy and the poor how would you address income inequality de blasio well we ve been addressing income inequality in new york city by raising wages by raising benefits by putting money back in the hands of working people 15 minimum wage paid sick days pre k for all things that are making a huge difference in working people s lives but let me tell you what we re hearing here already in the first round of questions is that battle for the heart and soul of our party i want to make it clear this is supposed to be the party of working people yes we re supposed to be for a 70 percent tax rate on the wealthy yes we re supposed to be for free college free public college for our young people we are supposed to break up big corporations when they re not serving our democracy this democratic party has to be strong and bold and progressive and in new york we ve proven that we can do something very different we can put money back in the hands of working people and let me tell you every time you talk about investing in people and their communities you hear folks say there s not enough money what i say to them every single time is there s plenty of money in this world there s plenty of money in this country it s just in the wrong hands democrats have to fix that applause diaz balart congressman delaney do you agree delaney i think we have to do real things to help american workers and the american people right this is the issue that all of us hear on the campaign trail we need to make sure everyone has a living wage and i ve called for a doubling of the earned income tax credit raising the minimum wage and creating paid family leave that will create a situation where people actually have a living wage that gets right to workers then we ve got to fix our public education system it s not delivering the results our kids needs nor is college and post high school career and technical training programs doing that you know i m very different than everyone else here on the stage prior to being in congress i was an entrepreneur i started two businesses i created thousands of jobs i spent my whole career helping small to mid sized businesses all over the country 5 000 of them i supported the obama administration gave me an award for lending to disadvantaged communities i know how to create jobs we need a short term strategy which is to put money in the pockets of workers with the earned income tax credit raising the minimum wage and creating family leave and then we need to have a long term strategy to make sure this country is competitive and we re creating jobs everywhere in this country diaz balart thank you governor inslee how would you address income inequality inslee well i m a little bit surprised i think plans are great but i m a governor and we ve got to realize the people who brought us the weekend unions need are going to bring us a long overdue raise in america and i m proud of standing up for unions i ve got a plan to reinvigorate collective bargaining so we can increase wages finally i marched with the seiu folks it is not right that the ceo of mcdonald s makes 2 100 times more than the people slinging cash at mcdonald s and the next thing i ll do is put people to work in the jobs of the present and the future look it donald trump is simply wrong he says wind turbines cause cancer we know they cause jobs and we know that we can put millions of people to work in the clean energy jobs of the future carpenters ibew members machinists we re doing it in my state today and then we can do what america always does lead the world and invent the future and put people to work that s what we re going to do diaz balart so congressman ryan president trump and you just referred to him promise of manufacturing jobs were all coming back to places like your home state of ohio can you make that same promise ryan yes i believe you can but first let s say the president came he said don t sell your house to people in youngstown ohio and then his administration just in the last two years we lost 4 000 4 000 jobs at a general motors facility that rippled throughout our community general motors got a tax cut general motors got a bailout and then they have the audacity to move a new car that they re going to produce to mexico i ve had family members that have to unbolt a machine from the factory floor put it in a box and ship it to china my area where i come from in northeast ohio this issue we re talking about here it s been going on 40 years this is not a new phenomenon in the united states of america the bottom 60 percent haven t seen a raise since 1980 meanwhile the top 1 percent control 90 percent of the wealth we need an industrial policy saying we re going to dominate building electric vehicles there s going to be 30 million made in the next 10 years i want half of them made in the united states i want to dominate the solar industry diaz balart thank you ryan and manufacture those here in the united states diaz balart senator warren are they coming back are these jobs coming back warren so we ve had an industrial policy in the united states for decades now and it s basically been let giant corporations do whatever they want to do giant corporations have exactly one loyalty and that is to profits and if they can save a nickel by moving a job to mexico or to asia or to canada they re going to do it so here s what i propose for an industrial policy start with a place where there s a real need there s going to be a worldwide need for green technology ways to clean up the air ways to clean up the water and we can be the ones to provide that we need to go tenfold in our research and development on green energy going forward and then we need to say any corporation can come and use that research they can make all kinds of products from it but they have to be manufactured right here in the united states of america and then we have to double down and sell it around the world there s a 23 trillion market coming for green products we should be the leaders and the owners and we should have that 1 2 million manufacturing jobs here in america diaz balart thank you warren we can do this holt all right we re going to turn to the issue of health care right now and really try to understand where there may or may not be daylight between you many people watching at home have health insurance coverage through their employer who here would abolish their private health insurance in favor of a government run plan just a show of hands start off with all right well senator klobuchar let me put the question to you you re one of the democrats who wants to keep private insurance in addition to a government health care plan why is an incremental approach in your view better than a sweeping overhaul klobuchar well i think it s a bold approach it s something that barack obama wanted to do when we were working on the affordable care act and that is a public option i am just simply concerned about kicking half of america off of their health insurance in four years which is exactly what this bill says so let me go on beyond that there is a much bigger issue in addition to that and that is pharmaceuticals the president literally went on tv on fox and said that people s heads would spin when they see how much he would bring down pharmaceutical prices instead 2 500 drugs have gone up in double digits since he came into office instead he gave 100 billion in giveaways to the pharma companies for the rest of us for the rest of america that s what we call at home all foam and no beer we got nothing out of it and so my proposal is to do something about pharma to take them on to allow negotiation under medicare to bring in less expensive drugs from other countries and pharma thinks they own washington well they don t own me holt your time is up thank you senator warren you signed on to bernie sanders medicare for all plan it would put essentially everybody on medicare and then eliminate private plans that offer similar coverage is that the plan or path that you would pursue as president warren so yes i m with bernie on medicare for all and let me tell you why i spent a big chunk of my life studying why families go broke and one of the number one reasons is the cost of health care medical bills and that s not just for people who don t have insurance it s for people who have insurance look at the business model of an insurance company it s to bring in as many dollars as they can in premiums and to pay out as few dollars as possible for your health care that leaves families with rising premiums rising copays and fighting with insurance companies to try to get the health care that their doctors say that they and their children need medicare for all solves that problem and i understand there are a lot of politicians who say oh it s just not possible we just can t do it have a lot of political reasons for this what they re really telling you is they just won t fight for it well health care is a basic human right and i will fight for basic human rights holt congressman o rourke when you ran for senate you also praised a bill that would replace private insurance this year you re saying you re no longer sure can you explain why o rourke my goal is to ensure that every american is well enough to live to their full potential because they have health care in laredo texas i met a young man 27 years old told me that he d been to a doctor once in his life and on that visit he was told he had diabetes he was told he had glaucoma and he was told untreated because he doesn t have health care he ll be dead before the age of 40 so getting to guaranteed high quality universal health care as quickly and surely as possible has to be our goal the ability to afford your prescriptions and go to a primary care provider to be the ability to see a mental health care provider in texas the single largest provider of mental health care services is the county jail system today and health care also has to mean that every woman can make her own decisions about her own body and has access to the care that makes that possible our plan says that if you re uninsured we enroll you in medicare if you re insufficiently insured you can t afford your premiums we enroll you in medicare but if you re a member of a union that negotiated for a health care plan that you like because it works for you and your family you re able to keep it holt your time is up o rourke we preserve choice by making sure everybody has care holt your time is up congressman but i do want to ask a follow up on this just to be very clear i ll give you 10 seconds would you replace private insurance o rourke no i think the choice is fundamental to our ability to get everybody cared for de blasio wait wait wait congressman o rourke congressman o rourke private insurance is not working for tens of millions of americans when you talk about the co pays the deductibles the premiums the out of pocket expenses it s not working how can you defend a system that s not working o rourke that s right so for those for whom it s not working they can choose medicare for the de blasio congressman o rourke who i listen to de blasio you ve got to start by acknowledging the system is not working for people o rourke they re able to keep them de blasio why are you defending private insurance to begin with delaney 100 million americans say they like their private health insurance by the way it should be noted that 100 million americans i mean i think we should be the party that keeps what s working and fixes what s broken i mean doesn t that make sense i mean we should give everyone in this country health care as a basic human right for free full stop but we should also give them the option to buy private insurance why do we have to stand for taking away something from people and also it s bad policy if you go to every hospital in this country and you ask them one question which is how would it have been for you last year if every one of your bills were paid at the medicare rate every single hospital administrator said they would close and the medicare for all bill requires payments to stay at current medicare rates so to some extent we re supporting a bill that will have every hospital closing i mean my dad was a union electrician right i actually grew up in a working class family he loved the health care that the ibew gave him and i just always think about my dad in anything i would do from a policy perspective he d look at me and he d say good job john for getting health care for every american but why are you taking my health care away holt i ve let this i ve let this play out a little bit because i m fascinated to hear the daylight between you congresswoman gabbard why don t you weigh in here gabbard i think we re talking about this in the wrong way you re talking about one bill over another bill really what we re talking about is our objective making sure that every single sick american in this country is able to get the health care that they need i believe medicare for all is the way to do that i also think that employers will recognize how much money will be saved by supporting a medicare for all program a program that will reduce the administrative costs reduce the bureaucratic costs and make sure that everyone gets that quality health care that they need i also think that holt senator gabbard if you if you look at other countries in the world who have universal health care every one of them has some form of a role of private insurance so i think that s what we ve got to look at taking the best of these ideas but making sure unequivocally that no sick american goes without getting the care that they need regardless of how much or little money they have in their pocket holt congresswoman congresswoman thanks holt let me turn to senator booker on this senator booker explain to me where you are this is hugely important to people so tell us where you are booker i absolutely will first of all we re talking about this as a health care issue but in communities like mine low income communities it s an education issue because kids who don t have health care are not going to succeed in school it is an issue for jobs and employment because people who do not have good health care do not succeed at work it s even a retirement issue because in my community african americans have a lower life expectancy because of poorer health care and so where i stand is very clear health care it s not just a human right it should be an american right and i believe the best way to get there is medicare for all but i have an urgency about this when i am president of the united states i m not going to wait we have to do the things immediately that are going to provide better care and on this debate i m sorry there are too many people profiteering off of the pain of people in america from pharmaceutical companies to insurers literally the overhead for insurance that they charge is 15 percent while medicare s overhead is only at 2 percent we can do this better and every single day i will be fighting to give people more access and more affordable costs until we get to my goal holt your time is up senator booker which is every american having health care holt time is up senator i want to holt i want to move back if i can to congresswoman gabbard warren point though and that is that the insurance companies last year alone sucked 23 billion in profits out of the health care system 23 billion and that doesn t count the money that was paid to executives the money that was spent lobbying washington we have a giant industry that wants our health care system to stay the way it is because it s not working for families but it s sure as heck working for them warren it s time for us to make families come first inslee it should not be an option in the united states of america for any insurance company to deny a woman coverage for their exercise of their right of choice and i am the only candidate here who has passed a law protecting a woman s right of reproductive health in health insurance and i m the only candidate who has passed a public option and i respect everybody s goals and plans here but we do have one candidate that s actually advanced the ball and we ve got to have access for everyone i ve done it as a public option holt your time holt senator klobuchar i want to get you unknown that s a false claim holt i am fascinated by this senator senator klobuchar klobuchar i just want to say there s three women up here that have fought pretty hard for a woman s right to choose i ll start with that and then i just want to make very clear i think we share the goal of universal health care and the idea i put out there the public option which the governor was just talking about this idea is that you use medicare or medicaid without any insurance companies involved you can do it either way and the estimates are 13 million people would see a reduction in their premiums 12 more million people would get covered so i think it is a beginning and the way you start and the way you move to universal health care holt secretary castro this one is for you all of you on stage support a woman s right to an abortion you all support some version of a government health care option would your plan cover abortion mr secretary castro yes it would i don t believe only in reproductive freedom i believe in reproductive justice and you know what that means is that just because a woman or let s also not forget someone in the trans community a trans female is poor doesn t mean they shouldn t have the right to exercise that right to choose and so i absolutely would cover the right to have an abortion more than that everybody in this crowd and watching at home knows that in our country today a person s right to choose is under assault in places like missouri in alabama in georgia i would appoint judges to the federal bench that understand the precedent of roe v wade and will respect it and in addition to that make sure that we fight hard as we transition our health care system to one where everybody can get and exercise that right holt senator warren would you put limits on any limits on abortion warren i would make certain that every woman has access to the full range of reproductive health care services and that includes birth control it includes abortion it includes everything for a woman and i want to add on that it s not enough for us to expect the courts to protect us forty seven years ago roe v wade was decided and we ve all looked to the courts all that time as state after state has undermined roe has put in exceptions has come right up to the edge of taking away protections holt your time is up senator warren we now have an america where most people support roe v wade we need to make that a federal law diaz balart lester thank you senator booker i want to kind of come back on a discussion we were having about health and the opioid crisis you represent a state where 14 of the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies are based should pharmaceutical companies that manufacture these drugs be held criminally liable for what they do booker they should absolutely be held criminally liable because they are liable and responsible this is one of the reasons why well before i was running for president i said i would not take contributions from pharma companies not take contributions from corporate pacs or pharma executives because they are part of this problem and this opioid addiction in our country we in cities like mine have been seeing how we ve tried to arrest our way out of addiction for too long it is time that we have a national urgency to deal with this problem and make the solutions that are working to actually be the law of our land and make the pharmaceutical companies that are responsible help to pay for that diaz balart congressman o rourke how would you deal with it o rourke tonight in this country you have 2 3 million of our fellow americans behind bars it s the largest prison population on the face of the planet many are there for nonviolent drug crimes including possession of marijuana at a time that more than half the states have legalized it or decriminalized it and yet despite what purdue pharma has done their connection to the opioid crisis and the overdose deaths that we re seeing throughout this country they ve been able to act with complete impunity and pay no consequences not a single night in jail unless there s accountability and justice this crisis will continue in my administration we will hold them to account we will make sure that they pay a price and we will help those who ve been victims of this malfeasance in this country get them treatment and long term care holt i know immigration is on a lot of your minds here and i want to talk about it we re going to talk about it in a moment we need to take a break we ll be back with more from miami after this diaz balart we want to turn to an issue that has been in the news especially this week there are undocumented children being held alone in detention even as close as homestead florida right here less than 30 miles from where we are tonight fathers and mothers and children are dying while trying to enter the united states of america we saw that image today that broke our hearts and they had names oscar martinez and his 23 month old daughter valeria died trying to cross the river to ask for asylum in this country last month more than 130 000 migrants were apprehended at the southern border secretary castro if you were president today hoy what would you specifically do castro thank you very much jose i m very proud that in april i became the first candidate to put forward a comprehensive immigration plan and we saw those images watching that image of oscar and his daughter valeria is heartbreaking it should also piss us all off if i were president today and it should spur us to action if i were president today i would sign an executive order that would get rid of trump s zero tolerance policy the remain in mexico policy and the metering policy this metering policy is basically what prompted oscar and valeria to make that risky swim across the river they had been playing games with people who are coming and trying to seek asylum at our ports of entry oscar and valeria went to a port of entry and then they were denied the ability to make an asylum claim so they got frustrated and they tried to cross the river and they died because of that diaz balart on day one sorry i m just going to ask castro on day one i would do that executive order that would address metering and then i would follow that up in my first 100 days with immigration reform that would honor asylum claims that would put undocumented immigrants as long as they haven t committed a serious crime on a pathway to citizenship and then we d get to the root cause of the issue which is we need a marshall plan for honduras and guatemala and el salvador so that people can find safety and opportunity at home instead of coming to the united states to seek it diaz balart senator booker what would you do on day one and this is a situation that the next president will inherit diaz balart senator booker what would you do on day one and this is a situation that the next president will inherit booker yes speaking in spanish on day one i will make sure that number one we end the ice policies and the customs and border policies that are violating the human rights when people come to this country they do not leave their human rights at the border number two i will make sure that we reinstate daca that we reinstate pathways to citizenship for daca recipients and to make sure that people that are here on temporary protective status can stay and remain here and then finally we need to make sure that we address the issues that made oscar and valeria come in the first place by making major investments in the northern triangle not like this president is doing by ripping away the resources we need to actually solve this problem we cannot surrender our values and think that we re going to get border security we actually will lose security and our values we must fight for both castro if i might if i might very briefly and this is an important point you know my plan and i m glad to see that senator booker senator warren and governor inslee agree with me on this my plan also includes getting rid of section 1325 of the immigration and nationality act to go back to the way we used to treat this when somebody comes across the border not to criminalize desperation to treat that as a civil violation and here s why it s important we see all of this horrendous family separation they use that law section 1325 to justify under the law separating little children from their families unknown thank you unknown jose castro and so i want to challenge every single candidate on this stage to support the repeal of section 1325 diaz balart thirty seconds booker as my friend here said i agree with him on that issue but folks should understand that the separation of children from families doesn t just go on at our border it happens in our communities as ice are ripping away parents from their american children spouses and the like and are creating fear in cities all across this country where parents are afraid to even drop their kids off to school or go to work we must end those policies as well de blasio we have to change the discussion about in this country diaz balart mayor de blasio because look at the bottom line here those tragic that tragic photo of those that parent that child and i m saying this as a father every american should feel that in their heart every american should say that is not america those are not our values but we have to get under the skin of why we have this crisis in our system because we re not being honest about the division that s been fomented in this country the way that american citizens have been told that immigrants somehow created their misery and their pain and their challenges for all the american citizens out there who feel you re falling behind or feel the american dream is not working for you the immigrants didn t do that to you the big corporations did that to you the 1 percent did that to you we need to be the party of working people and that includes a party of immigrants but first we have to tell working people in america who are hurting that we re going to be on their side every single time against those big corporations who created this mess to begin with and remind people we re all in this together if we don t change that debate that politics that s holding us back we won t get all these reforms people are talking about that s what we need to do as democrats diaz balart if i could i m sorry speaking in spanish what would you do congressman day one at the white house o rourke speaking in spanish we would not turn back valeria and her father oscar we would accept them into this country and follow our own asylum laws we would not build walls we would not put kids in cages in fact we would spare no expense to reunite the families that have been separated already o rourke and we would not criminally prosecute any family who is fleeing violence and persecution castro repeal of section 1325 o rourke we would make sure diaz balart secretary let him finish and i will give you diaz balart but let him finish let him finish o rourke we would not detain any family fleeing violence in fact fleeing the deadliest countries on the face of the planet today we would implement a family case management program so they could be cared for in the community at a fraction of the cost and then we would rewrite our immigration laws in our own image free dreamers forever from any fear of deportation by making them u s citizens here in this country invest in solutions in central america work with regional stakeholders so there s no reason to make that 2 000 mile journey to this country diaz balart thank you secretary i ll give you 30 seconds castro let s be very clear the reason that they re separating these little children from their families is that they re using section 1325 of that act which criminalizes coming across the border to incarcerate the parents and then separate them some of us on this stage have called to end that section to terminate it some like congressman o rourke have not and i want to challenge all of the candidate to do that castro i just think it s a mistake beto i think it s a mistake and i think that that if you truly want to change the system that we ve got to repeal that section if not diaz balart thank you castro then it might as well be the same policy o rourke let me respond to this very briefly as a member of a congress i helped to introduce legislation that would ensure that we don t criminalize those who are seeking asylum and refuge in this country castro i m not talking about i m not talking about the ones that are seeking asylum o rourke if you re fleeing if you re fleeing desperation then i want to make sure castro i m talking about i m talking about everybody else o rourke i want to make sure you are treated with respect castro i m still talking about everybody else o rourke but you re looking at just one small part of this i m talking about a comprehensive rewrite of our immigration laws castro that s not true o rourke and if you do that i don t think it s asking too much for people to follow our laws when they come to this country castro that s actually not true i m talking about millions of folks a lot of folks that are coming are not seeking asylum a lot of them are undocumented immigrants right and you said recently that the reason you didn t want to repeal section 1325 was because you were concerned about human trafficking and drug trafficking but let me tell you what section 18 title 18 of the u s code title 21 and title 22 already cover human trafficking castro i think that you should do your homework on this issue if you did your homework on this issue you would know that we should repeal this section diaz balart this is an issue that we should and could be talking about for a long time and we will for a long time delaney can we talk about the conditions about why people are coming here diaz balart let s lester lester i m sorry savannah i know it s just we could go on delaney but rather than talk about specific provisions we really have to talk about why these people are coming to our country guthrie you ll get your chance delaney and what we re going to do to actually make a difference in these countries guthrie congressman you ll get your chance let s continue the discussion senator klobuchar klobuchar yes guthrie let s talk about what secretary castro just said he wants to no longer have it be a crime to illegally cross the border do you support that do you think it should be a civil offense only and if so do you worry about potentially incentivizing people to come here klobuchar immigrants they do not diminish america they are america and i am happy to look at his proposal but i do think you want to make sure that you have provisions in place that allow you to go after traffickers and allow you to go after people who are violating the law what i really think we need to step back and talk about is the economic imperative here and that is that 70 of our fortune 500 companies are headed by people that came from other countries twenty five percent of our u s nobel laureates were born in other countries we have a situation right now where we need workers in our fields and in our factories we need them to start small businesses we need their ideas and this president has literally gone backwards at a time when our economy needs immigrants and so my proposal is to look at that 2013 bill that passed the senate with republican support to upgrade that bill to make it as good as possible and get it done it brings the doubt down by 158 billion guthrie senator klobuchar it gives a path for citizenship for citizen for people who can become citizens and it will be so much better for our economy in america guthrie senator that s time thank you congressman ryan same question should it be a crime to illegally cross the border or should it be a civil offense only ryan well i agree with secretary castro i think there are other provisions in the law that will allow you to prosecute people for coming over here if they re dealing drugs and other things that s already established in the law so there s no need to repeat it and i think it s abhorrent we re talking about this father who got killed with his daughter and the issues here the way these kids are being treated if you go to guantanamo bay there are terrorists that are held that get better health care than those kids that have tried to cross the border in the united states that needs to stop and i think the president should immediately ask doctors and nurses to go immediately down to the border and start taking care of these kids what kind of country are we running here where we have a president of the united states who s so focused on hate and fear and division and what has happened now the end result is now we ve got kids literally laying in their own snot with three week old diapers that haven t been changed we ve got to tell this president that is not a sign of strength mr president that is a sign of weakness guthrie senator booker a lot of people they asked the question if you re president on day one what will you do with the fact that you will have families here there s been a lot of talk about what you ll do in the first 100 days about legislation what will you actually do with these families how will you care for them will they be detained or will they not be booker well this is a related and brief point because what we re talking what secretary castro and i are talking about is that we have the power to better deal with this problem through the civil process than the criminal process i have been to some of the largest private prisons which are repugnant to me that people are profiting off incarceration and their immigration lockups our country has made so many mistakes by criminalizing things whether it s immigration whether it s mental illness whether it s addiction we know that this is not the way to deal with problems there is a humane way that affirms human rights and human dignity and actually solves this problem donald trump isn t solving this problem we ve seen under his leadership a surge at our border we solve this problem by making investments in the northern triangle to stop the reasons why people are being driven here in the first place and we make sure we use our resources to provide health care to affirm the values and human dignity of the people that come here because we cannot sacrifice our values our ideals as a nation for border security we can have both by doing this the right way guthrie all right senator thank you let me go to governor inslee on this what would you do on day one same question i just asked cory booker i have yet to hear an answer from anyone on this stage inslee there is no reason guthrie what will you do with the families that will be here inslee there is no reason for the detention and separation of these children they should be released pending their hearings and they should have a hearing and the law should be followed that s what should happen and we should do what we re doing in washington state i m proud that we ve passed a law that prevents local law enforcement from being turned into mini ice agents i m proud to have been the first governor to stand up against donald trump s heinous muslim ban i m proud to be a person who s not only talked about dreamers but being one of the first to make sure that they get a college education so that they can realize their dreams these are some of the most inspirational people in our state and i ll leave you with this thought if you want to know what i think donald trump the other day tried to threaten me he thought it was a threat to tell me that he would send refugees into washington state if we passed a law that i passed and i told him that s not a threat at all we welcome refugees into our state we recognize diversity as a strength this is how we ve built america that tradition is going to continue if i m president of the united states holt we re going to switch to another topic now we ve got a lot to get to let s delaney my grandfather was actually separated from his family when he came to this country holt we re going to we re going to talk about iran right now because we re working against the clock tankers have been attacked a u s drone has been shot down there have been disturbing threats issued by both the u s and iranian leadership i d like if you can just for a moment to put aside how you think we may have gotten here but what i want to know is how do you dial it back so a show of hands who as president would sign on to the 2015 nuclear deal as it was originally negotiated that s every well senator booker why not booker may i address that first and foremost it was a mistake to pull out of that deal and one of the reasons why we re seeing this hostility now is because donald trump is marching us to a far more dangerous situation literally he took us out of a deal that gave us transparency into their nuclear program and pushed back a nuclear breakout 10 20 years and now we see iran threatening to go further and who are pulled being pulled further and further into this crisis we need to renegotiate and get back into a deal but i m not going to have a primary platform to say unilaterally i m going to rejoin that deal because when i m president of the united states i m going to do the best i can to secure this country and that region and make sure that if i have an opportunity to leverage a better deal i m going to do it holt all right senator klobuchar i d like to ask you to answer that question because you ve said you ve said you would negotiate yourself back into the iranian agreement can you argue that that nuclear pact as it was ratified was a good deal unknown yes it was klobuchar it was imperfect but it was a good deal for that moment i would have worked to get longer sunset periods and that s something we could negotiate to get back in the deal but the point is donald trump told us when he got out of it that he was going to give us a better deal those were his words and now we are a month away from the iranians who claim now that they re going blow the caps on enriching uranium and the iranians have told us this and so that s where we are now he has made us less safe than we were when he became president so what i would do is negotiate us back into that agreement is stand with our allies and not give unlimited leverage to china and russia which is what he has done and then finally i would make sure that if there is any possibility of a conflict and we re having this debate in congress right now that he comes to congress for an authorization of military force i would do that and this president is literally every single day 10 minutes away from going to war one tweet away from going to war and i don t think we should conduct holt all right your time is up klobuchar foreign policy in our bathrobe at 5 00 in the morning which is what he does holt congresswoman gabbard congresswoman gabbard you ve said you would sign back on to the 2015 deal would you would you insist though that it address iran s support for hezbollah gabbard let s deal with the situation where we are where this president and his chickenhawk cabinet have led us to the brink of war with iran i served in the war in iraq at the height of the war in 2005 a war that took over 4 000 of my brothers and sisters in uniforms lives the american people need to understand that this war with iran would be far more devastating far more costly than anything that we ever saw in iraq it would take many more lives it would exacerbate the refugee crisis and it wouldn t be just contained within iran this would turn into a regional war this is why it s so important that every one of us every single american stand up and say no war with iran we need to get back into the iran nuclear agreement and we need to negotiate how we can improve it it was an imperfect deal there are issues like their missile development that needs to be addressed we can do both simultaneously to prevent iran from developing a nuclear weapon and preventing us from going to war holt your time is up and this is a very quick follow up but what would your red line be that would for military action against iran gabbard look obviously if there was an attack against the american our troops then there would have to be a response but my point is and it s important for us to recognize this is donald trump and his cabinet mike pompeo john bolton and others are creating a situation that just a spark would light off a war with iran which is incredibly dangerous that s why we need to de escalate tensions trump needs to get back into the iran nuclear deal and swallow his pride put the american people first de blasio hey but wait a minute guthrie we will have much more mayor de blasio we ll have more the commercial is coming when we ll continue our questioning next with chuck todd rachel maddow stick around we ll have a lot more with some very anxious candidates just ahead holt and welcome back everyone to the first democratic presidential debate from the arsht center in miami guthrie and as we continue the questioning time to get more members of our team in the mix diaz balart so right now let s turn it over to chuck todd and rachel maddow take it away maddow all right we re going to start by recapping the rules twenty candidates qualified for this first democratic debate we re going to hear from 10 tonight 10 more tomorrow the breakdown for each night was selected at random now the candidates will have 60 seconds to answer 30 seconds for a follow up if necessary and we will be ruthless if necessary todd we can do that by the way hi rachel maddow hi chuck todd how are you doing maddow good todd and we ve got a lot of ground to cover we re going to be talking about guns and climate here up top a whole lot more in this hour obviously because of the size of the field not every person will be able to weigh in on everything but over the course of this next hour we will hear from everyone i promise everybody todd and to begin with we re going to go with guns and senator warren i want to start with you we are less than 50 miles from parkland florida where 17 people were killed in a school shooting last year and where there has been significant activism on gun violence ever since many of you are calling for a restoration of an assault weapons ban but even if implemented there will still be hundreds of millions of guns in this country should there be a role for the federal government unknown their mikes are on todd everybody s mikes are on i think we have a i heard that too that s ok i think we had a little mike issue in the back maddow control room we ve got todd we had the i think we heard yeah we have the audience audio all right so the question is simply this we re from i apologize you guys didn t get to hear this the first part of the question obviously we re not far from parkland florida gun activism has become a big part of high school life up there in broward county many of you are calling for tighter gun restrictions some of you are calling for the restoration of the assault weapons ban but even if it s put in place there are still going to be perhaps hundreds of millions of guns still on the streets is there a role for the federal government in order to to play in order to get these guns off the streets maddow what s happening todd we are hearing our colleague s audio if the control room could turn off the mikes todd yeah if the control room could turn off the mikes of our previous moderators we will maddow you know we ve prepared for everything todd guess what guys we are going to take a quick break we re going to get this technical situation fixed we will be right back todd we believe we have the technical difficulties fixed maddow never say that todd never say never but we will march forward here and i will lean forward here a little bit senator warren we re going to get to the gun question here in parkland florida it s just north of here in broward county as you know it has created a lot of teenage activism on the gun issue it has inspired a lot of you to come out with more robust plans to deal with guns including assault weapons ban but even if you re able to implement that what do you do about the hundreds of millions of guns already out there and does the federal government have to play a role in dealing with it warren so in this period of time that i have been running for president i ve had more than 100 town halls i ve taken more than 2 000 unfiltered questions and the single hardest questions i ve gotten i got one from a little boy and i got one from a little girl and that is to say when you re president how are you going to keep us safe that s our responsibility as adults seven children will die today from gun violence children and teenagers and they won t just die in mass shootings they ll die on sidewalks they ll die in playgrounds they ll die in people s backyards gun violence is a national health emergency in this country and we need to treat it like that so what can we do we can do the things that are sensible we can do the universal background checks we can ban the weapons of war but we can also double down on the research and find out what really works where it is that we can make the differences at the margins that will keep our children safe we need to treat this like the virus that s killing our children todd ok thank you senator warren you didn t address do you think the federal government needs to go and figure out a way to get the guns that are already out there warren what i think we need to do is we need to treat it like a serious research problem which we have not done you know guns in the hands of a collector who s had them for decades who s never fired them who takes safety seriously that s very different from guns that are sold and turned over quickly we can t treat this as an across the board problem we have to treat it like a public health emergency that means bring data to bear and it means make real change in this country whether it s politically popular or not todd thank you senator senator booker you have a program warren we need to fight for our children todd senator booker you have a federal government buyback program in your plan how is that going to work booker well first of all i want to say my colleague and i both have been hearing this on the campaign trail but what s even worse is i hear gunshots in my neighborhood i think i m the only one i hope i m the only one on this panel here that had seven people shot in their neighborhood just last week someone i knew shahad smith was killed with an assault rifle at the top of my block last year for millions of americans this is not a policy issue this is an urgency and for those that have not been directly affected they re tired of living in country where their kids go to school to learn about reading writing and arithmetic and how to deal with an active shooter in their school this is something that i m tired of and i m tired of hearing people all they have to offer is thoughts and prayers in my faith people say faith without works is dead so we will find a way but the reason we have a problem right now is we ve let the corporate gun lobby frame this debate it is time that we have bold actions and a bold agenda i will get that done as president of the united states because this is not about policy this is personal todd thank you senator booker maddow secretary castro i d like to talk to you about something that senator booker just mentioned there the idea of active shooter drills in schools as school shootings seem like an almost everyday or every week occurrence now they don t make a complete news cycle anymore no matter the death toll as parents are so afraid as their kids go off to school that their kids will be caught up in something like this next to nothing has changed in federal law that might affect the prevalence of school shootings is this a problem that is going to continue to get worse over our lifetimes or is there something that you would do as president that you really think would turn it around castro you know rachel i am the dad of a 10 year old girl carina who s here tonight and the worst thing is knowing that your child might be worried about what could happen at school a place that s supposed to be safe the answer to your question is no we don t have to accept that and i believe that on january 20 2021 at 12 01 p m we re going to have a democratic president a democratic house and a democratic senate and the activists of parkland folks from moms demand who have risen up across the united states and inspired so many people you know we may not have seen yet legislative action but we re getting closer the house took a vote in the senate the question often is if the decision is between 60 votes a filibuster or passing commonsense gun reform i m going to choose commonsense gun reform so i believe that we re going to be able to get that done in 2021 todd secretary castro thank you ryan rachel i have something to add to this briefly because maddow we ll give you it ll be 30 seconds for a follow up on that question on that answer from secretary castro congressman ryan ryan you re talking about in the schools these kids are traumatized i support all the gun reforms here we need to start dealing with the trauma that our kids have we need trauma based care in every school we need social and emotional learning in every school ninety percent of the shooters who do school shootings come from the school they re in and 73 percent of them feel shamed traumatized or bullied we need to make sure that these kids feel connected to the school that means a mental health counselor in every single school in the united states we need to start playing offense if our kids are so traumatized that they re getting a gun and going into our schools we re doing something wrong too and we need reform around trauma based care maddow thank you congressman ryan todd congressman o rourke you re a texan who s campaigned you campaigned all over the state in 2018 in the most conservative parts there what do you tell a gun owner who may agree with you on everything else ok but says you know what the democrats if i vote for them in there they re going to take my gun away and even though i agree with you on all these other issues how do you have that conversation o rourke here s how we have that conversation in texas i shared with them what i learned from those students who survived the santa fe high school shooting a young student named bree her friend marcel who survived another shooting the mother of a victim who lost her life rhonda hart they talked about universal background checks where you close every loophole we know that they save lives we talked about ending the sales of assault weapons into our communities those weapons of war were designed to kill people as effectively and as efficiently as possible they should belong on the battlefield and not in our communities red flag laws so if someone poses a danger to themselves or to someone else they re stopped before it s too late and what i found in each one of those 254 counties is that democrats and independents and republicans gun owners and non gun owners alike agreed but this effort must be led by the young people that you referenced at the beginning of this issue those students from marjory stoneman douglas led the charge here in florida and they ve been able to change those laws they re making our democracy work ensuring that our values and our interests and our priorities are reflected in the laws that we pass todd thank you congressman o rourke hang on let me give 30 seconds senator klobuchar the iron range i m curious gun confiscation right if the government is buying back how do you not have that conversation klobuchar well that s not confiscation you could give them the offer to buy back their gun but i ll say this i look at these proposals and i say does this hurt my uncle dick and his deer stand coming from a proud hunting and fishing state these proposals don t do that when i was a prosecutor i supported the assault weapons ban when i was in the senate i saw those moms from sandy hook come and try to advocate for change and we all failed and then now these parkland kids from florida they started literally a national shift you know why it s just like with gay marriage when kids talked to their parents and their grandparents they say i don t understand why we can t put these sensible things in place they listen and if we get bested by a bunch of 17 year olds todd all right senator thank you klobuchar it s the best thing that ever happened we need to get todd senator thank you senator thank you maddow senator booker let me go to you on another matter actually todd we ve got to maddow senator mitch mcconnell says that his most consequential achievement as senate majority leader was preventing president obama from filling a supreme court seat having served with republicans on the judiciary committee do you believe they would confirm your court nominees booker i m going to use 20 of my seconds just to say there s one thing we don t all agree with when it comes to guns and i think it s common sense and over 70 percent of americans agree with me if you need a license to drive a car you should need a license to buy and own a firearm and not everybody in this field agrees with that but in states like connecticut that did that they saw 40 percent drops in gun violence and 15 percent drops in suicides we need to start having bold agendas on guns when it comes to the supreme court very clearly we i agree with my friend secretary castro we are going to get to 50 votes in the senate this is a team sport whoever is our nominee needs to campaign in places like south carolina because we can elect jamie harrison they need to campaign in places like iowa because we can win a senate seat there this is about getting us back to having 50 votes in the senate and more so that we cannot only balance the supreme court but start to pass an aggressive agenda that frankly isn t so aggressive because most of america agrees with the policy objectives of our party maddow mayor de blasio delaney rachel we have to actually maddow congressman delaney you ll have some time in a moment on this issue delaney this issue is related maddow congressman delaney i ll give you some time in a moment mayor de blasio as an executive in the largest city in this country you are used to saying what you want to have happen and having it happen if you nominate a supreme court nominee as president of the united states and mitch mcconnell is still senate majority leader what makes you believe that he would allow you to make a nominee de blasio rachel i am chief executive of the nation s largest city and i also wanted to just say something quick on the gun issue and come to your question look i run the largest police force in america too and if we re going to stop these shootings we want to get these guns off the street we have to have a very different relationship between our police and our community i also want to say there s something that sets me apart from all my colleagues running in this race and that is for the last 21 years i have been raising a black son in america and i have had to have very very serious talks with my son dante about how to protect himself on the streets of our city and all over this country including how to deal with the fact that he has to take special caution because there have been too many tragedies between our young men and our police too as we saw recently in indiana so we need to have a different conversation in this country about guns but also a different conversation about policing that brings policing community together we ve done that in new york city and we ve driven down crime while we ve done it but to your question about mitch mcconnell there is a political solution that we have to come to grips with if the democratic party would stop acting like the party of the elites and be the party of working people again and go into states including red states to convince people we re on their side we can put pressure on their senators to actually have to vote for the nominees that are put forward maddow that s time todd senator warren i m going to get you i will get you 30 seconds i promise let me get let me get this question we re trying i know you guys we ve got other issues we re trying to get to including a big one coming up in a minute but senator warren i want to continue on the mitch mcconnell thing because you have a lot of ambitious plans warren i do todd you have a plan for that ok we talked about the supreme court do you have a plan to deal with mitch mcconnell if you don t beat him in the senate if he s still sitting there as the senate majority leader it s very plausible you be elected president with a republican senate do you have a plan to deal with mitch mcconnell warren i do we are democracy and the way a democracy is supposed to work is the will of the people matters now we have for far too long have had a congress in washington that has just completely dismissed what people care about across this country they have made this country work much better than for those who can make giant contributions made it work better for those who hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers and not made it work for the people well here s how i see this happening number one sure i want to see us get a democratic majority in the senate but short of a democratic majority in the senate you better understand the fight still goes on it starts in the white house and it means that everybody we energize in 2020 stays on the frontlines come january 2021 we have to push from the outside have leadership from the inside and make this congress reflect the will of the people todd i m going to get to i m going to get a couple of you in here i m going to get a couple of you in here thirty seconds congressman delaney you seem to believe you can do everything in a bipartisan manner mitch mcconnell doesn t operate that way he operates differently why do you think he is going to conform to your style delaney i think we need to get things done that s why i believe we need to operate in a bipartisan manner listen i will sign into law bills that come to the white house that are passed on a party line basis absolutely but all the big transformative things we ve ever done in this country s history have happened when huge majorities of the american people get behind them which is why we need real solutions not impossible promises we need to put forth ideas that work whether it s on health care creating universal health care so that every american gets health care but not running on making private insurance illegal the gun issue is related the gun safety issue is related because i can t tell you how many times i ve been with folks in western maryland and they ve said to me you know democrats don t do anything for us republicans don t do anything for us you fight all the time so they vote on that single issue todd ok delaney if we become the party of getting things done for the american people with real solutions and not impossible promises we ll be able to get all these things done todd i promised todd senator booker 30 seconds you how do you deal with mitch you ve been in the senate you can t get bills on the floor right now with mitch mcconnell presidents can t do it is president booker going to get his bills on the floor with senator mcconnell booker you know when i got to the united states senate going back to what de blasio said as an african american man in an african american dominated community i knew one of the biggest issue was criminal justice reform from police accountability to dealing with the fact that we have a nation that has more african americans under criminal supervision than all the slaves in 1850 and when i got to the senate people told me we could not get a comprehensive criminal justice reform bill done as my colleagues in the senate know i fought on that bill from the day i got to the senate built coalitions across the aisle and today we passed the first step act it s not as far as i want to go but thousands of people will be liberated i have gotten i have taken on tough problems people said we cannot achieve and i ve been able to get things accomplished todd thank you senator booker rachel has got the next question maddow we are going to hold on governor you re going to be happy with where we go todd just give us a second maddow governor inslee the next question is to you you got me inslee rachel maddow you have staked your candidacy on the issue of climate change it is first second and third priority for you you ve said it s all the issues let s get specific we re here in miami which is already experiencing serious flooding on sunny days as a result of sea level rise parts of miami beach and the keys could be underwater in our lifetimes does your plan save miami inslee yes first by taking away the filibuster from mitch mcconnell to start with we have to do that look it look it we are the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we are the last that can do something it our towns are burning our fields are flooding miami is inundated and we have to understand this is a climate crisis an emergency off mike this is our last chance in the administration next one to do something about it and we need to do what i ve done in my state we ve passed a 100 percent clean electrical grid bill we now have a vision statement and my plan has been called the gold standard of putting people to work but the most important thing on this in the biggest decision for the american public is who is going to make this the first priority and i am the candidate and the only one who s saying this has to be the top priority of the united states the organizing principle to mobilize the united states so that we can do what we ve always done lead the world and invent the future and put 8 million people to work that s what we re going to do maddow governor inslee thank you todd congressman o rourke you also put out a big climate change plan from your campaign you want some big changes in a pretty short period of time including switching to renewable energy pushing to replace gas powered cars in favor of electric ones what s your message to a voter who supports the overall goal of what you re trying to do but suddenly feels as if government s telling them how to live and ordering them how to live what is that balance like o rourke i think you ve got to bring everybody in to the decisions and the solutions to the challenges that we face that s why we re traveling everywhere listening to everyone we were in pacific junction a town that had never meaningly flooded before just up against the missouri river in iowa and every home in that community had flooded there were farms just outside of pacific junction that were effectively lakes those farmers already underwater in debt their markets closed to them by a trade war under this administration and now they don t know what to do we in our administration are going fund resiliency in those communities in miami in houston texas those places that are on the front lines of climate change today we re going to mobilize 5 trillion in this economy over the next 10 years we re going to free ourselves from a dependence on fossil fuels and we re going to put farmers and ranchers in the driver s seat renewable and sustainable agriculture to make sure that we capture more carbon out of the air and keep more of it in the soil paying farmers for the environmental services that they want to provide if all of us does all that we can then we re going to be able to keep this planet from warming another 2 degrees celsius and ensure that we match what this country can do and live up to our promise and our potential todd thirty seconds secretary castro does who pays for the mitigation to to climate whether it s building sea walls for people that are perhaps living in places that they shouldn t be living is this a federal government issue that needs to do that do they have to move these people what do you do about that where maybe they re building a place someplace that isn t safe who pays to build that house and how much should the government be bailing them out castro well i don t think that that represents the vast majority of the issue in fact you know my first visit after i announced my candidacy wasn t to iowa or new hampshire it was to san juan puerto rico because people should know that if i m elected president everybody will count and you know i m one of the few candidates in this race with executive experience with a track record of getting things done when i was mayor of san antonio we moved our local public utility we began to shift it from coal fired plants to solar and other renewables and also created more than 800 jobs doing that and when i was hud secretary we worked on the national disaster resilience competition to invest in communities that were trying to rebuild from natural disasters in a sustainable way that s the way that we re going to help make sure that we re all safer in the years to come and that we combat climate change todd thank you castro and if i m elected president the first thing that i would do like senator klobuchar also has said is sign an executive order recommitting us to the paris climate accord so that we lead again todd all right congressman ryan i got a full question for you here which is simply this there are a lot of the climate plans include pricing carbon taxing carbon in some way this type of proposal has been tried in a few places whether it s washington state where voters voted it down you ve had the yellow vest movement we had in australia one party get rejected out of fear of the cost of climate change sort of being put on the backs of the consumer if pricing carbon is just politically impossible how do we pay for climate mitigation ryan well there is a variety of different ways to pay we talked about different ways of raising revenue and i think we ve got to build our way out of this and grow our way out of this but let me just talk real quick to the previous question about real politics we could talk about climate we could talk about guns we could talk about all of these issues that we all care about we have a perception problem with the democratic party we are not connecting to the working class people in the very states that i represent in ohio in the industrial midwest we ve lost all connection we have got to change the center of gravity of the democratic party from being coastal and elital elitist and ivy league which is the perception to somebody from the forgotten communities that have been left behind for the last 30 years to get those workers back on our side so we can say we re going to build electric vehicles we re going to build solar panels but if you want to beat mitch mcconnell this better be a working class party if you want to go into kentucky and take his rear end out and if you want to take lindsey graham out you ve got to have a blue collar party that can go into the textile communities in south carolina so all i m saying here todd thank you congressman ryan ryan all i m saying here todd thank you congressman ryan castro so chuck chuck ryan all i m saying is here if we don t address that fundamental problem with our connection to workers white black brown gay straight working class people todd thank you congressman ryan none of this is going to get done chuck todd thank you very much unknown chuck todd i want to you we re going to keep moving congressman delaney i m going to get to you delaney this is i introduced the only bipartisan carbon tax bill todd thirty seconds all right 30 seconds go delaney this is really important all the economists agree that a carbon pricing mechanism works you just have to do it right you can t put a price on carbon raise energy prices and not give the money back to the american people my proposal which is put a price on carbon give a dividend back to the american people it goes out one pocket back in the other todd thank you congressman delaney i can get that passed my first year as president with a coalition of every democrat in the congress and the republicans who live in coastal states todd thank you congressman thank you delaney because republicans in florida they actually care about this issue todd ok thank you very much delaney this has got to be our way forward if we re actually serious about this issue congresswoman gabbard we re going to move here one of the first things you did after launching your campaign was to issue an apology to the lgbt community about your past stances and statements on gay rights after the trump administration s rollbacks of civil rights protections for many in that community why should voters in that community or voters that care about this issue in general trust you now gabbard let me say that there is no one in our government at any level who has the right to tell any american who they should be allowed to love or who they should be allowed to marry my record in congress for over six years shows my commitment to fighting for lgbtq equality i serve on the equality caucus and recently voted for passage of the equality act maybe many people in this country can relate to the fact that i grew up in a socially conservative home held views when i was very young that i no longer hold today i ve served with lgbtq servicemembers both in training and deployed downrange i know that they would give their life for me and i would give my life for them it is this commitment that i ll carry through as president of the united states recognizing that there are still people who are facing discrimination in the workplace still people who are unable to find a home for their families it is this kind of discrimination that we need to address booker but it s not enough todd thank you congresswoman gabbard booker it s not enough if i can add to this it s very important todd thirty seconds senator booker it s not enough look civil rights is someplace to begin but in the african american civil rights community another place to focus on was to stop the lynching of african americans we do not talk enough about trans americans especially african american trans americans and the incredibly high rates of murder right now we don t talk enough about how many children about 30 percent of lgbtq kids who do not go to school because of fear it s not enough just to be on the equality act i m an original co sponsor we need to have a president that will fight to protect lgbtq americans every single day from violence in america maddow senator klobuchar let me put this to you on the issue of civil rights for decades on the civil rights and demographics honestly and politics for decades the democratic party has counted on african american voter turnout as step one to winning elections on a national level democrats are counting on the latino community now and in the future in the same way what have you done for black and latino voters that should enthuse them about going to the polls for you if you re your party s nominee klobuchar my life and my career and my work in the senate has been about economic opportunity and to me this means better childcare for everyone in this country and when you want an economy that works you need to have retirement that works you need to have public schools that work and you also need to make sure that those communities are able to get those jobs of the future the stem jobs in fact donald trump one of the first bills that he signed of the 34 he signed where i was the lead democrat ok that s a first up here was one that was about that making sure minority community members could share in those jobs so to me this is about a few things it s about an african american woman that goes to a hospital in new orleans says her hands are swollen and then doctor ignores her and her baby dies it s about the fact that african american women make 61 cents for every dollar a white man makes so in short we need one and i will do this in my first 100 days as president we will work to make sure everyone can vote at this table everyone can vote in this country maddow that s time senator klobuchar and we will also go to the next step of criminal justice reform senator booker and i worked on that first step act but we should go to the second step act which is to help all our communities across our country maddow senator thank you very much thirty second follow up to you secretary castro this is a 70 percent latino city here in miami you are the only latino democrat who is running here this year in the presidential race is that enough of an answer what senator klobuchar is describing there an economic justice agenda is that enough to mobilize latino voters to stand with the democratic party in a big way castro well i also think that we have to recognize racial and social justice and you know i was in charleston not too long ago and i remembered that dylann roof went to the mother emanuel ame church and he murdered nine people who were worshipping and then he was apprehended by police without incident well but what about eric garner and tamir rice and laquan mcdonald and sandra bland and pamela turner and antonio arce i m proud that i m the only candidate so far that has put forward legislation that would reform our policing system in america and make sure that no matter what the color of your skin is that you re treated the same including latinos who are mistreated too oftentimes by police maddow secretary castro thank you todd let me go over to lester holt who s got a question i believe a viewer question holt and i m over here chuck thanks we asked voters from across the country to submit their questions to the candidates let me read one now this comes from john in new york who submitted this question he asks does the united states have a responsibility to protect in the case of genocide or crimes against humanity do we have a responsibility to intervene to protect people threatened by their governments even when atrocities do not affect american core interests i would like to direct that question to congressman o rourke o rourke john appreciate the question the answer is yes but that action should always be undertaken with allies and partners and friends when the united states presents a united front we have a much better chance of achieving our foreign policy aims and preventing the kind of genocide to which you refer the kind of genocide that we saw in rwanda the kind of genocide we want to stop going forward but unfortunately under this administration president trump has alienated our allies and our friends and our alliances he s diminished our standing in the world and he s made us weaker as a country less able to confront challenges whether it s iran or north korea or vladimir putin in russia who attacked and invaded our democracy in 2016 and who president trump has offered another invitation to do the same he s embraced strongmen and dictators at the expense of the great democracies as president i will make sure that we live our values in our foreign policy i will ensure that we strengthen those alliances and partnerships and friendships and meet any challenge that we face together that makes america stronger de blasio but what about the war powers act maddow congressman o rourke thank you de blasio what about the war powers act being a part of that equation with deep respect to the congressman look we ve learned painful lessons as americans that we ve gone to war without congressional authorization and look this is very personal for me i know the cost of war my dad served in the pacific in world war ii in the u s army battle of okinawa had half his leg blown off and he came home with scars both physical and emotional and he did not recover he spiraled downward and he ultimately took his own life and that battle didn t kill him but that war did and look even in the humanitarian crisis and i think we should be ready congressman to intervene god forbid there is genocide but not without congressional approval democrats and republicans both in the congress have not challenged presidents and have let them get away with running the military without that congressional approval we learned a lesson in vietnam we seem to have forgotten that decisions have to be made by the united states congress maddow i m going to pick up i want to pick up this point and i want to put this to congressman ryan today the taliban claimed responsibility for killing two american servicemembers in afghanistan leaders as disparate as president obama and president trump have both said that they want to end u s involvement in afghanistan but it isn t over for america why isn t it over why can t presidents of very different parties and very different temperaments get us out of there and how could you ryan i appreciate that question so i ve been in congress 17 years and 12 of those years i ve sat on the armed services committee the defense appropriations committee or the armed services committee and the lesson that i ve learned over the years is that you have to stay engaged in these situations nobody likes it it s long it s tedious but right now we have so i would say we must be engaged in this we must have our state department engaged we must have our military engaged to the extent they need to be but the reality of it is this president doesn t even have people appointed in the state department to deal with these things whether we re talking about central america whether we re talking about iran whether we re talking about afghanistan we ve got to be completely engaged and here s why because these flare ups distract us from the real problems in the country if we re getting drones shot down for 130 million because the president is distracted that s 130 million that we could be spending in places like youngstown ohio or flint michigan or rebuilding or rebuilding maddow congresswoman gabbard i m going to give you 30 seconds actually to jump off what he said he described engagement as the problem gabbard is that what you will tell is that what you will tell the parents of those two soldiers who were just killed in afghanistan well we just have to be engaged as a soldier i will tell you that answer is unacceptable we have to bring our troops home from afghanistan we are in a place in afghanistan where we have lost so many lives we ve spent so much money money that s coming out of every one of our pockets money that should be going into communities here at home meeting the needs of the people here at home we are no better off in afghanistan today than we were when this war began this is why it s so important to have a president and commander in chief who knows the cost of war and who s ready to do the job on day one i am ready to do that job when i walk into the oval office todd listen i m going to go down the line i m going to go down i m going to go down i m going to go down the line here you know what you felt you felt like she was rebutting you get 30 seconds go ryan thank you you re a very good man i appreciate that todd fair enough i hear what you re saying she invoked your name ryan i would just say i don t want to be engaged i wish we were spending this money in places that i ve represented that have been completely forgotten and we were rebuilding but the reality of it is if the united states isn t engaged the taliban will grow and they will have bigger bolder terrorist acts we have got to have some presence there gabbard the taliban was there long before we came in they re going to be there long before we leave ryan and they were yeah exactly well we were gabbard we cannot keep u s troops deployed to afghanistan thinking that we re going to somehow squash this taliban that s been there that every other country that s tried has failed ryan i didn t say i didn t say squash them i didn t say squash them when we weren t in there they started flying planes into our buildings so i m just saying right now we have an obligation gabbard the taliban didn t attack us on 9 11 al qaida did ryan well i i understand gabbard al qaida attacked us on 9 11 that s why i and so many other people joined the military to go after al qaida not the taliban ryan i understand that the taliban todd go ahead congressman finish up 10 seconds ryan the taliban was protecting those people who were plotting against us all i m saying is if we want to go into elections and we want to say that we ve got to withdraw from the world that s what president trump is saying we can t i would love for us to gabbard you know who s protecting al qaida right now it s saudi arabia todd i want to go down the line here finish up foreign policy it s a simple question what is our what is the biggest threat what is who is the geopolitical threat to the united states just give me a one word answer congressman delaney delaney could you repeat the question todd greatest geopolitical threat to the united states right now congressman delaney delaney well the biggest geopolitical challenge is china but the biggest geopolitical threat remains nuclear weapons todd ok delaney right so those are you know those are different questions todd i got you totally get it go ahead governor inslee inslee the biggest threat to the security of the united states is donald trump and there s no question about it todd congresswoman gabbard gabbard the greatest todd greatest geopolitical threat gabbard the greatest threat that we face is the fact that we re in a greater risk of nuclear war today than ever before in history todd senator klobuchar klobuchar two threats economic threat china but our major threat right now is what s going in the mideast with iran if we don t get todd ok try to keep it at one slimmer than what we ve been going here one or two words o rourke our existential threat is climate change we have to confront it before it s too late todd senator warren inslee climate change todd yeah senator booker booker nuclear proliferation and climate change todd secretary castro castro china and climate change todd congressman ryan ryan china without a question they re wiping us around the world economically todd and mr mayor de blasio russia because they re trying to undermine our democracy and they ve been doing a pretty damn good job of it and we need to stop them todd all right well thank you for that wide variety of answers and i mean that no i mean that in that s what this debate is about this is the best part of a debate like this congressman o rourke special counsel robert mueller s report outlines multiple instances of potential criminal behavior by president trump house speaker pelosi has publicly and privately resisted any move toward impeachment in the house if the house chooses not to impeach as president would you do anything to address the potential crimes that were outlined in mr mueller s report o rourke yes and i ll tell you why todd how by the way if the answer is yes o rourke one of the most powerful pieces of art in the united states capitol is the trumbull painting of general george washington resigning his commission to the continental congress at the height of his power submitting to the rule of law and the will of people that has withstood the test of time for the last 243 years if we set another precedent now that a candidate who invited the participation of a foreign power a president who sought to obstruct the investigation into the invasion of our democracy if we allow him to get away with this with complete impunity then we will have set a new standard and that is that some people because of the position of power and public trust that they hold are above the law and we cannot allow that to stand so we must begin impeachment now so that we have the facts and the truth and we follow them as far as they go and as high up as they reach and we save this democracy and if we ve not been able to do that in this year or the year that follows and under my administration our department of justice will pursue these facts and ensure that there are consequences there is accountability and there is justice it s the only way that we save this country todd thank you congressman o rourke maddow congressman delaney because of the accountability issues that congressman o rourke was just describing there and the real political landscape in which nancy pelosi is saying that impeachment will not be pursued in the house it raises the prospect and the mueller report raises the prospect that president trump could be prosecuted for some of those potential crimes down the line no u s president has ever been prosecuted for crimes after leaving office do you believe that president trump could or should be the first delaney i guess there s always a first maddow should he be delaney i don t think anyone is above the law i don t think anyone is above the law including a president i support speaker pelosi s decisions that she is making in the house of representatives right now as speaker i think she knows more about the decision as to whether to impeach the president than any of the 2020 candidates combined maddow conceded on the issue of prosecution delaney so but i do think i do think the no one is above the law and this president who is lawless should not be above the law but i will tell you rachel the one thing when you re out doing as much campaigning as i ve done 400 events all 99 counties in iowa this is not the number one issue the american people ask us about it s not they want to know what we re going to do for health care how we re going to lower pharmaceutical prices how we re going to build infrastructure what we re going to do to create jobs in their communities you know last year in our country 80 percent of the money for start up businesses went to 50 counties in this country there s over 3 000 counties in this country that s what they care about they care about what s going on in the public schools they care about what s going on with jobs in their communities with their pay with their health care with infrastructure these are the issues these kind of kitchen table pocket book issues maddow understood delaney are actually what most americans care about they never ask about the mueller report maddow congressman thank you your time is up delaney they never ask about it they want to know how we re going to solve these problems maddow your time s todd here s the thing i still senator klobuchar but if we let the republicans run our elections and if do not do something about russian interference in the election and we let mitch mcconnell stop all the backup paper ballots then we re not going to get what we want to do todd i ve got to sneak in we blew through a break which was good news to give you more time so i got to sneak one in now more of this debate it s picking up here it continues right after this holt we are back from miami and it s time now for closing statements each candidate has 45 seconds we want to begin with former congressman delaney delaney closing now holt closing 45 seconds we could make we could go on delaney together we are on a mission we re on a mission to find the america that s been lost lost through infighting lost through inaction we re so much better than this we re a country that used to do things we saved the world we created the american dream for millions of people like myself the grandson of immigrants the son of a union electrician who went on to become a successful business leader and create thousands of jobs but we did these things with real solutions not with impossible promises and those are the roots that we have to get back to i m running for president to solve these problems to build infrastructure to fix our broken health care system to invest in communities that have been left behind to improve public education holt your delaney i just don t want to be your president to be your president holt congressman your 45 seconds is over delaney i want to be your president to do the job holt thank you sir delaney this is not about me this is about getting america working again holt thank you guthrie mayor de blasio mayor your closing statement de blasio it matters it matters in this fight for the heart and soul of our party that we nominate a candidate who has seen the face of poverty and didn t just talk about it but gave people 15 minimum wage it matters that we nominate a candidate who saw the destruction wrought by a broken health care system and gave people universal health care it matters that we choose someone who saw the wasted potential of our children denied pre k and gave it to every single one of them for free these things really matter and these are the things that i ve done in new york and i want to do the same for this whole country because putting working people first it matters we need to be that party again let s work together with your help we can put working people first again in america guthrie thank you mayor de blasio right on time diaz balart governor inslee 45 seconds inslee off mike grandchildren we love them all and when i was thinking about whether to run for president i made a decision i decided that on my last day on earth i wanted to look them in the eye and tell them i did everything humanly possible to protect them from the ravages of the climate crisis and i know to a moral certainty if we do not have the next president who commits to this as the top priority it won t get done and i am the only candidate frankly i m surprised i m the only candidate who s made this commitment to make it the top priority if you join me in that recognition of how important this is we can have a unified national mission we can save ourselves we can save our children we can save our grandchildren and we can save literally the life on this planet this is our moment diaz balart governor thank you todd congressman ryan your 45 seconds ryan there s nothing worse than not being heard nothing worse than not being seen and i know that because i ve represented for 17 years in congress a forgotten community they ve tried to divide us who s white who s black who s gay who s straight who s a man who s a woman and they ran away with all the gold because they divided the working class it s time for us to come together i don t know how you feel but i m ready to play some offense i come from the middle of industrial america but these problems are all over our country there s a tent city in l a there s homeless people and people around our country who can t afford a home it s time for us to get back on track the teacher in texas the nurse in new hampshire the waitress in wisconsin all of us coming together playing offense with an agenda that lifts everybody up todd thank you congressman ryan i will only promise you one thing when i walk into that oval office every morning you will not be forgotten todd thank you congressman ryan your voice will be heard thank you maddow congresswoman gabbard you have 45 seconds for your closing gabbard our nation was founded on the principles of service above self people who fled kings who literally prospered on the backs and the sacrifices of people coming here to this country instead putting in place a government that is of by and for the people but that s not what we have instead we have a government that is of by and for the rich and powerful this must end as president our white house our white house will be a beacon of light providing hope and opportunity ushering in a new century where every single person will be able to get the health care they need where we will have clean air to breathe and clean water to drink where we will have good paying jobs and a new green economy join me in ushering in this new century with peace prosperity opportunity and justice for all maddow congresswoman thank you holt secretary castro you have 45 seconds sir castro me llamo julian castro y estoy postolando por presidente de los estados unidos the very fact that i can say that tonight shows the progress that we have made in this country like many of you i know the promise of america my grandmother came here when she was 7 years old as an immigrant from mexico and just two generations later one of her grandsons is serving in the united states congress and the other one is running for president of the united states if i m elected president i will work hard every single day so that you and your family can get good health care your child can get a good education and that you can have good job opportunities whether you live in a big city or a small town and on january 20 2021 we ll say adios to donald trump guthrie senator klobuchar the floor is yours klobuchar three things to know about me first i listen to people and that s how i get things done that is my focus i have a track record of passing over 100 bills where i m the lead democrat and that is because i listened and i acted and i think that s important in a president everything else just melts away secondly i m someone that can win and beat donald trump i have won every place every race and every time i have won in the reddest of districts ones that donald trump won by over 20 points i can win in states like wisconsin and iowa and in michigan and finally yeah i am not the establishment party candidate i ve got respect but i m not that person i am the one that doesn t have a political machine that doesn t come from money and i don t make all the promises that everyone up here makes but i can promise you this i am going to govern with integrity i m going to off mike i m going to govern for you guthrie thank you senator diaz balart speaking in spanish booker gracias fifty years ago this month my family moved into the town i grew up in because after being denied a house because of the color of their skin it was activists mostly white activists that stood up and fought for them that s the best of who we are as america and why when i got out of law school i moved into the inner city of newark to fight as a tenant lawyer for other people s rights i ve taken on bullies and beat them i ve taken on tough fights and we ve won and we win those fights not by showing the worst of who we are by rising to who s best donald trump wants us to fight him on his turf and his terms we will beat him i will beat him by calling this country to a sense of common purpose again this is a referendum on him and getting rid of him but it s also a referendum on us who we are and who we must be to each other it s time we win this election and the way i ll govern is by showing the best of who we are because that s what this country needs and deserves diaz balart senator thank you todd congressman o rourke 45 seconds o rourke our daughter molly turned 11

tonight if we re going to be there for them if we re going to confront the challenges that we face we can t return to the same old approach we re going to need a new kind of politics one directed by the urgency of the next generation those climate activists who are fighting not just for their future but for everyone s those students marching not just for their lives but for all of ours we ll need a movement like the one that we led in texas it renewed our democracy by bringing everyone in and writing nobody off that s how we beat donald trump that s how we bring this great country together
