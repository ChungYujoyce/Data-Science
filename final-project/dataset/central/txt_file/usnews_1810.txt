when roger stone was arrested on friday morning on charges connected to robert mueller s russia investigation the news came in the wake of long speculation reports emerged months ago that stone s finances and associates were the subject of investigation by the special counsel s team in may of last year he even solicited funds for his legal defense but the story of how roger stone got to this point takes place over decades not months stone s history with trump is a long one and his trump boosterism was in keeping with a political career going back nearly half a century though he had volunteered for the 1964 barry goldwater campaign it was richard nixon s reelection campaign that launched his career and he is no stranger to questions about his involvement in possible political wrongdoing his actions having been examined by the senate watergate committee stone first appeared in headlines in 1972 when as an up and comer in young republican circles he was named as the nixon campaign contact of a man called michael w mcminoway who was caught going undercover within the campaigns of nixon s democratic challengers mcminoway had served as a security guard near mcgovern s headquarters during the democratic national convention and passed along what he heard to nixon s team he was also identified as having infiltrated hubert humphrey s and edmund muskie s campaigns too a new york times investigation that summer revealed that mcminoway was just one small part of a much larger sabotage plot and that stone s involvement in that plot went deeper too for example an official told the times that during the primary season stone was sent to new hampshire to make a donation to a nixon challenger in the name of the gay liberation front and forward a receipt for the donation to a manchester n h newspaper publisher stone apparently wary of announcing he was there on behalf of a gay organization decided to make the donation in the name of the young socialist alliance stone also suggested to the committee to re elect the president that they hire a young man he knew to infiltrate radical organizations he would later acknowledge his part in the nixon campaign dirty tricks adding that he was just 19 when he made that new hampshire donation and under orders from his boss to do something that was not technically illegal though he has objected to being described as a bagman who kept his mouth shut even after watergate stone was vocal about his admiration for nixon about whom he has written books and whose face he has tattooed on his back my admiration of nixon has to do with his resilience the tattoo is a daily reminder that in life when you get knocked down when things don t go your way when you re defeated you got to get up and fight again he said in 2017 after nixon s resignation stone continued to have a hand in republican campaigns from both the inside and outside for example he served in ronald reagan s 1980 and 1984 campaigns by 1986 when time ran a cover story about lobbying the twin lobbying political consulting firms he ran with paul manafort republican strategist charles black former dnc finance chair peter kelly and lee atwater of willie horton ad infamy was hailed as the slickest shop in town stone who practices the hardball politics he first learned as an aide to convicted watergate co conspirator charles colson fancies 400 suits and lawn parties the story noted with his heavy lidded eyes and frosty demeanor he openly derides atwater s client vice president bush as a weenie at the time stone was working for bush rival jack kemp stone played a role as a consultant in the 1992 race and in 1996 made headlines when he was nixed from his role for the bob dole campaign though the campaign downplayed his role after his departure time reported that he was responsible for opposition research and bracketing which is the practice of sending spokesmen and hecklers wherever clinton is headed after that bounced from the establishment campaign stone seemed to turn his focus to what was then the fringe as he told the washington post in 1986 he always saw himself as an outsider a man who preferred taking risks to getting into any club and one risk in particular had caught his eye donald trump in 1999 time looked at how figures outside the usual political party framework including jesse ventura ross perot and yes donald trump were eying the white house at the time mainstream republicans welcomed trump to the fray on the idea that were he to run as a third party candidate the votes he would vacuum up would mostly come from the left central in helping trump make the decision was roger stone stone known in g o p circles for his dapper dress and libertarian leanings began urging the donald to run last spring trump wasn t interested the developer had dabbled in politics at least once before he spoke in new hampshire in late 1987 but soon lost interest three weeks ago trump called ventura and the two talked politics ventura urged trump to consider a run pleading for a nonpolitician to carry the reform party flag they discussed taxes regulation and campaign finance reform last week ventura called trump but did not commit to supporting him after that call trump asked stone to assess how the new yorker might fare under the ballot rules he is going to look at the race seriously stone told time by the time fortune profiled trump the following year during the same election cycle roger stone was his political adviser there s a john f kennedy type charisma that s very hard to put your finger on stone said of trump he s probably the best speaker on the circuit the duo would have an on again off again political relationship in the election cycles that followed but their link clearly runs deep even so stone would acknowledge it wasn t his own intuition or experience that first led him to trump the first person to imagine a trump presidency was not me but was former president richard nixon he told c span in 2017 as he related he was doing some post white house work for nixon in the mid 1980s when nixon happened to meet trump at yankee stadium nixon called me the next day and he said well i met your man i ve got to tell you he s got it he could really go all the way write to lily rothman at lily rothman time com
