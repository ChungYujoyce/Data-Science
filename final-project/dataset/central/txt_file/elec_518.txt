may be changing as many voters focus on how to win key states in the general election loading november 15 2019 who can beat donald trump for many voters turning up at democratic events in new hampshire that s the no 1 question on their mind progressives are coming under greater scrutiny even liberal voters who love sen elizabeth warren sbold ideas like medicare for all are questioning whether she can really win especially in the heartland the last thing they want is for mr trump to eke out another electoral college victory for that they re willing to compromise on issues they care about i m more worried about finding the candidate that can beat donald trump than policy says john keenan a father in concord standing with his young daughter outside the statehouse waiting for joe biden to emerge though former vice president biden has been the go to centrist candidate mr keenan is leaning toward mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana sen amy klobuchar of minnesota fellow midwesterner is also drawing larger more enthusiastic crowds we need to build a blue wall around those states and make donald trump pay for it says senator klobuchar who won reelection last year in 42 counties that went for mr trump as the new hampshire primary draws closer and average voters start coming out to hear the presidential candidates in person there s a common refrain at democratic events we want someone who can beat president donald trump and not just in coastal states like ours even some avowed progressives are expressing concern that as much as they love massachusetts sen elizabeth warren s calls for systemic change programs like medicare for all might be more than fellow voters across the nation can swallow especially in the heartland that may explain an uptick of interest in midwestern candidates like south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg and minnesota sen amy klobuchar as well as the last minute entry of former massachusetts gov deval patrick and the possible bid by a centrist like michael bloomberg despite the unusually large democratic field what s emerging is a deepening sense that beating mr trump will be no cakewalk a recent new york times pollindicated that among the front runners only former vice president joe biden would beat mr trump in a majority of midwestern battleground states and only barely we need to build a blue wall around those states and make donald trump pay for it senator klobuchar told a theater full of voters in rochester new hampshire so packed at lunchtime on a weekday that more than a few people had to stand to do that she emphasized the nominee must reach out not only to midwestern democrats but also to independents and republicans of conscience that message has won the support of patrick quinn a republican who credits president trump s tax cut with dramatically improving his income as a travel nurse but calls the president himself vile for the first time ever i started looking at democratic candidates says mr quinn who paid 45 for a ticket to a recent democratic gala in southern new hampshire headlined by senator klobuchar by the end of the night he was sold on her despite his friends reactions on facebook i m happy to donate to her campaign support her in any way that i can in particular mr quinn who still plans to vote for republicans in every race other than the presidential contest says he s impressed with the minnesota senator s bipartisan record she has passedmore than 100 billsas the lead democrat and was the primary sponsor ofa third of those compared with a handful for senators like bernie sanders and ms warren that no doubt contributed to her winning 42 counties in 2018 that had gone for mr trump just two years prior and what about in a face off a recent poll shows her beating the presidentby 17 points in the state the heartland is not flyover country to me ms klobuchar told a packed audience at a retirement community in exeter new hampshire earlier that day demonstrating how she would spar with mr trump on a debate stage she added i don t think about these farmers and workers in the middle of the country as poker chips in a bankrupt casino like you do as you bankrupt the country they are my neighbors and friends the go to candidate for centrist voters all along has been mr biden a roman catholic who comes from a blue collar family in scranton pennsylvania and is seen as having a more natural appeal to some of the white working class voters who ditched the democrats for mr trump in 2016 when he arrives at the new hampshire capitol to officially file his papers for the feb 11 primary the narrow hallways are packed with firefighters and other supporters chanting his name j o e for 6 0 3 they yell referring to the state s area code as the former vice president walks with his wife past gilded portraits depicting new hampshire statesmen young staffers beat on upside down plastic buckets hastily painted the day before leaving a trail of blue paint chips behind them outside a modest crowd assembles in the frigid weather awaiting mr biden s exit they include voters who have just put the schedule of candidate visits on their fridge and are coming out for the first time as well as people like john keenan who saw the crowd and stopped to see what it was about i m more worried about finding the candidate that can beat donald trump than policy says mr keenan who was shopping with his daughter to replace her pink converse low tops he says he likes mr biden but also mr buttigieg and senator warren and adds that he knows it will take someone really strong to beat the president when mr biden is under the gun he s not as quick as he could be others dismiss the idea that mr biden is too old or should pass the baton to a new generation noting that he would be able to enter the white house on day one knowing how to run it and could leverage his many relationships with world leaders to repair america s alliances what better way to pass the baton than to right the ship and then pass it on to the next generation says chris a new hampshire voter who didn t want to give his last name because he is a federal employee the character of our nation is on the ballot mr biden said when he took to the stage before a modest crowd that had braved snow squalls on a frigid friday afternoon he indirectly addressed the president s criticism around his and his son s involvement in ukraine i ve learned two things the last several weeks one is that vladimir putin doesn t want me to be president he says the other that donald trump doesn t want me to be the nominee he s scared of you shouts one woman amid more drumming and cheers in a five minute speech mr biden presents himself as the only one who can bring the country together and make progress on key issues like health care while still respecting americans freedom to choose for themselves mr biden is the only candidate who has a chance of beating mr trump says dianetta gilmore of brooklyn new york when he finishes pushing a cart of biden buttons toward a line of protesters on the sidewalk with medicare for all signs button sales haven t been good today though i tell you what she says sanders and warren are bringing them out in bigger numbers and that s not good indeed there has been tension throughout the campaign season over whether a crusader promising sweeping overhaul like ms warren or mr sanders is what s needed to energize democrats and get them to the polls in larger numbers while some back that theory others argue that it would be better to find a moderate candidate who can woo back former obama supporters who went for mr trump win over disaffected republicans and help the country heal mr buttigieg the 38 year old gay harvard grad and navy reservist tells voters they don t have to settle for one or the other don t let anybody tell you that we re going to have to choose either solve the problems or everyone is going to be united but we can t get anything done that s not an acceptable choice he said adding that the nation needs a president who can stand on the rubble of what has been busted in our society and in our politics pick up the pieces implement bold solutions to get something done about those issues and find a way to do it that s actually going to unify the american people get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox mr buttigieg has been raking in contributions lately even as mr biden sfundraising machine has sputtered amid apparent donor worries about the staying power of his candidacy the south bend mayor now has more offices than any other campaign in new hampshire and has nearly doubled his staff since the summer according to his campaign one voter from boston a 2016 delegate for mr sanders who didn t want to be identified because his clients come from across the political spectrum says he likes senator warren s policies but that recent polls have started to change his thinking mr buttigieg might be the candidate that strikes the right balance of being inspiring without triggering fear of change he says in particular he s concerned about the backlash medicare for all could create citing challenges with the affordable care act s rollout if you force that big a change you will upset a lot of people and eventually energize a lot of republican voters in 2022 or 2024 link
