string of incidents that took place over a roughly 24 hour period in which american military resolve was tested across the globe no americans killed or injured during any of these events but the timing was no coincidence with novel coronavirus cases among u s service members now at 2 486 and climbing america s adversaries are emboldened to test u s military dominance current and former defense department officials tell time earlier in the day u s space command reported the russian military had tested a missile capable of destroying u s satellites in low earth orbit not long

motorboats repeatedly ran alongside and crisscrossed in front of the much larger american ships at high speeds and close range at one point buzzing within 10 yards of a cutter s bow all three incidents came after north korea launched a barrage of short range missiles from ground batteries and fighter jets off their east coast the cluster of adversary action poses no serious threat to the u

restricts all military travel u s aircraft carriers floating symbols of american might are sidelined while it remains unclear how long the pandemic will loom over missions abroad u s rivals are seeking to exploit the gaps covid has created when the world and america are off balance it presents opportunities for our adversaries said chuck hagel a former u s defense secretary and republican

global health pandemic keep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter the u s military s playbook for deterring adversaries since world war ii is to project power by promptly deploying thousands of troops flying in nuclear capable bombers or dispatching aircraft carrier battle groups to problematic regions it s a practice that s taken on increased importance under president donald trump who relishes the military hardware paid for by his administration s 700 billion pentagon budget amid today s covid pandemic the options to demonstrate a show of force are severely limited the pentagon has thus far responded to the spate of threats rhetorically repeatedly publicly warning enemies not to confuse the current moment of national crisis as a weakness we will continue to carry out our mission assignments around the world in asia europe the middle east et cetera joint chiefs chairman general mark milley told reporters tuesday at the pentagon our readiness is still high our readiness is still strong we are able to deter and defeat any challenges that may seek to take advantage of these opportunities at this point of crisis the aircraft carrier uss theodore roosevelt the anchor of a deterrent force against china s advances in the south china sea has been docked in guam indefinitely a covid outbreak swept through the ship s 4 865 person crew last month and has since infected at least 615 sailors killed one and sent five others into a guam hospital the only other american carrier deployed in the pacific the uss ronald

the air force for its part attempted to project power this week by parading 14 aircraft on a runway in guam the military publicized the so called elephant walk which included b 52 bombers and kc 135 refueling tankers more than a half century old meanwhile north korean leader kim jong un china s ally has been carrying out his own military exercises after voluntarily pausing missile launches last year pyongyang has blasted off a wide range of missiles in recent weeks the launches are seen as an attempt to demonstrate strength and deterrence both internally and externally amid the covid pandemic according to analysts with the united states institute of peace in many ways that s nothing new the chinese and north korean actions are business as usual by america s two adversaries in the region says zack cooper an asia expert at the american enterprise institute the sentiment is shared by jeffrey lewis a nuclear weapons analyst with the james martin center for nonproliferation studies in monterey california who says north korea is pursuing a backlog of tests now that diplomacy with the u s has floundered we re in the post diplomacy period now he said we re just waiting for them to test what s next the big stuff is yet to come iran another longtime adversary has also been ramping up its efforts to strengthen its influence in the region and attempt to drive u s troops out despite fighting a widespread covid outbreak at home iran has not relented on backing armed attacks on american forces on iraqi bases through its proxy militias the iranians are keen on demonstrating to the u

by ramping up its internal covid testing and isolating healthy troops after a negative test service members have to do a 14 day quarantine before going back to the business of being a soldier sailor or marine military laboratories are now processing about 9 000 tests a day our desire our aspiration is to expand testing especially for groups that are going to be in tighter quarters such as sub crews bomber crews basic trainees and things like that milley said we ve got an objective here of ramping that up to about 60 000 tests here in about 45 days or so even when the military s battle
