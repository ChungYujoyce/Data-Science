in the day he could frustrate me and i know he d say the same thing about me but he also made me better bush also noted current political tensions and spoke of mccain as a voice of reason among adversity john detested the abuse of power he could not abide bigots he said there was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy to speak for forgotten people in forgotten places bush defeated mccain for the republican presidential nomination in a bitterly fought 2000 presidential primary in which allegations against mccain s family ran wild mccain notably fought bush on many of his policies when bush became president advocating against bush s tax cut plans fighting his energy bill and questioning his management of the pentagon but between campaigns and political feuds mccain and bush maintained a cordial relationship despite their long political history bush and mccain were cordial bush is listed as a friend in the program for saturday s ceremony bush also

eulogy of john mccain cindy and the mccain family i am honored to be with you to offer my sympathies and to celebrate a great life the nation joins your extraordinary family in grief and gratitude for john mccain some lives are so vivid it s difficult to imagine them ended some voices are so vibrant and distinctive it s hard to think of them stilled a man who seldom rested is laid to rest and his absence is tangible like the silence after a mighty roar the thing about john s life was the amazing sweep of it from a tiny prison cell in vietnam to the floor of the united states senate from troublemaking plebe to presidential candidate wherever john passed throughout the world people immediately knew there was a leader in their midst in one epic life was written the courage and greatness of our country for john and me there was a personal journey a hard fought political history back in the day he could frustrate me and i know he d say the same thing about me but he also made me better in recent years we sometimes talk ph of that intense period like football players remembering a big game in the process rivalry melted away in the end i got to enjoy one of life s great gifts the friendship of john mccain and i ll miss him moments before my last debate ever with senator john kerry in phoenix i was trying to gather some thoughts in the holding room i felt a presence opened my eyes and six inches from my face was mccain who yelled relax relax john was above all a man with a code he lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country he was courageous with a courage that frightened his captors and inspired his countrymen he was honest no matter whom it offended presidents were not spared he was honorable always recognizing that his opponents were still patriots and human beings he loved freedom with the passion of a man who knew its absence he respected the dignity inherent in every life a dignity that does not stop at borders and cannot be erased by dictators perhaps above all john detested the abuse of power he d not abide bigots and swaggering despots there was something deep inside him that made him stand up for the little guy to speak for forgotten people in forgotten places one friend from his naval academy days recalls how john while a lowly plebe reacted to seeing an upperclassman verbally abuse a steward against all tradition he told the jerk to pick on someone his own size it was a familiar refrain during his six decades of service where did such strength and conviction come from perhaps from a family where honor was in the atmosphere or from the firsthand experience of cruelty which left physical reminders that lasted his whole life or from some deep well of moral principle whatever the cause it was this combination of courage and decency that defined john s calling and so closely paralleled the calling of his country it s this combination of courage and decency that makes the american military something new in history an unrivaled power for good it s this combination of courage and decency that set america on a journey into the world to liberate death camps to stand guard against extremism and to work for the true peace that comes only with freedom john felt these commitments in his bones it is a tribute to his moral compass that dissidents and prisoners in so many places from russia to north korea to china knew that he was on their side and i think their respect meant more to him than any medals and honors life could bring the passion for fairness and justice extended to our own military when a private was poorly equipped or a seaman was overworked in terrible conditions john enjoyed nothing more than dressing down an admiral or a general he remained the troublesome plebe to the end those in political power were not exempt at various points throughout his long career john confronted policies and practices that he believed were unworthy of his country to the face of those in authority john mccain would insist we are better than this america is better than this john as he was the first to tell you was not a perfect man but he dedicated his life to national ideals that are as perfect as men and women have yet conceived he was motivated by a vision of america carried ever forward every up ever upward on the strength of its principles he saw our country not only as a physical place or power but as the carrier of enduring human aspirations as an advocate for the oppressed as a defender of the peace as a promise unwavering undimmed unequaled the strength of a democracy is renewed by reaffirming the principles on which it was founded and america somehow has always found leaders who were up to that task particularly at the time of greatest need john was born to meet that kind of challenge to defend and demonstrate the defining ideals of our nation if we re ever tempted to forget who we are to grow weary of our cause john s voice will always come as a whisper over our shoulder we are better than this america is better than this john was a restless soul he really didn t glory in success or wallow in failure cause he was always on to the next thing a friend said he can t stay in the same experience one of his books ended with the words and i moved on john has moved on he would probably not want us to dwell on it but we are better for his presence among us the world is smaller for his departure and we will remember him as he was unwavering undimmed unequaled write to abby vesoulis at abby vesoulis time com
