 by robert farley posted on april 22 2016 donald trump falsely claims that while he has had 55 000 negative ads run against him john kasich has never had one negative ad against him while it s true that trump has had far more negative ads run against him in the presidential campaign it s simply not true that ohio gov kasich hasn t had any there have been92 tv ads that ran about 57 000 times against trump and 18 ads that ran about 9 400 times against kasich according to kantar media which tracks political advertising in fact trump himself ran an ad in ohio attacking kasich it ran 755 times trump the front runner for the republican nomination has criticized kasich who trails in third place for staying in the race kasich meanwhile has pointed out that he not trump beats democratic front runner hillary clinton in polls on a hypothetical general election matchup according to a real clear politics average of polls from march 24 to april 14 clinton leads trumpnationally by 9 3 percentage points whilekasich leads clintonby an average of 7 8 percentage points the other republican presidential candidate ted cruz trails clinton by an average of 2 3 percentage points trump says that s only because kasich hasn t been tested yet with negative ads a point he made duringa rally in ocean city maryland on april 20 at the 37 38 mark as far as kasich is concerned he will get slaughtered by hillary trump said he s never had one negative ad against him i ve had 55 000 negative ads kasich hasn t had one negative ad as soon as he has the first 10 ads against him he will drop like a rock believe me trump repeated the claim in an interview on nbc s today show the following day at the 40 second mark i ve been hit by 55 000 ads trump said i saw it on your show 55 000 negative ads and nobody else has you know you look at a guy like kasich he s never been hit by an ad because nobody cares frankly no it s true it s so true let s start with the adthe trump campaign itself ran against kasich in ohio in march the adsaidkasich helped wall street predator lehman brothers destroy the world economy a claim that earned a dubious four pinocchios from the washington post fact checker who described the claim as preposterous the post noted that kasich who worked at lehman brothers was one managing director out of 700 in a firm of 25 000 the ad included another misleading attack that kasich increased ohio s budget more than any other governor in the u s it s a claim that is based on skewed data as we wrote when a similar chargewas made in an ad by a pro jeb bush super pac according to andrew fitzgerald kantar media s senior political and environmental media analyst that trump campaign ad against kasich ran 755 times in ohio but it wasn t the first time kasich has been targeted by ads in the presidential campaign in fact we have written about several ads attacking kasich there was the ad we mentioned from the pro jeb bush right to rise super pac that relied on skewed data to falsely labelkasich as having the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country republican or democrat a similar claim was raised in several ads attacking kasich another ad from right to rise which targeted kasich in four different ads attacked kasich for voting to cut troop levels and military funding which is true but fails to mention that those votes in the early to mid 1990s came at a time in u s history post cold war when the debate on capitol hill was not whether to reduce troops or cut defense spending but by how many and how much that ad and others have also noted kasich s support for a medicaid expansion made possible by the affordable care act kasich has said he opposes the affordable care act but he supports the medicaid expansion which took effect jan 1 2014 another attack ad came from a pro ted cruz group that falsely claimed that democratic donor george soros gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to kasich the ad was later revised but still relied on guilt by association to make its point an ad from the conservative american future fund claimed kasich raised taxes by billions in ohio ignoring that kasich s overall plan resulted in a net tax cut all told there have been 18 ads run against kasich though some attack multiple candidates according to kantar media data those ads have aired just under 9 400 times fitzgerald told us while only one came directly from the trump campaign ads attacking kasich have been lobbed from groups supporting cruz bush chris christie carly fiorina and marco rubio trump certainly has a point that he has been the biggest target of attack ads according to fitzgerald trump actually undershot slightly when he said there have been 55 000 negative ads run against him according to kantar data as of april 21 there have been 92 separate ads targeting trump 11 from the clinton campaign and those ads have aired just under 57 000 times so using trump s measure the number of times negative or comparison ads have aired the score is 57 000 against trump and 9 400 against kasich that s a big disparity but it s not 55 000 to zero q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
