the career of the longest serving member of congress in u s history john david dingell jr who died thursday in his home state of michigan at 92 was one of many votes but out of all the votes that the detroit area congressman cast during his nearly 60 years in the house of representatives one stood out his the single most important vote of all he said as part of an oral history recorded in 2012 was his yea vote for the civil rights act in 1964 dingell had arrived at congress at the height of segregation having been elected to replace his michigan congressman father who had died in 1955 just two weeks after rosa parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on a montgomery ala bus nearly a decade into dingell s congressional career president lyndon b johnson s civil rights act came before congress after dingell helped get the 1964 bill passed he faced a difficult primary redistricting meant that he was up against another incumbent congressman john lesinski with whom he had much in common including a polish family background and fathers who had also served in congress the big difference between them and likely the topic that would drive voters in one way or the other was on the issue of race as time described it back then the dingells were liberals and champions of the negroes who comprised some 46 of the population in their longtime constituency the lesinskis stood fast against any negro penetration of their own home ground of dearborn a virtually all white city of 115 600 predictably dingell this year voted in congress for the civil rights bill while lesinski was the only northern democratic congressman to vote against it dingell s vote took some courage in michigan s redistricting he lost most of his old negro constituency faced lesinski in a new district that included 80 of lesinski s old territory and was 90 white in the new district bordered by negro neighborhoods and beset by fears of black incursions the backlash so everybody thought was an obvious issue dingell accused lesinski s followers of trying to use it they re raising the bogeyman telling people that if i m elected there will be two negro families on every block in dearborn lesinski indeed raised some bogeymen the other day he cried in a typical speech a 35 year old man was set upon and stabbed by four colored fellows he was stabbed to death it didn t appear on tv or in the papers they hushed it up now that s the kind of thing that the people are worried about to believers in the backlash theory lesinski s victory seemed a cinch but dingell won by a vote of 30 791 to 25 620 in a district that was clearly liberal on almost every issue other than civil rights his liberal record was the big difference moreover as dingell himself said with more accuracy than modesty i can make an understandable and intelligent speech where my opponent frankly cannot dingell s victory the magazine surmised was a solid piece of evidence that the country had come further on civil rights than some had feared to dingell however the fear of possible backlash was less influential than another motivating factor doing what he felt was right i very nearly lost an election over it but it was the right thing to do it was the single vote that did the most to see to it that our country remained one and to finally begin the solution of the problems that triggered the civil war he once told an interviewer i was challenged in an election in which the wall street journal gave me a 1 in 15 chance of winning it was a hard fought campaign in which i asked people why is it that a white man or woman should be able to vote and an african american should not write to olivia b waxman at olivia waxman time com
