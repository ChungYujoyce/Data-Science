ridiculous as some of his critics appear to believe plenty that happenedon tuesdaygives trump and his allies succor and reminds democrats that ousting the president in 2020 will be more difficult than they previously hoped the wholesale repudiation of the president that the democrats had been hoping for didn t materialize trump s control on his own party is firmer than ever his base first strategy worked in enough places enough of the time and the president now feels emboldened to make major personnel moves without worrying about immediate electoral consequences as was demonstrated by the

associates with subpoenas and perhaps launch impeachment proceedings perhaps not but the gains are not negligible either trump s news conferenceon tuesdaywas intended to underline the argument that he had vanquished his political opponents as well as media naysayers when one questioner cordelia lynch of britain s sky news prefaced a question with the assertion that the results were not an absolute victory for trump hecut her offto insist that i ll be honest i thought it was a very close to complete victory highlighting gop wins in georgia and florida trump recounted his own involvement on the campaign trial and said i think we ve done an amazing job it was a great victory democrats would dispute that on the basis of their gains in the house a tally that is not final yet but seems likely to fall near 35 seats the democratic winning margin in the popular vote is projected by the new york times to be about 7 points once all the votes are counted that margin is very similar to the republican advantage in 2010 which was seen as a huge wave election still in terms of seats the gop losses in the house were well within the parameters of historical norms and offset by gains in the senate that s one reason why it s so difficult to settle on a single narrative about what happened the house losses for trump s party were less than those suffered by the two most recent democratic presidents in their first midterms president obama saw his party lose 63 house seats in 2010 president clinton suffered the loss of 54 seats in 1994 expectations are always central to political perceptions and democrats clearly had hopes of winning more resoundingly than they didon tuesdaynight several marquee races went or are headed in the gop s favor long shot challengers to incumbent

to concede in her bitter fight with secretary of state brian kemp though in her case the goal appears to be to hope that kemp finishes under 50 percent so abrams can force a december run off trump stressed his own efforts on the campaign trail in these and other states where republicans prevailed at his news conference he said he had campaigned with 11 candidates in the final week leading up to election day and that 9 had won perhaps even more importantly and more worryingly from a democratic perspective trump s hard line rhetoric on immigration in particular appears to have been effective in energizing his base that will surely presage more of the same as trump begins his 2020 reelection efforts despite the controversy engendered this cycle by his description of a migrant caravan from central america as an invasion and a tv ad that several networks including fox news pulled from the air over concerns that it was racist in terms of republican politics the gop is now wholly owned by
