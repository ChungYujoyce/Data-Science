twenty years ago a chubby and nearly unibrowed high school senior in south bend indiana wrote an essay about his political idol the then 57 year old vermont congressman who was unafraid to call himself a socialist tonight after effectively tying the iowa caucuses that young man will face off against his former idol pete buttigieg and bernie sanders will go head to head in the final debate before the new hampshire primaries next week in the essay which was written in 2000 buttigieg earnestly applauded politicians who eschew political and personal comfort and convenience because they believe they can make a difference he cited sanders as one outstanding and inspiring example of such integrity and praised him for his willingness to stand against the current of opportunism moral compromise and partisanship which runs rampant on the american political scene his essay which won the jfk profiles in courage contest ended with a line that now seems like a premonition above all i commend bernie sanders for giving me an answer to those who say american young people see politics as a cesspool of corruption beyond redemption i have heard that no sensible young person today would want to give his or her life to public service i can personally assure you this is untrue now of course buttigieg may be wishing he d picked a different subject for his essay and sanders may be wishing that buttigieg had found him a little less inspirational the iowa caucuses the results of which remain muddled appear to have resulted in a virtual tie between the two candidates buttigieg has used that momentum to jump in the polls in new hampshire he s now just a point behind sanders well within the margin of error and high school kid who once heralded sanders for his convictions and principles is now openly criticizing him as an uncompromising ideologue in that two decades old essay buttigieg described sanders as a a powerful force for conciliation and bi partisanship on capitol hill and praised him for his reputation as a peacemaker now buttigieg accuses sanders of embracing what he calls a my way or the highway approach i hear senator sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you ve got to go all the way here and nothing else counts buttigieg said in iowa last week he added that his two main opponents sanders and former vice president joe biden were stuck litigating the arguments of the past when asked about the essay in his cnn town hall thursday night buttigieg explained that he had commended sanders s bravery not necessarily his ideology what i really admired about senator sanders and still do is his consistency and willingness to say exactly what he believes buttigieg said it doesn t mean i agree with him i didn t agree with him on everything then and don t agree with him on everything now but i do believe that wherever we fall on some pundit s ideological spectrum we have a responsibility to talk about what we believe in and to make the case for what we think it s right when it s popular and when it s not meanwhile the vermont senator is punching back against his former acolyte i m reading some headlines from newspapers about pete buttigieg he said at an event in manchester friday morning enunciating buttigieg s name slowly as if he hadn t quite gotten used to saying it yet pete buttigieg has most exclusive billionaire donors of any democrats that was from forbes sanders said the hill pete buttigieg tops billionaire donor list fortune pete buttigieg takes lead as big business candidate in 2020 field washington post pete buttigieg lures even closer look from wall street donors following strong iowa caucus performance forbes magazine here are the billionaires backing pete buttigieg s presidential campaign most of all the essay reads as a reminder of the gaping forty year age difference between the two democratic frontrunners buttigieg 38 is young enough to have looked up to sanders when he was a kid while sanders 78 is old enough to be competing against someone nearly young enough to be his grandchild and in there the essay contains the seed of both frontrunners arguments against each other buttigieg arrived too soon and sanders stuck around for too long correction feb 8 the original version of this story misstated the age difference between bernie sanders and pete buttigieg it is 40 years not 50 years write to charlotte alter at charlotte alter time com
