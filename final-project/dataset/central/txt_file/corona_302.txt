made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more s own guidelines for easing social distancing restrictions unveiled on thursday leave the final decisions for those matters with state governors and those governors are facing growing pressure from the public in states such as ohio and michigan where protests have called on leaders to quickly lift stay at home orders and bans on large gatherings and to allow nonessential businesses to open their doors experts say those fights between local stakeholders eager to lift the economic shutdown and governors wary of losing ground against the virus will be the next battleground in the nation s pandemic response we ve already seen significant conflicts between state and local leaders over the imposition of social distancing restrictions exceptions to them and how they should be enforced said lindsay wiley a law professor at american university we ll surely see conflicts over decisions to ease them and it s a fight in which trump appears to be siding with those who want the restrictions to be lifted quickly trump and state governors appeared to reach a truce this week when the white house unveiled guidelines for phasing in a reopening of the economy that seemed to give wide latitude to states the federal recommendations came after trump and several state leaders recently exchanged sharp words over whether public health authority ultimately resides with federal or state governments you re going to call your own shots trump told the governors during a conference call according to the associated press we re going to be

s above my pay grade tucker murphy replied i wasn t thinking of the bill of rights when we did this we looked at all the data and the science and it says people have to stay away from each other that is the best thing we can do to break the back of the curve of this virus that leads to lower hospitalization and ultimately fatalities the landmark 1905 supreme court decision in jacobson v massachusetts held that constitutional rights can be lawfully restricted when emergency public health measures are in place though the precise scope of government public health power is not clearly defined but there has not been a direct legal ruling yet on mandatory stay at home orders and state and local leaders could find themselves dragged into court fights if they adopt an overly aggressive approach to enforcing mitigation measures wiley said governors and local officials may need to walk a tight line in enforcing restrictions harsh enforcement would probably trigger lawsuits that could be more difficult for state and local leaders to defend than the suits filed so far by churches gun shops and health care providers she said in addition to citizen protests another source of conflict could result from states moving on a faster timeline to reopen than cities where higher population density makes person to person transmission of the virus easier conflicts between state and local control are a common problem for public health measures wiley said we ve seen it with gun control and fast food regulation and now we re seeing it with social distancing within states the division of public health power is based on each state s constitution and statutes creating a complicated patchwork of authorities across the country in a majority of states the governor legislature or both have the power to override local governments in other cases state constitutions provide so called home rule authority giving a degree of autonomy to local leaders how these looming health conflicts are resolved will vary state by state and early signs are of a split among blue and red states with republican governors more eager to ease restrictions wiley said governors will face a challenge as they navigate the pressure and decide how to enforce restrictions pandemic plans urge leaders to avoid police crackdowns and to rely on enforcement against businesses and organizations not individuals she said maintaining the public s trust and cooperation will be critical over the months to years for which some degree of social distancing is likely to be needed view the discussion thread the hill 1625
