statesman senator jeff flake who also represents arizona wrote on twitter as you go through life you meet few truly great people john mccain was one of them said senate minority leader chuck schumer his dedication to his country and the military were unsurpassed and maybe most of all he was a truth teller never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare schumer

generations remember him i will be introducing a resolution to rename the russell building after him he said the arizona lawmaker who was absent from washington d c in the last months of his life was known as someone willing to stand up to his own party usually through words and sometimes through votes in july 2017 he voted no on the republican effort to repeal the affordable care act in july 2017 the dramatic thumbs down on the senate floor drew the ire of president donald trump and the two have often traded barbs trump in august notably neglected to mention mccain s name when signing a 716 billion defense policy bill named for the senator continuing a years long feud that dates to trump s campaign rallies during the 2016 election trump and vice president mike pence weighed in on mccain

obama said in his statement we saw our political battles even as a privilege something noble an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home and to advance them around the world we saw this country as a place where anything is possible and citizenship as our patriotic obligation to ensure it forever remains that way former president jimmy carter released a statement calling mccain a true patriot in the best sense of the word and former president george w bush who defeated mccain for the republican presidential nomination in 2000 called him a man of deep conviction and a patriot of the highest order he was a public servant in the finest traditions of our country and to me he was a friend whom i ll deeply miss bush wrote in a facebook post accompanied by a photograph of him and mccain in the oval office joe biden obama s vice president and mccain s longtime senate colleague whose son beau passed away from brain cancer in 2015 said that mccain s impact on america will continue to resonate for generations john was many things a proud graduate of the naval academy a senate colleague a political opponent but to me more than anything john was a friend former alaska governor sarah palin who mccain selected as his running mate in 2008 a pick that propelled palin into the national spotlight and a choice mccain later said he regretted tweeted that she was sending prayers to the mccain family john mccain was my friend i will remember the good times she wrote my family and i send prayers for cindy and the mccain family senate majority leader mitch mcconnell called mccain s passing a deeply sad day for the senate and our nation mccain wrote about how his cancer diagnosis forced him to realize his current term in the senate would be his last in his book the restless wave saying that it allowed him the freedom to vote my conscience without worry about getting re elected he also confronted his illness in the book with a reference to a line

wrote it s been quite a ride i ve known great passions seen amazing wonders fought in a war and helped make a peace i made a small place for myself in the story of american and the history of my times
