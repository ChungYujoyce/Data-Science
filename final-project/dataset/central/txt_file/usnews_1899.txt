some candidates run on policy others run on nostalgia pete buttigieg s unlikely presidential campaign is all about story more than any of his democratic rivals buttigieg has rooted his bid in the power of narrative betting that voters are sick of partisan bickering and ready to hear a new vision about healing america s divisions his is a campaign of imagery themes and characters a reassuring bedtime tale for voters who feel caught in a waking nightmare the policy debates that dominated much of the race have faded into the footnotes emerging when he s asked but rarely central to his pitch instead buttigieg the multilingual son of an english professor and a linguistics professor has returned his campaign s first language a message of belonging and healing that message the one that has so far lifted buttigieg from the unknown mayor of south bend ind to a serious presidential contender emphasizes hope and unity he talks about a country that can put the chaos behind us and turn the page to a new chapter that rejects the old playbook and stops focusing on who said what when our message about belonging is designed to make everyone feel welcome and my own search for belonging of course partly has to do with being different because i m gay he told time in an interview saturday afternoon as he drove from dubuque to anamosa on saturday but it s also part of what motivates me to help make sure anybody who s been made to feel on the outside knows that they have a home in this campaign that has meant reaching out to republicans as well as democrats conservatives as well as liberals the politically alienated as well as political activists his narrative is one of an america that s big enough to include even those who vehemently disagree a nation that can be healed through forgiveness not retribution it s classic big tent politics at a moment when much of the nation seems more wrapped up in drawing distinctions than in finding common ground a big part of why the presidency matters is the tone that it sets he told time there s no office like the presidency when it comes to setting the overall tone and sending the overall signals about what kind of country we are in a 30 minute interview buttigieg used the word message 12 times as he crisscrosses iowa visiting high school gyms and community centers and hotel ballrooms he urges crowded rooms to think of the image that guides this whole campaign which is the moment when the sun comes up and for the first time donald trump will not be president of the united states it s the political equivalent of once upon a time gone is talk of policy specifics he still mentions medicare for all who want it climate change and college affordability but it s rarely central to his stump speech he talks less about his fiscal or foreign policy agenda and more about an emotional agenda of addressing mental health curbing the opioid crisis and reducing deaths of despair buttigieg s campaign is far more focused on healing what he calls a crisis of belonging it s a tonal problem as much as a political one donald trump is the master of the politics of exclusion and the politics of wedge issues and the politics of pitting people against each other says mike schmuhl buttigieg s campaign manager we firmly believe that most americans want to have a future where they re together and they feel like they re united they can disagree on a bunch of stuff but that we re in this together in the american project it s a big bet that needs to pay off in iowa or the campaign risks collapsing altogether buttigieg s central pitch is that he can woo waffling conservatives and disaffected trump voters back to the party iowa with its midwestern sensibility and aging white population is buttigieg s first and best chance of proving his case if he can t show that the unity message works here it will be harder for him to argue his case as he heads into more diverse and progressive states where he has less of an organizational foothold it s going to be very important for us to show well in iowa and new hampshire buttigieg says winning over a group buttigieg calls future former republicans is central to that strategy his latest swing through iowa has emphasized counties that voted for presidents obama and then trump and his campaign has focused on courting conservative volunteers to reach out to their networks to caucus for him a strategy called relational organizing that emphasizes personal connections over cold canvassing the campaign has said that 45 of their precinct captains are current or former republicans he s the most reassuring candidate at a time when people are tired of waking up and seeing the tweets getting so freaking pissed off by the time you ve had your coffee says scott matter a former regional political director for the republican national committee who is now a precinct captain for buttigieg near ankeny a des moines suburb i think people want somebody they can look up to again you don t have to be worried he s going to say something that s going to embarrass your children we don t think you can win a general election by telling people that they don t belong if they don t agree with you on 100 of the issues said buttigieg senior advisor lis smith in a campaign roundtable hosted by bloomberg news in des moines on saturday morning the idea of electability has to be centered somewhat around who can bring people together and who can build a big tent democratic party in the traditional sense and i would say that we are the only campaign that is actively aware of that buttigieg s pitch to conservatives is based on tone not policy that idea of tone not everybody votes based on dots on an ideological spectrum he tells time i m not going to pretend to be conservative but i am going to make sure that folks see that there might be a place for them in this movement besides he adds these are not voters who are diehard partisans they don t think first about party they think first about the effects they re expecting on their lives some of the message is tailored to people who don t follow politics closely and may be unlikely to have strong feelings about the details of competing proposals folks may not all be policy buffs but they understand what policies mean to them buttigieg says when we talk about what it s going to take to keep kids safe from gun violence and act on climate you know it adds up to a message about how we re going to be a better country buttigieg s biggest challenge so far is his lack of support among voters of color buttigieg s strategy to reach them has changed he started by unveiling a racial justice plan titled the douglass plan which he billed as a comprehensive and intentional dismantling of racist structures and systems he tried to host rallies in south carolina none of it worked now he is focusing instead on lining up intimate conversations in black communities in order to build trust and support we ve certainly made sure to adopt new forms of engagement he says like a recent conversation about racial equity with charlamagne tha god in south carolina and smaller conversations about health equity and black owned small businesses on his swing through the south in december i think that s helpful in terms of building a relationship that s just different for me having to do it in a matter of months rather than decades so for buttigieg the message is the message senator bernie sanders is running a campaign based on the idea of a progressive revolution senator elizabeth warren is running on her policy proposals with a recent late pivot towards unity and former vice president joe biden is running on electability for voters who are motivated by ideology or policy plans buttigieg probably won t be their candidate but for such a cerebral candidate his pitch to iowa voters is rooted more in emotion than in passion in seeking a sense of peace rather than seeking particular policy outcomes buttigieg s own presidential aspirations hinge on whether iowans are compelled by his message of turning the page as he puts it if they don t the story of the young gay veteran who came out of nowhere to shoot to the top of the presidential primary may soon be coming to an end write to charlotte alter at charlotte alter time com
