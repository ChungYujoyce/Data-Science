presidential nominee hillary clinton arrives on stage during the final day of the democratic national convention in philadelphia when all was said and done team hillary had to be pretty happy their four nights in philadelphia turned out better than almost anyone expected thursday night featured an orchestrated symphony of praise for hillary clinton and a precision bombing of her opponent donald trump clinton s own remarks at the conclusion will not enter the pantheon of great american prose or political rhetoric but no one had been reserving a place there more importantly she provided a fitting conclusion to the proceedings meeting her own mark and cutting a convincing figure as the nation s first female president think of it this way she got it done no she didn t seem to be having fun doing it not half as much as barack obama did when setting the table for her the night before and not to mention her husband bill on tuesday night she did not have the magic michelle obama flashed on monday night when she moved the delegates and set the tone for a winning week yet hillary clinton s moment was the most important of all the one that marked paid to the entire enterprise and it played even better on tv than inside the convention hall more on why that was so in a moment whatever the judgment of the polls in the days ahead the party s quadrennial confab represented an achievement in careful and effective political management it was not just crisis survived but crisis transcended delegates and attendees cheer during the fourth and final day of the democratic national convention win mcnamee getty images hide caption delegates and attendees cheer during the fourth and final day of the democratic national convention let us reflect for just a moment team clinton and the democratic national committee hit town last weekend facing all kinds of bad weather first literally a heat wave studded with violent thunder lightning and downpours second a flood of bad publicity was unleashed with wikileaks release of nearly 20 000 emails from dnc staffers that revealed bias against rival candidate bernie sanders long assumed though often denied this evidence of the dnc tilt broke the dam on sanders fans bitterness and resentment and at that worst possible time third gale winds carried in the hot allegations and abuse from the republican convention the previous week in cleveland where the catchphrase chanted regularly by the crowds was lock her up all in all a troubled forecast but as people filed out of the wells fargo center on thursday night most all of them seemed remarkably satisfied even many of the sanders folks seemed resigned or at least not overly disappointed most were also willing to vote against trump even if they couldn t quite vote for clinton the intervening days brought tense moments the first afternoon the sanders forces were in full cry booing every mention of clinton s name there seemed to be little prospect for peace and many opportunities for disruption and chaos sanders delegates arrived lacking the votes to contest the nomination yet many seemed to believe sanders might still win they thought the release of the dnc emails proved clinton s nomination was rigged and they imagined this would be enough to pry open the delegate allocations or persuade superdelegates to switch to sanders these reactions overestimated the importance and power of the dnc which was important in many ways but far from critical in determining who voted or how still the wikileaks release served to confirm the suspicion that party rules and party rulers were somehow overruling the popular will of the people it was obvious that the dnc controversies fed into a rules committee decision to reduce the future numbers of superdelegates elected officials and party leaders who are uncommitted participants in the nominating convention and may vote their own conscience in 2020 such delegates will be reduced from 720 to 250 but negotiations were going forward even then sanders people were talking and there were delegation leaders willing to work overtime to heal wounds sanders himself having already formally conceded intervened to urge his delegates to show respect if only to preserve the gains they had made as a movement bernie sanders supporters wear bright shirts on the final day of the democratic national convention patrick t fallon afp getty images hide caption bernie sanders supporters wear bright shirts on the final day of the democratic national convention by thursday night the convention organizers had perfected their defense against the hardcore of holdouts where the sanders people wore bright yellow shirts to set themselves apart and held up signs protesting fracking or trade deals the clinton delegates sprouted american flags to wave about there were also much larger american flags on poles that seemed to appear just in front of the more visible concentrations of sanders people outside throughout the four days there were thousands of protesters from black lives matter and anti war anti capitalist anti fracking and just plain anti clinton groups they were kept away from the hall by barriers and police but they did dump a mock coffin labeled dnc over one fence police arrested a handful and issued citations to dozens more they did not manage to make much impression on those inside the arena despite all this there remained the thought that more unites us than divides us to quote candidate clinton in one of her early appeals to sanders supporters for many democrats the more unites us argument matters but does not truly motivate what focuses their minds is the prospect of losing the white house this fall while never welcome that prospect has become truly disconcerting to them with trump s takeover of the gop whenever the energy of the week seemed to flag a fresh assault on trump revitalized the proceedings on the final night the program reached an early emotional peak with the testimony of khizr khan the father of a young u s army captain killed protecting his troops from a truck bomb khizr khan father of deceased soldier humayun s m khan holds up a copy of the u s constitution as he delivers remarks on the final day of the convention alex wong getty images hide caption the father stood onstage with his wife and calmly haltingly voiced his rage at trump s proposed ban on muslim immigration khan held up his personal copy of the u s constitution to offer it to trump questioning whether the republican had ever read it he also wondered whether trump had ever visited arlington cemetery to see what other people had sacrificed for their country adding you have sacrificed nothing and no one in fact much of the program on stage this week in philly was clearly meant to appeal to disaffected republicans left feeling a chill last week in cleveland a basic element of this appeal was the robust embrace of traditional patriotism its rhetoric and symbols for example on thursday night the program offered retired marine gen john allen an old school combat commander who stood onstage with 37 other veterans of the iraq and afghanistan wars allen announced his support for clinton in full throated and almost apocalyptic terms while his silent chorus nodded and applauded behind him rich galen a longtime republican operative who was a spokesman for former vice president dick cheney sent a tweet saying he was watching from his kitchen thursday night in tears because the democrats convention looked more like his party than the event he saw in cleveland last week he was far from alone longtime gop strategist and campaign handler stuart stevens tweeted that thursday night looked more like the last night of the 2004 convention in new york than anything he had seen in cleveland that was the last year the republicans won the presidential election balloons fall over delegates and attendees at the wells fargo center in
