could the 2020 nominating process be any zanier you mightassume i m referring to the sheer size of the original democratic field or the obscene spending by former new york mayor mike bloomberg or maybe the fact that iowa can t count its votes and nevada can t explain its byzantine caucus system actually i m talking about the most counterproductive element in this circus extremely early voting candidates had only two days to campaign between saturday ssouth carolina primary and the 14 state primaries on super tuesday yetfolks in many of those states started voting weeks ago minnesotans began casting votes on jan 17 you know who was still in the race on jan 17 former massachusetts gov deval patrick businessman andrew yang former maryland rep john delaney colorado sen michael bennet businessman tom steyer former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg and minnesota sen amy klobuchar they re all gone but back in mid january early voters didn t know that vermont another super tuesday state began accepting ballots jan 18 one day after minnesota californians have been filling out super tuesday ballots since feb 3 with over a million votes cast before bloomberg first appeared on a debate stage and showed how inarticulate he really is before former vice president joe biden finally won a primary before vermont sen bernie sanders had kind words about cuban dictator fidel castro on 60 minutes and before massachusetts sen elizabeth warren showed some muscle does that timing make any sense democrats those running and those voting are stressed enough without competing with the calendar consider the fate of buttigieg s early voters in california roughly 3 million people had voted before he dropped out and based on real clear politics polling averagesmonday night that means about 240 000 californians gave him meaningless votes in texas the second largest super tuesday state about 1 million democrats voted early so based on the state polling average buttigieg received an estimated 55 000 early votes klobuchar who dropped out a day after buttigieg probably got about 150 000 early votes in california and 50 000 in texas and businessman tom steyer who quit the race late saturday received 105 000 worthless votes from the two states if the rationale for dropping out before super tuesday was to allow supporters to move to more viable candidates then early voting has ruined it for roughly 600 000 democrats in just these two states early voting in its various forms is part of an understandable effort to get more americans to participate yetthere is a gap practically and politically between getting out the vote and getting out the facts some early voting is certainly necessary to accommodate those stationed out of their state or country such as members of the military in 2009 congress enacted a law requiring absentee ballots for military voters to be available for mailing 45 days beforean election some states such as vermont decided to simply extend that privilege to all residents however federal law also requires a uniform day of voting in 2001 oregon s early voting was challenged but a federal court ruled that elections must only be consummated on election day as long as votes aren t counted until then it doesn t matter how early they are cast in the 2016 presidential primary nearly 60 of california s ballots were cast before election day that figure is likely to climb this year because the state has increased the number of ballots sent weeks in advance to registered voters whether they wish to vote early or not after buttigieg dropped out sunday night there were pleas from some of his supporters according to the los angeles times for a revote of coursethere is no such thing those who voted early for buttigieg are out of luck the only thing these people achieved with their wasted ballots is to remind us how rapidly things change votes like polls capture a moment in time and the snapshots taken 30 or 45 days ago are looking pretty fuzzy today a few weeks ago as nevadans were casting early votes ahead of the caucus i spoke to mystified democrats who were unable to grasp the early voting format on the early ballot voters were asked for their top five presidential choices about75 000 people three quarters of the total vote cast ballots during an early voteperiod that ended feb 18 the day before the las vegas debatethat was supposedto help nevadans make an informed choice fix trump s mess or blow it up democrats shouldsteer to the center after this year s messy nominating experience much will change caucuses are likely to disappear and the rules by which candidates qualify for debates will be revised early voting should be reexamined as well a one week voting period might make sense but opening the polls for a month or longer only enhances the likelihood of voter regret in the hours before super tuesday the remaining democratic contenders scurried after the biggest prizes california s 415 delegates and texas 228 only to be confronted by the fact that californians have been voting since feb 3 and texans since feb 18 as the philosopher yogi berra once observed it gets late early out there peter funt
