lead to lasting gains in employee benefits and safety protections it also could embolden union organizing efforts and drive greater support for nationwide paid sick leave already one hurdle has been cleared the public is more aware than ever that low wage workers are the backbone of the economy if essential workers stop working so does the rest of the nation said michael oswalt associate law professor at northern illinois university in dekalb i think there will be more pressure on companies to treat them with more respect they are genuinely the heroes of the pandemic many grocery and

temperature checks companies can t normally demand temperature checks but the u s equal employment opportunity commission has said that covid 19 is a significant enough threat to workers safety that such checks are permitted said lauren novak a partner in the labor and employment practice at chicago based schiff hardin what s unusual is seeing employees push for precautions like temperature checks she said typically you don t find employees requesting measures that might prevent them from coming to work here you have employees who want to come to work in a safe environment so they re asking for these measures she said people in the market for a new job are also asking about safety as essential businesses scramble to fill positions skills for chicagoland s future which helps companies recruit the unemployed and underemployed has been explaining to job candidates the increased safety measures and incentives implemented since the start of the pandemic said president and ceo marie trzupek lynch she encourages those who are open to working to ask about protections and seize the openings as of the end of march 55 of employers who hire through skills have frozen hiring or started layoffs once the shelter in place lifts we re going to have a wave of unemployment unlike anything we ve seen trzupek lynch said get out and get a job now a wall street journal survey of economists found the unemployment rate is expected to hit 13 in june though the federal reserve bank of st louis estimated it could go as high as 32 most employers have made clear that the temporary pay increases bonuses and extra paid time off they re offering now will end once the health crisis passes but some companies have said they plan to keep expanded paid sick leave around once the pandemic ends darden restaurants the operator of chains like olive garden longhorn steakhouse and the capital grille said it accelerated existing plans to give all hourly employees paid sick leave even if employers don t voluntarily extend those benefits the pandemic could boost efforts to mandate paid sick leave at the federal level said jeremy glenn a labor and employment attorney at cozen o connor while some states and cities including chicago require employers to offer paid sick leave much of the nation does not there s a recognition that if workers face a choice between giving up a paycheck and going to work sick we as a country benefit from their being able to stay home glenn said though paid sick leave is a cost for employers a nationwide framework could help companies given concerns that covid 19 could reappear there are really good policy reasons up and down the line for why the government can step in and make something uniform so it s not constantly enacting things in the midst of a crisis oswalt said philippe weiss head of seyfarth at work a subsidiary of law firm seyfarth shaw that consults companies on workplace relations said the pandemic is likely to boost employees efforts to advocate for health and safety protections within the workplace one of his clients recently established a new executive position tasked with devising protocols and securing supply pipelines for safety equipment in the event of future crises some clients are talking about personal protective equipment as part of essential office supplies the same as uniforms and laptops many business leaders tell us that the covid 19 pandemic illustrates in stark relief the dismal preparation efforts on the part of key governmental bodies weiss said as a result the chatter in some c suites concerns how it may increasingly fall on corporate america to spur or proactively anchor initiatives that protect workers and others in the future he also expects covid 19 to spur unionizing efforts though most union growth has taken place during times of economic expansion and strong corporate profits seismic events such as the deadly 1911 triangle shirtwaist fire or the advent of the great depression can hasten the process weiss said in that regard covid 19 may well represent the seismic event of this generation he said workers in many industries already have found their voice in recent weeks a group of workers at an amazon delivery station in the pilsen area held four safety strikes outside the workplace after an employee was diagnosed with covid 19 the third on april 3 drew about 30 people and was held not long after employees received messages from amazon notifying them of a second case said ted miin 34 of chicago s west englewood neighborhood amazon said fewer than 5 of the chicago delivery station s 600 employees took part in demonstrations and that it has made more than 150 changes to its processes around health and safety we have taken extreme measures to keep people safe tripling down on deep cleaning procuring safety supplies that are available and changing processes to ensure those in our buildings are keeping safe distances the truth is the vast majority of employees continue to show up and do the heroic work of delivering for customers every day spokesman timothy carter said in an email miin said the group of employees who want to see more protections is larger but some can t afford to forgo pay he has seen extra cleanings but worries they re superficial and though the company has encouraged employees to keep their distance and placed cardboard sheets between some workstations the warehouse wasn t designed for social distancing he said with over 1 000 sites around the world and so many measures and precautions rapidly rolled out over the past several weeks there may be instances where we don t get it perfect but i can assure you that s just what they ll be exceptions dave clark senior vice president of worldwide operations at amazon said in a company blog post julia garcia a line operator at raymundo food group in bedford park is part of a group of factory workers that has refused to go into work for 14 days after learning
