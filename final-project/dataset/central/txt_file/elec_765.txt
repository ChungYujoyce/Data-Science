the most controversial presidential campaign in modern american history has sharpened a long standing debate is it ethical to not vote more than 92 million americans who were eligible to vote four years ago didn t cast ballots but politics in the age of trump hasprompted editorial writers democratic partisans and even some republicans to argue that donald trump is so unacceptableas a potential commander in chiefthat citizens have a heightened duty to show up to cast their ballot against him some trump supporters presumably including those whochant lock her up at gop rallies feel the same way about hillary clinton let s be clear elections aren t just about who votes but who doesn t vote first lady michelle obama said last week at a clinton campaign rally at la salle university in philadelphia with a cautionary message aimed at millennials and if you vote for someone other than hillary or if you don t vote at all then you are helping to elect hillary s opponent and the stakes are far too high to take that chance too high conservative columnist dorothy rabinowitz struck a surprisingly similar tone in a message aimed at republicans some among the anti hillary brigades have decided in deference to their exquisite sensibilities to stay at home on election day rather than vote for mrs clinton she wrote in friday sthe wall street journal but she warned her election alone is what stands between the american nation and the reign of the most unstable proudly uninformed psychologically unfit president ever to enter the white house on team trump new jersey gov chris christie and former new york mayor rudy giuliani are among those whoargue it is clinton whose election would pose athreat to the republic and some republicanswho oppose trump make the case for sending a message by supporting a third party candidate or not voting at all former florida governor jeb bush vanquished by trump in the gopprimaries told reporters thursday after delivering a guest lecture at harvard university that he planned to vote but not for trump or clinton if everybody didn t vote that would be a pretty powerful political statement wouldn t it he said is it trump or clinton fear vs hope trump s temperament criticism of muslim american gold star parents a late night twitter storm against a former beauty queen and policy views that include skepticism of the nato alliance and admiration forrussian president vladimir putin have fueled alarm even among some life long republicans aboutwhether he should be trusted with the nation s highest office former president george h w bush and 2012 presidential nominee mitt romney are among those who have said they won t vote for trump but concerns about clinton including questions about her honesty and trustworthiness have complicatedthe calculations by some voters aboutjust whom to support all that hasboosted libertarian candidate gary johnson whose 7 3 level of support in the realclearpolitics average of recent nationwidesurveys is higher than any third party candidate on election day since ross perot in 1996 when both major party candidatesget negative ratings from most americans will more voters just stay home inspirational contenders tend to do best in drawing voters to the polls the highest rate of turnout since world war ii was 63 8 of the voting eligible population in1960 when a youthful massachusetts senatorjohn f kennedy narrowly won the white house after decades of more or less steady decline it spiked again to 61 6 in 2008 whenillinois senator barack obama was elected the nation s first african american president but scholars say fearcan be as compelling as hope fear is a pretty big motivator just as is enthusiasm says michael dimmock president of the non partisan pew research center which has studied voters and non voters turnout in presidential elections tends to dip inyears such as 1996 and 2000 when voters don t see the stakes as particularly high or the differences between the two major candidatesas particularly sharp neither factor would apply this time and high levels of interest this year may signal higher turnout in a pew study released this summer more than eight in 10 said they were following news about the candidates closely the highest level of interest in a quarter century eight in 10 said they had thought quite a lot about the election three of four said it really matters who wins that said two thirds called the tone of the campaigntoo negative and only four in 10 were satisfied with their choices the lowest level in two decades just one in 10 said either candidate would make a good president four in 10 said neither would we ve never had candidates like this for president says michael mcdonald a political scientist at the university of florida who heads the united states elections project he turns to senate races for comparison citing the 2010 delaware contestwhen democrat chris coons crushed republican christine o donnell she was a controversial tea party backed contender who among other things aired a tv ad denying she was a witch despite a contest that wasn t seen ascompetitive turnout in the first state was among the highest in the country last year my guess is people are going to be activated to vote against these candidates mcdonald says they may not like their particular candidate but they certainly don t like the other party s candidate it s not howmuch do i like these people says jan leighley an american universityprofessor and co author of who votes now demographics issues inequality and turnout in the united states it s does it make a difference between this person i do not like opposed to that person i do not like this year trump has heightened that issue with rhetoricthat seems outside the scope of reasonable conversation or respectable public dialogue she says if he continues to do that she says the question for voters could be this isone being irresponsible by not casting a ballot in the first tentative clues about turnout this year mcdonald saysrequests for absentee ballots in congressional districts in iowa maine and north carolina likely to favor clinton have been running slightly ahead of requests at this point four years ago requests in districts in those three states likely to favor trump have been running slightly lower who doesn t vote most americans think there s an obligation to vote says jason brennan a georgetown university professor and author of the ethics of voting though the percentages may be inflated because they think that s what they re supposed to say he doesn t agree likening it to a lottery when anindividual ticket or vote isn t likely to make a difference that said he generallydoes vote himself a look at the demographics of those least likely to vote explains why democrats are more focused on turnout efforts than republicans a majority of eligible latino voters and of voters under 30 didn t go to the polls in 2012 both groups support clinton over trump and they make up significant blocs in some battleground states millennials incolorado and virginia hispanics in florida and nevada clinton has vowed to encourage 3 million new americans to register to vote before nov 8 she and her top campaign surrogates increasingly are focused on registering voters before state deadlines loomand encouraging supporters to cast early ballots that said trump has done well among another group of voters not inclined to cast ballots those who don t have a college education only a third of eligible voters who don t have a high school diploma voted in 2012 and less than half of those with only a high school education did so most non voters stay away from the polls not because they are making an ideological statement but because they say they are too busy or they don t like either candidate or they don t think it matters if they vote as a group they are younger less educated and less affluent than voters they express less interest in politics and public affairs although a usa today suffolk university poll of unlikely voters in 2012 found two thirds of them said they were registered they are much more likely than voters to favor an activist government eight in 10 said the government plays an important role in their lives and the usa todaysurvey found they supported obama over romney by more than 2 1 a far wider margin than those who cast ballots get out the vote efforts a standard part of presidential campaigns for decades have started earlier than ever this year in part because of the rise in early voting an estimated four in 10 voters will have cast early or absentee ballots before the polls open on nov 8 the gotv campaigns also have taken on a fiercer intensity than say when the choice was between barack obama and mitt romney i agree with the premise of the arizona republic the detroit news and many others that donald trump is a unique kind of candidate who represents a unique kind of threat to our fundamental way of life says norman ornstein a veteran political analyst at the american enterprise institute usa today which in the past hasn t endorsed a presidential candidate on friday came out against trump urging voters to go to the polls to support someone else ornstein acknowledges some voters are wary of clinton as well even if you see it as the lesser of two evils he says one of those evils is going to become president
