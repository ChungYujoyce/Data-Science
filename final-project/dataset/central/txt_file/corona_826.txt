legislation to respond to the crisis even though some gop lawmakers are weighing potential ideas for what would be a fifth piece of legislation in response to the crisis i don t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately that time could develop but i don t think it has yet mcconnell told reporters monday mcconnell during an interviewon fox news on thursday night said he thought there was a high likelihood congress would need to pass a fifth bill but declined to give a timeline including if it would be soon the gop leader s remarks come as several members of his caucus himself included have raised concerns about the long term fiscal impact of money congress has already appropriated and how it will affect the country s debt those concerns have sparked charges of hypocrisy from democrats who note that republicans embraced a 2017 tax bill that s contributed heavily to rising debt congress has passed several relief bills that total nearly 2 8 trillion roughly the combined total of fiscal 2019 and 2020 discretionary spending for the entire federal government instead of more spending mcconnell is focused on drafting liability protection legislation with sen john cornyn r

pelosi during a press conference on thursday characterized the house bill as an opening salvo we re putting our offer on the table we re open to negotiation pelosi said here s our offer let s see where you are but asked why he wasn t viewing the house bill as a first serve that could be volleyed between the two chambers mcconnell argued that the house bill was hardly salvageable a liberal wish

decision along with the administration to move to another phase that ll be the time to interact with the democrats during an interview with radio host hugh hewitt thune echoed those remarks saying republicans should first coalesce behind their own position i hope what happens is that the white house works with senate republicans to put together an agenda that makes sense that addresses the economic and health emergency needs of the american people he said that we can bring democrats in to negotiate and to find some common ground view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite
