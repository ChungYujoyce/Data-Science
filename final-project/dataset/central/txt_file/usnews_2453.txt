when donald trump says he s never met someone it can mean a lot of things one thing it doesn t that they literally have never met on multiple occasions over the last few years the president has plainly stated that he doesn t know someone has never met them or doesn t even know who they are even when he clearly does one example came at a press conference in november of 2018 when he was asked about the rapper lil jon who said that trump had once called him an uncle tom i don t know who lil jon is i don t i really don t trump replied but trump not only knows who the rapper is he knows him personally lil jon was a two time contestant on the celebrity apprentice trump has referred to him in the past as an amazing and wonderful guy a terrific guy and a great friend in that case trump was claiming he didn t know someone who had accusing him of poor behavior he used a similar defense against a former trump tower receptionist who said that trump once kissed her directly on the mouth against her will during an introductory meeting trump responded that he didn t know her and had never met her and he used the line when defending himself after mocking a new york times reporter at a 2015 campaign rally claiming that his curled up hands and shaking on stage were not a reference to the reporter s disability since he doesn t know him or what he looks like but trump also uses the same line against his critics as a way of arguing that they don t know what they re talking about that was the case with george conway the husband of one of his top aides i barely know him trump said on twitter he later retweeted his campaign manager claiming that potus doesn t even know him the washington post later published a 2006 letter from trump in which he thanked conway for his help on a problem in one of his buildings adding in a postscript you have a truly great voice certainly not a bad asset for a top trial lawyer trump has also used the line against critics that he really doesn t know including former defense secretary robert gates and retired marine gen john allen it s also a way for trump to diminish someone as unimportant since he presumes they would have met if they were that was the case when he attacked democratic sen bob casey during a 2018 campaign rally for his republican opponent i m not sure i ever met bob casey i never met him trump told the audience at a pennsylvania arena then he added and i m sure i did i shook his hand his father was a good man a totally different person i don t think i don t know this man he s a senator there s 100 senators i don t know him a philadelphia tv station then dug up a photo and transcript of casey and trump at a meeting in the cabinet room of the white house talking about proposed tariffs on imported steel earlier that year a spokesman for casey s campaign cited three other interactions in previous months as well trump has also used the line to distance himself from people when a relationship might be problematic as he did when former campaign adviser george papadopoulos got into legal trouble i don t know him i saw him sitting in one picture at a table with me that s the that s the only thing i know about him he said but trump had previously cited papadopolous as a member of his foreign policy team an energy and oil consultant excellent guy he said an interview with the washington post and once tweeted a photo of a meeting in which papadopoulos sat near him trump even used the line against his own acting attorney general i don t know matt whitaker contradicting what he had said a month earlier on fox news i mean i know matt whitaker he did the same with wikileaks the website that worked with russian intelligence to publicize stolen hillary clinton emails during the 2016 campaign trump regularly brought up wikileaks saying at one rally i love wikileaks but when wikileaks founder julian assange was arrested in london trump took the opposite tack i know nothing about wikileaks he told reporters it s not my thing trump made a similar about face with russian president vladimir putin from 2015 to 2016 he went from saying that he has a relationship with putin that putin once gave him a present that he s spoken with him and got to know him very well to saying i don t know who putin is i have no relationship with putin and i don t know putin trump as the saying goes has never met a person he doesn t like contact us at editors time com
