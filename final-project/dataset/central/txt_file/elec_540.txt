before jeb bush took to the stage in boulder colorado for wednesday night s third republican presidential debate the punditry had decided that he had to put in a strong performance or his already flagging campaign might be finished the consensus was that he did not make a strong showing so now what i could have done better bush reportedly told senior staffers and top donors on an emergency call thursday his campaign is not on life support he then told reporters while campaigning in portsmouth new hampshire the end is not near memo to file it s never a good sign when you have to defend your campaign from charges that it is terminal as bush did thursday on fox news but team jeb has a plan to turn the ship around campaign officials are assuring donors even while one top bush adviser tells the washington post that the candidate and his camp won t be panicked by the insanity of the pundit world here are some key points in the revival program for jeb bush as shared with the media on one of the darker days for bush 2016 1 focus on new hampshire bush s cash flush super pac has set aside almost 11 million for an advertising blitz starting jan 5 and 5 6 million of that is for new hampshire according to a 112 page campaign document leaked to u s news bush has already visited new hampshire at least 16 times this year more than double his trips to iowa and when he slashed his budget and downsized staff in miami last week bush moved resources to new hampshire which is now a must win state bush plans to lose in iowa 2 focus on proven leadership over performance bush doesn t seem to be a great debater so he s downplaying the importance of debates it s not about the big personalities on the stage bush said thursday it s not about performance it s about leadership 3 keep attacking marco rubio in the leaked campaign memo handed to donors on monday the bush campaign paints sen marco rubio r fla a former bush prot g as his key competitor for the gop establishment vote and money pot it titled one section of its memo marco is a risky bet noting his misuse of state party credit cards taxpayer funds and ties to scandal tarred former congressman david rivera among other alleged demerits bush s attack on rubio in the debate backfired pretty badly as did his team s suggestion that mitt romney s vp vetters found some shady stuff in rubio s background but some of bush s super pac ads are expected to attack rubio on the airwaves 4 stop the leaks bush has a large group of advisers and staffers and some of these backers have been saying dispiriting things to the press discipline matters warns one of his strategy sections that was yes leaked to the media 5 relax and get comfortable longtime bush supporters say the candidate they see running in 2015 is a diminished form of the towering figure he was as governor and not just because he has dieted away 40 pounds so bush will be campaigning with old friends to try to make him more like his old self the operative word going forward is relax and to lower expectations of how this primary will play out said one of those friends al cardenas 6 highlight bush s florida record with a book tour bush is mostly running on his list of accomplishments in florida and one of his tools to underscore those years is a new book excerpting his emails as governor he is giving a major speech in tampa next week to coincide with the release of that book reply all jeb bush planned to run as a joyful warrior in a year when the republican base isn t feeling very celebratory he is modeling his campaign reboot partly on sen john mccain s r ariz successful 2007 maneuvering from afterthought candidate to republican nominee but while there are certainly some similarities between mccain s fall from presumptive frontrunner to fading has been there are differences that should give bush and his team pause nobody ever accused mccain of being low energy for example and when he went on his 2007 romp toward the nomination his happy warrior persona was more warrior and less happy jeb bush can do joyful but so far he hasn t demonstrated the stomach or the skill to wound rubio donald trump or anyone else standing between him and the oval office if governor bush can t land a punch on marco rubio on the debate stage one senior gop operative tells the washington post then the super pac can t do it from the peanut gallery if bush can muster up enough political dexterity to shiv rubio without looking like a fool or a bully maybe republicans will consider supporting him for the coming fight against hillary clinton trump wants praise for his coronavirus response here it is the donald trump heresy a brief timeline of the trump whistleblower saga trump says it s safe to reopen schools i don t believe him trump keeps falsely accusing joe scarborough of murder and it s long past weird officials ask reckless lake of the ozarks partygoers to self quarantine
