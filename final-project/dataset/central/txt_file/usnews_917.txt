special counsel robert mueller found significant evidence that donald trump may have obstructed justice but he declined to charge him based on his view of how the law should work in a 400 page report sent to congress thursday the former fbi director spelled out a view of the constitutional limitations placed on prosecutors which guided his decision making in not charging trump at the same time he plainly stated that if he could have said that trump was innocent of obstruction of justice he would have done so the evidence we obtained about the president s actions and intents present difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred mueller wrote accordingly while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him the report details several examples of conduct which might be considered obstruction of justice including trump pressuring fbi director james comey to drop an investigation into his national security advisor firing comey attempting to urge attorney general sessions to undo his recusal from the investigation and attempting to fire mueller among other things despite mueller s decision attorney general william barr and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein announced in late march that after reviewing the evidence they had decided that trump did not obstruct justice here s a look at the legal reasoning behind mueller s decision mueller began by noting that the office of legal counsel in the white house wrote in a 2000 memo that sitting presidents can t be indicted because it would undermine their ability to oversee the nation s criminal justice system but he adds that doesn t mean that a special counsel couldn t investigate a presidential actions since charges could be brought after they ve left office given those considerations the facts known to us and the strong public interest in safeguarding the integrity of the criminal justice system we conducted a thorough factual investigation in order to preserve the evidence when memories were fresh and documentary materials were available he wrote read more can trump be indicted what to know about his legal powers mueller then notes that defendants have a constitutional right to clear their name of criminal accusations through a speedy trial by contrast if prosecutors were allowed to impugn their reputations without charging them with crimes it would be unfair the ordinary means for an individual to respond to an accusation is through a speedy and public trial with all the procedural protections that surround a criminal case he wrote a prosecutor s judgement that crimes were committed but that no charges will be brought affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name clearing before an impartial adjudicator read more the 270 arguments trump made about the russia probe because mueller s team can t indict trump it also can t give him the opportunity for a speedy trial to clear his name mueller reasoned he decided that his team would therefore not make an announcement that trump had committed a crime such as obstructing justice despite the facts it uncover the concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting president where a federal prosecutor s accusation of a crime even in an internal report could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice he wrote mueller also ruled out another option which would be to obtain a sealed indictment against presidents that would not become public until after they leave office would not work because they could be leaked it would be very difficult to preserve an indictment s secrecy and if an indictment became public t he stigma and opprobrium could imperil the president s ability to govern he wrote quoting the office of legal counsel memo all that said mueller also said that he did not rule out publicly clearing the president of wrongdoing either but based on the facts his investigators uncovered he decided not to do so if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice we would so state he wrote based on the facts and the applicable legal standards however we are unable to reach that judgement accordingly while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him he added write to mahita gajanan at mahita gajanan time com
