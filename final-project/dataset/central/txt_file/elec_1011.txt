7 min read multiple posts on social media make the claim that 2020 presidential candidate bernie sanders is proposing a 52 tax rate on incomes above 29 000 a year examples of the claim appear on facebook here instagram here twitter here and reddit here the posts give a breakdown of the potential impacts of this extreme tax hike alongside one of sanders signature proposals the increase of the federal minimum wage to 15 an hour see here some of the posts claim that sanders said he proposed a 52 tax raise at the ninth democratic debate hosted on february 19 2020 in las vegas nevada some posts claim the reason for this hike is to finance another one of sanders signature policies medicare for all a single payer national health insurance plan as referenced berniesanders com issues afull transcript here of the debate here shows that 29 000 was only said twice by former south bend mayor pete buttigieg there were no instances of anybody saying 52 buttigieg s comments on sanders alleged proposed tax increase on incomes above 29 000 is likely part of the inspiration for the claim made on social media buttigieg first scrutinized sanders alleged plan to raise taxes for incomes above 29 000 around the 37 minute mark of the debate as seen in the video here buttigieg said but i m actually less concerned about the lack of transparency on sanders personal health than i am about the lack of transparency on how to pay for his health care plan since he s said that it s impossible to even know how much it s going to cost and even after raising taxes on everybody making 29 000 there is still a multi trillion dollar hole in the last half hour of the debate buttigieg refers here again to this figure while making remarks similar to those earlier in the debate the exchange goes as follows buttigieg he s honest about the fact that taxes will go up on anybody making more than 29 000 to fund his health care plan although again a little bit vague about how the rest of that gets sanders you re not being honest premiums would be eliminated buttigieg but you re still raising those taxes and when you do it sanders but we re saving people money because they don t pay any premiums out of pocket expenses co payments or deductibles they re going to be much better off buttigieg but where is where is the other 25 trillion supposed to come from at a certain point you ve got to do the math sanders well we got it all up there on the internet it s a payroll tax a payroll tax crosstalk buttigieg well no but even after the payroll tax you still have a hole crosstalk sanders because we have a wealth tax elizabeth has a good one ours is a little bit tougher on mr bloomberg than hers we re going to raise it in a progressive way which deals with income and wealth inequality and makes certain finally that health care in this country is a human right not a privilege this exchange confirms that sanders plan is to finance medicare for all through a mixture of different taxes his website confirms here that his extreme wealth tax mentioned in the debate will help fund medicare for all the 52 figure of the claim likely comes from a memo released by sanders senate office ahead of the introduction of the medicare for all act of 2019 here to the us senate the memo options to finance medicare for all discusses different tax proposals to finance his healthcare program not all mentioned during the debate read the full memo here in the memo one optionhere proposed isa progressive income tax schedule that includes a 52 tax rate but strictly applied to incomes over 10 million another option proposed is the so called payroll tax that sanders mentioned in the debate this 7 5 payroll tax would be paid by employers exempting the first 2 million in payroll to protect small businesses a final option is a 4 income based premium applicable to all households making more than 29 000 currently the marginal tax rate as referenced here for a household making more than 29 000 and below 40 124 is 12 this 4 premium is the only evident proposal that could raise taxes on incomes above 29 000 sanders has spoken publicly in the past about his medicare for all plans and his menu of financing options reuters was unable to find any mention of tax increases anywhere near the claim made 52 sanders recently answered a question about how he would fund medicare for all at a cnn townhall in south carolina the video is available here sanders made no other mention of an increase in taxes during this debate except when discussing the current tax code that has he alleges benefited corporations and billionaires more than the middle class the claim that bernie sanders plans to tax anyone making above 29 000 a year 52 is therefore false false bernie sanders does not plan to tax minimum wage incomes 52 all quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes see here for a complete list of exchanges and delays 2020 reuters all rights reserved
