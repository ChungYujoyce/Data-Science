americans are experiencing the pandemic through sharply divergent partisan lenses loading may 8 2020 in some circles wearing a mask is now seen as a liberal political statement while going maskless is a sign of don t tread on me defiance in texas the debate over a salon owner jailed for reopening her shop early became so intense that lt gov dan patrickpaidher 7 000 fine and offered to serve the rest of her sentence under house arrest at a time when a shared reliance on facts and science is absolutely critical partisan polarization is splintering a national sense of resolve over how best to combat the virus two thirds of americans don t think the official u s death toll 76 600 as of friday is accurate according to the latestaxios ipsos poll but among democrats 63 say it s an undercount while a plurality of republicans 40 believes the figure is inflated some republicans suspect the number is being overstated to hurt president trump we can t even bring ourselves to accept the same set of facts and feel compelled to question the motivations of our leaders and of each other says mo elleithee director of the georgetown institute of politics and a former democratic strategist mask or no mask reopen businesses or keep them closed trust dr anthony fauci s expertise or not so much on question after question the debates have grown heated even amid a pandemic when a sense of common purpose and shared values are essential the nation s red blue divide seems as sharp as ever in some circles wearing a mask is now seen as a liberal political statement while going maskless is a sign of don t tread on me defiance in texas the debate over a salon owner jailed for reopening her shop early became so intense that lt gov dan patrick paid her 7 000 fine and offered to serve the rest of her sentence under house arrest even the widely admired dr fauci the nation s top epidemiologist has not escaped the partisan buzzsaw true he enjoys strong support in both parties but there s still a 17 point partisan gap 88 democratic approval versus 71 among republicans according to gallup editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall polarization building for decades was already intense before covid 19 now it s on steroids especially with a presidential election just six months away and at a time when a shared reliance on facts and science is absolutely critical partisanship and a deficit of trust have made fighting the virus all the more challenging for 40 years there s been a growing anti intellectualism or perhaps populist resentment toward the traditional sources of informational authority the press academia the scientific community nonpartisan government agencies says david barker director of the center for congressional and presidential studies at american university in washington we ve gotten to the point egged on by the president for four years where maybe one third of the country just does not trust a single word they hear from any of the traditional sources it must be acknowledged that the traditional sources sometimes do get it wrong the mainstream media make mistakes in 2003 the united states went to war in iraq based on faulty intelligence over weapons of mass destruction but each side now has its own sources of information and its own perspective in interpreting that information coupled with a healthy dose of distrust of the other side on covid 19 two thirds of americans don t think the official u s death toll 76 600 as of friday is accurate and faith in that figure is declining according to the latestaxios ipsos poll but partisans disagree on how it s wrong among democrats 63 say it s an undercount given that some people are dying with covid 19 like symptoms without being tested among republicans on the other hand a plurality 40 says the figure is inflated some republicans suspect the number is being overstated to hurt president donald trump it just shows how sadly tribal we have become in our politics that we can t even bring ourselves to accept the same set of facts and feel compelled to question the motivations of our leaders and of each other says mo elleithee director of the georgetown institute of politics and public service and a former democratic strategist newt gingrich sees a partisan hostility born of deep differences in values worldviews goals and definitions of reality the former republican house speaker writes in an email the gap is now so large that each group sees its opponents as the other when the governor of minnesota keeps open planned parenthood but closes churches he is communicating a value set utterly alien to religiously committed people speaker gingrich continues the rural urban geographic divide is also shaping perceptions of the crisis with democratic leaning regions hit harder by the virus than republican leaning areas people who live in cities and suburbs where population density and demographics have so far produced the highest case loads are literally experiencing the pandemic differently from those in rural areas that could soon shift coronavirus cases are now rising at a faster rate in rural america than in metropolitan areas according to the kaiser family foundation the spread to rural redder areas brings its own challenges given their older populations more preexisting health conditions and fewer hospitals rural areas also face economic problems even when the national economy is strong friday s jobs report 14 7 of americans unemployed in april the highest level since the great depression brought home the shocking economic impact of the virus yet on the question of reopening businesses partisan differences are again sharp and vary depending on the type of business some 61 of republicans support opening golf courses while only 30 of democrats agree according to the latest washington post university of maryland poll with barber shops and hair salons 48 of republicans support reopening versus 15 of democrats regarding movie theaters the survey reports 33 of republicans support reopening versus 8 of democrats then there s the mask question which has become a flashpoint for partisan sniping a majority in both parties say they wear a mask when leaving home but democrats are more likely to wear one by a margin of 17 percentage points 76 to 59 when vice president mike pence didn t wear a mask on a visit last week to minnesota s mayo clinic where mask usage is required liberal outrage ensued he said he didn t feel the need to wear one given he is regularly tested for covid 19 but later he said he should have president trump has yet to wear a mask in public on april 3 when the centers for disease control changed its guidance and recommended that americans wear masks when outside the home the president said he preferred not to his actions may have swayed some americans actions a march academic study shows that partisan affiliation more than age income or education level was a huge divider in people s reported health behaviors such as hand washing and canceled trips says shana kushner gadarian political scientist at syracuse university and co author of the study people are taking their cues from political leadership and from doctors and to the extent that those are different people will turn to their more trusted sources professor gadarian says in other words mixed messages say on mask wearing may be producing a mix of behaviors take danielle zaccagnino a 30 something teacher in suburban alexandria virginia who says she leans liberal and has largely stayed inside since the virus outbreak started when she does go out she wears an n95 mask she avoids the news and keeps up with events via friends and social media the assumption is that liberals are more panicked and conservatives are not ms zaccagnino says but because i limit my exposure to the conversation i think that s the main factor in how not panicked i am in contrast stephen hunt a 50 something project manager in information technology says he goes out in public all the time and doesn t wear a mask or gloves he watches fox news and thinks the official death toll from covid 19 is probably too high mr hunt who lives in exurban king george county virginia says he identifies as conservative more than republican because the party has embraced big government most important he says he wants the freedom to make choices for himself and be treated by the government as an individual the virus he says hasn t changed the way we he and his wife go about our normal day to day business at all other than social distancing which we abide by of course yet beneath these apparent divisions certain bedrock american values are still shining through there s plenty of evidence that on the ground at the community level we actually have become less polarized and have forged strong communities says mr elleithee former communications director at the democratic national committee he cites stories of people delivering groceries to elderly neighbors and drives to help keep local businesses afloat in late march the next door app added a feature that allows neighbors to help neighbors during the pandemic utility companies have features that allow people to round up their bill tohelp thosewho are struggling financially partisan affiliation doesn t come up it s happening all over the country even in polarized communities and swing districts mr elleithee says get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox staff writer noah robertson contributed to this report editor
