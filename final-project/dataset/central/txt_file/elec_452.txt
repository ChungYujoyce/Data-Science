washington ap joe biden bought himself time it s unclear how much biden s victory in south carolina on saturday was emphatic enough to let him make the claim that it had reordered the race for the democratic presidential nomination he can now credibly argue he is the overwhelming favorite of black voters who are the backbone of the democratic party and he is positioning himself as moderates best alternative to blocking bernie sanders path to the nomination but the next three days will determine whether south carolina was a one off for biden or the start of a true comeback for the former vice president more than a dozen states vote on tuesday including california the primary contest s biggest prize and a state where more than 1 million votes were cast early biden faces serious challenges in many of those states including a limited campaign infrastructure and virtually no money spent on advertising he ll be dependent largely on name recognition built up during more than four decades in national politics and the perception of momentum coming out of south carolina also standing in biden s way several other candidates who are vowing to stay in the race including billionaire mike bloomberg most have no discernible path to the nomination but they could keep biden s support down and allow sanders to rack up an insurmountable delegate lead some of biden s supporters are clear eyed about the difficulties ahead i think he will have to do better no question about that rep james clyburn the prominent south carolina democrat who gave biden a boost with a crucial endorsement days before the primary said on cnn we need to do some retooling in the campaign no question about that still there are real reasons for optimism for biden out of south carolina the first state to test the preferences of black voters biden was backed by about 60 percent of african americans according to ap votecast a wide ranging survey of more than 1 400 voters in south carolina s democratic primary he also performed strongly with older voters who vote more reliably and self described moderates also working in biden s favor were feelings of nostalgia in south carolina for the obama era though former president barack obama hasn t endorsed in the 2020 race and isn t expected to any time soon biden has wrapped himself in his one time running mate s legacy and held up his eight years in office as an example for a model for what his own presidency would bring biden s campaign is now moving urgently to rebrand its candidate as a front runner after weeks on the decline he finished a dismal fourth in iowa and fifth in new hampshire then a distant second to sanders in nevada biden and his top advisers are pressing prominent moderates in the next states on the calendar for endorsements and also trying to gently nudge other candidates toward the exit joe biden s strength tonight is why we are poised for a strong super tuesday and one of only two candidates remaining with a viable path to the nomination said anita dunn biden s senior adviser but biden is dependent on factors outside of his control and his weak start to the primaries means one victory in south carolina may not be enough to scare off other candidates who are still angling for their own opening indeed several others insisted saturday that they plan to stay in the race at least through the super tuesday contests this coming week including sens elizabeth warren and amy klobuchar as well as pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana but pressure will be particularly acute in the coming days on klobuchar and buttigieg after promising moments in iowa and new hampshire two overwhelmingly white states neither candidate has shown any significant strength with the minority voters who are crucial to democrats in the general election then there s bloomberg who entered the race late after determining biden was a weaker than expected candidate he skipped the opening contests but has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into television advertising into super tuesday states in hopes of racking up big delegate totals while bloomberg s campaign privately acknowledged that biden is likely to get a bump out of his south carolina win the campaign still believes the former new york mayor can win in a handful of states that vote on super tuesday including arkansas alabama oklahoma virginia and north carolina all states he s barnstormed in recent days mike bloomberg has not been on the ballot yet said kevin sheekey bloomberg s campaign manager we look forward to tuesday biden s campaign hasn t mapped out the states where it thinks the former vice president can win on tuesday but it s eyeing strong finishes in states with large black populations virginia north carolina tennessee arkansas and alabama biden doesn t have the time to build the personal relationships in those states that he had in south carolina a state he visited 30 times over the past year or the money to build out the campaign infrastructure that carried him to saturday s overwhelming victory but a comeback narrative can be a powerful political force one biden is hoping he can capitalize on during these next crucial days for his campaign in an emotional address to supporters in south carolina on saturday he declared for all those of you who ve been knocked down
