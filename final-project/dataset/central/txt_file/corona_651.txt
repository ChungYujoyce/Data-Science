potatoes but for these joggers marathons are a way to stay centered challenged and creative at an extremely trying time loading april 8 2020 three weeks ago shahieda thungo was at the peak of her training for the comrades the world s largest ultramarathon which is run in south africa each june she was taking on weekly marathons like they were casual jogs and then the world around her started to shrink on march 23 as cases of the novel coronavirus ticked upward the country announced a 21 day lockdown no leaving home except for food or medicine but for ms thungo that doesn t mean no running it just means running around her postage stamp backyard ducking under her washing line on every loop around the world government restrictions to fight covid 19 have changed the way we exercise and for a dedicated few it s given rise to a new kind of challenge to run ever longer distances in ever smaller spaces for some at home marathons are a way to raise money for charity or offer inspiration for others they re a way to stay centered in the midst of a crisis that can seem overwhelming isn t that what life is about finding different challenges and conquering them says ms thungo we run marathons we run ultras but maybe it s only by running in tiny circles that we can really test our minds and find our breaking point it was one of the most grueling marathons that wojciech machnik had completed and that was saying something mr machnik has run marathons that zigzag up mountain peaks he has finished 26 2 miles in 90 degree heat and 95 humidity one week last june he ran six marathons in six caribbean countries just to see if he could but even mr machnik had never run a marathon quite like this on a quiet sunday morning last month in warsaw poland he rounded his bed for the 5 626th time and then plopped down on top of it it was a crazy thing to do to commemorate a crazy moment in time he says so i thought why not around the world government restrictions to fight the novel coronavirus have changed the way we exercise for many that s meant brushing off dusty home gym equipment or streaming blocky feeds of trainers in their living rooms but for a dedicated few it s given rise to a new kind of challenge to run ever longer distances in ever smaller spaces editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall in china in february an ultramarathon runner named pan shancu set the tone when he ran 31 miles through his small apartment slurping noodles and taking videos of his stocking feet in march in the south of france furloughed restaurant manager elisha nochomovitz ran the length of his 23 foot balcony with its sweeping view of the pyrenees mountains 6 000 times to complete his own self isolation marathon and then a week later he did it again this is literally a way to keep moving through this crisis says rossyle ayuro a filipino hospital administrator in doha qatar who recently ran a marathon from her kitchen down her hallway out the door to the elevator and back 1 400 times at home marathons come with their own set of challenges namely extreme boredom but their adherents also see unusual upsides no race day jitters and smooth as butter logistics for runners like these then lockdown restrictions are less a limitation than a kind of extreme dare isn t that what life is about finding different challenges and conquering them says shahieda thungo a south african ultramarathoner who s been running 10 kilometer loops around her postage stamp backyard in soweto near johannesburg ducking under her washing line on every loop we run marathons we run ultras but maybe it s only by running in tiny circles that we can really test our minds and find our breaking point three weeks ago ms thungo was at the peak of her training for the comrades the world s largest ultramarathon which is run in south africa each june she was taking on weekly marathons like they were casual jogs and then the world around her started to shrink as south africa s coronavirus cases ticked upward the president called for restrictions on how many people could gather in one place races were canceled gyms closed their doors ms thungo kept running logging 20 mile jogs with just one or two friends or solo runs at dawn near her house but on march 23 south africa announced a 21 day lockdown no leaving home for anything except food or medicine i thought ok well that might be an opportunity to try something completely different says stuart mann who lives in johannesburg and has run over 240 marathons and ultramarathons he took stock of his options there was an exercise bike gathering dust in his garage sure he hadn t swum for exercise in 15 years but he had a pool in his backyard and his driveway was pretty long why not try an ironman triathlon he could get out his lockdown jitters and raise money for a favorite education charity so last saturday that s exactly what he did as cold rain lashed his shoulders he swam 2 4 miles across his 36 foot long pool when he finished he popped out had a cup of tea and headed for the bike on his veranda for the next 5 1 2 hours he chatted with friends online and read his 8 year old daughter a chapter of harry potter as his feet spun through the miles 112 of them to be exact then it was time for his driveway marathon full of constant sharp turns that pounded his knees not quite comrades pain he says referring to the 56 mile ultramarathon he s completed 10 times but definitely getting there for some runners however the tediousness of running back and forth across a tiny space has also been a way to trick their brains into thinking of something other than the colossal human crisis unfolding around them there are no real answers for why this is happening and this is a way to take my mind off of all that says walter tarello an italian veterinarian living in dubai who watched the horror in his home country unfold from afar last month he ran a marathon through the eighth floor corridor of his apartment building turning his head every loop to catch a glimpse of the skyscrapers arching into the dusty sky outside for mr machnik on the other hand his bedroom marathon provided little in the way of scenic distractions in fact he d clocked only a few loops before the room began to spin but he was determined to finish for two years mr machnik who runs a small adventure tour company has been on a dogged mission to run 100 marathons in 100 countries in a world record time a week and a half before he d finished marathon no 97 on the island of socotra in yemen he caught the last flight off the island when he arrived back in poland he was put into a 14 day quarantine confined to a small rented room there he watched as the dates for marathons 98 and 99 passed by canceled finally march 29 arrived the day he was meant to run marathon 100 i wanted something to celebrate he says and that something he decided would be 5 000 spins around a queen size bed get the monitor stories you care
