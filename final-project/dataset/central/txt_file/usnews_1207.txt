the first time that donald trump argued about collusion it was to claim that his political opponents were doing it then it was to argue that he had not done it now his attorney is arguing that it s not even a crime but legal experts say that the entire discussion around collusion has been beside the point it s not whether it s the crime of collusion it s whether they engaged in the act of collusion in furtherance of actual criminal behavior said bradley moss an attorney in washington d c who specializes in national security issues peter zeidenberg who was deputy special counsel in the scooter libby case and worked with special counsel robert mueller at the justice department explained that while the legal code doesn t strictly define collusion that doesn t mean acts of collusion are not criminal literally that s true there is no crime of collusion but i don t know how you collude with russia without conspiring to do so and i think it s pretty clear that mueller believes conspiracy with those working to interfere with the election is a crime it s a crime of conspiracy to commit an offense against the united states said zeidenberg what giuliani s saying is you can collude but there s not a crime and i think that s not really true i think they re constantly trying to move the goalpost trump has used the ambiguity around the term collusion to defend himself as part of a broader campaign to muddy the waters around investigations into any ties his campaign had with russians who were meddling in the 2016 election with his former campaign head paul manafort facing a trial this week on bank fraud and tax charges stemming from special counsel robert mueller s investigation trump has stepped up his attacks on the probe in the past trump has used the ambiguity around collusion to attack his opponents read more the 207 arguments trump has made against the russia probe during the republican presidential primary in 2016 he tweeted that his rivals texas sen ted cruz and ohio gov john kasich had to to team up collusion in a two on one because they couldn t beat him on their own implying something nefarious about a common political tactic in a three way race later he accused democratic nominee hillary clinton of collusion cover ups and bribery in an attack that fact checkers found false and over the top and argued without evidence that she colluded with the fbi to get an investigation into her private email server shut down but when federal investigators began looking into russian meddling in the 2016 election including any role his campaign might have played trump first argued that there was no evidence of collusion then falsely that the evidence proved there was no collusion and finally without evidence that the real collusion was with the clinton campaign since march of 2017 trump has tweeted that there was no collusion at least 90 times including twice on sunday when he argued that there is no collusion and also again without evidence that the real russian collusion on the democrats side but on monday trump s personal attorney former new york city mayor rudy giuliani argued that collusion is actually not against the law i ve been sitting here looking at the federal code trying to find collusion as a crime giuliani told fox and friends collusion is not a crime and on cnn s new day he said i don t even know if that s a crime colluding about russians i ve been saying that from the very beginning it s a very very familiar lawyers argument that the alternative my client didn t do it and even if he did it it s not a crime giuliani said later in the day on fox news trump weighed in on twitter tuesday morning with a similar argument saying that collusion isn t a crime and also noting without evidence that there was no collusion except by crooked hillary and the democrats but trump wasn t only backing up giuliani his tweet echoes arguments he has made in the past against collusion in an interview with the new york times in december trump cited a legal expert he d seen on cable news defending him there is no collusion and even if there was it s not a crime he said renato mariotti a former federal prosecutor who ran for attorney general as a democrat in illinois said the shift from no collusion to collusion is not a crime was telling instead of saying no collusion well now they re saying there is no such thing as collusion which suggests they think there is evidence out there that makes it hard for them to deny there is collusion he said and so they switched gears which is an interesting shift in strategy correction july 30th 2018 the original version of this story misstated the status of renato mariotti s candidacy for attorney general of illinois he is no longer a candidate he lost the state s primary in march write to alana abramson at alana abramson time com
