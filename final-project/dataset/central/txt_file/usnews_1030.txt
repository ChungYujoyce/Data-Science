after facing the likelihood that she would not qualify for the third debate abc announced four moderators for the debate abc news chief anchor george stephanopoulos abc news world news tonight anchor and managing editor david muir abc news correspondent linsey davis and univision anchor jorge ramos will moderate the debate stephanopoulos ramos and muir have all moderated democratic presidential primary debates in the past primary debates highlight internal party divisions hans noel an associate professor at georgetown university s department of government tells time in an email most of the candidates agree on nearly everything especially broadly speaking so the moderators will try to find space between the candidates so on what issues do they differ based on the seven hour climate change town hall held by cnn on sept 4 climate policy is becoming one such area says seth masket a professor of political science at the university of denver elizabeth warren for example proposed phasing out the use of nuclear power while cory booker and andrew yang were more optimistic about using nuclear energy the momentum from the town hall as well as the devastation of hurricane dorian in the bahamas might prompt moderators to focus on the topic candidates also differ substantially on health care some support medicare for all some strongly oppose and the subject will likely come up as it has in the past two debates while it has already been debated extensively it s too important an issue for democratic voters to not discuss says kyle kondik managing editor of sabato s crystal ball at the university of virginia center for politics after the deadly mass shootings in august masket says it s hard to imagine gun violence not coming up as well kondik also points out that beto o rourke has staked out an aggression position on guns after his hometown of el paso texas experienced a white supremacist mass shooting on aug 3 killing 22 people and injuring 24 o rourke might bring special attention to the issue the usual democratic issues of immigration and the economy will almost definitely come up although john hudak a senior fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution says he anticipates a bit of a different conversation around the economy compared to previous debates because recent signs suggest the country may be headed toward a recession masket says the forecast could be an area for democrats to attack president donald trump each candidate will start the debate with opening remarks but abc has said there will be no closing remarks compared to previous debates the september debate will allow candidates more time for their answers one minute and 15 seconds for direct responses and 45 seconds for rebuttals the first two debates hosted by nbc and cnn allowed for one minute responses and 30 second rebuttals political analysts told time to watch for clashes between biden and warren the former vice president and massachusetts senator represent different wings of the party biden the more moderate and warren the more progressive and are one and two in the polls this is the first time they ll face off in a dnc debate if warren s is going to move into the number one position she really has to take biden down a number of pegs masket says kondik theorizes they might clash over their different approaches to healthcare or their different rationale for running for president because biden is is the presumed front runner he will likely also face attacks from booker harris yang and other candidates to his left harris had stand out moments in the previous debates such as when she went after biden for his stance on busing and is likely hoping to have a similarly viral moment again hudak of brookings says the most interesting dynamic will be between warren and sanders who are neck in neck in the polls partially because there s a real need for bernie sanders to get reinvigorated as they fight for ideologically similar voters they avoided confronting each other in previous debates but the smaller field might force them to in hudak s opinion lower polling candidates might seek out clashes because they view the debate as a last gasp to stand out and one effective way to stand out is to go on the attack and to win klobuchar is another moderate candidate who might clash with the left leaning sanders or warren and castro and o rourke who both represent texas might go after each other as they did in the first debate the debate in general might be more fiery than previous ones because the field is winnowing more rapidly jennifer victor an associate professor of political science at george mason university s schar school policy and government tells time according to realclearpolitics s national polling average on sept 12 the candidates in the debate have the following polling averages masket says that on average there has been little movement in the polls for many of the candidates since early spring when the campaign season really heated up but there s one exception elizabeth warren one of the real stories has been the slow steady rise of elizabeth warren he says she has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the summer moving into sanders no 2 spot what about other candidates david barker a professor of government at american university writes in an email that buttigieg has really fallen back after being the darling of the spring season he is now consistently in the same range as booker and o rourke he does poll better in iowa though so he is not dead harris has also see her numbers decline since her initial spike after the first debate which kondik says just goes to show the changes that we see from these debates may not be enduring if they even occur at all victor also cautions against reading too much into polls because at this stage in the race many voters haven t made up their minds and are heavily influenced by name recognition the debate will be broadcast on abc news
