sen cory booker is adding another line to his resume presidential candidate with an early morning tweet and an email to his supporters the new jersey democrat made official his white house ambitions it is not a matter of can we it s a matter of do we have the collective will the american will i believe we do booker says in his introductory video together we will channel our common pain back into our common purpose together america we will rise minutes after that note went out he was scheduled to do a round of phone interviews starting with the tom joyner morning show the syndicated staple that is the top show with urban audiences booker was then scheduled to phone univision s despierta america a spanish language program and speak with the black eagle s joe madison a host and civil rights activist on siriusxm s urban view channel his first television interview will take place friday on abc s the view taken together the media bookings speak to how he like many of his declared and potential democratic rivals sees a pathway to the nomination with the support of african americans hispanics and women but he s not alone in this view of the campaign that lies ahead for instance sen kamala harris who is african american announced her candidacy on abc s good morning america on martin luther king jr day she is basing her campaign in baltimore and made her first campaign rally in oakland calif this approach may work on a macro national level but could hit speedbumps early on iowa which has scheduled its lead off caucuses for feb 1 2020 now exactly one year away and new hampshire s lead off primary are hardly bastions of diversity that s why some potential candidates like sen sherrod brown who is in iowa and heading to new hampshire see a path for a white man from the midwest or why three days after announcing her campaign on stephen colbert s program sen kirsten gillibrand of new york was on the ground in iowa sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts who announced on dec 30 that she was forming an exploratory committee has also been making the early state rounds all that helps explain why booker felt necessary to enter early and start making visits of his own to those same leadoff states his advisers said he would be campaigning in iowa on feb 8 and 9 and in south carolina feb 10 and 11 president s day weekend will take him to new hampshire the field is expected to be the most diverse in history and could be the largest that in turn could complicate matters already there are discussions about having democratic debates on back to back nights to accommodate the potentially unwieldy field donors say would be candidates are already burning up cell phone minutes with pitches for their candidacies but a handful of candidates stand ready to be introduced to the country as a potential president and booker at age 49 has proven himself a media savvy lawmaker his unsuccessful first race for newark mayor in 2002 was documented in the documentary street fight four years later he won the seat and used his perch to highlight the challenges of america s urban core and the city s turnaround he leveraged his celebrity friendships to fund newark s struggling schools his philanthropic footprint topped 400 million by the time he left the mayor s office in 2013 when he was appointed to the senate booker didn t shed his social media presence and instead became a model for his new colleagues to varying degrees of success and authenticity he was elected to his first full term the following year booker who counts stanford yale and oxford universities among his degrees has a largely liberal voting record but sought to create bipartisan opportunities from the start of his term in the senate for instance he has worked with sens rand paul of kentucky and tim scott of south carolina on criminal justice reforms and is friendly with sen ted cruz of texas in 2012 he said his party s attacks on gop nominee mitt romney s business record was nauseating new jersey is home to many wall street executives but liberals simply added it to their list of reasons to distrust booker as too cozy with big business that s not to say booker is a squish he took extraordinary steps to block then sen jeff sessions nomination to become attorney general testifying against his then colleague to the judiciary committee he voted against 16 of donald trump s 19 initial cabinet picks and he went rogue during the hearings for supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh releasing a document that republicans had sought to keep confidential facing the threat of expulsion from the senate for the release booker joked he was having a spartacus moment the unknown for booker is whether can build a sufficient and durable coalition of activists and donors to sway voters in the right places to that end his advisers point to a record of fighting big unwinnable battles and then winning for instance in 1998 the then 29 year old booker beat a four term incumbent to win a seat on newark s city council more recently he led the first major rewrite of the nation s criminal code in a generation and worked with partners persuaded the trump administration to back it booker s advisers also expect the campaign to talk extensively about his family story booker s father grew up poor in north carolina and his church passed a collection plate to send the elder booker to college booker also plans to tell voters about his family facing housing discrimination a potentially useful tale that can connect with voters who also feel the system is unfair but these advisers caution don t expect booker to run as an aggrieved candidate they point to an optimism that is a through line of his career in politics including two well received speeches at democrats nominating conventions that drew comparisons to barack obama just a few weeks ago as he was in south carolina for martin luther king jr day events he sounded a bell of comity i ve come to learn in this country that we have a common pain but we seem to have lost a sense of common purpose booker said we need each other we must awaken a more courageous empathy booker is about to test if that can be a winning
