have found nothing in the last eight hours already facing criticism for his disparaging rhetoric about the fourth estate president donald trump told supporters at a wisconsin rally on wednesday that the media is partly to blame for societal divisions that spilled into full view this week the remarks came hours after he told reporters at a white house press briefing that acts of threats or political violence have no place in the united states of america calling for unity the media also has a responsibility to set a civil tone and to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories trump said to a cheering crowd a very big part of the anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the mainstream media that i refer to as fake news he said in a tweet thursday morning it has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media must clean up its act fast cnn chief jeff zucker weighed in late wednesday denouncing remarks made by trump and white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders the trump administration has frequently sought to undermine the press by calling the media fake news singling out critical journalists and accusing major news outlets of lying the president and especially the white house press secretary should understand their words matter said zucker the president of cnn worldwide thus far they have shown no comprehension of that the packages which have been sent to the fbi laboratory in quantico virginia for analysis were all similar in appearance the fbi said although the motive behind the packages and the identity of those responsible are not yet known the individual recipients are high profile democrats many of whom have been been critical of the trump administration and a media outlet that is a frequent target of trump s ire during rallies and on twitter cnn received a further scare thursday evening when part of the time warner center mall in manhattan was evacuated as authorities checked out a report of two unattended packages the associated press reported the time warner center houses cnn headquarters in new york the new york police department later confirmed on twitter that the report of a suspicious package at the time warner building has been investigated by nypd officers and has been deemed safe no hazardous items found here s what to know about the suspicious packages sent to prominent politicians and cnn this week at least 10 similar packages were sent to prominent democrats or democratic supporters and recovered between oct 22 and oct 25 they were mailed in manila envelopes with six forever stamps and the florida address of former democratic national committee dnc chair debbie wasserman schultz on the return label containing potentially destructive devices the fbi said the packages were addressed to liberal philanthropist george soros former secretary of state hillary clinton former president barack obama former cia director john brennan in care of cnn former u s attorney general eric holder california rep maxine waters former vice president joe biden and actor robert de niro brennan is a trump critic whose security clearance was revoked by the president in august and de niro has publicly condemned the president saying f k trump at the tony awards this year this investigation is of the highest priority for the fbi fbi director christopher wray said in a statement we have committed the full strength of the fbi s resources and together with our partners on our joint terrorism task forces we will continue to work to identify and arrest whoever is responsible for sending these packages the u s secret service intercepted the suspicious package sent to clinton s chappaqua new york home late tuesday night and intercepted a package addressed to obama on wednesday morning in washington d c those packages came just two days after a bomb was found in the mailbox soros home in bedford new york the packages were immediately identified during routine mail screenings as potential explosive devices there was no risk of clinton or obama receiving the packages the secret service said in a statement at an event in florida clinton told a crowd we are fine thanks to the men and women of the secret service she added but it s a troubling time isn t it the packages set off safety concerns and caused evacuations in political offices around the country wednesday in florida two offices for wasserman schultz were evacuated after one of the suspicious packages was sent to her it was addressed to holder but had the florida congresswoman s address on the return label the associated press reported we will not be intimidated by this attempted act of violence she said in a statement later wednesday this appalling attack on our democracy must be vigorously prosecuted and i am deeply disturbed by the way my name was used cnn s offices in new york city were evacuated after one of the packages was found there an incident new york city mayor bill de blasio described as an act of terror attempting to undermine our free press and leaders of this county through acts of violence a field office for sen kamala harris in san diego calif was also evacuated wednesday after suspicious packages were found near the building though they were not addressed to the senator or her office house democratic leader nancy pelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer issued a joint statement wednesday afternoon calling on president trump to reverse his statements that condone acts of violence we listened with great interest to the president s remarks this afternoon we all take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the american people and that is our first responsibility they said in the statement however president trump s words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that condone acts of violence time and time again the president has condoned physical violence and divided americans with his words and his actions expressing support for the congressman who body slammed a reporter the neo nazis who killed a young woman in charlottesville his supporters at rallies who get violent with protestors dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people cnn worldwide president jeff zucker went further in his admonishment of the administration there is a total and complete lack of understanding at the white house about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media the president and especially the white house press secretary should understand their words matter thus far they have shown no comprehension of that at an event wednesday night brennan also faulted trump for rhetoric that promotes violence criticizing a continued failure on the part of donald trump to live up to what i think should be all of our expectations of what an american president should be doing unfortunately i think donald trump too often has helped to incite some of these feelings of anger if not violence when he points to acts of violence or also talks about you know swinging at somebody from the press brennan said adding if i and others are being targeted because we are speaking out and we re living up to our responsibilities as citizens i think that again is a very unfortunate turn of events the federal government is conducting an aggressive investigation and we will find those responsible and we will bring them to justice hopefully very quickly trump said at a rally in wisconsin on wednesday night any acts or threats of political violence are an attack on our democracy itself no nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation coercion or control such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted but he also blamed the media for the state of civility in american politics calling on the press to stop the endless hostility and constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders who condemned the cowards behind the pipe bombs also pushed back against any suggestion that trump s rhetoric had escalated political tension it is absolutely disgraceful that one of the first public statements we heard from cnn yesterday was to put the blame and the responsibility of this despicable act on the president and on me personally when person that is responsible for this is the person who made and created and put these suspicious packages in the hands and in the arms of innocent american citizens sanders told fox news on thursday there s a big difference between comments made and actions taken
