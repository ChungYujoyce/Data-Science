setting the stage for possible weeks of uncertainty the still undecided races will not tip the balance in either chamber of congress but include contests in parts of the country important to the futures of both parties and potentially to president donald trump s re election chances in two years in georgia where republican brian kemp declared victory in the governor s contest on wednesday on a narrow lead campaign officials for democrat stacey abrams on thursday vowed to pursue litigation to ensure all votes are counted in florida s u s senate race republican governor rick scott with his lead over democratic incumbent bill nelson narrowing filed lawsuits on thursday against election supervisors in two counties accusing them of failing to follow election law a spokesman for nelson dan mclaughlin said the lawsuits were politically motivated and borne out of desperation the florida governor s race between republican ron desantis and democrat andrew gillum also appeared headed for an automatic recount after desantis lead narrowed on thursday despite gillum having already conceded the hotly contested u s senate race in arizona between two congresswomen democrat kyrsten sinema and republican martha mcsally appeared days away from a final call with hundreds of thousands of ballots yet to be tallied sinema took a slight lead over mcsally on thursday night as more ballots were counted democrats on tuesday won a majority in the u s house of representatives after eight years as the minority party in the chamber while republicans appeared likely to expand their two seat advantage in the u s senate another cluster of races in the lower house where votes are still being finalized could add to the democrats new majority strengthening their hand as they seek to counter trump s policies republican u s representative karen handel conceded defeat to democrat lucy mcbath a gun control advocate in a suburban atlanta district on thursday democrats also picked up two republican districts in washington state and new mexico on wednesday night although republicans held on to an open north carolina district in a close race according to media outlet calls and the data company ddhq democrats now have flipped 32 seats nine more than they needed to take over the house with seven republican held districts still too close to call including four in california where many ballots are yet to be counted abrams is vying to become the first black woman elected to serve as governor of a u s state the georgia contest came under national scrutiny because of kemp s role as the state s top election official voting rights groups and prominent democrats accused the republican of using his position to suppress minority votes an allegation he strongly denied kemp said on thursday he had resigned as georgia s secretary of state saying the move would ensure public confidence in the final results while freeing him to focus on preparing for his new role as governor the abrams campaign told reporters that there were enough uncounted ballots to force a runoff under state law if no candidate reaches 50 percent of the vote the top two finishers advance to a second vote in december the election included a third party candidate kemp s vote count stood at 50 33 percent as of thursday according to unofficial results we are in this race until we are convinced that every vote is counted the abrams campaign s chairwoman allegra lawrence hardy told a news conference the campaign said it would file the first of what could be a wave of legal actions on behalf of voters in one county who had difficulty voting absentee the kemp campaign accused abrams of trying to steal the election stacey abrams can t accept the fact that georgians rejected her radical agenda at the ballot box so now she s desperately trying to steal this election in the courtroom said campaign spokesman ryan mahoney in a statement in florida scott s lead was narrowing on thursday nelson trailed by around 15 000 votes or 0 18 percent below the state s 0 25 percent threshold for a hand recount the results are unknown said marc elias an attorney for nelson s campaign historically democrats tend to pick up votes in recounts especially hand recounts he said elias also pledged legal action if the campaign found that rejected ballots due to signature mismatches were disproportionately hurting minority voters scott s lawsuits accuse broward county supervisor of elections brenda snipes and palm beach county supervisor of elections susan bucher of mishandling the ballot count and preventing observers from having full access as votes are counted snipes and bucher did not immediately respond to a request for comment scott also said he was asking the florida department of law enforcement to investigate i will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election scott told reporters in the florida governor s race desantis lead had winnowed to about 38 500 votes on thursday afternoon or 0 47 percent of the vote the state conducts an electronic recount when the margin falls below 0 5 percent gillum s campaign said it was prepared for any outcome including a recount we want every vote counted gillum said in a video posted to facebook on thursday in spite of the fact that we re a little bit down in the numbers we re hopeful that every single vote will be counted in
