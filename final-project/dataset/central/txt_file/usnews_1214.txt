after being held in an ice detention center i noticed immediately how many sick children there were in detention that no effort was being made to separate the sick from the healthy juarez said in her congressional testimony within a week of their arrival at an ice facility juarez s daughter mariee developed symptoms including a fever cough diarrhea and vomiting i begged them to do deeper exams but they the detention facility s medical staff sent us back to our room she told congress at one point the staff treated 19 month old mariee with vicks vaporub which is not recommended for children under

appropriate medical care more than 50 000 people are currently being held in ice facilities while approximately 20 000 are being held in cbp centers more than 11 000 children are now in the custody of hhs which holds unaccompanied children for an average of 45 days many are fleeing violence in northern triangle countries el salvador guatemala and honduras during the trump administration 24 immigrants including seven children have died in u s custody it is unknown precisely how many migrants have died attempting to cross the border although existing totals are likely to be underestimates last week reports emerged that border patrol agents had joked about migrant deaths in a facebook group at least 30 children have not been reunited with their parents according to a report from democrats on the committee the united nations high commissioner for human rights condemned america s detention of migrant children saying that it may violate international law the u s also guarantees certain rights to migrant children under the 1997 flores settlement in the 1980s and 1990s lawsuits against the government for mistreatment of unaccompanied children including 15 year old jenny lisette flores of el salvador culminated in the settlement of 1997 under the agreement u s immigration and border enforcement agencies would seek to avoid holding unaccompanied for longer than 20 days during which time they would be provided with 1 access to food and drinking water 2 medical assistance in the event of emergencies 3 toilets and sinks 4 adequate temperature control and ventilation 5 adequate supervision to protect minors from others 6 separation from unrelated adults whenever possible and 7 contact with family members who were arrested with the minor but flores did not take full effect until over a decade later when some parts of the settlement agreement became federal law as a part of the 2008 trafficking victims protection reauthorization act tvpra a federal judge ruled in 2015 that the flores requirements apply to both unaccompanied minors as well as children who are with their parents in 2018 the department of justice tried to get the same judge to modify the agreement to allow for indefinite detention but the request was denied u s customs and border protection is only supposed to hold people in short term detention for 72 hours before referring them to the department of health and human services for unaccompanied children and ice for all others but due to backlogs the limit has been frequently surpassed unable to accommodate increasing numbers of migrants the agencies have turned to makeshift alternatives such as constructing tent cities and moving children to an army base once used as an internment camp for japanese americans during world war ii in texas hhs converted a walmart and a former oilfield worker camp into holding centers for unaccompanied children both chambers of congress passed additional funding measures for the border but the bill initially proposed by the democratic controlled house had more restrictions on how the trump administration could spend the money the house ultimately acquiesced approving the senate s less restrictive version before the recess without pressuring the trump administration into any significant concessions on children in migrant detention facilities four house democrats refused to vote for the senate s version including reps alexandria ocasio cortez and ilhan omar throwing more money at the very organizations committing human rights abuses and the very administration directing these human rights abuses is not a solution omar said in a statement kevin mcaleenan the acting dhs secretary has agreed to testify before the committee on july 18 contact us at editors time com
