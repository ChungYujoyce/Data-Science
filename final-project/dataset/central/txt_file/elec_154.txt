 the 360 shows you diverse perspectives on the day s top stories and debates what s happening in the span of three days joe biden received endorsements from a trio of the democratic party s most prominent voices as his presidential campaign shifts from the primary to the upcoming general election against donald trump the first endorsement came from sen bernie sanders biden s chief rival in the primary sanders called for the party to come together to defeat trump whom he called the most dangerous president in the modern history of this country the duo also announced the creation of six working groups to help find middle ground between biden s more moderate policies and sanders s progressive platform a day later barack obama formally endorsed biden saying his former vice president has the character and the experience to guide us through one of our darkest times and heal us through a long recovery on wednesday sen elizabeth warren threw her support behind biden as well biden now has the backing of each significant competitor in the primary plus a long list of lawmakers and former high ranking officials why there s debate this string of endorsements could provide biden a significant boost in the general election some political analysts argue many in the progressive wing of the party particularly sanders supporters have been intensely critical of biden throughout the campaign for his moderate policies and tenure in the senate sanders and warren throwing their support behind biden could help alleviate that skepticism among more liberal democrats partnering with sanders on policy may also signal to progressive voters that they have a voice in the democratic party obama s endorsement could also make a difference the former president is extremely popular among democrats and his support could help drive turnout in groups that biden likely needs to win in november the endorsement also bolsters the biden campaign s narrative that he represents a continuation of obama s legacy some argue others are skeptical that these endorsements will have much of an impact many in the left wing of the party are so staunchly opposed to biden that even the backing of the progressive movement s standard bearers won t convince them the influential group democratic socialists of america announced it would not be supporting biden following sanders s endorsement this same group also holds a less favorable view of the obama presidency and is less likely to be swayed by his support of biden the timing of the endorsements in the midst of a pandemic that is drowning out all other news may also stunt their impact some argue what s next as he looks to shore up support within the left wing of the party biden has reportedly been in contact with rep alexandria ocasio cortez and other young lawmakers in the squad ocasio cortez said she hopes to have some policy conversation with biden and his team before formally endorsing his candidacy the endorsements were an important show of unity obama s speech underscored that democrats are far less divided than their primary battle suggested from health care to climate change to economic inequality democrats have moved across the board in a more progressive direction obama has done so himself because he sees openings for social reform now that he didn t have when he was in office e j dionne jr washington post policy changes not endorsements are needed to win over progressive voters their lingering skepticism of biden signals an emerging pressure campaign to score key policy concessions from the former vice president a relative moderate who for months fought off criticism from progressives that his platform and political history were out of step with a younger more liberal democratic coalition max greenwood the hill sanders carries major sway over progressive democrats normally it s not particularly important when one candidate in a primary endorses another but sanders is not a normal candidate he inspires passionate support and he doesn t identify as a member of the democratic party some of his voters won t automatically shift their support to another democrat david leonhardt new york times the impact of the endorsements was reduced because of the timing in ordinary times the past two weeks would have been a campaign highlight reel for joe biden to biden s dismay these are not ordinary times the national struggle against the covid 19 pandemic has dramatically altered american life and completely upended traditional politics carl golden burlington county times the endorsements show progressives that there s space for them in the democratic party biden is acting less like a candidate than a party leader less like one side of an argument that will be settled by his victory and more like a legislator who recognizes the only way to win is to make real serious concessions to his colleagues he s not asking the left to bend the knee and accept his victory he s inviting them into coalition and offering concrete concessions and avenues of influence in return for their participation ezra klein vox obama s support likely won t change many votes i just don t think there s anyone out there who is saying well i was on the fence about biden but now that obama has endorsed him he has my support nathaniel rakich fivethirtyeight obama could have made more of an impact with an endorsement during the primary while it s not clear if there was anyone else obama wanted his backing of biden when there are no alternatives smacks of acceptance rather than preference michael goodwin new york post obama is a better spokesman for biden than biden himself endorsements are almost always overrated in campaigns as voters want the candidate to make their own case but this one from barack and michelle obama is critical to joe biden because the two can frame the stakes of the election and the personal qualities of joe biden in a way that is more compelling and effective than even biden can himself joe lockhart cnn is there a topic you d like to see covered in the 360 send your suggestions to the360 yahoonews com is coronavirus a threat to america s food supply how are
