always been to help unify americans to defeat donald trump and to win the era for our values buttigieg said so we must recognize that at this point in the race the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our country together so tonight i am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency buttigieg ssuccess in the campaign even aside from his personal story was a remarkable achievement as the mayor of a midsize midwestern town he rosefrom relative political obscurity to become a viable candidate for the white house his narrow one delegate victory over sanders in iowawas overshadowedbythe vote counting chaos there and his winremained in doubt until it was confirmed after a final recanvass and recount werecompleted by every conventional wisdom by every historical measure we were never supposed to get anywhere at all buttigieg said a week after iowa sen amy klobuchar surged into a third place finish in new hampshire eating into buttigieg s support among the center left bloc of voters he finished second there to sanders by 1 percentage point his campaign never found its footing after that and he failed to reach 15 support in both nevada and south carolina buttigieg s exit before super tuesday also bucks the past 20 years of history in the iowa democratic caucuses every democratic winner of the caucuses since 2000 has gone on to be the democratic party s nominee butwith his victory in iowa buttigieg achieved what would have been considered politically impossible just a decade ago let s vote when are the 2020 presidential election primaries and on the night of the caucuses an emotional buttigieg was clearly struck by the significance of what he had accomplished he said his campaign s success taught him to believe in american belonging and that it left him remembering how it felt to be an indiana teenager wondering if he would ever belong in this world wondering if something deep inside him meant that he would forever be an outsider that he might never wear the uniform never be accepted never even know love now that same person is standing in front of you a mayor a veteran happily married and one step closer to becoming the next president of the united states buttigieg came out in a 2015 op ed in the south bend tribune months before being elected to his second mayoral term with 80 of the 10 000 plus votes cast in june hetold the des moines register that he did not want his sexuality to be the only thing he was known for i am proud of who i am buttigieg said i m certainly very proud of my marriage and my husband we don t shy away from that it s also not the only thing that defines me buttigieg s democratic opponents immediately responded with well wishes as news of his departure from the race broke thank you petebuttigieg i know you ll continue giving back and serving our country for many years to come sen elizabeth warren tweeted president donald trump reacted to buttigieg s dropping out sunday by again implying democrats are trying to get sanders out of the race pete buttigieg is out all of his supertuesday votes will go to sleepy joe biden great timing this is the real beginning of the dems taking bernie out of play no nomination again the tweet said buttigieg a former navy intelligence officer whoserved in afghanistan was one of the few military veterans in the race as a rhodes scholar with degrees from harvard university and the university of oxford who speaks multiple languages he also had some of the highest academic credentials in the race during the campaign he pitched himself as a moderate alternative to progressive candidates like sanders and warren one who was also younger and more in tune with the current democratic party than biden at 38 hewas the youngest of the presidential candidates yet he failed to connect with voters under age 30 who ironically tended to favor the 78 year old sanders on the other hand he performed well with older voters i want to be brave like you boy 9 asks pete buttigieg for help coming out as gay from the beginning buttigieg s candidacy was haunted by headlines about his inability to win the support of minority voters particularly african americans despite this efforts to make strides with black and latino communities his pollnumbers remained dismal with those demographics and that lack of support left him unable to compete as the race moved into more diverse states like nevada and south carolina during the campaign buttigieg faced criticism for his response to a police shooting of an african american man in south bend as well as the lack of diversity on the town s police force his campaign did find enthusiastic support among wealthy democratic donors and was a top recipient of donations from wall street contributors those contributions led sandersto paint him as thecandidate of the powerful corporations who would not represent the interests of working americans buttigieg who trailed only sanders and warren in contributions of less than 200 defended his campaign s acceptance of large donor donations he toldfox news that while he was not a fan of the current campaign finance system he was also insistent that we have got to go into this with all of the support we can get contributing maureen groppe usa today barbara rodriguez the des moines register andrew
