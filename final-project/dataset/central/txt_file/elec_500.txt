caption president trump s poll numbers are starting to dip at exactly the wrong time a new npr marist poll finds trump s approval rating at 39 percent in a troubling sign for republicans less than two months before november s elections democrats advantage on the question of which party americans are more likely to vote for in november is ballooning according to a new npr marist poll the gap has widened to 12 percentage points up from 7 in july and it is largely because of voters in the midwest they have swung 13 points in democrats direction since july that midwestern shift is consistent with what marist has found in statewide polls conducted for nbc in michigan wisconsin and minnesota that showed president trump s support there starting to erode every way we are looking at the data the same general pattern is emerging said lee miringoff director of the marist institute for public opinion which conducted the poll the midwest is an area that is getting restless about what they hoped was going to occur and what they feel is not occurring trump has waged trade wars with several countries aiming to renegotiate deals and has instituted tariffs on imports that have been met with retaliatory tariffs on exports many of those have taken a toll on midwestern farmers for example and some automakers have come out against trump s moves on car imports hitting trump with some tough headlines and that appears to be sticking to the gop now republicans have not only been fairly silent in opposition to the president miringoff said but they ve been driving very hard in the senate when it comes to his supreme court nominee congressional republicans are buying into trump for november in terms of brand they look totally in lockstep with the president and that has become extremely clear to voters overall in the poll half of voters 50 percent said they are more likely to vote for the democrat in their congressional district over the republican 38 percent in july the democratic edge was 47 percent to 40 percent it s the largest gap on this question known as the congressional ballot since december 2017 when marist showed democrats with a 13 point advantage the lead is also similar to democrats advantage on the question in 2006 the last time they took back the house trump approval dangerously low trump s approval rating is below 40 percent in the poll just 39 percent said they approve of the job the president is doing the rating is unchanged from the last marist poll in july but it s the third poll this week to show trump below 40 percent amid the release of an explosive new book from journalist bob woodward detailing chaos in the trump white house and an op ed in the new york times from what the paper describes as a senior official who writes that there is a resistance within the trump administration to save the country from the president the gop s and the president s weaknesses continue to be in the suburbs and now with midwestern voters they retain advantages in rural areas the south and with white non college educated voters and white evangelicals but even in rural areas and small towns there has been some slippage from july it s not that democrats are going to carry rural america miringoff stressed but republicans are not performing the way the president needs them to in small towns for example there was an 11 point swing toward democrats and there was a 6 point drop off among rural voters on the congressional ballot the president s approval rating in the suburbs is just 34 percent and in those same suburbs democrats enjoy a whopping advantage 56 percent to 34 percent over republicans on whom americans are more likely to vote for that is particularly problematic for republicans because many of the key races for control of the house run through the suburbs there is also a massive gender gap men approve of the job trump is doing a 50 percent to 42 percent margin but women who are fueling democratic hopes in these midterm elections disapprove of his job 62 percent to 28 percent in the 2016 presidential election trump won 41 percent of women according to exit polls this is an election about gender miringoff said pointing out that party identification and race are still major factors but the gender numbers are much bigger than might be expected after 2016 what happens when approval slips the npr marist poll was conducted sept 5 through sunday it surveyed 777 registered voters and has a margin of error of 4 percentage points the two other polls out this week that showed the president slipping below 40 percent were cnn and quinnipiac cnn had trump at 37 percent and quinnipiac 38 percent slightly earlier polls that meet npr s polling standards from gallup yougov 43 percent ipsos 42 percent and selzer 43 percent had trump at or slightly above 40 percent for context let s look at some history to see where that ranks and what it could mean for the gop s chances in two months just one president since polling began was below 40 percent in the last gallup poll before a president s first midterm harry truman in 1946 gallup has comprehensive historical data on presidential approval ratings just 33 percent of americans approved of the job truman was doing less than a year after the end of world war ii his party wound up losing 55 house and 12 senate seats truman s 12 seat loss in the senate remains the worst for a president s first midterm since 1862 according to numbers from vital statistics on congress it s hard to compare to just one president however so widening out the lens there have been plenty of presidents who were below 50 percent before their first midterm and on average their parties lost 44 house seats and five senate seats a performance like that for republicans this year would give democrats control of both the house and senate democrats need a net gain of 23 seats to gain control of the house and two seats to take the senate every election though has its unique factors not every president below 50 percent had as favorable a senate map as republicans do not every president below 50 percent had structural house district advantages because of redistricting or the fact that the opposition party has holed up in cities and arguably not since the civil war has the country been as polarized politically as it is today but overall first term midterms are not kind to the president s party on average they have lost 29 house and three senate seats dating back to truman and it s even worse when the country thinks the president isn t doing a very good job presidents approval ratings when they are low in midterm elections cause havoc for the party in power miringoff noted and trump s approval rating he added is casting a cloud over the gop congress performances by a president s party in his first midtermsorted by most to least house losses based on gallup approvals vital statistics data 2010 obama 45 approval lost 63 house lost 6 senate 1946

this story incorrectly said harry truman s democrats lost 45 seats in the house in 1946 the party lost 55 seats in that midterm in addition the earlier version said when a president s approval rating is below 50 percent ahead of his first midterm on average his party loses 41 house seats and six senate seats using numbers from vital statistics on congress the president s party lost 44 house seats
