generations of american children have learned the apocryphal tale of young george washington bravely admitting to his father that he chopped down the cherry tree the story sprang from a culture that wanted even its fables to serve the ideal of truth by that standard the house intelligence committee hearing on march 20 should have been a massive humiliation for the president who followed washington 228 years later it is rare for such hearings to be unclassified and thus televised but fbi director james comey found the largest possible audience for his rebuke of the sitting president he had given donald trump nearly three weeks to walk back his incendiary tweets accusing president obama of wire tapping trump tower during the campaign if such surveillance had been done through legal channels the fbi would have known if done illegally it was a scandal of historic proportions and the fbi should be digging into it either way trump s accusation implicated the integrity of comey s bureau which is why the former prosecutor felt compelled to push back as the cameras rolled i have no information that supports those tweets comey said we have looked carefully inside the fbi the department of justice has asked me to share with you that the answer is the same the statement was concise direct and damning the president of the united states had been marked as a fabulist by one of the top officials in government charged with finding the truth and yet for the man being called out the rebuke was nothing of the sort i m a very instinctual person but my instinct turns out to be right trump told time two days later in a 20 minute phone interview from the oval office the testimony in other words had not fazed him at all he was still convinced he would be proved right i have articles saying it happened that is not exactly true the new york times reported on jan 20 that wiretapped data had been used in an investigation of trump s advisers but not that obama had targeted trump for wiretapping as trump had claimed but he had new ammunition house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes had just announced that he had seen intelligence reports showing the president elect and his team were at least monitored as part of legally collected information nunes suggested the monitoring was most likely the result of incidental collection which occurs when a target of an intelligence operation like a foreign ambassador talks with another u s person but nunes never claimed that obama wiretapped trump and yet for trump who proceeded to read at length over the phone from a politico article on nunes statement such distinctions did not matter that means i m right he said he also argued that the punctuation in his original tweet meant he did not mean wiretapping in the literal sense when i said wire tapping it was in quotes he said what did he mean trump argued that his claims about scandalous wiretaps by obama had to be viewed within the context of other assertions he had made in the past which had later come true he had predicted for instance that the sexting of former representative anthony weiner would become a problem for hillary clinton s campaign which it did when the fbi found emails to clinton on his computer he had claimed that he would win the white house when few believed him which he did he claimed that britain would vote to exit the european union i took a lot of heat when i said brexit was going to pass he described brussels as a hellhole before a major terrorist attack there i happen to be a person that knows how life works he said he also claimed credit for things he had said that were factually incorrect at the time but for which he later found evidence at a february rally in a discussion about problems caused by new migrants in europe he said look at what s happening last night in sweden nothing had happened the prior night in sweden prompting diplomatic protests from stockholm but days later there was a riot in a predominantly immigrant suburb in response to a local arrest which to the president s way of thinking made him a truth teller i was right about that he said truth in other words takes time to ripen he also said his unsubstantiated claim that at least 3 million undocumented immigrants had voted illegally in the 2016 election would be proved right eventually though he hinted to time that he no longer stood by all parts of that claim when i say that i mean mostly they register wrong in other words for the votes they register incorrectly and or illegally the president said i m forming a committee on it the more the conversation continued the more the binary distinctions between truth and falsehood blurred the telltale sign of a veteran and strategic misleader who knows enough to leave himself an escape route when he tosses a bomb rather than assert things outright he often couches provocative statements as beliefs or attributes them to unnamed very smart people during the campaign he claimed falsely that texas senator ted cruz s father had consorted with the assassin who killed john f kennedy now as president trump argued that he had done nothing wrong by spreading the fiction since it had been printed in the national enquirer a tabloid famous for its unconventional editorial standards why do you say that i have to apologize he asked i am just quoting the newspaper he appeared to do it again when he repeated the accusation of a fox news contributor andrew napolitano who claimed his network was told by three former intelligence officials that obama had asked the british to surveil trump s campaign fox news repudiated the claim the pundit vanished from the airwaves the british called the accusation ridiculous and the head of the u s national security agency said it would not have happened under his watch and yet trump did not back down i have a lot of respect for judge napolitano he said i don t know where he has gone with it since then trump has in this way brought to the oval office an entirely different set of assumptions about the proper behavior of a public official and introduced to the country entirely new rules for public debate in some ways it is not surprising for years we have known trump colored outside the lines of what was actually real because he told us as a businessman trump wrote in praise of strategic falsehood or truthful hyperbole as he preferred to call it sometimes his whoppers were clumsy the apparent result of being ill informed or promiscuous in his sources sometimes he exaggerated to get a rise out of his audience but often trump s untruths give every sign of being deliberate and thought through trump recently bragged about a drop in the labor department jobless rate after calling the same statistic phony when it signaled improvement under obama trump explained the contradiction through his spokesman with a quip they may have been phony in the past but it s very real now through it all he has presented himself as the last honest man and among his fervent supporters he hits notes that harmonize with the facts of their lives as they deeply feel them to beat a polygraph it s said you should make some part of your brain believe what you are saying friends of trump report that the president would pass with flying colors he tells them privately that he believes the things he tweets in public despite the luxury and ease of his own life he seems genuine in his belief that the system is rigged and that life is a zero sum game no one wins without someone else losing reality for the reality show mogul is something to be invented episode by episode and what reality is trump creating he entered national politics in 2011 peddling the incredible theory that obama might have been born in africa and therefore constitutionally barred from the presidency in those days trump was widely dismissed as a reckless self promoter though he clung to his story for five years using it to get television bookings and newspaper coverage before surrendering it with a shrug looking back it s striking to see a future president testing the waters by charging the elected incumbent with fraud and illegitimacy without introducing a shred of evidence that was a fitting warm up for trump s official entry into the 2016 campaign the mexican government he alleged is deliberately dumping its hoodlums in the u s later that year he answered the paris terrorist attacks by claiming without substantiation that he had seen thousands and thousands of people celebrating in new jersey as the twin towers smoldered on 9 11 on television no footage is known to exist trump s alternative reality is dark divisive and pessimistic and it tends to position him and his supporters as heroic victims of injustice despite this or maybe because of it his reckless assertions are weapons that often work he commandeers the traditional news cycle and makes visceral connections with voters by taking on obama over his birth certificate trump charmed a right wing constituency and ratcheted himself to the level of white house ready by scorning good manners to attack border crossers and muslims trump showed solidarity with the politically incorrect and advertised his iconoclasm by flouting fact checkers and making journalists his enemy he is driving home the theme that his turbulent presidency is a struggle to the death with a despised washington elite trump has discovered something about epistemology in the 21st century the truth may be real but falsehood often works better it is for this same reason that russia deployed paid internet trolls in the 2016 campaign according to u s investigators repeatedly promoting lies on u s social networks to muddy the debate in the radical democracy of social media even the retweets of outraged truth squadders has the effect of rebroadcasting false messages controversy elevates message and it keeps the president on offense if the fable of president trump is ever written young donald might say to his father i m not gonna lie to you dad the tree has been chopped smart people say maybe by illegal immigrants or muslims there are some bad hombres anyway it s gone and i m gonna build something truly terrific on this parcel these big falsehoods are different explains bill adair who created politifact the fact checking journalistic site that won a pulitzer prize they are like a neutron bomb they just take over the discussion and obliterate a lot of other things that we should be discussing since winning the white house trump has employed this weapon at specific times often when he is losing control of the national story line he pulled the trigger on nov 27 a day after clinton s vanquished campaign agreed to join in a recount of votes in wisconsin over the course of that day trump sent out 11 tweets averaging 18 440 retweets expressing his outrage over the situation but the two most widely read and shared by wide margins were the false ones his incorrect claim that he had won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally was retweeted more than 53 000 times his unsupported allegation of serious voter fraud in three states that he lost was forwarded more than 31 000 times the virtual world far prefers the outrageous the new the controversial to the normal routine of reason and verification and so does the world of news television and print reporters rushed to examine the president elect s sensational statements thus spreading them further in the dog eat dog world of donald trump clinton had taken the first swing and he was justified in fighting back with the full force of the internet time reviewed the 298 tweets trump has sent since being elected president as of march 21 fifteen included clear falsehoods like the wiretap claims the false messages were retweeted an average of 28 550 times those that were not clearly false were retweeted on average 23 945 times the viral effect of falsehood being repeated on the news was many times more pronounced according to a search through the internet archive a nonprofit library database the false tweets were quoted on television an average of 31 times more than twice as often as other tweets for trump s allies this is a measure of strategic brilliance not defective character he understands how to make something an issue and elevate the discussion by saying things that are contrary perhaps even unproved explains roger stone a former adviser to trump who has his own penchant for spreading false conspiracy theories he has the ability to change the subject to what he wants to talk about the night before his wiretap maneuver had been a trying one for trump s young white house according to aides it was a friday and the president was frustrated that his widely praised address to congress on tuesday had been overtaken by darker news revelations of previously denied contacts between attorney general jeff sessions and a russian official had led sessions to recuse himself from any probe of russian election interference the lexisnexis database registered 509 stories or news transcripts referring to some aspect of the story aides later said trump latched on to an online article by a conservative talk show host who assembled previously published media reports into a speculative indictment of obama whether trump was persuaded by the theory or simply looking for something explosive to change the story line he knew he had found dynamite there is one page in the trump white house crisis management playbook argued obama s former white house spokesman josh earnest two days later and that is simply to tweet or say something outrageous to distract from a scandal it worked his tweet replaced the russian story at the top of the news generating 514 stories that sunday trump is by no means the first to use diversion and distortion as a political weapon during the 2016 brexit debate in great britain critics of the e u exaggerated the cost of e u membership to average britons by roughly 100 the ensuing argument over the correct amount served to focus resentment that citizens were paying anything at all democrats have been caught playing the game former senate leader harry reid floated the false claim that mitt romney did not pay taxes without any evidence and in both the 2008 and 2012 campaigns the obama campaign suggested that republican nominees john mccain and mitt romney opposed abortion even in cases of rape and incest they did not but the misdirection tilted the abortion debate toward an issue favorable to most democrats trump took this occasional tool and made it a favorite weapon the president has a history of being a negotiator explains christopher ruddy a longtime friend of trump s who continues to meet with him in florida if i look back i think he is always in a state of negotiation with everybody all the time he takes an exaggerated position to create a new middle ground he moves the goalposts to force other people to move and he is able to withstand tremendous derision over his untruthfulness a man who has cheerfully discussed intimate details of his private life on the air with howard stern a man who mugs and poses at professional wrestling bouts a man who encouraged the coverage of his own affair in the new york tabloids is not overburdened by a sense of shame this has proved to be an advantage over politicians who fear the embarrassment of being caught in a lie that fear has been documented by political scientists during the 2012 election season two researchers randomly divided 1 169 state legislators from nine states into three groups one group received letters warning that they were being monitored for falsehood by politifact and that any false statements would soil their reputations and risk defeat the second group was sent letters saying their statements were being monitored but with no explicit warning of consequences the third group wasn t contacted at all group a the ones who were warned of consequences proved to be more cautious about the truth they had their accuracy questioned at less than half the rate of the other groups politicians typically care not just how the public cares about them but about how elites care about them explained dartmouth s brendan nyhan one of the authors of the study trump doesn t care indeed even exit polls on election day found that 65 of voters including 28 of his own voters said that he isn t honest and trustworthy yet that hasn t stopped his rise the question now is this can this same strategy work for a president of the united states the credibility trump toys with is no longer just his own for generations the world has looked to american leadership in times of crises one grounded in an historic fidelity to basic facts and a sobriety of rhetoric what does it mean if the president now needs to use that credibility to rally support in a new confrontation with north korea will the world have time or patience to consider which words he has put air quotes around the conservative editorial page of the wall street journal had raised the question on the same morning trump called time with a biting condemnation of trump s falsehoods the article compared the president to a drunk clinging to an empty gin bottle of fabrication trump had read the piece and he did not approve the country s not buying it it is fake media he said of the journal the country believes me hey i went to kentucky two nights ago we had 25 000 people it is true that trump has many supporters one possibility is that this shift in behavior at the top will lead to an increased skepticism among the voters and politicians on whom trump depends reams of social science long ago established that partisans tend to unconsciously overlook falsehoods that come from their own team while being outraged by the errors of their enemies but trump s excesses are exasperating even his fellow republicans senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has stepped up his warnings about trump s tweeting telling one conservative outlet that it takes attention away from his party s accomplishments trump isn t moved mitch is a wonderful man the president told time mitch will speak for himself but other republican members of congress have become more bold in voicing their concerns there s a lot of distractions agrees senator jerry moran of kansas whose state gave trump 56 of its votes i just would say that truth is foundational it s important in public life and all of us need to do what we can to tell it the way the facts are representative carlos curbelo of florida agrees the white house and the president have to understand that there s a cost to all of this this country needs a government that it can trust ultimately democracy needs facts to allow for public debate and provide a check on abuses of power truth has a despotic character philosopher hannah arendt wrote in a 1968 essay on the subject it is therefore hated by tyrants who rightly fear the competition of a coercive force they cannot monopolize although trump is a tyrant only in the minds of his most fevered critics he often talks like one any negative polls are fake news he tweeted in his third week on the job the gallup daily tracking poll of trump s approval fell below 40 after the release of his obamacare replacement bill with time trump may find he has committed himself to a strategy that will deteriorate with reuse because with each passing month the american people will be gathering their own data on his habits and tactics and what they yield they will decide whether it s true as trump has promised that health care costs are lower and everyone has wonderful insurance they will fact check his pledge of millions of new manufacturing jobs they will see whether their incomes rise and their taxes fall whether mexico pays for a giant wall in the end presidents aren t allowed to get away with excuses explains bill galston a presidential scholar who worked in the clinton white house they pay a price for the promises they make this is a truth that no one yet has been able to tweet away before he got off the phone i tried one more time to get trump to answer a question about the risk to his reputation caused by false and ever changing utterances once again he would not accept the premise hey look he said i can t be doing so badly because i m president and you re not as a factual matter the last part of this statement is indisputably true and with that he graciously said goodbye and went back to running the affairs of the most powerful country in the world with reporting by sam frizell zeke j miller pratheek rebala and chris wilson washington this appears in the april
