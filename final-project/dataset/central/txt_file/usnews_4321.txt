washington president donald trump s effort to keephis personal and corporate financial records away from congressional and law enforcement investigators comes before the supreme court tuesday amid indications some justices may bereluctant to weigh in the dramatic oral arguments to be conducted by telephone amid the coronavirus pandemic and broadcast live could result in historic rulings on a president s immunity from investigation while in office andcongress oversight powers right in the middle of the 2020 presidential campaign or not perhaps with an eye onthe potential political repercussions the court last month asked both sides fighting over congressional subpoenas to address whether the battle may be a political question beyond the reach of federal courts if the justices so decide they could avoid putting a thumb on the scale favoring the president or congress listen live supreme court hears argument in disputes about access to trump s financial records it s an uncomfortable position for the court says peter shane who teaches constitutional law at ohio state university moritz college of law there s nothing in it for the court to antagonizeone of them if they don t have to among the justices who might find that attractive are chief justice john roberts who seeks to keep the court out of politics when possible and trump s two high court nominees associate justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh who otherwise face the choice of protecting or opposingthe president who nominated them roberts wrote the court s 5 4 decision last summer that saiddisputes over partisan gerrymandering by state legislatures were political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts in a novel political fight like this the court might well look for ways both to extricate itself and to keep future fights like this out of the court system says lawrence joseph an attorney who suggested that approach to the court on behalf of the conservative eagle forum education legal defense fund but both sides in the current dispute urged the justices friday to weigh in on the merits rather thaninvoke the political question doctrine judicial abstention here would not fence off the court from a political tug of war trump s lawyer william consovoy wrote it would be writing every congressional committee a blank check to subpoena any personal records it wants from any president any time it wishes simply by seeking those records from a custodian with no incentive to draw the ire of congress that is constitutionally intolerable it is in the committees interest for this court to reach the merits now rather than to let doubts as to the subpoenas validity linger house general counsel douglas letter agreed it is also in the interest of the executive branch for this court to reach the merits here the courts should be available to provide the executive branch safeguards should it ever need them it s notclear whether punting the battle with congress back to the executive and legislative branches would help or hurt trump in the end house democrats are seeking banking and accounting records held by mazars usa deutsche bank and capital one in a stalemate between the white house and congress they could refuse to release them or hand them over thelegal battles pit trump against three house committees controlled by democrats that have issued subpoenas foreight years of financial documents a separate fight involves manhattan district attorney cyrus vance s subpoena for similar documents as well as the tax returns that trump unlike recent predecessors has not released voluntarily lawmakers claimthe records will help determine the need for future legislation in areas such as campaign finance law bank loan practices and efforts to prevent foreign influence in elections trump s lawyers say it s a fishing expedition to see if the president is guilty of tax fraud or money laundering all three branches of government have much at stake the political earthquakethat some justices may be seeking to sidestepwould be most acutely felt if the president loses and the documents aremade public during his reelection campaign for nearly five years since declaring his candidacy in 2015 trump has managed to keep his tax returns and much of his financial data from prying eyes publicly releasing information about individuals is a form of punishment trump s lawyers arguein court papers yet that has been the goal here from the start congress has much at stake as well its oversight authority could be constrained by a ruling in trump s favor setting a precedent for future investigations particularly those viewed as partisan in more than 20cases concerning the scope of congress s power to investigate this court has only once held that a congressional inquiry exceeded its constitutional limits house lawyers contend in defending the subpoenas there also are high stakes facing the high court if it sides with trump along ideological lines withfive justices named by republican presidents in the majority and four named by democrats in dissent itcould emerge as damaged goods in the eyes of the public if the presidentwins and it s 5 4 there will be people claiming that the president s appointees have come to his defense says saikrishna prakash a university of virginia law professor whose recent book the living presidency warns of its ever expanding powers the congressional subpoenas emanate from three house committees rather than one or both houses of congress a potential shortcoming trump s lawyers have sought to impress upon the supreme court the house committee on oversight and reform issued a subpoena to mazars usa trump s accounting firm more than a year ago seeking financial records from the president his family business a trustand the company that runstrump international hotel in washington d c thus far two federal courts have upheld the subpoena trump s former personal lawyer michael cohen testified before congress that as a private citizen trump routinely overstated or understatedhis holdings for financial gain the panel wants to compare eight years of financial documents to cohen s testimony and government disclosures the house financial services committee and the house intelligence committee issued subpoenas todeutsche bank and capital onemore than a year ago seeking records from trump his three oldest children and the trump organization the panels are probing risky lending practices by major financial institutions and efforts by russia to influenceu s elections they have been upheld twice in lower courts letter said the records are needed to help determine whether senior government officials including the president are acting in the country s best interest and not in their own financial interest but consovoy warnedthe justices that given the obvious temptation to investigate the personal affairs of political rivals subpoenas concerning the private lives of presidents will become routine in times of divided government the manhattan da s subpoenas came later as part of a criminal probe of hush money payments that cohen said were made to adult film star stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal who claimed they had affairs with trump that he has denied once again two lower courts upheld the subpoenas trump s lawyers have argued that the president has absolute immunity while in office from grand jury investigations of criminal conduct during oral arguments before the u s court of appeals for the 2nd circuit they contended trump could shoot someone on fifth avenue and escape prosecution until he leaves office local officials cannot exercise their power to hinder the chief executive in the performance of the duties that he owes to the undivided nation they argue in court papers the risk that politics will lead state and local prosecutors to relentlessly harass the president is simply too great to tolerate the legal battles are nothing new for trump as a new york based real estate developer and reality tv star hemade it a practice to bring his personal and professional beefs to court since winning the white house he has done the same thing on political and policy matters a usa today analysis in 2016 of legal filings across the united states found that trump and his businesses hadbeen involved in at least4 000legal actionsin federal and state courts overthreedecades ranging frommillion dollar real estate battlesto personal defamation lawsuits since his election trump has had better luck at the supreme court than the lower courts that have blocked many of his policies particularly on immigration the administration has asked the justices for emergency stays of lower court actions26times in three plusyears compared to eight timesin the previous 16 years according to university of texas school of law professor stephen vladeck the court has complied in 15 of those cases at least in part but in previoushigh profilebattles over documents or testimony the supreme courtruled unanimously against presidents richard nixon in 1974 and bill clinton in 1997 with their nominees in agreement the decisionsled eventually to nixon s resignationandclinton s impeachment that history raises the pressure on today s high court which roberts has said should seek unanimity wherever possible at a time we are so politicized and trump is such a polarizing president i hope that the court doesn t come down 5 4 along partisan lines says erwin chemerinsky dean of the university of california berkeley school of law i do think the court s credibility is on the line
