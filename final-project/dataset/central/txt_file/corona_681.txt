 the covid 19 pandemic also known as the coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 1 the outbreak was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 4 6 the world health organization declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern on 30 january and a pandemic on 11 march 7 8 as of 26 may 2020 more than 5 49million cases of covid 19 have been reported in more than 188 countries and territories resulting in more than 346 000 deaths more than 2 23million people have recovered from the virus 5 common symptoms include fever cough fatigue shortness of breath and loss of sense of smell 9 13 14 complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome 15 the time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days 16 17 there is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment 9 primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy 18 recommended preventive measures include hand washing covering one s mouth when coughing maintaining distance from other people wearing a face mask in public settings and monitoring and self isolation for people who suspect they are infected 9 19 authorities worldwide have responded by implementing travel restrictions lockdowns workplace hazard controls and facility closures many places have also worked to increase testing capacity and trace contacts of infected persons the pandemic has caused global social and economic disruption 20 including the largest global recession since the great depression 21 it has led to the postponement or cancellation of sporting religious political and cultural events 22 widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic buying 23 24 and decreased emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases 25 26 schools universities and colleges have been closed either on a nationwide or local basis in 177 countries affecting approximately 98 6 percent of the world s student population 27 misinformation about the virus has spread widely 28 and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against chinese people and against those perceived as being chinese or as being from areas with high infection rates there have also been reports of surging xenophobia within china itself directed at non chinese over the belief that foreigners were bringing the virus into china 29 30 31 on 31 december 2019 health authorities in china reported to the world health organization who a cluster of viral pneumonia cases of unknown cause in wuhan hubei 322 323 and an investigation was launched in early january 2020 324 on 30 january the who declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern pheic 7 818 cases confirmed globally affecting 19 countries in five who regions 325 326 several of the early cases had visited huanan seafood wholesale market 327 and so the virus is thought to have a zoonotic origin 328 the virus that caused the outbreak is known as sars cov 2 a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses 329 pangolin coronaviruses 330 331 and sars cov 332 the scientific consensus is that covid 19 has a natural origin 333 334 the probable bat to human infection may have been among people processing bat carcasses and guano in the production of traditional chinese medicines 335 the earliest known person with symptoms was later discovered to have fallen ill on 1december 2019 and that person did not have visible connections with the later wet market cluster 336 337 of the early cluster of cases reported that month two thirds were found to have a link with the market 338 339 340 on 13 march 2020 an unverified report from the south china morning post suggested a case traced back to 17 november 2019 a 55 year old from hubei may have been the first person infected 341 342 the who recognized the spread of covid 19 as a pandemic on 11 march 2020 343 italy iran south korea and japan reported surging cases the total numbers outside china quickly passed china s 344 cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for covid 19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols 345 as of 24 may countries that publicised their testing data have typically performed many tests equal to 2 6 percent of their population while no country has tested samples equal to more than 17 3 percent of its population 346 many countries early on had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms 347 348 an analysis of the early phase of the outbreak up to 23 january estimated 86 percent of covid 19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source for 79 percent of documented cases 349 several other studies using a variety of methods have estimated that numbers of infections in many countries are likely to be considerably greater than the reported cases 350 351 on 9 april 2020 preliminary results found that 15 percent of people tested in gangelt the centre of a major infection cluster in germany tested positive for antibodies 352 screening for covid 19 in pregnant women in new york city and blood donors in the netherlands has also found rates of positive antibody tests that may indicate more infections than reported 353 354 however such antibody surveys can be unreliable due to a selection bias in who volunteers to take the tests and due to false positives some results such as the gangelt study have received substantial press coverage without first passing through peer review 355 analysis by age in china indicates that a relatively low proportion of cases occur in individuals under 20 356 it is not clear whether this is because young people are less likely to be infected or less likely to develop serious symptoms and seek medical attention and be tested 357 a retrospective cohort study in china found that children were as likely to be infected as adults 358 countries that test more relative to the number of deaths have a younger age distribution of cases relative to the wider population 359 initial estimates of the basic reproduction number r0 for covid 19 in january were between 1 4 and 2 5 360 but a subsequent analysis has concluded that it may be about 5 7 with a 95 percent confidence interval of 3 8 to 8 9 361 r0 can vary across populations and is not to be confused with the effective reproduction number commonly just called r which takes into account effects such as social distancing and herd immunity as of mid may 2020 the effective r is close to or below 1 0 in many countries meaning the spread of the disease in these areas is stable or decreasing 362 total confirmed cases of covid 19

ranges from6 to 41 days typically about 14 days 368 as of 26 may 2020 approximately 346 000 5 deaths had been attributed to covid 19 in china as of 5 february update about 80 percent of deaths were recorded in those aged over 60 and 75 percent had pre existing health conditions including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes 369 the first confirmed death was in wuhan on 9 january 2020 370 the first death outside of china occurred on 1february in the philippines 371 and the first death outside asia was in france on 14 february 372 official deaths from covid 19 generally refer to people who died after testing positive according to protocols this may ignore deaths of people who die without testing e g at home or in nursing homes 373 conversely deaths of people who had underlying conditions may lead to overcounting 374 comparison of statistics for deaths for all causes versus the seasonal average indicates excess mortality in many countries 375 376 in the worst affected areas mortality has been several times higher than average in new york city deaths have been four times higher than average in paris twice as high and in many european countries deaths have been on average 20 to 30 percent higher than normal 375 this excess mortality may include deaths due to strained healthcare systems and bans on elective surgery 377 several measures are used to quantify mortality 378 these numbers vary by region and over time influenced by testing volume healthcare system quality treatment options effectiveness and rapidity of government response 379 380 381 time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age sex and overall health 382 some countries like belgium include deaths from suspected cases of covid 19 regardless of whether the person was tested resulting in higher numbers compared to countries that include only test confirmed cases 383 the death to case ratio reflects the number of deaths attributed to covid 19 divided by the number of diagnosed cases within a given time interval based on johns hopkins university statistics the global death to case ratio is 6 3percent 346 232 deaths for 5 495 061 cases as of 26 may 2020 5 the number varies by region 384 other measures include the case fatality rate cfr which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease and the infection fatality rate ifr which reflects the percentage of infected diagnosed and undiagnosed who die from a disease these statistics are not timebound and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution our world in data states that as of 25 march 2020 the ifr cannot be accurately calculated as neither the total number of cases nor the total deaths is known 385 in february the institute for disease modeling estimated the ifr as 0 94 95 confidence interval 0 37 2 9 based on data from china 386 387 the university of oxford s centre for evidence based medicine cebm estimated a global cfr of 0 8 to 9 6 percent last revised 30 april and ifr of 0 10 percent to 0 41 percent last revised 2may acknowledging that this will vary between populations due to differences in demographics 388 the cdc estimates for planning purposes that the fatality rate among those who are symptomatic is 0 4 0 2 to 1 and that 35 of infected individuals are asymptomatic for an overall infection fatality rate of 0 26 as of 20 may 389 390

could be controlled 8 the peak and ultimate duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location maciej boni of penn state university said left unchecked infectious outbreaks typically plateau and then start to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts but it s almost impossible to make any sensible projection right now about when that will be 393 the imperial college study led by neil ferguson stated that physical distancing and other measures will be required until a vaccine becomes available potentially 18 months or more 394 william schaffner of vanderbilt university said because the coronavirus is so readily transmissible it might turn into a seasonal disease making a comeback every year the virulence of the comeback would depend on herd immunity and the extent of mutation 395 the usual incubation period the time between infection and symptom onset ranges from one to 14 days and is most commonly five days 9 397 some infected people have no symptoms known as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers transmission from such a carrier is considered possible 398 as at 6april estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range widely from 5 to 80 399 symptoms of covid 19 can be relatively non specific the two most common symptoms are fever 88 percent and dry cough 68 percent less common symptoms include fatigue respiratory sputum production phlegm loss of the sense of smell loss of taste shortness of breath muscle and joint pain sore throat headache chills vomiting coughing out blood diarrhea and rash 400 401 402 among those who develop symptoms approximately one in five may become more seriously ill and have difficulty breathing 9 emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing persistent chest pain or pressure sudden confusion difficulty waking and bluish face or lips immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present 14 further development of the disease can lead to complications including pneumonia acute respiratory distress syndrome sepsis septic shock and kidney failure 401 covid 19 is a new disease and many of the details of its spread are still under investigation 9 10 12 it spreads between people very efficiently and sustainably easier than influenza but not as easily as measles 10 this occurs mainly when people are in close contact two metres or six feet via small droplets produced during coughing sneezing or talking 9 12 contaminated droplets exhaled by infected people are then inhaled into the lungs or settle on other people s faces to cause new infection 10 the droplets are relatively heavy usually fall to surfaces and do not travel far through the air 9 12 people can transmit the virus without showing symptoms but according to the who and ecdc it is unknown how often this happens 9 10 12 one summary of available studies estimated the number of those infected who are asymptomatic to be 40 403 people are most infectious when they show symptoms even mild or non specific symptoms but may be infectious for up to two days before symptoms appear pre symptomatic transmission 12 they remain infectious an estimated seven to twelve days in moderate cases and an average of two weeks in severe cases 12 when the contaminated droplets fall to floors or surfaces they can though less commonly remain infectious if people touch contaminated surfaces and then their eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands 9 on surfaces the amount of active virus decreases over time until it can no longer cause infection 12 and surfaces are thought not to be the main way the virus spreads 10 it is unknown what amount of virus on surfaces is required to cause infection via this method but it can be detected for up to four hours on copper up to one day on cardboard and up to three days on plastic polypropylene and stainless steel aisi 304 12 404 405 surfaces are easily decontaminated with household disinfectants which kill the virus outside the human body or on the hands 9 disinfectants or bleach are not a treatment for covid 19 and cause health problems when not used properly such as when used inside the human body 406 sputum and saliva carry large amounts of virus 9 10 12 407 although covid 19 is not a sexually transmitted infection kissing intimate contact and faecal oral routes are suspected to transmit the virus 408 409 some medical procedures are aerosol generating 410 and result in the virus being transmitted more easily than normal 9 12 estimates of the number of people infected by one person with covid 19 the r0 have varied widely the who s initial estimates of the r0 were 1 4 2 5 average 1 95 however a more recent review found the basic r0 without control measures to be higher at 3 28 and the median r0 to be 2 79 411 the virus may occur in breastmilk 412 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 sars cov 2 is a novel virus first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in wuhan 332 all features of the novel sars cov 2 virus occur in related coronaviruses in nature 413 sars cov 2 is closely related to sars cov and is thought to have a zoonotic origin 329 sars cov 2 genetically clusters with the genus betacoronavirus and is 96 percent identical at the whole genome level to other bat coronavirus samples 414 and 92 percent identical to pangolin coronavirus 415 covid 19 can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms and confirmed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr testing of infected secretions or ct imaging of the chest 416 417 the standard test for current infection with sars cov 2 uses rna testing of respiratory secretions collected using a nasopharyngeal swab though it is possible to test other samples this test uses real time rrt pcr which detects presence of viral rna fragments 418 a number of laboratories and companies have developed serological tests which detect antibodies produced by the body in response to infection 419 several have been evaluated by public health england and approved for use in the uk 420 characteristic imaging features on chest radiographs and computed tomography ct of people who are symptomatic include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities without pleural effusions 421 the italian radiological society is compiling an international online database of imaging findings for confirmed cases 422 due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus imaging without confirmation by rrt pcr is of limited specificity in identifying covid 19 421 a large study in china compared chest ct results to pcr and demonstrated that though imaging is less specific for the infection it is faster and more sensitive 417 strategies for preventing transmission of the disease include maintaining overall good personal hygiene washing hands avoiding touching the eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands and coughing or sneezing into a tissue and putting the tissue directly into a waste container those who may already have the infection have been advised to wear a surgical mask in public 423 424 physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission 425 426 health care providers taking care of someone who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions contact precautions and eye protection 427 many governments have restricted or advised against all non essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak 428 the virus has already spread within communities in large parts of the world with many not knowing where or how they were infected 429 misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection for example rinsing the nose and gargling with mouthwash are not effective 430 there is no covid 19 vaccine though many organisations are working to develop one 431 hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease the cdc recommends that people wash hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds especially after going to the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty before eating and after blowing one s nose coughing or sneezing this is because outside the human body the virus is killed by household soap which bursts its protective bubble 19 cdc further recommended using an alcohol based hand sanitiser with at least 60 percent alcohol by volume when soap and water are not readily available 423 the who advises people to avoid touching the eyes nose or mouth with unwashed hands 424 432 it is not clear if washing hands with ash if soap is not available is effective at reducing the spread of viral infections 433 surfaces may be decontaminated with a number of solutions within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface including 62 71 percent ethanol 50 100 percent isopropanol 0 1 percent sodium hypochlorite 0 5 percent hydrogen peroxide and 0 2 7 5 percent povidone iodine other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate are less effective 434 the cdc recommends that if a covid 19 case is suspected or confirmed at a facility such as an office or day care all areas such as offices bathrooms common areas shared electronic equipment like tablets touch screens keyboards remote controls and atm machines used by the ill persons should be disinfected 435 recommendations for wearing masks have been a subject of debate 436 the who has recommended healthy people wear masks only if they are at high risk such as those who are caring for a person with covid 19 437 china and the united states among other countries have encouraged the use of face masks or cloth face coverings more generally by members of the public to limit the spread of the virus by asymptomatic individuals as a precautionary principle 438 439 several national and local governments have made wearing masks mandatory 440 surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected as wearing this type of mask can limit the volume and travel distance of expiratory droplets dispersed when talking sneezing and coughing 437 social distancing also known as physical distancing includes infection control actions intended to slow the spread of disease by minimising close contact between individuals methods include quarantines travel restrictions and the closing of schools workplaces stadiums theatres or shopping centres individuals may apply social distancing methods by staying at home limiting travel avoiding crowded areas using no contact greetings and physically distancing themselves from others 424 441 442 many governments are now mandating or recommending social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak 443 444 non cooperation with distancing measures in some areas has contributed to the further spread of the pandemic 445 the maximum gathering size recommended by u s government bodies and health organisations was swiftly reduced from 250 people if there was no known covid 19 spread in a region to 50 people and later to 10 446 on 22 march 2020 germany banned public gatherings of more than two people 447 a cochrane review found that early quarantine with other public health measures are effective in limiting the pandemic but the best manner of adopting and relaxing policies are uncertain as local conditions vary 442 older adults and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes heart disease respiratory disease hypertension and compromised immune systems face increased risk of serious illness and complications and have been advised by the cdc to stay home as much as possible in areas of community outbreak 448 449 in late march 2020 the who and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term social distancing with physical distancing to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections either virtually or at a distance the use of the term social distancing had led to implications that people should engage in complete social isolation rather than encouraging them to stay in contact through alternative means 450 451 some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic these include recommendations to have sex only with someone you live with and who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus 452 453 self isolation at home has been recommended for those diagnosed with covid 19 and those who suspect they have been infected health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self isolation 454 455 many governments have mandated or recommended self quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas 456 457 the strongest self quarantine instructions have been issued to those in high risk groups those who may have been exposed to someone with covid 19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission have been advised to self quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure 9 16 458 strategies in the control of an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population when it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease efforts then move to the mitigation stage measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society a combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time 463 suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic reproduction number to less than 1 394 part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to delay and decrease the epidemic peak known as flattening the epidemic curve 459 this decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed 459 non pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene wearing face masks and self quarantine community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning 464 more drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in china once the severity of the outbreak became apparent such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans 465 other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus south korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so taiwan increased face mask production and penalised hoarding of medical supplies 466 simulations for great britain and the united states show that mitigation slowing but not stopping epidemic spread and suppression reversing epidemic growth have major challenges optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by two thirds and deaths by half but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed health systems suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population or until a vaccine becomes available as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed long term intervention to suppress the pandemic has considerable social and economic costs 394 contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission 467 the use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has prompted privacy concerns with amnesty international and more than a hundred other organisations issuing a statement calling for limits on this kind of surveillance 468 several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use and as of 7april 2020 more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy friendly solutions such as using bluetooth to log a user s proximity to other cellphones 468 users could then receive a message if they ve been in close contact with someone who has subsequently tested positive for covid 19 468 on 10 april 2020 google and apple jointly announced an initiative for privacy preserving contact tracing based on bluetooth technology and cryptography 469 470 the system is intended to allow governments to create official privacy preserving coronavirus tracking apps with the eventual goal of integration of this functionality directly into the ios and android mobile platforms 471 in europe and in the u s palantir technologies is also providing covid 19 tracking services 472 increasing capacity and adapting healthcare for the needs of covid 19 patients is described by the who as a fundamental outbreak response measure 473 the ecdc and the european regional office of the who have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary healthcare services for shifting of resources at multiple levels including focusing laboratory services towards covid 19 testing cancelling elective procedures whenever possible separating and isolating covid 19 positive patients and increasing intensive care capabilities by training personnel and increasing the number of available ventilators and beds 473 474 due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains some manufacturers are 3d printing healthcare material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts 475 476 in one example when an italian hospital urgently required a ventilator valve and the supplier was unable to deliver in the timescale required a local startup received legal threats due to alleged patent infringement after reverse engineering and printing the required hundred valves overnight 477 478 479 on 23 april 2020 nasa reported building in 37 days a ventilator which is currently undergoing further testing nasa is seeking fast track approval 480 481 antiviral medications are under investigation for covid 19 as well as medications targeting the immune response 482 none has yet been shown to be clearly effective on mortality in published randomised controlled trials 482 however remdesivir may have an effect on the time it takes to recover from the virus 483 emergency use authorisation for remdesivir was granted in the u s on 1may for people hospitalised with severe covid 19 the interim authorisation was granted considering the lack of other specific treatments and that its potential benefits appear to outweigh the potential risks 484 taking over the counter cold medications 485 drinking fluids and resting may help alleviate symptoms 423 depending on the severity oxygen therapy intravenous fluids and breathing support may be required 486 the use of steroids may worsen outcomes 487 several compounds which were previously approved for treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in treating covid 19 488 there are several theories about where the very first case the so called patient zero originated 490 the first known case may trace back to 1december 2019 in wuhan hubei china 336 over the next month the number of coronavirus cases in hubei gradually increased according to official chinese sources these were mostly linked to the huanan seafood wholesale market which also sold live animals 328 on 24 december wuhan central hospital sent a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid bal sample from an unresolved clinical case to sequencing company vision medicals on 27 and 28 december vision medicals informed the wuhan central hospital and the chinese cdc of the results of the test showing a new coronavirus 491 a pneumonia cluster of unknown cause was observed on 26 december and treated by the doctor zhang jixian in hubei provincial hospital who informed the wuhan jianghan cdc on 27 december 492 493 on 30 december a test report addressed to wuhan central hospital from company capitalbio medlab stated an erroneous positive result for sars causing a group of doctors at wuhan central hospital to alert their colleagues and relevant hospital authorities of the result that evening the wuhan municipal health commission issued a notice to various medical institutions on the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause 494 eight of these doctors including li wenliang punished on 3january 495 were later admonished by the police for spreading false rumours and another ai fen was reprimanded by her superiors for raising the alarm 496 the wuhan municipal health commission made the first public announcement of a pneumonia outbreak of unknown cause on 31 december confirming 27 cases 322 497 498 enough to trigger an investigation 324 during the early stages of the outbreak the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days 499 in early and mid january 2020 the virus spread to other chinese provinces helped by the chinese new year migration and wuhan being a transport hub and major rail interchange 414 on 20 january china reported nearly 140 new cases in one day including two people in beijing and one in shenzhen 500 later official data shows 6 174 people had already developed symptoms by then 501 and more may have been infected 502 a report in the lancet on 24 january indicated human transmission strongly recommended personal protective equipment for health workers and said testing for the virus was essential due to its pandemic potential 338 503 on 30 january the who declared the coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern 502 on 31 january 2020 italy had its first confirmed cases two tourists from china 504 as of 13 march 2020 the who considered europe the active centre of the pandemic 505 on 19 march 2020 italy overtook china as the country with the most deaths 506 by 26 march the united states had overtaken china and italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world 507 research on coronavirus genomes indicates the majority of covid 19 cases in new york came from european travellers rather than directly from china or any other asian country 508 retesting of prior samples found a person in france who had the virus on 27 december 2019 509 510 and a person in the united states who died from the disease on 6february 2020 511 as of 19may2020 update more than 5 49million cases have been reported worldwide more than 346 000 people have died and more than 2 23million have recovered 512 513 a total of 188 5 countries and territories have had at least one case of covid 19 so far due to the pandemic in europe many countries in the schengen area have restricted free movement and set up border controls 514 national reactions have included containment measures such as quarantines and curfews known as stay at home orders shelter in place orders or lockdowns 515 by 26 march 1 7billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown 516 which increased to 3 9billion people by the first week of april more than half the world s population 517 518 by late april around 300million people were under lockdown in nations of europe including but not limited to italy spain france and the united kingdom while around 200million people were under lockdown in latin america 519 nearly 300million people or about 90 percent of the population were under some form of lockdown in the united states 520 around 100million people in the philippines 519 about 59million people in south africa 521 and 1 3billion people have been under lockdown in india 522 523 on 21 may 100 000 new infections occurred worldwide the most since the start of the pandemic while overall 5million cases were surpassed 524 as of 19may2020 update cases have been reported in all asian countries except for turkmenistan 525 and north korea 526 although these countries likely also have cases 527 despite being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak the early wide scale response of some asian states particularly south korea 528 taiwan 529 and vietnam 530 has allowed them to fare comparatively well the first confirmed case of covid 19 has been traced back to 1december 2019 in wuhan 336 one unconfirmed report suggests the earliest case was on 17 november 341 doctor zhang jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause on 26 december upon which her hospital informed wuhan jianghan cdc on 27 december 531 532 initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 december 2019 indicated the presence of a sars like coronavirus 531 a public notice was released by wuhan municipal health commission on 31 december confirming 27 cases and suggesting wearing face masks 498 the who was informed on the same day 322 as these notifications occurred doctors in wuhan were warned by police for spreading rumours about the outbreak 533 the chinese national health commission initially said there was no clear evidence of human to human transmission 534 in a 14 january conference call chinese officials said privately that human to human transmission was a possibility and pandemic
