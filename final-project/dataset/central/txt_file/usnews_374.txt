in bill taylor s opening statement to lawmakers obtained by time the top u s diplomat in ukraine says that he was told that president donald trump would withhold military aid from the country until it publicly announced investigations that would benefit him politically testifying behind closed doors acting ambassador taylor told congress that he was alarmed that the trump administration would leverage security aid in exchange for investigations into vice president joe biden and his son hunter as well as the 2016 election which he called weird and crazy read the full statement here opening statement of ambassador william b taylor october 22 2019 mr chairman i appreciate the opportunity to appear today to provide my perspective on the events that are the subject of the committees inquiry my sole purpose is to provide the committees with my views about the strategic importance of ukraine to the united states as well as additional information about the incidents in question i have dedicated my life to serving u s interests at home and abroad in both military and civilian roles my background and experience are nonpartisan and i have been honored to serve under every administration republican and democratic since 1985 for 50 years i have served the country starting as a cadet at west point then as an infantry officer for six years including with the 101st airborne division in vietnam then at the department of energy then as a member of a senate staff then at nato then with the state department here and abroad in afghanistan iraq jerusalem and ukraine and more recently as executive vice president of the nonpartisan united states institute of peace while i have served in many places and in different capacities i have a particular interest in and respect for the importance of our country s relationship with ukraine our national security demands that this relationship remain strong however in august and september of this year i became increasingly concerned that our relationship with ukraine was being fundamentally undermined by an irregular informal channel of u s policy making and by the withholding of vital security assistance for domestic political reasons i hope my remarks today will help the committees understand why i believed that to be the case at the outset i would like to convey several key points first ukraine is a strategic partner of the united states important for the security of our country as well as europe second ukraine is right at this moment while we sit in this room and for the last five years under armed attack from russia third the security assistance we provide is crucial to ukraine s defense against russian aggression and more importantly sends a signal to ukrainians and russians that we are ukraine s reliable strategic partner and finally as the committees are now aware i said on september 9 in a message to ambassador gordon sondland that withholding security assistance in exchange for help with a domestic political campaign in the united states would be crazy i believed that then and i still believe that let me now provide the committees a chronology of the events that led to my concern on may 28 of this year i met with secretary mike pompeo who asked me to return to kyiv to lead our embassy in ukraine it was and is a critical time in u s ukraine relations volodymyr zelenskyy had just been elected president and ukraine remained at war with russia as the summer approached a new ukrainian government would be seated parliamentary elections were imminent and the ukrainian political trajectory would be set for the next several years i had served as ambassador to ukraine from 2006 to 2009 having been nominated by george w bush and in the intervening 10 years i have stayed engaged with ukraine visiting frequently since 2013 as a board member of a small ukrainian non governmental organization supporting good governance and reform across the responsibilities i have had in public service ukraine is special for me and secretary pompeo s offer to return as chief of mission was compelling i am convinced of the profound importance of ukraine to the security of the united states and europe for two related reasons first if ukraine succeeds in breaking free of russian influence it is possible for europe to be whole free democratic and at peace in contrast if russia dominates ukraine russia will again become an empire oppressing its people and threatening its neighbors and the rest of the world second with the annexation of the crimea in 2014 and the continued aggression in donbas russia violated countless treaties ignored all commitments and dismissed all the principles that have kept the peace and contributed to prosperity in europe since world war ii to restore ukraine s independence russia must leave ukraine this has been and should continue to be a bipartisan u s foreign policy goal when i was serving outside of government during the obama administration and after the russian invasion of ukraine in 2014 i joined two other former ambassadors to ukraine in urging obama administration officials at the state department defense department and other agencies to provide lethal defensive weapons to ukraine in order to deter further russian aggression i also supported much stronger sanctions against russia all to say i cared about ukraine s future and the important u s interests there so when secretary pompeo asked me to go back to kyiv i wanted to say yes but it was not an easy decision the former ambassador masha yovanovitch had been treated poorly caught in a web of political machinations both in kyiv and in washington i feared that those problems were still present when i talked to her about accepting the offer however she urged me to go both for policy reasons and for the morale of the embassy before answering the secretary i consulted both my wife and a respected former senior republican official who has been a mentor to me i will tell you that my wife in no uncertain terms strongly opposed the idea the mentor counseled if your country asks you to do something you do it if you can be effective i could be effective only if the u s policy of strong support for ukraine strong diplomatic support along with robust security economic and technical assistance were to continue and if i had the backing of the secretary of state to implement that policy i worried about what i had heard concerning the role of rudolph giuliani who had made several high profile statements about ukraine and u s policy toward the country so during my meeting with secretary pompeo on may 28 i made clear to him and the others present that if u s policy toward ukraine changed he would not want me posted there and i could not stay he assured me that the policy of strong support for ukraine would continue and that he would support me in defending that policy with that understanding i agreed to go back to kyiv because i was appointed by the secretary but not reconfirmed by the senate my official position was charg d affaires ad interim i returned to kyiv on june 17 carrying the original copy of a letter president trump signed the day after i met with the secretary in that letter president trump congratulated president zelenskyy on his election victory and invited him to a meeting in the oval office i also brought with me a framed copy of the secretary s declaration that the united states would never recognize the illegal russian annexation of crimea but once i arrived in kyiv i discovered a weird combination of encouraging confusing and ultimately alarming circumstances first the encouraging president zelenskyy was taking over ukraine in a hurry he had appointed reformist ministers and supported long stalled anti corruption legislation he took quick executive action including opening ukraine s high anti corruption court which was established under the previous presidential administration but never allowed to operate he called snap parliamentary elections his party was so new it had no representation in the rada and later won an overwhelming mandate controlling 60 percent of the seats with his new parliamentary majority president zelenskyy changed the ukrainian constitution to remove absolute immunity from rada deputies which had been the source of raw corruption for two decades there was much excitement in kyiv that this time things could be different a new ukraine might finally be breaking from its corrupt post soviet past and yet i found a confusing and unusual arrangement for making u s policy towards ukraine there appeared to be two channels of u s policy making and implementation one regular and one highly irregular as the chief of mission i had authority over the regular formal diplomatic processes including the bulk of the u s effort to support ukraine against the russian invasion and to help it defeat corruption this regular channel of u s policy making has consistently had strong bipartisan support both in congress and in all administrations since ukraine s independence from russia in 1991 at the same time however there was an irregular informal channel of u s policy making with respect to ukraine one which included then special envoy kurt volker ambassador sondland secretary of energy rick perry and as i subsequently learned mr giuliani i was clearly in the regular channel but i was also in the irregular one to the extent that ambassadors volker and sondland included me in certain conversations although this irregular channel was well connected in washington it operated mostly outside of official state department channels this irregular channel began when ambassador volker ambassador sondland secretary perry and senator ron johnson briefed president trump on may 23 upon their return from president zelenskyy s inauguration the delegation returned to washington enthusiastic about the new ukrainian president and urged president trump to meet with him early on to cement the u s ukraine relationship but from what i understood president trump did not share their enthusiasm for a meeting with mr zelenskyy when i first arrived in kyiv in june and july the actions of both the regular and the irregular channels of foreign policy served the same goal a strong u s ukraine partnership but it became clear to me by august that the channels had diverged in their objectives as this occurred i became increasingly concerned in late june one the goals of both channels was to facilitate a visit by president zelenskyy to the white house for a meeting with president trump which president trump had promised in his congratulatory letter of may 29 the ukrainians were clearly eager for the meeting to happen during a conference call with ambassador volker acting assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs phil reeker secretary perry ambassador sondland and counselor of the u s department of state ulrich brechbuhl on june 18 it was clear that a meeting between the two presidents was an agreed upon goal but during my subsequent communications with ambassadors volker and sondland they relayed to me that the president wanted to hear from zelenskyy before scheduling the meeting in the oval office it was not clear to me what this meant on june 27 ambassador sondland told me during a phone conversation that president zelenskyy needed to make clear to president trump that he president zelenskyy was not standing in the way of investigations i sensed something odd when ambassador sondland told me on june 28 that he did not wish to include most of the regular interagency participants in a call planned with president zelenskyy later that day ambassador sondland ambassador volker secretary perry and i were on this call dialing in from different locations however ambassador sondland said that he wanted to make sure no one was transcribing or monitoring as they added president zelenskyy to the call also before president zelenskyy joined the call ambassador volker separately told the u s participants that he ambassador volker planned to be explicit with president zelenskyy in a one on one meeting in toronto on july 2 about what president zelenskyy should do to get the white house meeting again it was not clear to me on that call what this meant but ambassador volker noted that he would relay that president trump wanted to see rule of law transparency but also specifically cooperation on investigations to get to the bottom of things once president zelenskyy joined the call the conversation was focused on energy policy and the stanytsia luhanska bridge president zelenskyy also said he looked forward to the white house visit president trump had offered in his may 29 letter i reported on this call to deputy assistant secretary of state george kent who had responsibility for ukraine and i wrote a memo for the record dated june 30 that summarized our conversation with president zelenskyy by mid july it was becoming clear to me that the meeting president zelenskyy wanted was conditioned on the investigations of burisma and alleged ukrainian interference in the 2016 u s elections it was also clear that this condition was driven by the irregular policy channel i had come to understand was guided by mr giuliani on july 10 ukrainian officials alexander danyliuk the ukrainian national security advisor and andriy yermak an assistant to president zelenskyy and secretary perry then national security advisor john bolton ambassador volker and ambassador sondland met at the white house i did not participate in the meeting and did not receive a readout of it until speaking with the national security council s nsc s then senior director for european and russian affairs fiona hill and the nsc s director of european affairs alex vindman on july 19 on july 10 in kyiv i met with president zelenskyy s chief of staff andrei bohdan and then foreign policy advisor to the president and now foreign minister vadym prystaiko who told me that they had heard from mr giuliani that the phone call between the two presidents was unlikely to happen and that they were alarmed and disappointed i relayed their concerns to counselor brechbuhl in a regular nsc secure video conference call on july 18 i heard a staff person from the office of management and budget omb say that there was a hold on security assistance to ukraine but could not say why toward the end of an otherwise normal meeting a voice on the call the person was off screen said that she was from omb and that her boss had instructed her not to approve any additional spending of security assistance for ukraine until further notice i and others sat in astonishment the ukrainians were fighting the russians and counted on not only the training and weapons but also the assurance of u s support all that the omb staff person said was that the directive had come from the president to the chief of staff to omb in an instant i realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for ukraine was threatened the irregular policy channel was running contrary to the goals of longstanding u s policy there followed a series of nsc led interagency meetings starting at the staff level and quickly reaching the level of cabinet secretaries at every meeting the unanimous conclusion was that the security assistance should be resumed the hold lifted at one point the defense department was asked to perform an analysis of the effectiveness of the assistance within a day the defense department came back with the determination that the assistance was effective and should be resumed my understanding was that the secretaries of defense and state the cia director and the national security advisor sought a joint meeting with the president to convince him to release the hold but such a meeting was hard to schedule and the hold lasted well into september the next day on the phone dr hill and mr vindman tried to reassure me that they were not aware of any official change in u s policy toward ukraine omb s announcement notwithstanding they did confirm that the hold on security assistance for ukraine came from chief of staff mick mulvaney and that the chief of staff maintained a skeptical view of ukraine in the same july 19 phone call they gave me an account of the july 10 meeting with the ukrainian officials at the white house specifically they told me that ambassador sondland had connected investigations with an oval office meeting for president zelenskyy which so irritated ambassador bolton that he abruptly ended the meeting telling dr hill and mr vindman that they should have nothing to do with domestic politics he also directed dr hill to brief the lawyers dr hill said that ambassador bolton referred to this as a drug deal after the july 10 meeting ambassador bolton opposed a call between president zelenskyy and president trump out of concern that it would be a disaster needless to say the ukrainians in the meetings were confused ambassador bolton in the regular ukraine policy decision making channel wanted to talk about security energy and reform ambassador sondland a participant in the irregular channel wanted to talk about the connection between a white house meeting and ukrainian investigations also during our july 19 call dr hill informed me that ambassador volker had met with mr giuliani to discuss ukraine this caught me by surprise the next day i asked ambassador volker about that meeting but received no response i began to sense that the two decision making channels the regular and irregular were separate and at odds later on july 19 and in the early morning of july 20 kyiv time i received text messages on a three way whatsapp text conversation with ambassadors volker and sondland a record of which l understand has already been provided to the committees by ambassador volker ambassador sondland said that a call between president trump and president zelenskyy would take place soon ambassador volker said that what was m ost impt is for zelensky to say that he will help investigation and address any specific personnel issues if there are any later on july 20 i had a phone conversation with ambassador sondland while he was on a train from paris to london ambassador sondland told me that he had recommended to president zelenskyy that he use the phrase i will leave no stone unturned with regard to investigations when president zelenskyy spoke with president trump also on july 20 i had a phone conversation with mr danyliuk during which he conveyed to me that president zelenskyy did not want to be used as a pawn in a u s re election campaign the next day i texted both ambassadors volker and sondland about president zelenskyy s concern on july 25 president trump and president zelenskyy had the long awaited phone conversation strangely even though i was chief of mission and was scheduled to meet with president zelenskyy along with ambassador volker the following day i received no readout of the call from the white house the ukrainian government issued a short cryptic summary during a previously planned july 26 meeting president zelenskyy told ambassador volker and me that he was happy with the call but did not elaborate president zelenskyy then asked about the face to face meeting in the oval office as promised in the may 29 letter from president trump after our meeting with president zelenskyy ambassador volker and i traveled to the front line in northern donbas to receive a briefing from the commander of the forces on the line of contact arriving for the briefing in the military headquarters the commander thanked us for security assistance but i was aware that this assistance was on hold which made me uncomfortable ambassador volker and i could see the armed and hostile russian led forces on the other side of the damaged bridge across the line of contact over 13 000 ukrainians had been killed in the war one or two a week more ukrainians would undoubtedly die without the u s assistance although i spent the morning of july 26 with president zelenskyy and other ukrainian officials the first summary of the trump zelenskyy call that i heard from anybody inside the u s government was during a phone call i had with tim morrison dr hill s recent replacement at the nsc on july 28 mr morrison told me that the call could have been better and that president trump had suggested that president zelenskyy or his staff meet with mr giuliani and attorney general william barr i did not see any official readout of the call until it was publicly released on september 25 on august 16 i exchanged text messages with ambassador volker in which i learned that mr yermak had asked that the united states submit an official request for an investigation into burisma s alleged violations of ukrainian law if that is what the united states desired a formal u s request to the ukrainians to conduct an investigation based on violations of their own law struck me as improper and i recommended to ambassador volker that we stay clear to find out the legal aspects of the question however i gave him the name of a deputy assistant attorney general whom i thought would be the proper point of contact for seeking a u s referral for a foreign investigation by mid august because the security assistance had been held for over a month for no reason that i could discern i was beginning to fear that the longstanding u s policy of strong support for ukraine was shifting i called counselor brechbuhl to discuss this on august 21 he said that he was not aware of a change of u s policy but would check on the status of the security assistance my concerns deepened the next day on august 22 during a phone conversation with mr morrison i asked him if there had been a change in policy of strong support for ukraine to which he responded it remains to be seen he also told me during this call that the president doesn t want to provide any assistance at all that was extremely troubling to me as i had told secretary pompeo in may if the policy of strong support for ukraine were to change i would have to resign based on my call with mr morrison i was preparing to do so just days later on august 27 ambassador bolton arrived in kyiv and met with president zelenskyy during their meeting security assistance was not discussed amazingly news of the hold did not leak out until august 29 i on the other hand was all too aware of and still troubled by the hold near the end of ambassador bolton s visit i asked to meet him privately during which i expressed to him my serious concern about the withholding of military assistance to ukraine while the ukrainians were defending their country from russian aggression ambassador bolton recommended that i send a first person cable to secretary pompeo directly relaying my concerns i wrote and transmitted such a cable on august 29 describing the folly i saw in withholding military aid to ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the east and when russia was watching closely to gauge the level of american support for the ukrainian government i told the secretary that i could not and would not defend such a policy although i received no specific response i heard that soon thereafter the secretary carried the cable with him to a meeting at the white house focused on security assistance for ukraine the same day that i sent my cable to the secretary august 29 mr yermak contacted me and was very concerned asking about the withheld security assistance the hold that the white house had placed on the assistance had just been made public that day in a politico story at that point i was embarrassed that i could give him no explanation for why it was withheld it had still not occurred to me that the hold on security assistance could be related to the investigations that however would soon change on september 1 just three days after my cable to secretary pompeo president zelenskyy met vice president pence at a bilateral meeting in warsaw president trump had planned to travel to warsaw but at the last minute had cancelled because of hurricane dorian just hours before the pence zelenskyy meeting i contacted mr danyliuk to let him know that the delay of u s security assistance was an all or nothing proposition in the sense that if the white house did not lift the hold prior to the end of the fiscal year september 30 the funds would expire and ukraine would receive nothing i was hopeful that at the bilateral meeting or shortly thereafter the white house would lift the hold but this was not to be indeed i received a readout of the pence zelenskyy meeting over the phone from mr morrison during which he told me president zelenskyy had opened the meeting by asking the vice president about security cooperation the vice president did not respond substantively but said that he would talk to president trump that night the vice president did say that president trump wanted the europeans to do more to support ukraine and that he wanted the ukrainians to do more to fight corruption during this same phone call i had with mr morrison he went on to describe a conversation ambassador sondland had with mr yermak at warsaw ambassador sondland told mr yermak that the security assistance money would not come until president zelenskyy committed to pursue the burisma investigation i was alarmed by what mr morrison told me about the sondland yermak conversation this was the first time i had heard that the security assistance not just the white house meeting was conditioned on the investigations very concerned on that same day i sent ambassador sondland a text message asking if we are now saying that security assistance and a wh meeting are conditioned on investigations ambassador sondland responded asking me to call him which i did during that phone call ambassador sondland told me that president trump had told him that he wants president zelenskyy to state publicly that ukraine will investigate burisma and alleged ukrainian interference in the 2016 u s election ambassador sondland also told me that he now recognized that he had made a mistake by earlier telling the ukrainian officials to whom he spoke that a white house meeting with president zelenskyy was dependent on a public announcement of investigations in fact ambassador sondland said everything was dependent on such an announcement including security assistance he said that president trump wanted president zelenskyy in a public box by making a public statement about ordering such investigations in the same september 1 call i told ambassador sondland that president trump should have more respect for another head of state and that what he described was not in the interest of either president trump or president zelenskyy at that point i asked ambassador sondland to push back on president trump s demand ambassador sondland pledged to try we also discussed the possibility that the ukrainian prosecutor general rather than president zelenskyy would make a statement about investigations potentially in coordination with attorney general barr s probe into the investigation of interference in the 2016 elections the next day september 2 mr morrison called to inform me that mr danyliuk had asked him to come to his hotel room in warsaw where mr danyliuk expressed concern about the possible loss of u s support for ukraine in particular mr morrison relayed to me that the inability of any u s officials to respond to the ukrainians explicit questions about security assistance was troubling them i was experiencing the same tension in my dealings with the ukrainians including during a meeting i had had with ukrainian defense minister andriy zagordnyuk that day during my call with mr morrison on september 2 i also briefed mr morrison on what ambassador sondland had told me during our call the day prior on september 5 i hosted senators johnson and murphy for a visit to kyiv during their visit we met with president zelenskyy his first question to the senators was about the withheld security assistance my recollection of the meeting is that both senators stressed that bipartisan support for ukraine in washington was ukraine s most important strategic asset and that president zelenskyy should not jeopardize that bipartisan support by getting drawn into u s domestic politics i had been making and continue to make this point to all of my ukrainian official contacts but the push to make president zelenskyy publicly commit to investigations of burisma and alleged interference in the 2016 election showed how the official foreign policy of the united states was undercut by the irregular efforts led by mr giuliani two days later on september 7 i had a conversation with mr morrison in which he described a phone conversation earlier that day between ambassador sondland and president trump mr morrison said that he had a sinking feeling after learning about this conversation from ambassador sondland according to mr morrison president trump told ambassador sondland that he was not asking for a quid pro quo but president trump did insist that president zelenskyy go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of biden and 2016 election interference and that president zelenskyy should want to do this himself mr morrison said that he told ambassador bolton and the nsc lawyers of this phone call between president trump and ambassador sondland the following day on september 8 ambassador sondland and i spoke on the phone he said he had talked to president trump as i had suggested a week earlier but that president trump was adamant that president zelenskyy himself had to clear things up and do it in public president trump said it was not a quid pro quo ambassador sondland said that he had talked to president zelenskyy and mr yermak and told them that although this was not a quid pro quo if president zelenskyy did not clear things up in public we would be at a stalemate i understood a stalemate to mean that ukraine would not receive the much needed military assistance ambassador sondland said that this conversation concluded with president zelenskyy agreeing to make a public statement in an interview with cnn after the call with ambassador sondland on september 8 i expressed my strong reservations in a text message to ambassador sondland stating that my nightmare is they the ukrainians give the interview and don t get the security assistance the russians love it and i quit i was serious the next day i said to ambassadors sondland and volker that t he message to the ukrainians and russians we send with the decision on security assistance is key with the hold we have already shaken their faith in us i also said i think it s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign ambassador sondland responded about five hours later that i was incorrect about president trump s intentions the president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo s of any kind before these text messages during our call on september 8 ambassador sondland tried to explain to me that president trump is a businessman when a businessman is about to sign a check to someone who owes him something he said the businessman asks that person to pay up before signing the check ambassador volker used the same terms several days later while we were together at the yalta european strategy conference i argued to both that the explanation made no sense the ukrainians did not owe president trump anything and holding up security assistance for domestic political gain was crazy as i had said in my text message to ambassadors sondland and volker on september 9 finally i learned on september 11 that the hold had been lifted and that the security assistance would be provided after i learned that the security assistance was released on september 11 i personally conveyed the news to president zelenskyy and foreign minister prystaiko and i again reminded mr yermak of the high strategic value of bipartisan support for ukraine and the importance of not getting involved in other countries elections my fear at the time was that since ambassador sondland had told me president zelenskyy already agreed to do a cnn interview president zelenskyy would make a statement regarding investigations that would have played into domestic u s politics i sought to confirm through mr danyliuk that president zelenskyy was not planning to give such an interview to the media while mr danyliuk initially confirmed that on september 12 i noticed during a meeting on the morning of september 13 at president zelenskyy s office that mr yermak looked uncomfortable in response to the question again i asked mr danyliuk to confirm that there would be no cnn interview which he did on september 25 at the un general assembly session in new york city president trump met president zelenskyy face to face he also released the transcript of the july 25 call the united states gave the ukrainians virtually no notice of the release and they were livid although this was the first time i had seen the details of president trump s july 25 call with president zelenskyy in which he mentioned vice president biden i had come to understand well before then that investigations was a term that ambassadors volker and sondland used to mean matters related to the 2016 elections and to investigations of burisma and the bidens i recognize that this is a rather lengthy recitation of the events of the past few months told from my vantage point in kyiv but i also recognize the importance of the matters your committees are investigating and i hope that this chronology will provide some framework for your questions i wish to conclude by returning to the points i made at the outset ukraine is important to the security of the united states it has been attacked by russia which continues its aggression against ukraine if we believe in the principle of sovereignty of nations on which our security and the security of our friends and allies depends we must support ukraine in its fight against its bullying neighbor russian aggression cannot stand there are two ukraine stories today the first is the one we are discussing this morning and that you have been hearing for the past two weeks it is a rancorous story about whistleblowers mr giuliani side channels quid pro quos corruption and interference in elections in this story ukraine is an object but there is another ukraine story a positive bipartisan one in this second story ukraine is the subject this one is about young people in a young nation struggling to break free of its past hopeful that their new government will finally usher in a new ukraine proud of its independence from russia eager to join western institutions and enjoy a more secure and prosperous life this story describes a nation developing an inclusive democratic nationalism not unlike what we in america in our best moments feel about our diverse country less concerned about what language we speak what religion if any we practice where our parents and grandparents came from more concerned about building a new country because of the strategic importance of ukraine in our effort to create a whole free europe we through republican and democratic administrations over three decades have supported ukraine congress has been generous over the years with assistance funding both civilian and military and political support with overwhelming bipartisan majorities congress has supported ukraine with harsh sanctions on russia for invading and occupying ukraine we can be proud of that support and that we have stood up to a dictator s aggression against a democratic neighbor it is this second story that i would like to leave you with today and i am glad to answer your questions contact us
