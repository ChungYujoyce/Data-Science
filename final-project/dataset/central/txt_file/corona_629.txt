 anxiety in the business of live entertainment is at record levels during the current stage of the agonizing global covid 19 pandemic work far into the future is evaporating the summer show and concert season is looking like toast seemingly stable institutions are experiencing life threatening crises fights between unions and management over diminishing compensation are brewing and some powerful politicians are proving to be less than sympathetic to the existential dilemma faced by an industry that is having to fight the timeless unfair and resurgent perception that it is frivolous unimportant and dispensable in a health crisis yet worse some hard data although limited and time bound is emerging that audiences especially those of mature age will be reluctant to gather in the old ways any time soon perhaps not until there is a vaccine and that would mean not just the vaccine s development but its widespread availability in a politically dysfunctional country that already has struggled mightily with the logistics of crucial medical supplies optimists are hoping for a vaccine as soon as september and also think that widespread antibody testing could be the key to making an audience feel safe to venture out again assuming a large portion of the population is carrying such antibodies which is very far from a certainty pessimists think that a vaccine at least 18 months away extreme pessimists think a vaccine might never arrive in a fully satisfactory fashion but as they fret in their zoom meetings the leaders of the sector are in essence confronting two connected but related dilemmas the first question is shared with the rest of the economy when will it be safe and ethical to re open the second is potentially far more vexing and complex what systemic changes will be seen when that moment finally comes to pass the first question is not only unanswerable at present but almost entirely dependent on the actions of government officials not the arts leaders themselves broadway will not open without the full consent of new york gov andrew cuomo any more than lollapalooza will go ahead in any form without the ok from chicago mayor lori lightfoot when cuomo was asked by reporters on april 7 about broadway s optimistic june reopening hopes he reacted with apparent indignation i wouldn t use what broadway thinks as a barometer of anything even if that s accurate producers are not epidemiologists that was not the tone the industry wanted to hear lightfoot has kept more of an open mind on chicago s massive rock festival at least in public but if you look at those dilemmas from a political point of view the reputational and moral downside from any premature green light is obviously substantial notwithstanding the ongoing economic devastation the twin demons of a terrible virus and economic ruin and the relative pain each delivers and to whom are emerging as an unfortunate political binary at a time when some semblance of unity would be preferable but that is not the american reality at present in the non profit arts sector where humanistic compassion progressive values and hopes for longterm government rescue are yet more ingrained into the ecosystem opening too soon is also politically and morally fraught nobody wants to be accused of putting performers or audiences at risk on the other hand laying off staff in the absence of revenue is also unpopular art institutions are between the proverbial rock and a hard place government support is hoped for and there have been admirable local efforts trickling in but federal help has been slow in coming it is also worth noting that the corporate parent of the small steakhouse chain ruth s chris has already received 20 million in potentially forgivable loans that s more than 25 percent of the 75 million earmarked for the entire arts sector although some organizations may also be eligible for other federal programs whether in new york or las vegas or chicago opinions on how long this goes run the gamut optimists see the crisis made worse for many by personal experiences and fears in their own families as a three or four month span of moribund activity noting that even the notorious wet market in wuhan china now has reopened for better or worse less than four months after the authorities in china first acknowledged the existence of a new virus pessimists see no live shows reopening until there is a vaccine arguing that say the audience at the lyric opera of chicago will never return en masse until then most people land somewhere between but there also is a growing realization that the binary nature of open versus closed is not the right way to think it s not going to be a light switch said dr anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert last sunday so what does that mean for live entertainment it may mean social distancing banning mosh pits for example or asking venues to only seat every other row or put empty spaces between couples that is a logistical nightmare for live entertainment where the economic model requires full houses as does much of the artistic excitement of a night at say the riviera concert hall this problem is not unique to this sector but is shared by restaurants and airlines if you don t want to see a play at the goodman theatre you certainly don t want to sit for four hours to fly in coach to los angeles on a discretionary vacation but most restaurants could remove tables and require masks for staffers and maybe still operate at a profit you can t perform hamilton in a face mask moreover hamilton as it is currently organized would not work at 50 percent capacity not without huge union concessions so the big question is whether a juggernaut like that can come back under new rules or would simply wait it out that poses another terrible question how long can some of our cultural mainstays stay dark without risking never coming back at all in a fundraising email this week one canceled summer theater told its supporters that it needed to raise close to 2 million and fast in order to be able to come back in 2021 the tone was dire fauci drawing from experiences in some asian countries has also mentioned the possibility of rolling quarantines of starting up activity but being ready to stop if infection rates increase in such a way as to threaten medical care what would that mean it certainly would favor flexible simple scheduling announcing one attraction at a time not a whole slate of them thus finally putting a bullet in the old subscription model it would favor simple shows an acoustic concert a chamber opera a small cast improvisation portability will be a desirable quality so will being outside this is precisely the kind of art that thrived in the european dark ages when plague was rampant but in 2020 economic structures are built around fixed runs artists on tour and complex scheduling there is no existing model for such flexibility maybe one will need to be created long planning periods may not work for months if not years charcoalblue an innovative and future thinking british design firm of arts venues has been addressing this problem with its clients in a recent report sharing its opinion that all new arts buildings will need better ventilation bigger lobby space and no crushes at the bar at intermission it has opined that dressing rooms might need to be individualized designed to be easy to clean and regularly sanitized which could be costly it thinks that more understudies will be needed should performers get sick it suggests the glory days for interactive entertainment of rappers crowd surfing and audience members hugging actors are behind us it worries about the increasing social stigma of coughing at concerts and the potential anger and disruption that could evolve it thinks venues might need more devoted first aid rooms maybe even isolation rooms for those who become unwell during a show there is a lot to worry about but then again as tony kushner famously observed the world only spins forward chris jones is a tribune critic cjones5 chicagotribune com
