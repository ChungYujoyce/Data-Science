small donors raising millions with contributions of less than 200 but there s no guarantee this pattern will continue for future republicans loading september 19 2016 republican candidate donald trump who did little to establish a fundraising army for his presidential primary campaign has raked in an unprecedented amount of donations for a republican candidate in the last three months leading some to liken his efforts and success to that of sen bernie sanders i of vermont mr trump has already raised nearly 100 million from donors writing checks for less than 200 an impressive feat considering he only started soliciting donations in may and had just 1 3 million on hand in june politico reported as the numbers roll in many republicans are surprised by the real estate mogul s fundraising success among small donors noting that democrats typically rake in a high number of small to moderate donations while republicans rely on fewer donors but larger sums of money in 2008 and 2012 republican candidates john mccain and mitt romney pulled in less than 64 million from small donors the wall street journal reported i ve never seen anything like this a senior republican operative working with the campaign s small dollar fundraising operation told politico he s the republican obama in terms of online fundraising or the senator sanders who built his primary campaign with average donations of just 27 and famously said he did not have or want a super political action committee pac by soliciting small contributions sanders s campaign was able to raise 229 million through june while former secretary of state hillary clinton brought in 238 million before the help of super pacs sanders s ability to attract small donors has truly been remarkable anthony corrado a professor at colby college who studies campaign finance and presidential elections told the atlantic during sanders s campaign small dollar donations have become the bedrock of his campaign and he has been able to motivate more donors more quickly to raise more money from small amounts than was the case for barack obama or howard dean despite trump s latest success among small donors some say it s not enough and that such success comes from different tactics than those used by democrats i would just put it in the perspective of they re still not doing as well as they should be doing and they re doing too little too late kenneth pennington the former digital director for sanders s campaign told politico once they start copying some of things democrats are doing then i ll get worried instead trump is using his name to capitalize on donations and has offered the chance to have dinner or other meetings with the candidate and his family in return for donations an email campaign offers autographed copies of trump s book the art of the deal for 184 sanders s campaign on the other hand used lengthy appeals over email sometimes between 1 000 to 2 000 words to garner donations we find that people develop a deeper investment and appreciation for the campaign when they re being counted as part of something bigger than themselves robin curran sanders s former digital production director told the atlantic in march get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox while trump s fundraising success might mirror that of sanders it s worth noting that money wasn t enough to win the primary for the vermont senator when he ran against mrs clinton and there s no guarantee trump s donation bounty will help him fair any better against the democrat some also question whether trump s success will usher in a new era of small donations for future republican candidates a lot of them probably don t realize that 20 percent of the money goes to the rnc otherwise they probably wouldn t give an operative working with the candidate and the rnc which has started a joint fundraising venture with trump told politico people are giving money to the joint fundraising committee because
