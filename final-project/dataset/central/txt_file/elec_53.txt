over the past decade republicans have made historic gains on the state level heading into the election they control two thirds of the governors mansions but this year the gop is playing defense in the two years since president trump s election democrats have found their energy party turnout during the primaries was high and looking forward to the general election democrats could pick up more than a dozen gubernatorial seats and have the chance to become the majority and there is more than state policy on the line with the 2020 census new congressional districts will be drawn and in most states whichever party is in control can decide where the lines go also some democrats could make history as firsts in georgia the state could elect stacey abrams who would be the country s first female african american governor democratic candidate andrew gillum could be florida s first african american governor and in colorado jared polis could be the first openly gay governor elected in the

suppress the votes of people of color the republican who oversees the state s elections calls it a manufactured crisis meant to energize democrats late in the race former president jimmy carter urged

record to woo voters the race has become the most expensive in oregon history with candidates raising upwards of 12 million apiece most notable the 2 5 million buehler received from nike co founder
