 by lori robertson posted on april 12 2015 hillary clinton has made it official she will run for president in the 2016 race here s a look back at some of the claims from clinton that we ve fact checked over the years there s plenty more in our file on clinton which is like a trip down memory lane but it has been a while since she last campaigned for office 2008 so much of our material is dated or no longer pertinent for instance clinton said that her health care plan was the only one that would achieve universal coverage when experts said it would come close but wouldn t cover everyone and during her last run she repeatedly made the misleading claim that a 2005 energy bill included enormous giveaways to the oil and gas industries it actually increased taxes on net on oil and gas companies we expect to find more timely claims as we continue to monitor clinton andall potential 2016 presidential candidates lori robertson q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
