debate proponents of liability protections say the economy s recovery will be stunted if businesses are afraid to open over the fear of being sued there are also fears that businesses that have managed to survive the long lockdown period might ultimately be brought down by expensive lawsuits current laws shield business owners who conform with labor laws and make a reasonable effort to protect the health of their employees and customers but the constantly changing guidance and patchwork of policies in different parts of the country may be too much to expect businesses to keep straight some argue if you re trying to do the right thing then you shouldn t be kind of second guessed after the fact an executive from the u s chamber of commerce said opponents of liability shields say existing laws already protect businesses owners from being sued if they make appropriate accommodations for workers and customers any additional immunity they argue will only open opportunities

worker safety could allow for some limited liability protections for businesses editorial pittsburgh post gazette while federal lawmakers might be tempted to include sweeping liability protections in the eagerly awaited phase 4 of coronavirus relief they ought to let states take the lead in preventing an avalanche of lawsuits ross marchand detroit news opponents the whole point of making employers liable for risking the lives of their staff is to prevent them from exposing their staff to undue risk businesses are asking for the right to expose their workers to fatal risks with no consequences it s bad economics and bad policy economist justin wolfers in the end liability is not likely to present a huge problem for businesses as long as they make some reasonable effort to keep their places
