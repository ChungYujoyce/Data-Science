 ken rudin president barack obama joins former president bill clinton on stage during the democratic national convention in charlotte n c on wednesday j scott applewhite ap hide caption president barack obama joins former president bill clinton on stage during the democratic national convention in charlotte n c on wednesday the democrats were no sooner out of charlotte when the bad economic news came a more disappointing job report than had been forecast economic numbers weaker than expected just 96 000 jobs were created in august far fewer than what economists were anticipating and even a lower unemployment rate down to 8 1 percent from 8 3 was explained as that more people had simply stopped looking for work the hope of four years ago is quickly becoming a fading memory especially for those whose lives have not seen the change barack obama once promised reality often can get in the way of a celebration and that may be how we define the convention bounce of 2012 all the emotion and enthusiasm and memorable speeches of charlotte have indeed resulted in a bounce for the president and his party but how long does it last maybe a little trip down memory lane is in order fade music here for flashback her smiling face belied a voice dripping of contempt poor george ann richards said of the republican nominee he can t help it he was born with a silver foot in his mouth that 1988 democratic convention also included taunts from ted kennedy aimed at vice president george h w bush whom he was depicting as someone totally missing from accountability in the reagan administration where was george he asked over and over which became a rallying refrain at the omni in atlanta democrats got a big bounce out of their 1988 convention it didn t last ken rudin collection hide caption all in all a big success for the democrats and michael dukakis who left the convention with a seven point bounce and a 17 point lead in the polls according to gallup but the bounce the democrats got didn t last long where was george you ask four weeks after their convention ended gallup had bush up by nine not every convention bounce disappears bill clinton got a 16 point bounce after his 1992 convention five weeks later the republicans met and renominated president bush but the gop convention its internal divisions exposed wasn t as successful and clinton never lost his momentum to be sure things were different back then the two conventions were weeks apart and that allowed at least one party to emerge with serious momentum now they are practically on top of each other in 2008 and again this year they were separated by just a weekend and so whatever momentum the first convention might create could theoretically vanish within days if not hours that s what happened four years ago the democratic convention that nominated obama in denver was seen as a home run not to mention historic gallup showed the dems with a four point bounce but republicans aware of what they were up against struck quickly john mccain waited just one day after the democrats left denver to announce sarah palin as his running mate in the first gallup survey after the republican confab in st paul mccain jumped to a 49 44 percent lead over obama and it looks like we re seeing a similar situation this year the republicans went first and nominated mitt romney in tampa a talking chair aside it went well but there was no evidence of a meaningful romney bounce and it didn t have nearly the kind of emotion that we saw at the democratic gathering days later in charlotte gallup now has obama up 49 45 percent the reuters ipsos poll also has the president ahead by four points said ipsos pollster julia clark the convention bump is actually happening i know there was some debate whether it would happen but it s here nate silver who writes the five thirty eight blog at the new york times says the bounce may be more than just a blip what s a bit more worrisome for mr romney is that gallup s reporting of the head to head results in its poll occurs over a lengthy seven day window meaning that only a minority of the interviews in the poll were conducted after the major speeches at the democratic convention in fact most of the interviews in the poll were conducted just after the republican convention in tampa fla a period in which mr romney should have been enjoying a convention bounce of his own it s certainly important to be cautious when interpreting one day changes in the polls but so far this data is tracking toward a decent size convention bounce for mr obama it s quite unlikely in fact that the movement in the polls reflects statistical noise alone silver points out that one day after the convention came a mediocre jobs report which certainly can t be good news for the dems and so the better question then is not whether the movement in the polls toward mr obama is real but rather how much more of it if any he will get and how long it persists mr obama will need to show leads of around four or five points in national polls conducted next week to maintain the advantage the model is now showing for him mr romney entered the conventions in a narrow deficit to mr obama the fact that he only pulled into a rough tie in the polls after the republican convention was a bearish sign for him if mr obama emerges from the conventions in a stronger position than he entered them with mr romney s position will have become a bit difficult obama can and will continue to try to make the case that as disappointing as things are now romney and the gop will make them worse republicans in congress have blocked their attempts at improving the economy every step of the way that in a nutshell is the president s strategy on the other hand if the election is a referendum on the past three and a half years obama is in trouble and great speeches at a national convention will not change that with former congressman virgil goode on the ballot in virginia could he be mitt romney s nader ken rudin collection hide caption goode news for obama former congressman virgil goode of virginia who was elected as a democrat 1996 and 1998 an independent 2000 and a republican 2002 2004 and 2006 before his narrow defeat in 2008 is the presidential nominee this year of the constitution party last week he qualified for the ballot in virginia a state that is seen as dead even between president obama and mitt romney an almost must win state for romney if he is to prevail in november it s not a stretch to suggest that nearly every vote goode gets would be siphoned from romney s total and goode doesn t have to do particularly well to make a difference think back to 2000 ralph nader got just 1 6 percent of the vote in florida but many democrats are convinced that those 97 000 plus votes he received ultimately cost al gore the state and the presidency george w bush carried florida by just 537 votes political updates i post periodic political updates during the
