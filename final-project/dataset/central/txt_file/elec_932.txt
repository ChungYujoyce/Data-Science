 aug 15 2019 at 4 29 pm by nathaniel rakich filed under 2020 election helen h richardson medianews group the denver post via getty image another passenger has boarded the s s winnow on thursday former colorado gov john hickenlooper announced he was dropping out of the race for president many of the problems we identified with hickenlooper s campaign when he first entered the race ended up coming true he lacked a geographic or demographic base and he proved unable to stand out from a flashier field of candidates despite hopes that he would make some noise in the debates he didn t make a positive impression in the first and spoke less than any other candidate in the second the result hickenlooper never found his footing among actual voters when he dropped out of the race a majority of democrats 56 percent still did not have an opinion of him according to a fivethirtyeight average of august polls but even if hickenlooper had more successfully gotten his name out there he just wasn t what voters were looking for even in colorado where he is well known and well liked among democrats 1 hickenlooper received just 7 percent of the vote in a public policy polling survey of the presidential primary nationally he never wound up exceeding 2 percent in any poll hickenlooper s campaign had been struggling for months so this wasn t an unexpected announcement in early july six of his top staffers left the campaign after urging him to drop out and run for u s senate in colorado instead there was so little grassroots appetite for his candidacy that four months into his campaign he had reportedly amassed only 13 000 individual donors one tenth of the required number to qualify for the september debate at the time an anonymous source said staff told hicklenlooper his campaign was on pace to run out of money by the end of august so it s possible hickenlooper simply could not afford to continue his campaign hickenlooper s failure is notable because as a two term governor of a swing state he had a great traditional r sum for a presidential candidate it s fair to think that if he had run in say 1992 he might very well have become the nominee or at least made more of a showing but hickenlooper s fate is another data point suggesting we can throw some of those old priors out the window nowadays it appears more important to many democratic primary voters that a presidential candidate either has revolutionary ideas better represents the diversity of the party or both and former vice president joe biden perhaps the only candidate with better traditional credentials than hickenlooper is sucking up all the oxygen among the remainder of the electorate indeed it s notable that the candidates to qualify for the september debate so far are biden and then an array of boundary breaking candidates three women sens elizabeth warren kamala harris and amy klobuchar three people of color harris sen cory booker and andrew yang and a gay man mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana sen bernie sanders and former rep beto o rourke are the exceptions but even they have the novelty of democratic socialism and youth respectively on their side the race s many straight moderate and or older white men look likely to be culled from the debate stage and we expect some to join hickenlooper in bowing out of the race of course we ll have to wait and see perhaps some will break out of the pack the other notable thing about hickenlooper s departure from presidential politics is the question of what he does next many hope he ll challenge republican sen cory gardner back home in colorado senate minority leader chuck schumer has reportedly met with hickenlooper repeatedly to pressure him into running and hickenlooper said in his drop out video that he will give it some serious thought but with about a dozen democrats already running in that race others believe his presidential dalliance has cost him a clear shot at a senate nomination that would otherwise have been his for the taking i agree to a point it is far from certain that they will all drop out in deference to hickenlooper in fact former state house speaker andrew romanoff said on thursday he would not do so in addition former state sen mike johnston has raised more in total contributions for his senate campaign 3 4 million than hickenlooper did for his presidential campaign 3 2 million 2 and both johnston and former diplomat dan baer had more cash on hand than hickenlooper at the end of last quarter so those two can also probably afford to stand and fight if they want to on the other hand i still think hickenlooper would be strongly favored to win the nomination his fundraising would almost surely pick up and his rivals would dry up if he sets his sights a little lower and two hypothetical polls of the race have given hickenlooper huge leads the same ppp poll that showed hickenlooper at 7 percent in the presidential primary put him at 44 percent in the senate primary followed by romanoff at 12 percent none of the six other candidates included in the survey received more than 4 percent and a more recent poll from garin hart yang put hickenlooper at 61 percent johnston at 10 percent and romanoff at 8 percent one caveat both polls were sponsored by unknown democratic organizations and they may have a vested interest in tempting hickenlooper to run for senate that s because hickenlooper is widely seen as democrats strongest possible general election candidate and colorado is virtually a must win for democrats if they want to take back control of the senate according to the garin hart yang poll 61 percent of democrats think hickenlooper has the best chance of defeating gardner in the general election most respondents said electability was more important than ideology in determining their primary vote so ironically hickenlooper could end up essentially becoming the biden of the colorado senate field there are reasons to think hickenlooper would present a particularly strong challenge to gardner he s already won two statewide elections in colorado and in tough years for democrats 2010 and 2014 to boot and another ppp poll conducted just last weekend gave hickenlooper a strong 13 point lead over gardner but personally i m not convinced just as early polls of the presidential general election can readily be dismissed i don t think that ppp poll shows us much beyond name recognition plus that poll was sponsored by 314 action which definitely has a vested interest in tempting hickenlooper to run for senate 314 action is a group that promotes scientists running for office hickenlooper is a former geologist additionally hickenlooper is on record saying he doesn t want to be a senator he has said i m not cut out to be a senator and i don t think that s my calling there is even video of him saying the senate doesn t attract me and if the senate s so good how come all those senators are trying to get out i would expect to see those clips show up in an attack ad or two finally in a presidential year i m just not sure any democrat would perform that much better than another in this era of partisanship ber alles senate races track very closely with the presidential results in their states gardner s fate probably hinges on how closely associated he is with president trump and trump s standing come election day more than on the quality of his opponent although his net favorability has slipped a bit since launching his presidential campaign as of june 30 the end of the last fundraising period nathaniel rakich is
