office of the white house on march 27 2020 in washington d c ten years from now when economists mull the exact moment the u s ceded the future to china this week s events are sure to top the list of time stamp candidates this was the week after all when chinese president xi jinping tossed another 4 trillion yuan or 565 billion at an economy taking devastating coronavirus blows the 4 trillion yuan figure will sound familiar to students of 2008 and 2009 back when beijing threw exactly that amount at plunging demand amid the lehman stock it worked back then china recovered rapidly from wall street s crash thanks to aggressive infrastructure spending by 2009 china was growing 8 7 again thanks to giant public works projects six lane highways bridges ports new skyscraper strewn commercial centers now as xi s communist party pulls a similar play it s hard not to lament this week s missteps in mitch mcconnell s washington within the same 24 hours during which xi s announced a nearly 600 billion plan to build even more airports railways and power grids senate majority leader mcconnell gave the thumbs down to comparable upgrades to america s economic hardware infrastructure is unrelated to the coronavirus pandemic that we re all experiencing and trying to figure out how to go forward mcconnell said music to xi s ears the trillions of dollars his government lavished on the made in china 2025 extravaganza is already positioning china to lead the future of artificial intelligence automation micro processing renewable energy robotics self driving vehicles you name it and trump made it easy for xi as china prepares for the global economy it will confront in 2025 trump is making coal great again granted xi has been slow to get the state s tentacles out of the economy his pledges to let market forces play a decisive role in decision making have gotten only modest traction in seven years china s hulking 10 trillion shadow banking system meantime continues to allocate capital recklessly look no further than the recent jump in the number of bank bailouts including hong kong listed bank of gansu beijing s rescue efforts highlight the deterioration of balance sheets and the extreme opacity that plagues china inc the accounting fraud at luckin coffee china s supposed starbucks killer is a reminder asia s biggest economy isn t ready for global prime time but trump s three and half years in office have been a lost period for building the kind of economic muscle needed to stay ahead of china trump is doing zero to get under the economy s hood his trade war and protectionist policies might ve worked in say 1985 in 2020 though his tariffs are merely added headwinds as the global economy fends off covid 19 fallout trump isn t increasing competitiveness and productivity or catalyzing innovation he s cutting investments in education training and health trump s republican party is avoiding the infrastructure big bang needed to raise america s economic game instead it cut taxes in ways that reward billionaires without incentivizing companies to fatten paychecks or hone competitiveness over the last few years trump widened the gulf between rich and poor

handling of a covid 19 pandemic believed to have started in wuhan there should indeed be investigations and punishment doled by the global community but trump s antics lies and over the top bombast are helping china deflect blame each bizarre trump twitter rant makes xi s china look serious and sober by comparison each trumpian threat to impose new tariffs here demand higher military payments there or manufacture some controversy over there plays into beijing s hands so does mcconnell s refusal to rise to the occasion at 78 it s reasonable to think the kentucky republican might not have many more years left in top senate leadership yet the lost period of reform that mcconnell represents will be with u s china dynamics for decades to come come 2025 u s investors may wish they could engineer their own alternative reality one where mcconnell and trump favored a marshal plan of sorts to halt america s slide toward developing nation status in terms of infrastructure when economic
