a taste of the same kasich they d see in person minus the teal puffy coat he s been wearing this winter the national debt tickerthat decorates his town hall meetings and the blue bus carting him through the new hampshire snow with kasich voters get an hour of folksy explanations of complicated policies plus exhortations to take care of each other seek a personal purpose become part of something bigger than themselves he also makes jokes that make fun of audience members or himself or the presidential process he drops names he s friends with john mccain who twice won the new hampshire primaries he got leonardo dicaprio s autograph for his daughters at a restaurant this month he sometimes interrupts questioners or finishes their queries for them my mind works very fast you know and there s things that they say that trigger something that i can t wait to tell them he said in the interview i m really not trying to cut anybody off and i m certainly not trying to show them any disrespect but can t we just kind of get to it i m just bursting to tell them rushad thomas walked right into a kasich joke monday night at a town hall in lebanon new hampshire i thinkimmigrationis a good thing because our population is getting very old people heavy thomas 26 said to the audience which was also very old people heavy since the event was at a senior center it s

his campaign his campaign manager is beth hansen his former gubernatorial chief of staff his traveling staff and advisers are all men sometimes this bus is like being in a fraternity house you know kasich said in the interview i would rather have a situation where we could bring more women in but on this bus it s just guys you know it s not ideal but there s only a couple of people that i talk to really really seriously and beth is one of them kasich s family joined him monday and tuesday in new hampshire his daughters told voters kasich was the most loving caring and experienced gop candidate and the only one i d feel comfortable with reese said once in lebanon kasich teased reese for wanting to attend college at an art school in london what kind of school is that he said to

moment so he did what parents do she didn t like that and i actually had to apologize to her he said in the interview without his daughters on the campaign trail kasich lights up whenever he sees a child he read a thomas the tank enginebook to a family of toddlers in the middle of a town hall meeting asking the children what noise a cow makes finally he supplied in a shaky voice moo you said it like a goat a voter shouted new hampshire voters who see kasich often say they believe he ll get things done in washington d c they cite his down home style and his blue collar upbringing i know he s not in the top three nationally said paul plater a 67 year old from hillsboro who is retired from the army corps of engineers he d get my vote he s going to be up there in the top three by the end on
