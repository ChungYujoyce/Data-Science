washington it s not too late if donald trump loses the republican presidential nomination he says he might runforthe white house anyway and if trump wins the gop nomination anti trump candidates from the partyestablishment are considering doing the same while it s an uphill climband state deadlines loom there are several ways a third candidate could mount a general election bid consequential enough to demand attention trump is easy to spell notes democratic strategist tad devine suggesting the billionaire businessman could try a write in campaign for the nation s highest office on the democratic side hillary clinton and bernie sanders have promised to support the party s nominee but allthree remaining republican rivals have walked back commitments they signed last year to support the party s nominee onfox news sunday trump refused to rule out an independent orthird party candidacy if he fails to win the gop nomination i m going to have to see how i was treated he told chris wallace it s very simple in an election seasonthat already has upended the expected there are the ingredients that have fueled third party bids in the past theyincludea mercurial potential contender with money donald trump meet ross perot and the sort of ideological divide that prompted moderate congressmanjohn anderson to run when the gop shifted rightin 1980 to nominate conservative ronald reagan the powerof theparties hasgotten weakersince thenand the rules for getting on state ballots easier minor parties have been working and working and working all these years and it s slowly paying off says richard winger publisher ofballot access news a newsletter that just might see a surge in readership this year nobody notices because it s little incremental changes but it s adding up in a little noticed ruling last month for instance a u s district court struck down the provision in georgiathat required independent presidential candidates to submit petitions with signatures equal to 1 of eligible registered voters ingreen party of georgia v kemp judge richard story ruled that the state s ballot requirement one of the toughest in the country wastoo onerous heset an interimstandard of 7 500 signatures until the state legislature acts there are two candidates in this race who could be a third party candidate and that s trump and bernie sanders says republican strategist ed rollins who for a time ran perot s 1992 independent bid if trump chose to go outside and spend his own money he d create chaos albeit with a better chance of helping to elect clinton than himself rollins says neither perot nor anderson won the white house of course but they participated in debatesand affected the cross currentsof the campaign some analysts say ralph nader s campaign in 2000 as the green party nominee may have pulled enough votes from democrat al gore inflorida to tip the closely dividedstate and with itthe presidency to republican george w bush although nader disputes that and if trump is nominated if donald trump gets nominated and continues to drive his negatives through the roof conceivably a third party candidate could become the de facto republican nominee says gop pollster whit ayres speculation has centered on establishment leaders who have been outspoken in criticizing trump including 2012 nominee mitt romney and former 2016 contender jeb bush last week the texas tribunereported there was no record offormer governor rick perry voting in the state s primary although he had endorsed texas sen ted cruz that drew notice because it would preserve perry s eligibility to run as an independent in the fall while perrylast year described trump s candidacy as a cancer on conservatism a spokesman said the formerpresidential hopeful wasn t interested in making an independent bid voters increasingly are open to voting for someone other than the democrator the republican in the most recent usa today suffolk university poll taken in february only a third of those surveyed said the two major parties did a good job of representing americans political views a 54 majority said three or more parties were necessary running for president this year as a third candidate isn t easy that doesn t mean it s impossible let s count the ways that s what perot did in 1992 the texas billionaire said he was open to a draft movement in february opened a phone bank in march and after an in and outcampaign was on all 50 state ballots in november there were times during the campaign when he led republicangeorge h w bush and democrat bill clinton in national polls and he participated in the fall debates in the end perot carried 19 of the popular vote the most for any thirdcandidate sinceteddy roosevelt s bid in 1912 as the progressive bull moose party s nominee texas hasthe earliest deadline and someof the stiffest requirements for an independent presidential candidateto get on the ballot by may 9 just five weeks away a candidate must submit petitions with 70 939 signatures realistically the number has to be much higheras a cushion for signatures that might be thrown out asineligible north carolina s deadline is next on june 9 three other states illinois indiana and new mexico have deadlines in late june but thirty one states and the district of columbia don t have deadlines until august and many require only a nominal number of signatures such as275 in tennessee and800 in new jersey in colorado a check for 1 000 gets a candidate on the ballot the final deadlines in arizona kentucky mississippi and rhode island are on sept 9 that said 11 states have deadlines before the republican convention opens in cleveland on july 18 and other deadlines begin to follow in a crush the libertarian party already is on track to be on every state ballot this fall party chairman nicholas sarwark 36 whose family owns an independent car dealership in phoenix says more than one of this year s presidential contenders have been in touch to expressinterest in the libertarian nomination he won t name names or even specify if the calls came on behalf of republicans or democrats or both there s a lot of frustration that candidates feel like they weren t able to get a hearing from the republican or democratic races that there wasn t enough oxygen in the room he says he sayshis party could be open to nominating a newcomer it would be up to that candidate to make the case that they were libertarian or libertarian enough the partyconvention is in orlando over memorial day weekend with none of the delegatesbound to a particular contender beforehand the first nationally televised debate everamong libertarian contenders was heldlast friday on fox business news featuringformer new mexico governor gary johnson the libertarian republic founderaustin petersen and anti virus software developer john mcafee johnson the libertarian nominee in 2012 doubts some high profile republican could move in and win the nomination they re going to get their heads handed to them he predicted in an interview saying the gop s conservativeviews on social issues would undermine their appeal among libertarians that said they would bring a lot of welcome attention to the libertarian party if they try last month a nationalmonmouth university poll included a three way race among clinton trump and johnson the libertarian candidate was supported by 11 even though three of four of those surveyed said they didn t know enough about him to have an opinion johnson s name seems to be more of a placeholder for voters who are not particularly thrilled with either major party choice right now says poll director patrick murray there is an appetite there for a third party candidate but it s still too soon to tell whether that will be a realistic option then there are all those other third parties that already are on some state ballots but not all people who think it is too late for donald trump to run after he is rejected by the republican national convention ought to realize there are ballot qualified parties that would probably nominate trump winger says he listed 13 of them as prime prospects they range from the alaskan independence party sarah palin s husband todd was once a member to the independent american party in utah forget ballot access what about running as a write in five states hawaii louisiana nevada oklahoma andsouth dakota have laws that ban all write in votes and south carolina bans write in votes for president election officials in arkansas and new mexico say they won t tally write ins and mississippi law says the statewill count them only if one of the candidates on the ballot has died still that leaves 42 states and the district of columbia that do allow write ins and will tally them most require a write in candidate to submit a declaration of candidacy before the vote it s a path that most realistic for someone with a fervent following and a famous name and ideally one that is easy to spell that s not a frivolous concern when it comes to making sure a write in vote counts when alaska sen lisa murkowski lost the republican nomination in 2010 and then ran as a write in she aired a tv adthat showed a faux spelling bee contestant soundingout her name letter by letter murkowskibecame the first senator in a half century to win with a write in campaign if trump doesn t get the nomination i think he would organize a write in campaign predictsrick tyler a former top campaign aide to cruz trump s top rival in some ways donald trump already is a third party candidate right now he is effectively a third party candidate running for the republican nomination
