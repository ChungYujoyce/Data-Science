more than two years ago deputy attorney general rod rosenstein appointed robert mueller as special counsel to investigate possible coordination efforts between the russian government and donald trump s 2016 campaign on march 22 mueller delivered his report to attorney general william barr who later released a four page summary the special counsel s findings before making a redacted copy available to congress over the course of his probe mueller brought 199 charges against 34 people and three companies including six of trump s former advisers and associates barr wrote in a letter to the leadership of the house and senate judiciary committees that he may be in a position to advise you of the special counsel s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend the report found that the russian government interfered with the 2016 presidential election though it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy between trump s campaign and russia while the report could not conclude whether trump committed a crime it also did not exonerate him here s what we know about how much the report cost to produce between may 17 2017 the day mueller was appointed special counsel through sept 30 2018 his office spent 12 287 852 this includes 7 3 million on salaries and benefits 1 3 million on travel and transportation and 2 2 million on rent and utilities in the most recent of the three expense reports filed the special counsel s office also says it spent 15 618 on printing and copying needs not included in these figures are component expenses incurred by the department of justice at large these additional costs totaled 12 928 000 though the doj says it was not legally required to report them and that they are approximate to what the doj would have spent elsewhere if the special counsel s office didn t exist mueller s office has not yet filed an expense report for the last six months of his investigation but including the doj s contributions the total reported cost so far is 25 2 million the fourth and final expense report has not yet been released though it is likely that it will come out soon the first three reports totaled approximately 6 8 million 10 million and 8 5 million respectively so the last one if comparable to the others would make the final dollar amount of mueller s probe between 32 million and 35 million though that is a lot of money the investigation may have actually paid for itself by uncovering tax evasion and fraud trump s former campaign chairman paul manafort was sentenced for obstruction of justice and conspiracy in september manafort as part of his plea deal agreed to forfeit assets valued around 42 million including about 22 million in real estate property according to cnbc though a justice department official told nbc news that the money would not go directly to funding the investigation some republicans have been critical of the costs of mueller s investigation the least we can do is start looking at all the ways he has absolutely blown taxpayer dollars rep louie gohmert told fox news in june according to gohmert mueller has wasted money right and left republicans repeatedly brought up the cost of the investigation during a july 24 hearing before the house judiciary committee but the cost of mueller s investigation is much lower than previous ones the investigation into president bill clinton from 1994 to 2002 cost approximately 69 million and the investigation into iran contra cost approximately 47 million not adjusted for inflation according to the washington post write to abby vesoulis at abby vesoulis time com
