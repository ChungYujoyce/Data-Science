accusers had been debunked he blamed the clinton campaign for planting false stories about him and called hisaccuserspublicity hounds i didn t even apologize to my wife who is sitting righthere because i didn t do anything trump said in a somber tone delivered over repeated interruptions from trump clinton argued that trump had repeatedly mocked women for their looks and sought to shame and demean them privately and in the workplace donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger clinton said he goes after their dignity their self worth and i don t think there s a woman anywhere that doesn t know what that feels like nobody has more respect for women than i do trump shot back drawing gasps from the audience wallace had to remind the crowd to stay quiet later trump lit up social media for muttering into the microphone such a nasty woman female voters make up an outsize portion of the electorate and may very well be responsible for sending trump to a huge defeat on nov 8 trump

legitimacy of the vote count on election day trump said there are millions of people who are registered to vote illegally alleged that the media has poisoned the minds of the voters and pledged to keep the nation in suspense over whether he d concede the race to clinton those remarks were received with bewilderment from wallace who noted the nation s long history of peaceful transfer of power

against abortion and stayed on the attack against clinton on her biggest vulnerabilities raising questions about the fbi s investigation into her private email server donations from foreign governments to the clinton foundation and revelations from the wikileaks email dumps but clinton countered and may have won more points over the course of the night several instant polls named clinton the winner regardless trump needed a campaign altering moment and it didn t happen he will enter the final three weeks before election day trailing badly and with his support teetering on the edge of full collapse stirring republican fears that they could lose the house majority the days of trump boasting about his polling numbers and his prospects in blue states are long gone trump s attacks against clinton and the message that turned him into a winner in the gop primaries won t be enough to get him back to that place he needs some outside development or event to change the dynamic of the race if he s going to be president policy takes center stagefor policy wonks and those who believe the election has not been about the issues wednesday night s debate was a winner wallace is being held up as a hero for steering the discourse into specific areas of policy and for provoking some interesting exchanges between the candidates on gun rights abortion entitlements immigration and foreign policy clinton was pressed to answer some uncomfortable questions about her support of late term abortion trump was held to account for questionable remarks he s made about russia syria and war torn areas in the middle east the first half hour of the debate even included a lengthy discussion of the second amendment focused on a supreme court decision there were moments when the debate devolved into the tawdry details of the candidates personal lives but overall wallace was able to draw them away from scorched earth combat view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite
