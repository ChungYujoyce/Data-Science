longer period of time some of the people most removed from the economic pain of the pandemic from a former wells fargo ceo to the president of the united states have preached an urgency to restart the economy and get people back to work but none of the dozen low wage workers interviewed for this article advocated for scaling back the social distancing measures currently in place despite their economic hardships only one a cook at the waikiki beach marriott suggested it might be possible to treat states differently depending on how bad their outbreaks are ese es un jaque mate norma says when i ask her which she would prefer a checkmate trump over the weekend backed off his arbitrary deadline of having people back at work by easter announcing instead that social distancing guidelines will remain in place at least through april 30 meanwhile miguel an undocumented waiter at a party venue in new york s westchester county has just five or six hundred dollars in his bank account in december his vehicle s transmission died wiping out the modest savings fund he would have relied upon for an emergency like this he worries about paying his bills and sending money to his family in mexico no me alcanza lo que yo tengo he says what i have isn t enough workers are looking to the federal government for help and many will get it on friday trump signed a senate produced 2 trillion stimulus package among the provisions are 1 200 checks to americans who earn less than 75 000 per year but miguel and norma who are among the undocumented immigrants that pay taxes and make up large numbers of the hourly employees most affected by the lost wages will not be eligible for those benefits to be honest i m trying not to look into what i have in my account says luerica fiffee who was a full time passenger service representative at new york s john f kennedy international airport until march 19 when she was laid off because air traffic had slowed and there was no work for her she still has her part time job as a ups cargo agent through dnata an air service provider which gives her three three hour shifts a week at jfk but it s not enough to depend on being out of work that s not something i m used to so it s hard just to sit here in the meantime millions of people home are suspended in uncertainty it s unclear how deeply damaged the economy will be or how long it will take to emerge from sudden disruption when we were originally laid off we were told that it was to be temporary i think it s very unlikely that that will be the case says adam hyland who was a security officer at the rhode island convention center before he was laid off on march 13 when the center began layoffs associated with the center closing he and his wife have a seven month old baby girl for a place like a trade show center this is not likely to rebound within a month or two hyland says so you know that s the time frame in which i m going to have to be at another job or it just
