in vienna austria photo illustration by johann schwarz sepa media getty images the coronavirus outbreak has now affected nearly 190 000 people in the u s and has claimed more than 4 000 lives in the country there is one metric that matters more than all else acceleration of the coronavirus spread this acceleration is slowing down not zero yet not negative but it has been slowing down for the last few days acceleration is the rate of change of the change itself the spread of spread per unit time it is not to be confused with the change which is new cases added each day for clarity the rule is simple when acceleration is negative things won t be the same below is some data for new cases in the united states to understand the evolving picture of acceleration better and the dashboard here shows our forecast timing for when negative acceleration is possible what s important look at the 2nd number in each of the rows above the more new cases per day that s the daily acceleration this increased from 789 on mar 23 to 3869 on mar 26 but the last few days it has been less with 384 more new cases per day on mar 30 for coronavirus fear to subside this number needs to go to negative while we re not there yet it looks like acceleration is headed downwards we looked at the acceleration of spread in south korea china germany italy across countries to forecast cases in the u s does that mean there will be no scarcity of ventilators hospital beds or care providers as we see above the acceleration while reduced is still positive there are unfortunately still more new cases each day in fact in one scenario we expect the number of covid 19 cases to reach around 720k however if this trend continues there will be fewer new cases each day and things will get better markets will improve from stock markets to grocery stores and people won t be scared to pick up a coffee from the corner starbucks sbux or mcdonald s mcd until then let s continue to be scared paranoid continue that social distancing and isolation it seems to be meaningfully negating the unbalanced force of spread so far our dashboard 28 coronavirus crash vs 4 historic crashes builds a complete macro picture
