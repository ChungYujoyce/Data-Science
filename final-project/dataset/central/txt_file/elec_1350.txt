images hide caption early voting has begun in the battleground states of ohio virginia and iowa voting booths were set up for early voting thursday at the black hawk county courthouse in waterloo iowa ahead of wednesday s first presidential debate an npr poll finds president obama with a 7 point lead nationally but his gop challenger mitt romney is within striking distance the latest poll by npr and its bipartisan polling team pdf shows president obama with a 7 point lead among likely voters nationally and a nearly identical lead of 6 points in the dozen battleground states where both campaigns are spending most of their time and money i know it s a long way off but thinking about the presidential election this november if the election for president were held today and the candidates were democrat barack obama and republican mitt romney for whom would you vote source npr democracy corps resurgent republic credit padmananda rama and alyson hurt npr but the poll also finds former massachusetts gov mitt romney very much within striking distance of the incumbent as the two men begin a series of three debates wednesday in denver more than 80 percent of respondents said they planned to watch the first televised clash wednesday and one in four said the debate could influence their vote do you intend to watch the first presidential debate next wednesday night if yes is that all of the debate some or will you try to catch portions of it on the news source npr democracy corps resurgent republic credit padmananda rama and alyson hurt npr the poll found 51 percent of the likely voters planning on or leaning toward a vote for the president with 44 percent voting for or leaning toward his challenger in the battleground subsample the numbers were 50 percent obama and 44 percent romney those numbers were slightly better for the president than his job approval rating in the poll nationally the president was at 50 percent approval 46 percent disapproval but in the battleground he was at 48 percent approval and 49 percent disapproval battleground voters were also more downbeat about the direction of the country asked whether things were generally going in the right direction or pretty seriously off on the wrong track 59 percent in the battleground said wrong track and just 36 percent said right direction that gap of 23 points was only 16 points on the same question in the national sample the poll of 800 likely voters was conducted over the final five days of september by stan greenberg of democracy corps and whit ayres of resurgent republic about a third of those polled live in the 12 states considered in play for the nov 6 election colorado florida iowa michigan nevada new hampshire new mexico north carolina ohio pennsylvania virginia and wisconsin ayres the republican half of the team noted that the actual electorate in november may not have as many democrats as this npr poll s likely voter sample which he called a best case scenario for the president s party when you sample voters over time you inevitably get varying proportions of democrats and republicans in the sample it s nothing nefarious just the vagaries of sampling ayres said this sample ended up with seven points more democrats than republicans in 2008 there were seven points more democrats than republicans in the electorate according to exit polls but in 2004 there were equal numbers of democrats and republicans if this year s voters were to split evenly again between the two major parties romney would have an advantage the npr poll found him a 4 point favorite among independents most observers expect this year s party ratio to be somewhere between the democratic tilt of 2008 and the even split of 2004 which recurred in the midterm elections of 2010 greenberg the democratic member of the polling team said polling this year has generally found fewer people self identifying with the gop they re moving into the independent category greenberg said where also if you look at the brand position of the republican party and democratic party the republican party favorability has been dropping throughout this whole period but while the ranks of independents are growing that does not imply a large number of undecided voters with five weeks left to election day the pollsters found only 2 percent calling themselves undecided moreover 11 percent of those who do not support the president said they might still change their minds fifteen percent of those who do not support romney say the same we have a very polarized electorate where people go to their tribal corners and fight it out ayres said but in an election this close even a point or two could make a difference now thinking about the nation s economy do you believe the economy source npr democracy corps resurgent republic credit padmananda rama and alyson hurt npr the poll indicates that the republican challenger has a tall order to fill wednesday night and in the remaining weeks as he has fallen behind on issues such as taxes the economy and medicare ayres said that means his party s nominee needs to paint a compelling picture for a better economic future and explain why his emphasis on small businesses and private sector solutions is more likely to succeed than obama s emphasis on governmental and public sector solutions ayres also noted that when his firm tested the statement obama s economic plan is working and we need to stay the course versus the opposing option obama s economic plan is not working and we need to try something different the latter choice was easily the more popular but when the statements were altered to emphasize romney s video quotation about the 47 percent who don t pay taxes the results were different in the election this year do you plan on voting on election day on november 6th or do you plan to vote early or absentee prior to election day source npr democracy corps resurgent republic credit padmananda rama and alyson hurt npr that reinforces the argument that obama cannot win a referendum on his economic record ayres added the only way he can win is to so thoroughly trash romney that he becomes an unacceptable alternative the npr poll like others in recent weeks showed half the electorate giving romney an unfavorable personal approval rating ayres said that was the other imperative for romney in the debates he needs to come across as knowledgeable and compassionate about people who are hurting in this economy if he does that then he will help to close this gap democratic pollster greenberg maintained that efforts to make the election a referendum on the economy had been under way for months and had yet to take hold nonetheless he said the president cannot afford to sit on his current lead he s got to decide on one thing that he wants to communicate here greenberg said my guess is he ll want to communicate a presidential but not arrogant empathetic style he s got to focus in a way that seals the deal a previous web version of this story incorrectly characterized the percentage of people who said they might change their minds about the candidate they would support we reported 11 percent of president obama s supporters and 15 percent of mitt romney s supporters said they might still change their minds the poll actually indicates that 11 percent of those who do not support obama and 15 percent of those who do not support romney might change their minds npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
