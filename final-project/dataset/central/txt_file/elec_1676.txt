amid pandemic parties gear up for battle over texas state house more s r texas presidential campaign there is a civil war in the party that is going on right now the question is whether after the election the party will be able to repair itself or cease to exist or continue to exist in some diminished way should trump lose to clinton as polls now project the bloodletting is certain to be intense conservatives who have long regarded trump as an ideological imposter are in a position to make the case that the party should return to its core values supporters of trump meanwhile could make the case that it was a lack of establishment buy in not problems with the candidate that cost them the election others believe the party needs to hew closer to the center ground to make itself electable again but they don t hold out much hope of quick progress john mac stipanovich who has worked in republican circles in florida for 35 years including as a senior adviser to jeb bush and chief of staff to former gov bob martinez said that he thought people of good intentions and goodwill may regain dominance in the republican party but that the process would take a long time that may be a much shrunken republican party stipanovich said we may be about to enter a wilderness here in which we will wander for a decade or more and hopefully emerge but if that s the case then we need to wander i personally don t want to be in a party that is characterized by trumpism some people have suggested that the party could split apart entirely in an interview with vox published on friday gop consultant steve schmidt predicted that an alt right party and a center right conservative party would emerge also on friday 2012 gop presidential nominee mitt romney said in a podcast interview that it would be very difficult for the republican party to be put back together again after the election romney s remarks were first reported by buzzfeed tyler said that while he harbors no great love for the current gop establishment a new party could be a dead end over the history of the republic he told the hill all these parties have come and all these parties have gone he added why should i have a new party i want to make the republican party the conservative free market freedom party that s its history divisions have long existed within the gop with those fissures deepening with the rise of the tea party under president obama but even the turmoil caused by the tea party pales in comparison to what s happening now with trump remaking the gop in his image trump s recent tactics have aligned him more fully than ever before with the breitbart wing of the party the faction named after the right wing news organization that has become synonymous with nationalism warnings of globalist conspiracy and vigorous attacks on both democrats and gop leaders in washington its critics argue that the movement also traffics in xenophobia and racism the executive chairman of breitbart news steve bannon has been trump s campaign ceo since mid august and his fingerprints are all over the candidate s latest moves bannon is on a leave of absence from breitbart while working for trump in the

average and was given only about a 17 percent change of prevailing in the election by the data forecasting website fivethirtyeight those dynamics as well as trump s longer history of using controversial rhetoric about illegal immigrants women and muslims are cited by other republicans as evidence that the party would doom itself to perpetual defeat if it continues down the trump path afternov 8 you cannot be crazy and win a national or big state election said stipanovich you may do so in a safe district but in a florida or a california or a texas we are about to learn that you have to stay somewhere within a rifle shot of the center but stipanovich also acknowledged that there was no real chance of his faction winning back the gop in quick and easy fashion it s not like there is going to be a meeting we will take a vote and it ll be over this will play out over the next several election cycles 18 20 22 some say the rise of trump and those forces associated with him reveals a disconnect between the priorities of the establishment and the voters they claim to represent the core principles that drive breitbart seem to be gaining popularity alex marlow the editor in chief of the breitbart news network told cnnmoneylast week there is a movement there is also a huge question mark hanging over what trump will do if he is loses the election some believe he will exit the political stage and return to life as a businessman others think he may well stay involved in politics in some fashion albeit not as a candidate there have been persistent rumors that trump will start his own conservative media organization and that could be the worst outcome of all for republicans seeking to wrest back control such an organization might act as a megaphone for the views trump has put forward in his presidential run and could serve as a platform for a 2020 candidate to run along similar lines trump s supporters according to gop consultant ron bonjean are not going to disappear and they are going to push and pull for the soul of the republican party bonjean does see some slivers of optimism there is at least a possibility he said that gop leaders in washington could find a way to connect with grassroots anger and present an agenda that those voters will understand alternatively a figure with trump s populist instincts but fewer of his personal foibles could emerge but bonjean made no bones about the cataclysm consuming the party we are right now in a raft navigating the political rapids without any oars he said view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k
