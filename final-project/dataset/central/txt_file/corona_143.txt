shaping a more robust response to another collective challenge global warming loading april 22 2020 the covid 19 pandemic has raised the question what lessons will we learn and for those trying to address climate change it has brought a sense of a potentially pivotal moment by mid march amid economic shutdowns scientists calculated a nearly 20 drop in carbon emissions in china in large cities in asia europe and the americas the air has been much clearer the main lesson for activists is that in crisis with a scientific consensus leaders can act decisively and their hope reflected in an open letter last month is that similarly as leaders push to rebuild economies greener priorities will prevail yet governments must weigh tough tradeoffs in the united states that includes how extensively to intervene to support the oil industry and airlines in france president emmanuel macron an advocate for international action on climate confronts the expectation that the economy will shrink by at least 6 in china the economy has shrunk by 6 8 in the first three months of 2020 the imperative for authoritarian regimes and democratically elected governments alike will be to get a battered economy back in action that could temper the appetite for greener initiatives will we learn the lessons as the covid 19 pandemic spreads worldwide that question is being heard ever more widely yet the potentially more critical question is what lessons we ll learn and on at least one key policy challenge climate change the terms of debate have been getting clearer and starker climate change will be far from the only subject of post pandemic policy debate given the sheer scale of the human cost of the covid crisis and the unprecedented economic and political actions governments are taking to constrain it tug of wars are certain to surface domestically on issues like welfare provision public health economic security or the trade off between surveillance and individual rights internationally we ll see them on the future of badly strained international institutions the workings of the global economy and relations with china yet even as the pandemic continues to spread the

thunberg the pandemic is being viewed as a potentially pivotal moment they re presenting it as important new evidence both of why action on climate change matters and why such action is also possible if leaders summon the political will exhibit acame in late february with satellite photos of mainland china in the wake of its economic shutdownsshowinga dramaticdrop in emissions of one toxic gas

millions of people across the world have seen and felt the environmental effects of covid related economic lockdowns in large cities from new delhi to bangkok in asia london to rome in europe and new york to bogota in the americas not only were the streets suddenly quieter the air was much clearer and in what climate activists see as an important signpost for the way forward huge numbers of people have responded to covid 19 like global warming a product of human interaction with the natural world with generosity altruism and community spirited action the main lesson climate activists are drawing however is that in times of crisis with a scientific consensus on what is necessary and what will work leaders can act decisively for the advocates of stronger action on climate change the takeaway is clear as ms thunberg remarked on a recent zoom call with fellow activists and supporters every crisis needs to be treated like a crisis the advocates of climate change action also know of course that the shutdown of wide areas of the world s major economies is in the longer run neither sustainable nor desirable their hope reflected in an open letter last month by an alliance of scientists politicians religious leaders and climate activists is that in the push to revive and rebuild world economies greener priorities become the drivers that s where the other side of the debate the pushback is likely to come to the fore and there have already been signs of the tradeoffs that major governments are going to have to weigh take the world s largest economy the united states the oil industry and the airlines two major contributors to carbon emissions have been severely hit given the prospect of continued low oil prices and reduced air travel even when the worst of the covid 19 crisis has passed the federal government will have to decide how extensively to intervene in support of their recovery the signs from the trump administration at least so far is that both are likely to receive high priority attention in france where president emmanuel macron has been an advocate of international action on climate change it is clear he too will face difficult decisions in an effort last year to blunt the direct democracy demands of yellow vest protesters who had been staging street demonstrations across the country he empowered a citizens panel to come up with policy recommendations on reducing emissions he pledged not to ignore them but the agenda they ve produced includes radical constraints on everything from air travel and automobile sales to telecommunications infrastructure now coinciding with a covid 19 crisis that is expected to shrink france s economy this year by at least 6 nor is china immune in the first three months of the year its economy shrank by 6 8 the first such contraction since official quarterly gdp figures were first released nearly three decades ago in theory at least president xi jinping could further re burnish his post crisis international image by prioritizing lower carbon technologies in his drive to get the economy growing again there would be another potential advantage to doing that the main policy tool used to respond to the last major economic jolt the 2008 world financial crisis might not be as attractive this time around back then the answer was a huge financial stimulus it worked yet it also hugely raised the scale of debt inside china a problem president xi has in recent years been actively seeking to bring under control still the immediate imperative for mr xi s authoritarian regime no less than for democratically elected leaders like president trump or president macron will be to get a comprehensively battered economy back in action as quickly as possible so it s at least as likely that the chinese leader will focus on reviving his country s existing economic machine get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox this story was published as part of
