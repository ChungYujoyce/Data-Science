there is opportunity in crisis as the saying goes and for republicans roy moore s stunning loss in alabama s special senate election is a chance to focus on a nagging question if they can t win in alabama where can they win it is also a chance for republicans to address their growing electoral conundrum with a manifestly unfit president a party base besotted by fire breathers and a congress determined to pay off its debts to the wealthy by borrowing from the young and taxingmany in the middle class there is much work to be doneand with an embarrassing loss in alabama plenty of motivation to take it on democrats face a less obvious threat the growing temptation to take midterm victory for granted dnc alabama voted for the right party the election of former prosecutor doug jones in the deep red state of alabama wasn t a fluke but jones party can t depend on running against a slate of relatively poorly funded pedophiles in 2018 democrats won t often run against the likes of moore a constitution trashing former judge accused of predatory sexual behavior by at least nine women nor will they often have afundraising advantagein the last couple of months of more than five to one they should not look at their alabama success and plan for a house majority next november they should not assume that their senators running in red states will float to re election on an anti trump blue tide and they should not count on pickup wins in nevada and arizona driven by demographic shifts the truth is democrats still have work to do in convincing millions of americans that they speak their language and understand their issues the democratic partyshould stay hungry even desperate and try to find a message that resonates with voters beyond itsbase neither party has created much of a message of late that is anything but the contrary of the other party for eight years republicans did little but vilify president obama and now democrats are in danger of defining themselves simply as the party that does not include presidenttrump androy moore they won t get far with that message american voters know full well that democrats do not like trump and that they have been purging their pols accused of sexual harassment while the gop has been praising theirs every minute spent on that message is time not spent on reintroducing themselves to middle america the alabama election has many messages it will be interesting to see whethereither party will take them to heart if you can t see this readerpoll please refresh your page
