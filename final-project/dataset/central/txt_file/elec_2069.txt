be how little money can buy in politics loading december 19 2019 michael bloomberg isn t just a billionaire candidate he s also a record setting one in his recently announced bid for the democratic presidential nomination mr bloomberg s ad spending of more than 100 million is already nearly twice the personal funds that donald trump spent on his entire 2016 campaign mr bloomberg s ads are ubiquitous in major states like california where other leading democratic candidates will appear at a televised debate tonight his positioning as a moderate is a tough sell to party faithful despite his focus on gun control and climate change but some political analysts say it s too soon to rule him out given the possibility that key rivals might stumble in early primary elections still the road to elected office is littered with self financing candidates who lost since texas billionaire ross perot ran in 1992 a half dozen presidential candidates have contributed more than 1 million to their races only mr trump was victorious money is never enough on its own candidates still need to have all of the other pieces of the puzzle charisma connection to voters good ideas a good campaign operation says sheila krumholz of the nonpartisan center for responsive politics michael bloomberg the last minute entrant to the democratic presidential primary won t appear on the debate stage in los angeles on thursday but he s all over california texas and other super tuesday states where viewers can see him in an unprecedented ad campaign that outspends all of his party competitors combined the ads are everywhere clustered around game shows like jeopardy news and late night talk programs soap operas and football they underscore an unconventional campaign that is skipping the first four states to concentrate instead on the delegate rich ones that follow in march they also highlight in big green dollar signs the record breaking sums that this multi billionaire is pouring into his self financed campaign raising the question of whether an election can be bought actually there s widespread agreement on that one from the bloomberg campaign itself to political savants and the track record of history the acknowledged truth is that while money sure can help it is no guarantee of victory not even close the road to elected office is littered with failed campaigns of the super wealthy money is never enough on its own candidates still need to have all of the other pieces of the puzzle charisma connection to voters good ideas a good campaign operation says sheila krumholz executive director of the nonpartisan center for responsive politics which tracks money in elections on the other hand unlimited resources are a big plus says ms krumholz they will allow mr bloomberg the former mayor of new york to fund an extensive field operation and give him an immediate surge in his ability to get his message out and introduce himself to voters that surge is reflected in opinion polls where the real clear politics average has the self made businessman and philanthropist at 5 support among democrats nationally that s fifth place behind joe biden bernie sanders elizabeth warren and pete buttigieg interestingly the other self made billionaire in the race tom steyer is stuck at less than 2 still mr bloomberg has a track record of success and a super tuesday oriented strategy that some political analysts say could prove viable if key rivals stumble forbes calculates mr bloomberg s wealth at 55 7 billion one of the richest people on the planet his spending on ads so far more than 100 million according to advertising analytics is nearly twice the personal funds that donald trump spent on his 2016 campaign president trump s tally was 66 1 million according to the center for responsive politics but he also benefited from billions of dollars worth of media attention so called earned media matt mackowiak a gop consultant in texas where mr bloomberg has campaigned and is also advertising in expensive media markets says it s entirely possible the latecomer could double or triple what he s spent so far on the primary and put out 1 billion or 2 billion for a general election we ve never seen funding at that level but warning signs for such a candidacy abound voters tend to be highly suspicious of money in politics says garry south a longtime democratic consultant in california they kind of resent rich candidates who pop out of nowhere and spend unlimited amounts of money since texas billionaire ross perot funded most of his losing presidential bid in 1992 a half dozen presidential candidates have contributed more than 1 million to their races only mr trump was victorious california is itself a showcase for failed self funded candidates seeking executive office an exception is republican celebrity arnold schwarzenegger the former governor who tossed 5 million of his own money into a recall election that was a special circumstance involving no primary and 135 names on the ballot mr south questions whether mr bloomberg can build the necessary field operation in california or generate enough enthusiasm among base voters the billionaire governed new york for three terms as a republican and only registered as a democrat last year he was strongly supported by his gop predecessor rudolph giuliani now the democrats villain and has donated to republican candidates his stop and frisk policy as mayor angered democrats though he recently said he was wrong and apologized and then there s the mere fact of his wealth at a time when candidates like ms warren and mr sanders are railing against millionaires and billionaires i think it s very difficult for a candidate like bloomberg to set up a real ground organization in california mr south says you have to do it with democrat activists you can t do it with rent a maids and there s no reason for democratic activists to be interested in his candidacy the bloomberg campaign is well aware that history is not on its side when it comes to self funding campaigns overwhelmingly they lose admits marc lavorgna a spokesman for the campaign but he counters mr bloomberg is an outlier who has proved he can win again and again in the largest progressive city in the country in new york city and can govern extremely effectively with high marks from new yorkers who are frankly tough graders mr bloomberg s entry into the race less than a month ago precludes a run in the early states of iowa new hampshire nevada and south carolina instead his unorthodox strategy is to simultaneously and immediately run two parallel campaigns one is a primary effort that targets states in march and april where democratic competitors are not presently focused but which hold more than 65 of the delegates needed to win the nomination the other is a general election campaign in battleground states where president trump has had a free run says mr lavorgna unlimited resources allow the campaign to go head to head with president trump on digital advertising and to widely distribute mr bloomberg s story as an entrepreneur he made his money on the bloomberg terminal used by investors worldwide a mayor and a philanthropist his ads portray him as a doer who has won battles with the gun lobby coal and tobacco and who can beat president trump in his campaign talks he addresses his wealth head on saying he plows most of the profits from his business into his causes and was a self made man who grew up in a boston suburb where the most his dad ever earned was 6 000 in a year amid the focus on mr bloomberg s eye popping ad buys his spending paints a much broader picture his everytown for gun safety initiative has connected him with activists all over the country last year he spent extensively on electing house democrats and this cycle is putting up to 20 million into a voter registration drive primarily aimed at minority voters support for a mayoral training program at harvard university has graduated a nationwide network of mayors who know him including michael tubbs the progressive african american known for testing universal basic income in stockton california last week mayor tubbs endorsed mr bloomberg during a visit to the golden state in which the new yorker also talked with former gov jerry brown at a climate event in san francisco the popular former governor did not endorse him but the two launched a climate initiative together in 2017 analysts call mr bloomberg s unusual campaign a long shot that can only work if no clear front runner emerges before super tuesday which is march 3 clearly he is running in the moderate lane mr south believes he could end up as a power broker at the democratic convention perhaps with 200 or 300 delegates who could be deployed to prevent the nomination of liberals like senators warren or sanders get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox sherry bebitch jeffe another experienced observer of california and presidential politics is not closing the book on mr bloomberg normally i would say his strategy is risky it still may be she says but the four top leaders notably fellow moderates like mr biden and mr buttigieg could all emerge bloodied from the early states given his resources record on some core issues that democrats care about and his three wins in new york he ain t just walking precincts link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to the christian science monitor has
