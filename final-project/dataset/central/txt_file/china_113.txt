global emergency by the world health organization as the outbreak continues to spread outside china the main reason for this declaration is not what is happening in china but what is happening in other countries said who chief tedros adhanom ghebreyesus the concern is that it could spread to countries with weaker health systems meanwhile the us has told its citizens not to travel to china the state department issued a level four warning having previously urged americans to reconsider travel to china and said any citizens in china should consider departing using commercial means china has said it will send charter plans to bring back hubei province residents who are overseas as soon as possible a foreign ministry spokesman said this was because of the practical difficulties chinese citizens have faced abroad hubei is where the virus emerged at least 213 people in the china have died from the virus mostly in hubei with almost 10 000 cases nationally the who said there had been 98 cases in 18 other countries but no deaths most international cases are in people who had been to wuhan in hubei however in eight cases in germany japan vietnam and the united states patients were

conference in geneva dr tedros described the virus as an unprecedented outbreak that has been met with an unprecedented response he praised the extraordinary measures chinese authorities had taken and said there was no reason to limit trade or travel to china let me be clear this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in china he said but various countries have taken steps to close borders or cancel flights and companies like google ikea starbucks and tesla have closed their shops or stopped operations the us commerce secretary wilbur ross has said the outbreak could accelerate the return of jobs to north america what happens if this virus finds its way into a country that cannot cope many low and middle income countries simply lack the tools to spot or contain it the fear is it could spread uncontrollably and that it may go unnoticed for some time remember this is a disease which emerged only last month and yet there are already almost 10 000 confirmed cases in china the 2014 ebola outbreak in west africa the largest in human history showed how easily poorer countries can be overwhelmed by such outbreaks and if novel coronavirus gets a significant foothold in such places then it would be incredibly difficult to contain we are not at that stage yet 99 of cases are in china and the who is convinced the country can control the outbreak there but declaring a global emergency allows the who to support lower and middle income countries to strengthen their disease surveillance and prepare them for cases the who declares a public health emergency of international concern when there is an extraordinary event which is determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease it has previously declared five global public health emergencies a confirmed case in tibet means the virus has reached every region in mainland china according to the country s national health commission 9 692 cases have tested positive
