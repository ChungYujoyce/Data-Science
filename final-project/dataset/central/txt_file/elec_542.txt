hearing former vice president joe biden call an iowa farmer a damn liar the other day and then watching biden challenge that same 83 year old man to a pushup contest a foot raceand an iq test made me wonder what would it actually take to beat donald trump and which of the democratic candidates possesses that quality biden s style a poor man s jed bartletmeets bizarro popeye seems unlikely to succeed in 2020 according to democrats we already have an ill tempered gaffe prone elderly bully in the white house with a blind spot for his children why would they nominate someone so similar i subscribe rather to the extreme pendulum swing theory of presidential displacement wherein changing the party in power requires the total opposite of the current chief executive not in policy necessarily but in style and attitude in 1980 a feckless and besweatered jimmy carter gave way to the robust ronald reagan whose strong and confident approach offered a shot in the arm to a country that had been down on itself for over a decade in 1992 fuddy duddy throwback george h w bush lost to the cool and modern bill clinton a lifetime of service please this guy plays the saxophone on late night tv don t force racial diversity democrats december debate lineup could be all white but diversity isn t only about race in 2000 george w bush restored honor and dignity to the white house after eight years of personal scandal and drama the nation turned to a moral conservative family man as it punished al gore for bill clinton s numerous sins in 2008 the sales job was easy america wants its seat back at the cool kids table barack obama forms articulate and complete sentences shoots hoops hangs with celebritiesand sounds like he has all the answers sold and in 2016 a nation no longer concerned with experience bought donald trump s anti elite pitch as he railed against the elitist in the white house and the one opposing him with the country having lurched too far left too fast trump s job was easy so which 2020 democrats provide enough opposite magic there are three pete buttigieg amy klobucharand andrew yang for reasons already explored biden is too much of a bully and a blowhard to fit this theory elizabeth warren seems like an opposite on her face but is she for all the carping democrats do about trump making things up warren s penchant for whoppers makes her a future burger king franchisee and she lacks a contrasting optimism to boot warren s angrier about the personal hardships she made up than most people are about their real travails mike bloomberg septuagenarian new york city billionaire with an authoritarian streak who pisses people off on the regular a reboot with different hair and bernie sanders get off my lawn angry white man populism seems all too familiar but buttigieg klobucharand yang while not exactly the 27 yankees of american politics represent a near opposite choice and democrats often gravitate to and win with nerdy wonks according to one democratic strategist i trust in buttigieg you have a young ivy league educated navy veteran who speaks softly and offers a contrasting attitude regarding america s place in the world he enjoys middle america street cred while espousing big city liberal values his biggest similarity to trump st pete s confidence and ambition far outstrip his experience somewhere sen cory booker ofnew jersey is screaming crying into a pillow watching buttigieg s rise and i suppose stands ready to fill this slot should the mayor ofsouth bend indiana falter even whites can fight for black equality pete buttigieg s real black problem he has been convicted of white privilege klobuchar another midwesterner is a u s senator with real deal political experience her deliberate and understated style at least in public is the opposite of bombastic nominating a woman plays to the gaping gender gap that has opened on trump s job approval her most trump like trait could be in the way she treats staff in private if you believe the stories think hillary clinton without the 9 tons of baggage and condescension yang is a detail oriented asian american technocrat who as he often says likes math he s young and has worked in the modern economy as well as the nonprofit sector he appears to be having fun how novel while i find him to be trump s opposite in almost every way his one similarity comes in his instinct that impeachment is a loser for democrats if all that happens is all of the democrats are talking about impeachment that fails then it seems like there is no vision yang told the rolling stone magazine it seems like all we can do is throw ineffective rocks at donald trump and then it ends up leading unfortunately toward his reelection i still consider trump the favorite although his struggles with women and college educated whites are real political problems to ride the pendulum fully across america s political axis in 2020 and turn election day into opposite day
