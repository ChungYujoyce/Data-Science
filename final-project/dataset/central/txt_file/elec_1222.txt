their own leader is sanders 76 often seems to be the most powerful member of the minority but refuses to officially join the party to the consternation of many democrats obama remains popular but has repeatedly sent the signal that he wants to stay off the public stage to allow room for future party leaders to find their voice clinton is always in the news sometimes because of her own efforts but

camp and moscow mueller s investigation which now looks like it will last for some time will make it that much tougher for either party to get over the events of 2016 for some time view the discussion
