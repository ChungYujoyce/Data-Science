and millennials views the issue loading october 1 2016 donald trump s presidential campaign is suffused with nostalgia his slogan is make america great again after all many of his supporters yearn for a return to an unspecified era of prosperity and patriotism before what they see as today s suffocating political correctness but in bringing up the marital infidelities of hillary clinton s husband as mr trump and his surrogates are doing in the wake of his much panned performance in monday s debate the gop nominee may be indulging in a sort of nostalgia that is unlikely to benefit his white house bid in part that may be because the values of a number american voters are very different than the distant era of 1998 while such an appeal might resonate among his white male base women and millennial generation voters are particularly unlikely to be moved by trump s attempts to link mrs clinton with president bill clinton s affairs and impeachment says jennifer lawless director of the women and politics institute and a professor of government at american university for many women when trump talks about the subject of sex they ll hear the word gender they ll interpret trump s words as implicit criticism of clinton s decisions about her marriage at the time and as an effort to disparage a wife for the transgressions of the husband for millennials they ll hear about monica lewinsky and gennifer flowers and ken starr and tune out the youngest eligible voters today weren t even born when news broke that president clinton was having an affair with a young intern litigating old conflicts probably isn t a great way to sway millennial votes i don t think this is going to work like trump thinks it will says professor lawless it makes me feel like the last 20 years didn t happen on one hand it s a clear way of highlighting the old scandals or perceived scandals of the clinton years it suggests to voters they can expect the same again if they elect a second clinton to office and it might work for those who lived through that period and disliked it but many of today s voters women in particular may also think it suggests something more offensive says lawless that hillary clinton was not sufficient as a wife and this made mr clinton stray it s a suggestion to voters that maybe they need to look elsewhere like bill did says lawless for his part trump is treating references to mr clinton s infidelities as explosive material in an oblique reference at the end of monday s debate trump said that he had been going to say something extremely rough to clinton but had refrained because it was inappropriate since then has dropped a few direct references on thursday at a campaign rally in new hampshire at one point trump said an impeachment for lying referring to the attempt to remove mr clinton from office for lying about his affair with ms lewinsky remember that impeach the trump campaign has told surrogates to raise the issue more directly if asked about the ongoing dispute over alicia machado the former miss universe whom trump continues to disparage for having gained weight during her reign as pageant winner surrogates should pivot to the lewinsky scandal according to the trump campaign they should say mrs clinton bullied and smeared women who have accused mr clinton of sexual harassment according to trump campaign talking points obtained by nbc news in the past clinton has indeed lashed out at women who have charged her husband with misconduct in the early 1990s she dismissed ms flowers statement of an affair with mr clinton flowers was some failed cabaret singer mrs clinton said at the time in 1998 mr clinton acknowledged having sexual contact with flowers however the political problem for trump is that in 1998 the voters generally saw impeachment as being largely about sex not lying nor did they punish mrs clinton for defending her husband her favorability rating rose from 64 to 66 percent in polls at that time a personal best today initial indicators are that the issue might be particularly toxic with crucial female swing voters anti trump gop strategists tim miller and katie packer told nbc that they conducted focus groups on the subject before the republican primaries and concluded that voters were completely turned off and disgusted by it perhaps more telling is that many trump supporters are publicly saying that the gop nominee should refrain from raising this subject it s totally the wrong direction to go said trump backer and former house speaker newt gingrich who pushed for mr clinton s impeachment on thursday so what s trump up to it s possible that this attack is aimed at the one section of voters sure to find it attractive trump s base says brian rosenwald a political historian at the university of pennsylvania and author of a forthcoming book on the political impact of talk radio it could be meant to evoke not just the memory of impeachment but also the entire swirl of clinton drama that s an era many republicans do not remember fondly it reminds them of what they hate about the clintons says professor rosenwald or trump might think this could appeal to younger voters who are already anti clinton inclined they could view the lewinsky clinton encounter as an encounter that reflected a power imbalance between an older man and a younger woman they could see clinton s harsh words about her husband s accusers as victim shaming that might be more in keeping with the cultural values and experience of many millennials get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox but that assumes that the veer toward talking about scandal was premeditated that might not be the case it s possible that trump himself thrice married and someone who had an affair that ended his first marriage is just angry about the debate and responding in an emotional way the right candidate could probably bring it up and benefit at least on the margins but trump isn t that candidate says
