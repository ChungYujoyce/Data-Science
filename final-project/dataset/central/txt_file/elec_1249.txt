election if coronavirus concerns make in person voting untenable no one should have to risk catching a potentially deadly virus in order to exercise their right to vote they argue vote by mail had significant support before the pandemic proponents say it increases access to voting especially for vulnerable people who may struggle to make it to a polling place on election day recent evidence suggests vote by mail can provide a significant boost in voter turnout opponents of vote by mail including prominent republican lawmakers say it would open the door for rampant voter fraud though there s little evidence of that from current vote by mail states others say a national mandate requiring mail in ballots would undermine the principle that states should control their own election
