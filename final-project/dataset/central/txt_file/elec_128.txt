presidential candidate mitt romney and his wife ann wave from a campaign bus on friday at scamman farm in stratham n h republican presidential candidate mitt romney was in new hampshire on friday back at the farm where he launched his presidential campaign one year ago in the days ahead we ll be traveling on what are often called the backroads of america he said but i think our tour is going to take us along what i ll call the backbone of america it was the first stop on a five day bus tour that will take him to small towns the former massachusetts governor s campaign is calling it the every town counts tour even though rural communities appear solidly republican these days both presidential candidates are trying to win over voters there president obama isn t generally the type to wear a cowboy hat though he tried on one here in austin texas in 2007 but he s trying to reach out to rural voters as he campaigns for re election ben sklar getty images hide caption president obama isn t generally the type to wear a cowboy hat though he tried on one here in austin texas in 2007 but he s trying to reach out to rural voters as he campaigns for re election rural appeal romney and president obama are both let s be honest city slickers that s a big change for the american presidency says dee davis president of the center for rural strategies if it s ronald reagan on a horse or bill clinton the man from hope ark there s always been this kind of visual narrative or this story that to be president you had to be able to handle the wilderness be comfortable outside of the city it s just part of the lore he says you re not likely to see romney or obama in a cowboy hat very often but both men are trying to appeal to the folks who live in small towns traditionally republican strongholds it s been an extraordinary priority and the proof of that is the fact that the president established the rural council says agriculture secretary tom vilsack the rural council which vilsack runs is a group of cabinet members who meet to talk about policies aimed specifically at rural america this week the council put out a report documenting improvements in the agricultural economy president obama and gop presidential candidate mitt romney both seem more urban than rural but traditionally it s been important for presidents to be comfortable outside the city says dee davis president of the center for rural strategies here are a few snapshots of presidents down on the farm lyndon johnson looks over his prize hereford bull on his ranch in texas in 1960 ap hide

ranch rancho del cielo near santa barbara calif in 1976 in that report is the plan if you will for revitalizing the rural economy we haven t had a plan in the past we now do vilsack explains competing plans the administration s plan talks about increasing exports producing biofuels and giving low interest loans to small businesses in rural america exports are already way up over the past few years farmers are seeing record profits vilsack says that s a sign of obama administration success at helping rural america jim talent a former senator from missouri who now advises the romney campaign disagrees exports are up that s in part because of the weak dollar and i guess the administration can claim some credit for that i mean the dollar s weak because the economy s weak talent says over these five days romney will visit six swing states that went for obama four years ago but he ll focus on the small towns in those states that went republican last time in hopes of tipping the whole state into the red column this time talent says during this bus tour romney will lay out his ideas to help rural america more oil and natural gas drilling lower taxes and deficit reduction folks in rural america understand you can t borrow your way to prosperity and they know that for themselves and they know it for the federal government as well says talent getting redder during the primary season romney consistently underperformed in small towns republican rivals rick santorum and newt gingrich often beat him in those areas so romney has some work to do in rural america so does the president according to davis at the center for rural strategies in 2008 obama lost rural counties by a smaller margin than past democratic presidential candidates john kerry or al gore did obama tightened the race says davis he lost rural by about 7 percent in the swing states if he could do that again this time he would win in a walk but at this point rural looks pretty tough here s why davis says that in 2008 rural districts in congress were split about evenly between democrats and republicans but in 2010 a republican wave washed across those districts nationally republicans won 60 house seats in 2010 two thirds of those wins came from rural america so the small towns that romney is visiting these next five days are red and getting redder the republican candidate just needs to keep that momentum going obama has the more difficult task of moving the rural trend lines in the opposite direction npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
