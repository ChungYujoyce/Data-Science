news outlets noted that u s president donald trump had blamed his predecessor former president barack obama for leaving the trump administration with faulty covid 19 diagnostic tests even though the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic is the result of a virus not discovered until 2019 at the time the new coronavirus was first detected in the winter of 2019 obama had been out of office for just under three years the timeline prompted some to ask whether trump had really blamed obama for leaving him faulty tests for a disease that did not yet exist after covid 19 was first detected in the u s something of a scandal broke out surrounding the failure to provide and coordinate widespread testing for the virus this failure was the result of as the new york times reported technical flaws
