 sam sanders ally mutnick a few hours before the start of this week s democratic presidential debate in las vegas the tweets started to pour in yes chafee fans the hashtag for tonight is feelthechafe is this a hash tag for the nycmarathon or the democratic debate feelthechafe they all had the same strange hashtag feelthechafe a reference to the feelthebern bernie sanders supporters were using to rally around their candidate but it had a snarky twist for lincoln chafee the former rhode island governor and senator who s been so far a much less popular presidential candidate by the end of the night feelthechafe had gone from being a hashtag twitter assumed was made by chafee supporters to being one used to soundly ridicule the man when nobody seems to feelthechafe pic twitter com ra68xry7cq this one s for you lincoln chaffee demdebate feelthechafe pic twitter com 0lyqexvmoq anyone else feelthechafe pic twitter com 5ipcxcw1nk by the next day the hashtag had even made it to tv becoming part of a jimmy fallon riff on his late night show and a lot of people were asking the same question who in the world on chafee s team thought that hashtag was a good idea too bad chafee will get the breakout boost feelthechafe https t co un0f8bwjus here s the thing though from what we can tell it was not actually his team s idea at some point over the last few months the occasional chafee supporter began using feelthechafe seemingly positively how did it all change and perhaps an even better question how did it all start feelthechafe https t co jiaenrubdf well npr found the first person on twitter to actually use the hashtag feelthechafe when talking about the chafee campaign that tweet occurred on may 29 of this year from an account belonging to greg newburn npr reached out to newburn to see what inspired him here s a bit of our conversation npr it seems as if you were the first person on twitter to use the feelthechafe hashtag in relation to chafee s bid for president before that it was used when ladies were talking about working out in yoga pants and stuff so talk about that first tweet you did with the hashtag i think you posted it soon after chafee announced he was running do you recall that former rhode island gov lincoln chafee at the first democratic presidential debate tuesday john locher ap hide caption former rhode island gov lincoln chafee at the first democratic presidential debate tuesday newman yeah i do recall that if i recall correctly that was right around the time that the feelthebern hashtag was just taking off among some of bernie sanders most die hard and early supporters on twitter and i follow several of them so i was familiar with the feelthebern hashtag and when lincoln chafee announced someone tweeted it his announcement and it just sort of clicked it just made sense to me it was just some sort of throw away joke really do you like lincoln chafee oh i guess from what i know about him sure he doesn t seem like a bad guy but to tell you the truth i haven t thought too much about him one way or the other when you tweeted the hashtag for that first time was it meant to be a positive thing or a negative thing or just a funny thing yeah it was not negative nor positive i thought it was funny so i tweeted it who are you supporting for president i don t really have a candidate to be honest i like several of the republican candidates but not the dem candidates no i don t think i like any of the democratic candidates jim webb i guess a little bit i m a republican i ll probably vote republican have you been following the feelthechafe hashtag i was shocked at how many people have used it cause i didn t follow it like i said it was a joke and i tweeted it i m not even sure i saw anything about lincoln chafee between the time i tweeted that and then the debate the other night i don t think i saw him in the news even once i was surprised to see so many people using it i m just under the assumption that someone else independently came up with the same hashtag and it took off from there probably someone with considerably more followers than i have you ve seen what this hashtag has become it s kind of been used to ridicule this guy does that make you feel bad laughter i don t like it when anyone gets ridiculed i guess but he s a politician and he s in the public sphere so i assume he can handle this type of criticism and i m reasonably certain that whatever the intent it s probably in good fun it s probably in good faith if you were in a room with lincoln chafee and he was like oh hey you re the guy that did that hashtag what would you say to him well i guess it would depend on what his reaction to the hashtag is i would hope that he would understand that it was all in good fun and certainly not political in any meaningful way and then i would probably ask him if he supports sentencing reform newman is the florida state policy director of families against mandatory minimums and if he does i would say yay thank you if you could do it all over again and if you knew that your hashtag would take off so much would you have crafted that tweet differently no i would have written it the same way i think it s funny npr also reached out to the chafee campaign to see what it thought of the hashtag gone wrong team chafee confirmed it did not start the hashtag and did not know who did when we asked if it had been following feelthebern and how they felt about it we got this from campaign spokeswoman debbie rich governor chafee applauds any political involvement in general and the creative attention to his campaign in particular npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
