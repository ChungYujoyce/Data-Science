at least one third of the world is under some type of lockdown to slow the coronavirus apos spread that apos s because the covid 19 virus is insidious there apos s significant transmission by people not showing symptoms stephen morse an epidemiologist at columbia university told business insider according to anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease somewhere between 25 and 50 of people infected with the new coronavirus may never show symptoms or fall ill but can still transmit the illness to others robert redfield director of the centers for disease control and prevention gave npr a similar estimate on march 31 suggesting that asymptomatic carriers are contributing to the rapid spread of the coronavirus during a white house briefing on april 5 fauci cautioned that these percentages are just estimates and said there is disagreement even among his colleagues as to how many people are asymptomatic he added that antibody tests which can confirm whether a person has already had covid 19 are needed to answer that question in a scientifically sound way dr anthony fauci center speaks at a white house press conference on the coronavirus outbreak on february 29 2020 flanked by president donald trump and vice president mike pence andrew harnik ap we don apos t know all the unidentified cases out there morse said it apos s mostly sicker people in hospitals who are being tabulated the prevalence of asymptomatic transmission doesn apos t bode well for global containment efforts as bill gates recently wrote in the new england journal of medicine that means covid 19 will be much harder to contain than the middle east respiratory syndrome or severe acute respiratory syndrome sars which were spread much less efficiently and only by symptomatic people gates said a worker taking the temperature of a customer at the entrance of a walmart store in wuhan china on january 27 ap photo arek rata the first confirmation that the coronavirus can be transmitted by asymptomatic people came in february when a case study described a 20 year old woman from wuhan china who passed the coronavirus to five family members but never got physically sick herself a world health organization report about the coronavirus outbreak in china also published in february found few instances in which a person who tested positive never showed any symptoms instead most people who were asymptomatic on the date of their diagnosis a relatively small group went on to develop symptoms later the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare the report authors wrote in the who study 75 of people in china who were first classified as asymptomatic later developed symptoms propublica reported that means technically presymptomatic transmission is what apos s probably common other research has reaffirmed these findings a cdc study of coronavirus patients in a nursing home in king county washington found that of 23 people who tested positive only 10 showed symptoms on the day of their diagnosis ten people in the other group developed symptoms a week later these findings have important implications for infection control the authors wrote adding that many public health approaches rely on presence of signs and symptoms to identify and isolate residents or patients who might have covid 19 the cdc also evaluated coronavirus patients on the diamond princess cruise ship which was quarantined in japan in february of the 3 711 people on board 712 tested positive but almost half of them had no symptoms at the time a worker building a splash guard during a mass manufacturing operation on march 27 at the brooklyn navy yard to supply new york city with protective supplies ap photo john minchillo redfield told npr that infected people are likely shedding significant virus about 48 hours before symptoms appear this helps explain how rapidly this virus continues to spread across the country because we have asymptomatic transmitters and we have individuals who are transmitting 48 hours before they become symptomatic he added a handful of recent studies and reports suggest that presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission is not unusual an especially troubling aspect of presymptomatic transmission is that people seem to shed more coronavirus in the earlier stages of their infection but the average symptom onset takes five days research that examined 23 coronavirus patients in two hong kong hospitals found that people apos s viral load how many viral particles they were carrying and shedding into their environment peaked during the first week of symptom onset and then gradually declined a sars patient by contrast sheds the most virus seven days to 10 days after

among 94 patients people were most contagious right when symptoms started to show or just before a notable group of asymptomatic carriers could be children thus far children are among those least sickened by the coronavirus but some could be getting very mild infections and then spreading the virus research published march 25 in the journal the lancet looked at 36 children who tested positive for the coronavirus in three chinese hospitals half of those children had mild disease with no presenting symptoms the authors wrote another study published april 6 looked at more than 2 500 coronavirus cases among children younger than 18 in the us between the authors found that 73 of the patients in that age group had a fever cough or shortness of breath compared to 93 of adults the researchers concluded that children do not always have fever or cough as reported signs and symptoms of covid 19 a child at the ninoy aquino international airport in manila philippines on february 3 ezra acayan getty images yet another recent study which has yet to be peer reviewed found that 56 of 700 children infected with covid 19 in china had mild if any symptoms john williams an expert in pediatric infectious disease at the university of pittsburgh medical center told abc that asymptomatic infection is common in children occurring in 10 30 of cases on april 3 the cdc recommended that people in the us start wearing cloth masks when they go out in public even if they feel healthy the policy is different from the agency apos s guidelines during the early days of the coronavirus outbreak when cdc experts said they did not recommend the use of face masks for the general public the prevalence of presymptomatic transmission was a primary reason for the change doug hassebroek walks home from the grocery store wearing a protective mask during the outbreak of coronavirus in brooklyn new york march 25 2020 reuters caitlin ochs we have always recommended that symptomatic people wear a mask because if you apos re coughing if you have a fever if you apos re symptomatic you could transmit disease to other people surgeon general jerome adams said on april 3 he added we now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms this means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity for example coughing speaking or sneezing even if those people were not exhibiting symptoms face protection for the most part doesn apos t benefit the wearer instead masks primarily protect others from the wearer
