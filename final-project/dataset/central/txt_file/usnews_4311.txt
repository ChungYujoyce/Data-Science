some people thinkthe great depression which began in 1929 during the presidency of herbert hoover ended shortly after franklin d roosevelt replaced him in 1933 not so it went on and on and on and on as late as january 1941 the unemployment rate was still 10 5 that isuseful contextas we consider our current plunge into the abyss which has now consumed about one fifth of the u s labor force in seven shattering weeks i m not saying we re in for a 12 year rut like the one hoover and fdr encountered knock on wood but i am saying our recovery is unlikely to be as quick or dramatic as our leaders predict when it comes to what the future holds when the storm has passed i m reluctant to accept the word ofthose who ignored its approach in the first place and then when it was too late bungled the response we re supposed to have faith in them no thanks meanwhile here s something many of the blow dried tv pundits seem to have missed as bad as friday s jobs report was the data was for april s household survey which determines the unemployment rate was collected through april 18 it s not like the niagara of bad news miraculously ceased on that day it ll be reflected in the may unemployment report which comes out june 5 here s a preview an additional 2 5 million americans probably lost their jobs in the week that ended may 9 according toa survey by the analytical firm trading economics president donald trump has said we re in for a spectacular 2021 his top economic adviser larry kudlow used the same adjective in an interview with cnn s jake tapper i don t blame them for predictions of a rapid recovery what do you expect politicians to say in an election year with their necks on the line that we re in for a long painful slog that it ll take years to dig out of this hole and that the economic suffering may be for many unbearable and yet consider some realities that existed even before any of us had heard of the coronavirus last year the federal reserve estimated that 39 adults would find an unexpected 400 expense say for a car repair or medical bill a hardship twoout of five adults the fed estimates that 12 of adults would be unable to pay the expense by any means the fed also estimated again long before the coronavirus hit that39 of adults expected to skip essential payments like rent mortgage or their water gas or electric bills similar numbers said they d skip things like phone bills how can you look for a job if your electricity or phone gets cut off false choice protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy we can have both it s sad data like this that has swept away the illusion we were fed as recently as february 2019 b c before coronavirus that americans never had it so good in fact as recently as two weeks ago the president was still telling us that we used to have the greatest economy the world has ever seen but it s a flimsy claim since the end of world war ii there have been numerousperiods when the u s economy grew faster often far faster than what trump would have you think the political hyperbole that americans have been subjected to over the past few years has obscured the fact that things really weren t that great to begin with we heard about jobs jobs jobs yet the reality is that post recession job growth has been slowing down since 2015 and many of those jobs appear to payshockingly little a brookings institution study found that 53 million americans between the ages of 18 to 64 accounting for 44 of all workers qualify as low wage their median hourly wages are 10 22 and median annual earnings are about 18 000 that meanshalf make even less blueprint from us chamber of commerce president this is how we reopen america given that we re talking about 44 of thegargantuan u s labor force it sreasonable to say that this isn t so much a trump problem as it is a long term slidecovering both republican and democratic presidents and republican and democratic dominated congresses neither party has been able to stop it stimulus checks are going out to tens of millions of americans a helpful gesture but when so many of them were living paycheck to paycheck to begin with and those paychecks are now gone a few hundred or thousand dollars is like tossing a morsel of food to a hungry elephant it isn t much in the grand scheme of things what would really be helpful how about actually addressing those underlying problems that long term slide that pushed so many of our citizens to the edge in the first place paul brandus founder andwhite housebureau chief ofwest wing reports is the author ofunder this roof the white house and the presidency and a member of usa today s board of contributors follow him on twitter westwingreport
