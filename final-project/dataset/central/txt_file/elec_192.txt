indication of a difficult road ahead for the gop in this year s midterms the president made the argument that his supporters in what both he and political observers are calling trump country should vote for republicans this year in order to prevent the top democrat in the house minority leader nancy pelosi d calif from regaining the speaker s gavel and possibly seeking to impeach him and to drive home the point about impeachment should democrats take control of the house trump also targeted rep maxine waters d calif a frequent and outspoken critic who has been calling for the president s

tout his recently enacted tariffs steel is back and aluminum is back trump said on north korea trump used his familiar refrain of let s see what happens just days after it was announced that he intends to meet directly with kim jong un in the hopes of achieving the permanent denuclearization of the rogue regime this should ve been handled by the way over the last 30 years not now trump also said of north korea but that s ok he added because that s what we do we handle things trump faulted his predecessors in the oval office beginning with president obama and going back to presidents george w bush and bill clinton for failing to rid north korea of its nuclear capabilities trump talked up the economy since his election he mentioned the latest monthly jobs report overall job gains since election day in 2016 milestones in black and hispanic unemployment achieved since he took office stock market gains and the gop tax cuts enacted late last year he rehashed his frequent criticism

predecessors all the way back to president ronald reagan who held office for most of the 1980s for what he sees as the current unfairness in the country s trade relations with much of the rest of the world in one of the rally s more surreal moments the president actually provided the crowd with an extended nearly two minute impression of being presidential that mocked the more straight laced style of previous presidents and suggested that trump s looser style is more entertaining president trump leaves after speaking to supporters at saturday in moon township penn jeff swensen getty images hide caption president trump leaves after speaking to supporters at saturday in moon township penn trump also made his trademark attacks on the media in a rhetorical sleight of hand the president told the crowd at the beginning of the rally that washington d c had a lot of evil a lot of bad people a lot of fake media trump once again singled out cnn msnbc and nbc for what he views as their biased coverage of him and their poor ratings he specifically mentioned media mogul oprah winfrey and suggested he couldn t wait for her to run for president so he could beat her and he called meet the press anchor chuck todd sleepy eyes and referred to todd as sleeping before piling on a vulgar insult to refer to the seasoned d c journalist trump s speech saturday drew a quick response from the congressional black caucus a group of african american lawmakers that is increasingly becoming an outspoken antagonist of the president and his administration on twitter the group came to the defense of one of its own rep waters and demanded an apology from trump for his low i q remark realdonaldtrump we re not surprised that you re using womenshistorymonth to continue your attacks on women we demand an apology that we know you re not smart enough or strong enough to give after all you couldn t even bring yourself to apologize to a military widow https t co 2hex33hm0l and david axelrod a onetime top aide to president obama had a broader critique that suggested trump s recent policy moves had been all about politics during what is looking like a tough midterm year for republicans trump s recently announced tariffs were calculated and certainly timed so he could make this protectionist pitch from this platform in steel country on the eve of a politically important house race axelrod wrote on twitter if you had any doubts this spectacle certainly should resolve them potus s hasty sloppy advance of tariffs were calculated and certainly timed so he could make this protectionist pitch from this platform in steel country on the eve of a politically important house race lamb s response to the 75 minute event was muted let s win this the democrat said on twitter just as the trump saccone rally wrapped up saccone spoke briefly as the rally ended after trump introduced him saying that saccone is a really good person who needs to come to washington to prevent democrats from rolling back the gop tax cuts limiting second amendment rights and thwarting trump s push for increased military spending i came tonight because this guy is special the president also said of saccone rick is going to vote for us all the time trump also said ahead of tuesday s election emphasizing again that a democrat like lamb could not be trusted to back trump s agenda fully but the more important message of the night might be the one trump delivered earlier in his remarks a message as much about himself and seeking re election in 2020 as about the 2018 midterms the task for everyone here tonight is to make sure that this great american comeback continues full speed ahead npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
