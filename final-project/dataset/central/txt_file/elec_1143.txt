voting or change votes however we remain watchful of any malicious activities from cybercriminals and from foreign actorslike russia china andiran the states autonomy over elections makes our elections more resilient the diversity of election systems among the states multiple checks and redundancies in those systems and post election auditing all make it extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to disrupt or change vote tallies states have plans in place like provisional ballots to enable a reliable election to proceed in the case that interference does occur while the states have primary responsibility for administering elections under our constitution our agencies continue to provide them with support by identifying best practices for voting systems sharing threat informationand offering services and resources several of our agencies are working directly with campaigns and candidates to educate them about ways to help keep their networks secure we are mobilized and working with states to identify cybersecurity threats to their own systems and to campaigns and we are better able to warn them about threats today than ever before you can play an important role

a track record of meddling in our affairs by attempting to shape public opinion and voter perceptions foreign actors have done this by hacking and dumping private campaign and candidate information on the internetand spreading disinformation and divisive messages on social media often we see foreign adversaries amplifying messages some americans create and share with each other in an effort to stoke hostility among us and make us appear more divided than we are they seek to undermine our trust and confidence in each other our democratic societyand democracy itself to combat this threat we continue to strengthen partnerships with technology and social media companies and share more information than ever before those companies are taking more responsibility for preventing foreign adversaries from weaponizing their platforms additionally we must remain aware that foreign adversaries continue to spread disinformation to discredit politicians and views that are counter to their interests and ambitions we cannot prevent all disinformation foreign propagandaor cyberattacks on our infrastructure however together we can all help to mitigate these threats by exercising care when
