 looking ahead to the november general election leading illinois republicans thought they had a marketable message to voters by pointing to myriad federal investigations that have ensnared democrats at the city suburban and state level but republican president donald trump s decision tuesday to commute former democratic gov rod blagojevich s prison sentence on federal corruption charges may have short circuited the gop s strategy voters in a state with a rich history of corruption can rightfully ask republicans how dedicated they are toward cleaning up government in illinois when their president who vowed to clean the swamp of government freed a former governor who attempted to shake down a children s hospital for campaign funds and tried to sell president barack obama s u s senate seat it s discouraging for people in the state of illinois to see this happen and that a disgraced former governor who is corrupt to the core is walking out of the federal prison based on a gift from the president said illinois house republican leader jim durkin of western springs there are i think more deserving inmates in the federal bureau of prisons who are serving lengthy sentences for crimes that were i think not as harmful as what gov blagojevich did who are never going to receive one bit of consideration from this president said durkin a former prosecutor who played a lead role in blagojevich s impeachment republicans knew they had their work cut out for them after what the party s state chairman tim schneider acknowledged was a rough year in 2018 the gop lost the governorship and all other statewide offices saw democrats expand their stranglehold in the general assembly and pick up two traditionally gop u s house seats with illinois a solidly blue state in presidential elections due to democratic turnout in chicago and demographic changes that have eroded the longtime gop leanings of the suburban collar counties there was little for trump to gain politically in freeing blagojevich something the state s underdog republicans realized blagojevich is the face of public corruption in illinois and not once has he shown any remorse for his clear and documented record of egregious crimes that undermined the trust placed in him by voters said a statement released by the five republicans in the state s congressional delegation who had previously urged trump not to pardon blagojevich or commute his sentence as our state continues to grapple with political corruption we shouldn t let those who breached the public trust off the hook history will not judge rod blagojevich well said the statement signed by u s reps darin lahood of peoria john shimkus of collinsville rodney davis of taylorville mike bost of murphysboro and adam kinzinger of channahon after the dismal 2018 election republicans had hoped to capitalize on the federal corruption investigations that have ensnared some of the state s most powerful democrats sign up for the spin to get

target house speaker michael madigan as part of an investigation into the lobbying practices of comed and its parent company exelon federal authorities have raided the downstate home of powerful former lobbyist mike mcclain a top springfield insider and one of madigan s closest friends it all has made for a potent tableau for republicans to paint their anti corruption strategy to attract voters until trump s decision to let blagojevich out of prison i think it doesn t help the argument said illinois senate republican leader bill brady of bloomington we here in illinois had to live through the tragedy of what rod blagojevich did and we better understand the hurt and the damage he did to our reputation he said that is why uniformly you saw us say that if the judicial system thought that 14 years was the right amount of prison time then that s the right amount brady said he believed most voters would consider trump s commutation of blagojevich s prison time as a matter of compassion rather than a reflection of the president s views of the crimes the former governor committed but trump has defended blagojevich s actions saying last august that blagojevich was behind bars over a phone call where nothing happens he added blagojevich shouldn t have said what he said but it was braggadocio and on wednesday trump issued a tweet that included a major falsehood rod blagojevich did not sell the senate seat he served 8 years in prison with many remaining he paid a big price there is a lot riding on the gop message in illinois in addition to looking to elect more republicans in november the party is looking to use the corruption angle to fight democratic gov j b pritzker s signature agenda item voter approval of a change in the state s constitution to impose a graduated rate income tax to replace the currently mandated flat rate income tax their argument is that in the midst of federal investigations democrats cannot be trusted with a move that would give the state an additional 3 6 billion in annual revenue pritzker is cognizant to the threat the corruption argument by republicans brings to voter consideration of the proposed amendment and has been using an anti corruption theme of his own on thursday he noted that more than a decade after blagojevich s impeachment we still have politicians in this state who are on the take we ve got to get rid of them we ve got to make sure we find them out we ve got to make sure they get prosecuted democrats for the most part want nothing to do with a blagojevich return to illinois many including pritzker and mayor lori lightfoot supported blagojevich s continued incarceration scheduled through march 2024 but pritzker has a trump connection that won t go away secret government wiretaps that were part of the federal investigation of blagojevich that were obtained by the tribune in the months leading up to pritzker s november 2018 victory in a nov 14 2008 conversation between the two discussing an obama senate replacement pritzker called secretary of state jesse white the least offensive among candidates for the job speaking about other options pritzker referred to then state senate president emil jones as crass and then u s rep jesse jackson jr as a nightmare following the release of the conversation by the tribune in february 2018 pritzker then a candidate for governor issued an apology to the african american community and said on that call i was not my best self i can be better i have been better and i can do better and i have on thursday pritzker was again compelled to address the issue there were hundreds of people who were recorded to be clear and let s also make sure we all understand that what happened more than 10 years ago has nothing to do with where we are today in this state he said upon his release blagojevich dubbed himself a trumpocrat but brady the senate republican leader says his party wants nothing to do with him either he maintained ongoing news stemming from the federal investigations may overtake any need to address trump s commutation of blagojevich s sentence i think that the prevailing issues involving illegal activities will persist as these democrats continue to go through the court system brady said durkin said he thinks voters will continue to ask questions about trump and blagojevich especially as the ever loquacious blagojevich seeks public forums to voice his criticism of federal prosecutors while still proclaiming his innocence when the republican president of the united states says you know what you don t have to pay your debt to society on a case that deals with public corruption people in illinois are obviously going to be confused durkin said i also think they re going to take the position that why didn t you take this more seriously mr president he said public corruption is something that has cast a long shadow upon state government and to me considering the environment that we re in it minimizes what should be a strong statement coming out of the administration about where it stands on issues of corrupt officials rap30 aol com
