president of the chicago police board headed the police department office of professional standards and the city s police accountability task force both the police board and office of professional standards have faced criticism some say the oversight agencieswerefeckless organizations that rarely took action against chicago police officers for misconduct there is genuine confusion in this moment of what it means to be progressive said emma tai executive director of the group united working families we re in this moment when most of the candidates regardless of the past positions they ve taken or work that they ve done were running as far from rahm emanuel s record as they could that s not the same thing as being progressive lightfoot hammered preckwinkle 72 who is also the cook

said that she wouldreturn 116 000 in political donations she collected at a fundraiser at burke s home last year both lightfoot and preckwinkle acknowledged that a victory by either of them would mark a historic moment for african american women but neither dwelled on it during the campaign for a while i may be disappointed preckwinkle said in her concession speech i am not disheartened for one
