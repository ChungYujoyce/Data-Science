numbers facts and trends shaping your world americans say there has been a decline in public trust in the federal government and in each other and they believe this erosion of confidence makes it harder to solve some of the nation s pressing problems according to a pew research center survey conducted in late 2018 but one finding from the study may offer some hope as the country confronts the new coronavirus three quarters of americans said people would cooperate with each other in a crisis even if they didn t trust each other around a quarter 24 said people wouldn t cooperate in a crisis if they didn t trust each other cooperating in a time of a crisis has taken on new urgency as federal state and local government leaders urge americans to stay at home practice social distancing and take other steps to prevent the spread of covid 19 it s important to note that respondents to the 2018 survey may have been focusing more on how americans might actively assist those in need during a crisis rather than steering clear of others to avoid spreading a virus as the united states copes with the public health and economic fallout of the coronavirus we revisited the findings of a late 2018 pew research center survey about americans and trust the survey was conducted nov 27 dec 10 2018 among 10 618 u s adults everyone who took part is a member of the center s american trends panel an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses recruiting our panelists by phone or mail ensures that nearly all u s adults have a chance of selection this gives us confidence that any sample can represent the whole population see our methods 101 explainer on random sampling to further ensure that each survey reflects a balanced cross section of the nation the data is weighted to match the u s adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories here are the questions asked in this survey along with responses and its methodology the survey found no partisan differences when it comes to how the public expects americans might behave in a crisis around three quarters of republicans and gop leaning independents 76 as well as democrats and democratic leaners 75 said people would cooperate with each other even if they didn t trust each other by contrast partisans were divided on many other questions related to public trust including the confidence they place in key institutions and societal actors from presidential appointees and career government officials to journalists the trust that majorities of americans said they have each other in times of crisis generally held true across demographic groups but there were some differences by income and education level race and ethnicity and age for example 81 of those in households earning 75 000 a year or more said people would cooperate with each other in a crisis compared with around two thirds 68 of those in households earning less than 30 000 a year white adults 78 were more likely than black 67 and hispanic 69 adults to say people would cooperate with each in other in a time of crisis and while eight in ten americans ages 65 and older said people would cooperate with each other in a crisis a slightly smaller share 71 of those ages 18 to 29 said this this reflects a broader pattern of young adults expressing less trust than their elders in other people and key institutions the survey also found divisions based on people s overall levels of interpersonal trust that is whether people are high trusters 22 of all u s adults medium trusters 41 of adults or low trusters 35 of the public among those classified in the study as high trusters 85 said people would cooperate with one another in a time of crisis even if they didn t trust each other the share fell to 78 among those classified as medium trusters and 65 among those deemed low trusters you can read more here about how respondents were placed in one of these trust groups note here are the questions asked in this survey along with responses and its methodology 1615 l st nw suite 800washington dc 20036usa 1 202 419 4300 main 1 202 857 8562 fax 1 202 419 4372 media inquiries about pew research center pew research center is a nonpartisan fact tank that informs the public about the issues attitudes and trends shaping the world it conducts public opinion polling demographic research media content analysis and other empirical social science research pew research center does not take policy positions it is a subsidiary of the pew charitable trusts if you have been invited to participate in one of our surveys please click here to complete the subscription process please click the link in the email we just sent you
