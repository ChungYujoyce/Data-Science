 megyn kelly and charles krauthammer fox news conservative commentator charles krauthammer said after thursday night apos s fox news republican debate thatformer florida gov jeb bush r might have come away a big winner speaking withfox moderator megyn kelly shortly after the debate ended krauthammer said the former florida governor turned in a strong performance possibly the best of the night out of all the candidates on stage i thought it was interestingly the best night that jeb had in all of the debates krauthammer said and i might even say i think he might have had the best night of the group in this debate krauthammer highlighted one momentwith presidential rival and sen marco rubio r florida he was very strong he had one moment where he kind of flipped back to marco rubio on the question of immigration he said krauthammer was referring to a back and forth between bush and rubio on supporting a path to citizenship onfor immigrants living in the country illegally rubio said that bush used to support a path to citizenship to which bush said so did you bush then continued i think it apos s important for people in elected office to try to force consensus to solve problems there apos s never going to be a perfect bill you shouldn apos t cut and run you should stick with it he cut and run he was referring to the 2013 immigration bill that rubio co sponsored what i found ironic here is it was kind of a reversal of that moment in one of the earlier debates when there was a tangle between rubio and bush and rubio turned it very strongly against bush krauthammer said so i thought this was one debate where bush did very well
