the possibility of a pandemic is a challenge donald trump is unqualified to handle as president i remember how trump sought to stoke fear and stigma during the 2014 ebola epidemic he called president barack obama a dope and incompetent and railed against the evidence based response our administration put in place which quelled the crisisand saved hundreds of thousands of lives in favor of reactionary travel bans that would only have made things worse he advocated abandoning exposed and infected american citizens rather than bringing them home for treatment trump s demonstrated failures of judgmentand his repeated rejection of sciencemake him the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health challenge the outbreak of a new coronavirus which has already infected more than 2 700 people and killed over 80in china willget worse before it gets better cases have been confirmed in a dozencountries with at least fivein the united states there will likely be more the state department has scheduled an evacuation flight and advised americans againsttraveling to hubei province the epicenter of the outbreak and isevacuating non essentialpersonnel trump has blithely tweetedthat it will all work out well yet the steps he has taken as president have only weakened our capacity to respond trump has rolled back much of the progress president obama and i made to strengthen global health security he proposed draconian cuts to the national institutes of health nih the centers for disease control and prevention cdc and the agency for international development the very agencies we need to fight this outbreak and prevent future ones he dismissed the top white house official in charge of global health security anddismantled the entireteam and he has treated with utmost contempt institutions that facilitate international cooperation thus undermining the global efforts that keep us safe from pandemics and biological attacks to be blunt i am concerned that the trump administration s shortsighted policies have left us unprepared for a dangerous epidemic thatwill comesooner or later pandemic diseases are a prime example of why international cooperation is a requirement of leadership in 2020 diseases do not stop at borders they cannot be thwarted by building a wall we cannot keep ourselves safe without helping to keep others safe as welland without enlisting the help of other nations in return and here s the truth the united states must step forward to lead these efforts because no other nation has the resources the reachor the relationships to marshal an effective international response cruel and unusual trump tweeted heartlessly about ebola in 2014 he s ill equipped to handle 2019 outbreak that s how we broke the infection curve on ebola in september2014 cdc projections warned that over 1 million people could be infected if we failed to act by february 2015 thanks to the leadership of our administration the number of new ebola cases wasfewer than 400 a few months later the epidemic was essentially extinguished we brought the world together behind a response that only the united states could mobilize including dispatching our military on a limited mission to help build the urgent infrastructure necessary to coordinate a massive global public health response deploying american disaster assistance response teams to africa unleashing the nihto help spur the discovery of new treatments and vaccines protecting our citizens from potential cases of ebola in the usa andharnessing civilian expertise from the cdc at home and abroad we acted over the chorus of uninformed objections from critics like donald trump and more than 60 countries followed our lead contributing over 2 billion thousands of health professionals and personnel and other critical resources like personal protective equipment just as important we strengthened our focus on preparing for the next crisis that s the kind of leadership a moment like this demands a leadership trump could never deliver unintended consequences measles outbreak drains resources we may need for a future epidemic or bioterrorist attack as president i will reassert u s leadership in global health security my policies will always uphold science not fiction or fearmongering i will ask congress to beef up the public health emergency fundand give me the power to use the stafford disaster relief and emergency assistance actto declare a disaster if an infectious disease threat merits it i will also renew funding set to expire in may for the nationwide network of hospitals that can isolate and treat people with infectious diseases and fully fund the global health security agendaso the world is ready for the next outbreak and i will rebuild public trust make sure we havededicated resourcesto help us respond to crises quickly and better harness the capabilities of the private sector to protect the american people our national security requires nothing less
