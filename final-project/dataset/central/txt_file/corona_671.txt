though it may now be difficult to imagine at some point this crisis will end whether when a vaccine for the novel coronavirus is released or heaven help us well before then new infections will slow and life will move back toward normal then it will be time to sue each other salus populi suprema lex esto wrote the roman jurist cicero the health or welfare or common good of the people should be the supreme law but in the united states our literal supreme law is the constitution and the public health measures taken to curb the spread of covid 19 are running into constitutional rights questions at every turn here are some of the cases that coronavirus could conceivably send to the supreme court first amendment cases the first amendment protects our freedoms of religion speech press assembly and petition and at least two of those could easily be the subject of post pandemic lawsuits the most obvious candidate is assembly as a growing number of cities and states have issued some version of a stay at home order putting police power behind the federal recommendation against gatherings of 10 or more cases whose appeal potentially could go all the way to the top are already happening in new jersey parents who hosted a party of several dozen people were charged with child endangerment and in new mexico the president of the albuquerque tea party has filed suit in federal court against gov michelle lujan grisham d alleging her shelter in place order violates his right to free assembly and worship by prohibiting social and religious gatherings the question for the supreme court would be whether that claim is correct whether the state interest behind the shelter in place order is compelling enough to override first amendment guarantees that brings us to the other probable type of first amendment case which would concern limits on free exercise of religion while most churches and other places of worship have suspended in person services some including a few megachurches which host crowds of thousands have refused to close their doors one recent survey of regular churchgoers found one in 10 reporting their churches are open a florida pastor was arrested monday for continuing live services and slapped with misdemeanor charges of unlawful assembly and violation of a public health emergency order if convicted he could be jailed for up to 60 days it looks like we re going to have to go to court over this because the church is encroached from every side the pastor said in a video on facebook if the assembly restrictions specifically targeted religious gatherings he d have a strong case as it is they re content neutral and will likely survive court challenge absent some novel argument second amendment cases guns and ammo ranked almost as high as toilet paper on some americans prep lists but firearms sales were suspended in los angeles new jersey pennsylvania and washington state new orleans has an emergency proclamation which would permit the mayor to close gun shops though that hasn t happened yet pennsylvania s governor let gun sales resume at the urging of justices from the state s supreme court and new jersey s governor did the same monday following multiple suits from gun rights groups other legal challenges are underway and could ultimately ask scotus to settle whether the second amendment makes weapons sales an essential service fourth amendment cases civil libertarians like me have warned about lasting curtailment of personal freedoms stemming from the pandemic response and the fourth amendment s guarantee of privacy is among the rights at risk officials are using cellphone location data to track population movement and as my colleague navneet alang has noted that s unlikely to be the only privacy violation proposed as a means of fighting the pandemic measures implemented in israel china and south korea include facial recognition software cctv monitoring tracking of credit card purchases and more if governments in america attempt something similar expect lawsuits the aclu is already on alert even scrutinizing online learning apps which could violate students privacy the court here would be tasked with considering whether such encroachments on privacy breach the fourth amendment s mandate of specific warrants authorizing searches of our persons houses papers and effects and if so whether the state interest in public health permits that breach trial rights cases the trump administration s push to effectively suspend habeas corpus seems to have been stymied by congressional democrats but other violations of the fifth sixth seventh and eighth amendments which protect our trial rights are possible court closures could run afoul of the right to a speedy trial pennsylvania s top court for example has declared a statewide judicial emergency through mid april and the justice department s interest in video hearings raises questions about whether a video conference can be considered a public trial suspension of jury trials is a potential battle here too in each scenario the supreme court would consider whether modifications to constitutionally determined trial procedure were justified by the state interest in limiting the spread of infection meanwhile the risk of pandemic within jail and prison facilities has drawn attention to longstanding criminal justice reform issues including needless pre trial detention and inhumane conditions with insufficient medical care or hygiene products emergency policy changes most notably large scale release of pre trial detainees who were held only because they couldn t afford bail might fuel court challenges to the pre pandemic status quo abortion cases alabama iowa ohio oklahoma and texas all attempted to include abortion in the medical procedures temporarily suspended to conserve resources for treatment of covid 19 federal judges have blocked the order in alabama ohio and texas and legal fights are ongoing in the other two states the supreme court has spoken clearly wrote u s district judge lee yeakel a george w bush appointee in the decision against texas there can be no outright ban on such a procedure this court will not speculate on whether the supreme court included a silent except in a national emergency clause the supreme court however might be interested in verbalizing such a clause and texas is trying to give it the chance police power cases this final class of cases may be the broadest police power in the words of american legal theorist thomas cooley means the government s system of internal regulation by which it is sought not only to preserve the public order and to prevent offenses against the state but also to establish for the intercourse of citizen with citizen those rules of good manners and good neighborhood which are calculated to prevent a conflict of rights and to insure to each the uninterrupted enjoyment of his own so far as is reasonably consistent with a like enjoyment of rights by others more plainly it s the power to police the public for the public good in our country per the 10th amendment it primarily belongs to the states not the federal government this is why president trump s talk about opening up the country by easter was always meaningless it s why new york gov andrew cuomo d reacted so vehemently to trump s suggestion of a federal quarantine of the north atlantic region calling it a declaration of war on states the regulation of the health and safety of individuals is primarily and historically a matter of local concern the supreme court has held a quartet of lawyers explain at the lawfare blog a wealth of scotus precedent says neither the president nor congress can directly require states and cities to call off their shelter in place orders or to reopen schools and businesses two types of lawsuits could happen here one would see a state or group of states suing the federal government should trump try to commandeer police power for washington the other would be a public challenge to a state s use of its police power perhaps specifically to the manner of police enforcement a crowd dispersal turned violent for example or coming full circle back to the first amendment cases to the assembly ban itself police power is not unlimited and the supreme court could be asked to judge whether state governments have claimed too much authority in their covid 19 responses the supreme court has postponed its next round of oral arguments due to the novel coronavirus a rarity in scotus history and it is unclear how the court will proceed as isolation orders lengthen whatever the justices decide though this pandemic may well give them a very full docket the constitutional immune system kicks in is qanon the newest american religion the president who can only live in the moment trump shares disturbing meme of biden s campaign in a coffin obama administration economist predicts best jobs and growth numbers ever ahead of the election trump keeps falsely accusing joe scarborough of murder and it s long past weird
