democratic presidential contenders went after three targets on the second night of this week s 2020 democratic debates former vice president joe biden vermont sen bernie sanders and president donald trump as the frontrunner biden faced tough questions including a brutal back and forth over his recent comments about working well with segregationist senators and his past opposition to busing plans used to desegregate public schools from california sen kamala harris i do not believe you are a racist harris said and i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground but i also believe and it is personal and i was actually very it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country and it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing sanders meantime was pressed over his self description as a socialist including a question on whether his proposals like medicare for all would lead to higher taxes on the middle class every proposal that i have brought forth is fully paid for he said arguing that insurance premiums would be lower under his proposal yes they will pay more in taxes but less in health care for what they get and several candidates took the opportunity to hit trump directly over his 2017 tax cuts tariffs he s levied as president and poor conditions at migrant detention centers along with biden snaders and harris the second night also featured california sen kamala harris new york sen kirsten gillibrand south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg self help author marianne williamson former colorado gov john hickenlooper entrepreneur andrew yang colorado sen michael bennet and california rep eric swalwell read more think you can name every democratic candidate for president prove it here s a look at the highlights from the second night of the 2020 democratic debate harris and biden had an intense exchange when the conversation turned to race as harris went after biden for working with segregationists and opposing forced busing to integrate public schools biden s record on civil rights has come up in the weeks leading up to the debate harris said she didn t think biden was a racist but directly addressed his prior work with segregationists and talked about how integration efforts affected her personally i do not believe you are a racist and i agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground but it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on segregation of race in this country it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose busing she added and there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public school and she was bused to school every day and that little girl was me so i will tell you that on this subject it cannot be an intellectual debate among democrats in response biden called harris s comments a mischaracterization of my position across the board and disputed her account i did not praise racists that is not true he said in terms of busing you would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council harris then directly asked biden do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in america he answered i did not oppose busing in america i opposed busing by the department of education harris replied but that is where the federal government must step in read more here s what to know about biden s history with busing swalwell 38 took an opportunity to point out the generational differences on the debate stage revealing the knife twist slowly i was six years old when a presidential candidate came to the california democratic convention and said it s time to pass the torch to a new generation of americans he said that candidate was then senator joe biden joe biden was right when he said it was time the pass the torch to a new generation of americans 32 years ago moderators gave biden 76 a chance to respond i m still holding on to that torch he said sanders 77 jumped in to give what seemed at first like a defense of biden but quickly went in another direction as part of joe s generation he said before getting cut off the issue he said is not generational the issue is who has the guts to take on wall street to take on the fossil fuel industry to take on the big money interest who have unbelievable influence over the economic and political life of this country sanders added swalwell didn t let the moment go either talking about climate change later in the debate he returned to it here s a solution pass the torch pass the torch to the generation that s going to feel the effects of climate change hickenlooper who was booed at a california event for criticizing socialism was undeterred he argued that while he agreed with the goals of the green new deal he didn t understand why it included a job guarantee and that while health care is a right he did not support programs like medicare for all that would abolish private insurance the bottom line is if we don t clearly define that we are not socialists the republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists he said later in the debate he elaborated if we turn towards socialism we run the risk of helping to reelect the worst president in american history sanders defended himself on the charge that being labeled as socialists could cost democrats the election i think the responses at the polls last poll i saw had us 10 points ahead of donald trump because the american people understand that trump is a phony that trump is a pathological liar and a racist and then he lied to the american people during his campaign he said the candidates onstage for the second debate night attacked trump directly marking a possible inflection point in the primary for many of the contenders who have largely avoided fighting with trump so far donald trump were the first words out of biden s mouth on the debate stage in response to a question about systemic change to the economy biden has been one of the only candidates going after trump so far but thursday night that changed multiple candidates including biden harris and sanders criticized trump for his tax bill and the economy those three and most of the others onstage including gillibrand williamson and bennet spoke harshly about trump and his administration separating migrant families at the border the president has turned the border of the united states into a symbol of nativist hostility said bennet hickenlooper went further if you had ever told me any time in my life that this country would sanction federal agents to take children from the arms of their parents put them in cages actually put them up for adoption in colorado we call that kidnapping he said williamson agreed calling the separations kidnapping and collective child abuse if your government does it that doesn t make it less of a crime she said these are state sponsored crimes later in the debate the candidates were asked which country they would try to repair u s relations with first as president buttigieg ducked the question by attacking trump hard we have no idea which of our important allies he will have pissed off worst between now and then he said when asked if their health care plan would cover undocumented immigrants all of the candidates raised their hands although a few of the candidates including biden seemed to be a bit hesitant others including gillibrand and sanders shot their hands up buttigieg argued that undocumented immigrants would be able to pay into his proposed health care plan just as they already pay property and sales taxes this is not about a handout this is an insurance program and we do ourselves no favors by having 11 million undocumented people in our country unable to access health care buttigieg said next biden argued that providing immigrants with access to health care would ultimately lower costs for everyone they in fact contribute to the wellbeing of the country but they ve also for example they ve increased the lifespan of social security because if they have a job they re paying social security biden said adding that providing undocumented immigrants with health care would lower the costs of emergency treatment for untreated conditions trump took time out of his meeting with world leaders at the g20 in osaka japan to tweet about thursday s 2020 democratic debate in miami bloomberg reported that during a break between meetings with indian prime minister narendra modi and german chancellor angela merkel trump tweeted all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare how about taking care of american citizens first that s the end of that race since a white police officer shot and killed a black man eric logan on june 16 buttigieg has faced criticism over whether he failed to adequately address racial inequality and police discrimination in the city asked during the debate why he didn t manage to hire more black police officers in south bend where 26 of the population is black buttigieg responded because i couldn t get it done nbc moderators quoted a figure that only 6 of the south bend police force is black it s a mess and we re hurting he continued and i could walk you through all the things that we have done as a community all of the steps that we took from bias training to de escalation but it didn t save the life of eric logan and when i look into his mother s eyes i have to face the fact that nothing that i say will bring him back buttigieg said that these issues south bend faces are really a national problem and that across the country it s important to combat systemic racism in police departments in order to defeat what he terms a wall of mistrust that has been built between communities and officers i am determined to bring about a day when a white person driving a vehicle and a black person driving a vehicle when they see a police officer approaching feels the exact same thing a feeling not of fear but of safety buttigieg said swalwell wore an orange ribbon on his lapel in honor of jaime guttenberg a victim of the parkland fla shooting guttenberg s father fred was swalwell s debate guest according to anthony man a reporter for the south florida sun sentinel we are the only candidate that has a plan that would have prevented what happened in parkland swalwell told man according to a tweet i m going to make that clear tonight as on the previous night the candidates on stage thursday were asked to raise their hands if they would abolish private health insurance as president in favor of a government run plan although only sanders and harris raised their hands gillibrand answered the question first as though she too agreed with their position noting that private companies never put people over their profits and i doubt they ever will buttigieg said he would support a plan that he called medicare for all who want it and that americans cannot depend on the tender mercies of the corporate health care system biden meantime spoke in personal terms about the importance of health care as he advocated for a system that builds on obamacare he invoked his late son beau biden who died of brain cancer in 2015 and his first wife and young daughter who died in a car crash in 1972 noting that he couldn t fathom where he would be without health care during those times williamson also weighed in on the issue arguing that we don t have a health care system in the united states we have a sickness care system when asked why he didn t support free college as sanders warren and castro do buttigieg said that he wanted to make college tuition free but only for low and middle income students i just don t believe it makes sense to ask working class families to subsidize even the children of billionaires he said free college is closely tied to the student debt crisis from existing loans in april warren kickstarted the 2020 conversation on the issue with a proposal that would offer student loan forgiveness on a sliding scale depending on income her plan would eliminate up to 50 000 of student loan debt for people earning less than 100 000 per year the next month castro put out an education plan that would allow borrowers to have zero monthly payments if they earned less than 250 of the federal poverty line currently 64 375 for a family of four and forgive any remaining balance after 20 years on monday sanders upped the ante by unveiling a more radical proposal to cancel all student debt for everyone in america regardless of income buttigieg who has said that he and his husband carry 130 000 in student debt took a more moderate position saying he was open to student loan refinancing if you can refinance your house you oughta be able to refinance your student debt he said on thursday night sen amy klobuchar who has built her campaign on moderate stances likewise prefers loan refinancing over outright debt forgiveness it also needs to be more affordable in this country to not go to college buttigieg added you should be able to live well afford rent be generous to your church and little league whether you went to college or not that s one of many reasons we need to raise the minimum wage to at least 15 an hour swalwell who is 14 months older than buttigieg jumped in to note that i ve got 100 000 in student loan debt myself although he told marketwatch in april that he has paid it down from 150 000 to slightly less than six figures and once again drew a contrast between himself and older candidates saying that it s going to be the next generation who would solve the student debt crisis greeted by moderator jos di z balart with a bueas noches buttigieg broke into brief spanish before talking about college affordability buenos noches gracias de invitado he said which essentially means good evening thanks for the invite on wednesday night primary debate viewers were treated to several moments of candidates speaking spanish former texas rep beto o rourke and new jersey sen cory booker both spoke briefly in spanish followed by former hud secretary juli n castro leading some to call it the first bilingual presidential debate several of the other candidates had virtually promised to stay away from the language my spanish is terrible tweeted andrew yang es swalwell also promised cnn that he won t be butchering the language during the debate williamson joked last night that it might be time for her to take some lessons harris has previously joked that she only knows one word in the language pendejo which roughly translates to stupid meantime a candidate who didn t speak spanish on the debate stage came to regret it new york city mayor bill de blasio quoted cuban revolutionary che guevara the day after the debate saying hasta la victoria siempre then later had to apologize read more bill de blasio tried his hand at spanish he ended up in hot agua on several occasions the debate devolved into shouting and cross talk as candidates struggled to be heard and the moderates struggled to regain control as a few of the candidates started to talk over each other harris smiled and took command of the stage with the first zinger of the night hey guys you know what america does not want to witness a food fight they want to know how we re going to put food on their table harris said the audience burst into noisy applause and even biden paused to clap for harris yang certainly tried to appeal to millennials ahead of thursday night s debate first in a tweet the former tech executive activated his debate mode featuring a video backed by a hip hop song version of his yang gang 2020 slogan which showed him adding an american flag pin to his jacket lapel yang also made waves when he arrived on the debate stage without a tie msnbc anchor brian williams didn t hide his reaction to the fashion choice mr yang would it kill you to throw on a tie many on twitter agreed with williams surprise but not all disliked the choice with abby vesoulis tessa berenson and madeleine joung in
