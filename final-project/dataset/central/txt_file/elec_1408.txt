in january america is going to have a new president things are going to change that much is certain the question is what kind of change are we going to have we can build an economy that works for everyone or stack the deck even more for those at the top we can keep america safe through strength and smarts or turn our backs on our allies and cozy up to our adversaries we can come together to build a stronger fairer america or fear the future and fear each other everything i ve done as first lady senator or secretary of state i ve done by listening to people and looking for common ground even with people who disagree with me and if you elect me on tuesday that s the kind of president i ll be here are four priorities for my first 100 days issues i ve heard about from americans all over our country exclusive trump op ed we must clean up this corruption first we will put forward the biggest investment in new jobs since world war ii we ll invest in infrastructure and manufacturing to grow our economy for years to come we ll produce enough renewable energy to power every home in america within a decade we ll cut red tape for small businesses and make it easier for entrepreneurs to get the credit they need to grow and hire because in america if you can dream it you should be able to build it we ll pay for it all by asking the wealthy wall street and big corporations to finally pay their fair share and this commitment will go far beyond the first 100 days creating more good jobs with rising incomes will be a central mission of my presidency second we will introduce comprehensive immigration reform legislation the last president to sign comprehensive immigration reform was ronald reagan and it was a priority for george w bush i m confident that we can work across the aisle to pass comprehensive reform that keeps families together and creates a path to citizenship secures our border and focuses our enforcement resources on violent criminals this is the right thing to do and it will also grow our economy third to break the gridlock in washington we need to get secret unaccountable money out of our politics it s drowning out the voices of the american people so within my first 30 days i will introduce a constitutional amendment to overturn citizens united we should be protecting citizens rights to vote not corporations rights to buy elections fourth we need to get started on end to end criminal justice reform too many people have been sent away for far too long for non violent offenses i believe our country will be stronger and safer when everyone has respect for the law and everyone is respected by the law there s so much more we need to do together and we certainly won t get it all done in the first 100 days but we re going to roll up our sleeves and get to work for american families and i ll never ever quit i want to be president for all americans democrats republicans and independents americans of every race faith and background my opponent has run his campaign on divisiveness fear and insults and spent months pitting americans against each other i ve said many times that donald trump has shown us who he is now we have to decide who we are because it s not just our names on the ballot this year every issue we care about is on the ballot too this is about who we are as a country and whether we are going to have change that makes us stronger together or change that pushes us further apart it all comes down to this i love our country i believe in our people and i think there s nothing we can t achieve if we work together and invest in each other hillary clinton is the democratic nominee for president you can readdiverse opinions from ourboard of contributorsand other writers ontheopinion front page on twitter usatopinionand in our dailyopinion newsletter to submit a letter comment or column check oursubmission guidelines
