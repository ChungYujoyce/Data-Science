if you go to the tennessean website and put gary johnson in the search box located in the top right corner with a gray magnifying glass in it you will discover one news story pertaining to the libertarian presidential nominee itis dated march 15 2014 readerslikecate scotthave written letters to the editor about why they are supporting the former governor of new mexico for president but in our newspaper like many others johnsonis conspicuously absent in a year where voters have pointedly expressed their dissatisfaction with presidential candidates who represent status quo politics it seems odd that we are not interested in learning more about johnson who was a surprisingly effective governor from 1995 to2003 johnson barely won a four man republican gubernatorial primary in 1994 snagging34 of the primary vote he beat the incumbent governor democrat bruce king by 10 percentage points in the general election in a state where democrats outnumber republicans by a 2 to 1 margin like a traditional republican he ran on a platform of a common sense business approach to government you can go ahead and yawn at that with promises to cut the growth of government spending reduce taxes increase jobs and of course law and order once he was elected johnson executed his promises by using his veto power he vetoed 47 of the bills that reached his desk and exercised line item veto power on almost every bill he signed he cut government spending in every area during his first term except education where the state s budget increased by over 30 the khans reminded me why i love america column policing the usa alook atrace justice media when johnsonran for re election in 1998 against the popular democratic mayor of albuquerque he won again won by 10 percentage points in a 2001 interviewwith the libertarian reason magazine johnson described his accomplishments as governor as building 500 miles of four lane highway in the state to increase access to jobs reducing taxes by 123 million a year reforming medicaid reforming new mexico s prison system which was under federal supervision and reducing state government payrolls by 1 200 people he failed to pass a school voucher program but did get a statewide charter school authorizationbill passed during his second term johnson called the nearly two decade long war on drugs a failure and began advocating for the legalization of marijuana it was perhaps his first step to embracing thelibertarian party which was founded in 1971 in colorado and advocates for a small government andbroad personal and civil liberties with strict personal responsibility live and let live is the libertarian way states the party website the first libertarian ticket in 1972 received 3 674 votes johnson became a libertarian in 2011 and was the party nominee in the 2012 presidential election with running mate james p gray an orange county california judge he got on 48 state ballots and received almost 1 3 million votes or just under 1 of the popular vote president barack obama received almost 66 million votes and gop nominee mitt romney received nearly 61 million the whigs died but the gop doesn t have to column johnson tapped former massachusetts gov william weld as his running mate in 2016 johnson and weld advocate adiverse range of solutions including a broad tax simplification plan that would ultimately replace income and payroll taxes with consumption taxes sounds a lot like tennessee term limits for all federal offices an immigration policy that focuses on work visas and employment issues more than militarization of our borders decriminalization or legalization of marijuana as part of a comprehensive criminal justice system reform a woman s right to choose their slogan appreciate life respect choice stay out of personal decisions and send american troops to war only with clear congressional authorization generally if you ask someone whether they would vote for johnson the answer well other than who is that the vote is wasted and will either ensure that hillary clinton wins or donald trump wins whomever the person dislikes more of course then many folks cringe at the thought of either of the main party nominees serving in the white house they are after all the two most unpopular candidates in the history of candidate popularity polling so hold your nose and vote or take a look at another option the other main complaint i ve heard over the past two weeks as i talked with folkswas skepticism toward the extremism of the libertarian philosophy read thedemocratic party platform or therepublican platform both tend more toward extreme positions thanmost voters embrace if we want to see change in how our government works putting these two former governors in the mix might be the
