offered new evidence loading april 7 2016 this week the popular mass e mail that helps people build their vocabularies a word a day featured a word that has been used to describe donald trump it s clairaudience and it means the supposed ability to hear what is inaudible rolling stone writer paul solotaroff has described the gop presidential frontrunner as clairaudient able to see into and hear the hearts of disaffected underemployed white people from his office on the 26thfloor of trump tower and to read their rage back to them word for word in ways that no republican has ever done before but the past two weeks suggest that clairaudience has its limits losing wisconsin by 13 points is the latest evidence that trump s strengths reading voters and accurately identifying their concerns are no longer outweighing his shortcomings his limitations have long been known he speaks off the cuff his policies lack specificity and practicality his demeanor can be boorish for months the connection he has made with his core audience in some cases through those very qualities has limited any damage but now with only two other competitors left in the race and trump urgently needing 1 237 delegates to avoid a contested convention in which the party will be aligned against him his clairaudience isn t enough so far he s won fewer than 50 percent of the delegates on offer to get to 1 237 he ll need to win more than 60 percent of those remaining in other words he needs to expand his support as a result the candidate who has broken all the political rules of how to run for president is at last having to reckon with them he s kind of like a guy in a barber shop that makes a lot of sense complaining about things but that doesn t mean he should be president of the united states says gop consultant matt mackowiak who has not endorsed any candidate this is the challenge going forward can he grow as a candidate and can he grow as a credible nominee no question the billionaire has identified issues that voters care about says republican pollster david winston president of the winston group along with mr cruz trump criticizes lax immigration enforcement and wants to build a big barrier on the southern border along with democratic candidate bernie sanders trump has railed against international trade deals that have cost americans well paying manufacturing jobs and he has made a consummate dealmaker s complaint that the us is getting ripped off by allies who won t contribute a fair share to nato is trump identifying dynamics that people care about yes says mr winston who does polling for republicans in congress so you ve identified the problem great what s your solution until this week trump has been able to successfully run a primary campaign on such broad policy prescriptions or none at all because of his celebrity his tell it like it is style and the fact that there were so many candidates in the race candidates who mostly fought each other not him with 17 candidates running there s not enough time to force details on tax cuts or whatever your foreign policy is says mackowiak now we re down to three candidates and there s more of a requirement for specificity as that dynamic has changed however trump has not grown as a credible nominee mr mackowiak argues he cites the billionaire s recent interviews on policy positions in the new york times the washington post and other media he s laid out positions such as a nuclear armed japan and south korea possibly leaving nato and forcing mexico to pay for a wall on the border by cutting off money that mexicans in the us send back home experts have called these positions unworkable or even dangerous but perhaps more important to voters they have revealed how totally out of his depth he is on almost every major issue mackowiak says so can trump study up and act more presidential as he says his friends and family are urging him to do he s planning soon to roll out more policy speeches his speech on us israeli relationswas written by his son in law recently one of his foreign policy advisers appeared on the respected pbs newshour but his team is made up of unknowns or people who have mixed reputations in foreign policy circles according to politico he would need a lot more than a few policy speeches written by somebody else to be a credible candidate for president he would need an entire personality transplant and that s not going to happen says gop pollster whit ayres president of north star opinion research mr ayres was the pollster for republican presidential candidate marco rubio who has dropped out of the race trump has said that he will be very presidential once he dispenses with his competitors cruz and ohio gov john kasich he ll be so presidential he s telling the media that they ll be bored but in wisconsin exit polls show that nearly 40 percent of republicans said they would not vote for him if he were the nominee he would need north of 90 percent in his own party to win a general election ayres points out get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox meanwhile his controversial style and broad policy pronouncements may have won him a loyal following among primary voters but his approach so far has also resulted in very high negative ratings among general election voters unfavorables in the mid to high 60s one of trump s challenges will be to find some way to drop those staggering negatives explains winston that s incredibly hard to do link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more
