because they have suffered a spate of retirements andfacetrouble recruiting strong candidates to make upforthose losses for the candidates that the nrcc has touted in their young guns program they have either completely failed to launch or fizzled out simply put house republicans offensive opportunities are nonexistent a bad sign for an already imperiled republican majority law said republicans

the tax victory also saved the party s standing with its conservative base which threatened to desert themfollowing the health care debacle our base said ok you guys actually could come together and get something big done so you re seeing that reflected in the generic ballot that has gone from double digits down to single digits he said it feels like it s bottomed out and we re coming back up he said we will have a very good record to run on he also noted that trump s numbers are getting better walden acknowledged that house republicans don t have many pickup opportunities but arguedthat the party is focused onplaying defense not offense this year let s face it in the last two cycles you had a 247 seat majority and 241 seat majority those are the biggest republican back to back majorities

election year 2010 followed by a redistricting year and we had that in 2011 so a lot of these seats are pretty baked in said walden house democrats want to make the midterms a referendum on trump but republicans say they will counter that by tying democratic candidates to pelosi as they did in last year s special election in georgia s 6thcongressional district we were able to use nancy pelosi to
