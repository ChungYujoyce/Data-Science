latinos in iowa overlooked as a political force for years in the state that kicks off the u s presidential race have been getting unprecedented attention in a too close to call democratic white house nominating fight the predominantly white state has seen the hispanic share of its population more than double to 6 2 since 2000 making it iowa s biggest minority group and a crucial voting bloc that could spell the difference in monday s state caucuses and in the november election the population growth has spurred many democrats seeking the nomination to face president donald trump in november to hire latino or spanish speaking staff and tailor some campaign events to court latinos while activists have scrambled to register new hispanic voters and maximize their clout it has also changed the nature of life in some cities and towns in iowa in west liberty a small hispanic majority community with 3 700 residents the school system has a dual language program and some churches hold two services one in english and one in spanish it has strengthened the town to have two cultures living and working together with mutual respect and it opens the door to more people moving here said brenda arthur miller the high school principal in west liberty and director of the dual language program but the growth in iowa s hispanic population a community largely of mexican heritage so far has not been matched by progress in its political power language barriers have hindered participation particularly in the sometimes confusing caucuses hispanic activists estimate as few as 3 000 latinos participated in iowa s 2016 presidential caucuses out of more than 50 000 who were registered to vote to help remedy that the state democratic party has agreed to at least five spanish language satellite caucus sites on monday some local officials are scrambling to get interpreters in place at other locations the league of united latin american citizens a hispanic advocacy group known more commonly as lulac launched a registration drive it says has signed up 10 000 new hispanic voters ahead of monday s caucuses it also held mock caucus sessions to spread the word on the process and help train potential voters on how they work our long term goal is to keep doing the same thing through the november election and beyond we want to keep the momentum going said nick salazar state director of lulac and state co chairman of the bernie sanders presidential campaign left a pioneer sign stands in a field on a farm right an eagle model decoration sits on the front yard of a house salazar said the democratic party has sometimes taken the hispanic community for granted i ll be the first to admit that we have not done as much as we need to as a party to organize and emphasize the latino vote said troy price chairman of the iowa democratic party who said the party was trying to bolster its hispanic appeal with new staff and programs the crowded field of democratic presidential contenders has made up for it in this campaign however heavily courting latinos in the state ahead of a general election campaign likely to be influenced by trump s divisive rhetoric and policies on immigration for instance the sanders campaign which has hosted more than a dozen unidos con bernie events around the state created a spanish language digital ad featuring sanders father who immigrated to the united states from poland with the hispanic population expected to more than double again by 2050 according to the state data center of iowa salazar said the community was trying to build a tradition of civic engagement when people think about rural iowa they think of white farmers but many of these communities will keep becoming more diverse and more latino salazar said photo editing marika kochiashvili text editing soyoung kim and franklin paul layout julia dalrymple angel lucatero and miguel almanza play basketball near a cornfield the west liberty high school comets wrestling team hosts a meet at west liberty high school people watch race cars drive past at the west liberty race track a woman sits on a race car trailer at the west liberty race track a man watches a car race from the grandstands a religious statuette stands outside of st joseph catholic church silvia rojas and samuel contreras take part in a rehearsal at the independent pentecostal christian church father guillermo trevi o says goodbye to people after leading a spanish spoken church service flowers left at a gravesite stand at the oak ridge cemetery thank you baghdad kiu cobargo kaohsiung hong kong houston fuzhou lebaron hong kong hong kong baghdad jiujiang
