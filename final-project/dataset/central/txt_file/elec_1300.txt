and warren each left new hampshire stressing messages of perseverance and a promising timeline ahead with the nevada caucuses and the south carolina primary steadilyapproaching nevada s contest will happen in fewer than two weeks and once again hold new potential for thecandidates most notably while the large majority of primary voters in new hampshire are white nevada is one of just five states where whites make up a minority of thepopulation also the upcoming february 22 contest is a caucus and not a primary and similar to the iowa caucuses there are changes to nevada s caucus process from pastyears for the first time the democratic party is allowing early caucusing for four days next week in an effort to increaseaccessibility the party was also originally planning to use the same company that iowa used for a key reporting technology but after last week s malfunctions the party severed ties with thecompany reports this week indicate that democrats there are turning to a more paper based method but the party has not publicly detailed itsplans npr will be launching live analysis and fact checks for both the upcoming nevada caucuses and south carolinaprimary in the meantime

record in 2008 when hillary clinton bested barack obama and others was 287 556 in 2016 when vermont sen bernie sanders beat clinton easily in new hampshire turnout was249 587 turnout has been a point concern for many democrats since last week s iowa caucuses when fewer caucusgoers showed up at precincts than several candidates and party leaders had hoped for iowa democrats it was on par with 2016 which was not a good omen for the party turnout is a good indicator of voters generalenthusiasm sanders whose campaign strategy focuses on getting new voters to the polls has said that the best way to beat president trump in november is to drive up turnout but he conceded in recent days the iowa turnout was not as high as i wanted it tobe the new hampshire turnout should assuage some democratic concerns but remember that the primaries there are semi open meaning independent voters can participate in either the republican or democratic primary as npr s domenico montanaro has reported in a year when only one party is holding a competitive primary more independents might be expected to vote in the competitiveone so democrats might not be able to count on all those voters to be on their

was ahead throughout the night but faced a close contest from pete buttigieg former mayor of south bend ind speaking to supporters in manchester late tuesday evening sanders said his win marked the beginning of the end for donaldtrump the victory combined with sanders finish in a virtual tie with buttigieg in last week s still muddled iowa caucuses cements a candidate who spent much of his career as a political outsider and still is not a member of the democratic party as a top contender for its presidentialnomination after a strong second place showing in new hampshire pete buttigieg took the stage to thank his supporters and said his campaign has shown that we are here tostay in this election season we have been told by some that you must either be for a revolution or you are for the status quo the former south bend ind mayor said but where does that leave the rest ofus most americans don t see where they fit in that polarized vision and we can t defeat the most divisive president in modern american history by tearing down anybody who doesn t agree with us 100 of the time hesaid buttigieg finished behind vermont sen bernie sanders and acknowledged sanders win i admired senator sanders when i was a high school student i respect him greatly to this day and i congratulate him on his strong showing tonight buttigiegsaid former massachusetts gov deval patrick

hampshire with over 60 of the precincts reporting according to the associatedpress sanders won the primary in the state four years ago by over 20 points but is facing a close challenge from pete buttigieg former mayor of south bend ind both have seen large crowds in the final days of the campaign as they battle for the winning message among democraticvoters sanders continues to push for bold policy proposals like medicare for all and free tuition at public colleges and universities buttigieg argues it s time for fresh leadership and he s the candidate who can unite a broad range of voters to defeat president trump innovember minnesota sen amy klobuchar basked in the glow of better than expected support in the new hampshire primary delivering a speech to supporters in prime time and taking the opportunity to share herbiography hello america i am amy klobuchar and i will beat donald trump she began addressing a crowd in concord n h with details about her family sbackground she stressed her campaign s theme of unity arguing that democrats cannot win big by trying to outdivide the divider in chief and that they instead need to embrace a broadcoalition donald trump s worst nightmare is that the people in the middle the people tired of the name calling and the mudslinging have someone to vote for in november she told her supporters who responded by chanting beat trump voteamy early results show klobuchar in third place in new hampshire exceeding expectations after lagging in national polls to date she sought to frame the outcome as a comeback for hercampaign everyone had counted us out even a week ago thank you pundits i came back and we delivered shesaid results were still coming in from across new hampshire when sen elizabeth warren addressed supporters gathered in the executive health sports center inmanchester right now it is clear that senator sanders and mayor buttigieg had strong nights and i also want to congratulate my friend and colleague amy klobuchar for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out warrensaid before launching into a version of her stump speech she told the crowd it s possible the democratic party is headed for a long primary fight she called sanders and buttigieg people she respects and said they would both make a better president than donald trump but she warned about recent negativity coming from within theparty she called out the recent negative ads and said the harsh tactics from campaigns may work if they re willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last manstanding she maintains she s the candidate who can bring in the broadest coalition within the democraticparty alice donnaselva drove from concord to hear warren speak she has been a warren supporter since warren got into the race and isn t concerned that a lower place finish for warren in the primary prevents her from gaining momentum down theroad she s come from behind before and she built support so i think that s still possible donnaselva said i think we tend to think oh after one contest it s over and it s notover robert peters agrees warren represents him in the senate and he says that although he s somewhat disappointed by the evening s results he s heartened by the fact that warren says her campaign willcontinue there s a lot of fight left in her and a lot of territory left in the united states that we need to hear from he said as a former californian i think that one american in eight is californian and they need to have their say in this as well as the rest ofus fellow massachusetts voter milo bezark wants pundits to hold off on predictions fornow this is like a marathon not a sprint bezark smiled and so i think it ll be ok i came here to get an extra boost of warren love and i definitely gotthat former new york city mayor michael bloomberg is pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the democratic presidential contest but tim o brien a senior adviser to his campaign told npr i think you can buy exposure you can t buy anelection bloomberg did not compete in the new hampshire primary and is focused on buying ads and hiring scores of staffers to focus on states holding elections in march he faced intense criticism tuesday following the release of audio from a 2015 speech in which the then mayor defended aggressive stop and frisk police tactics in minority neighborhoods bloomberg apologized for backing the policy which o brien reiterated in an interview on npr ontuesday mike made a huge mistake and he stood by this for too long he should have let go of it earlier i think he deeply regrets having been part of thatpolicy without naming former vice president joe biden o brien also suggested that other democrats would need to account for their support of tough laws that have now come under criticism among african american voters it s interesting to me that the 1994 crime bill is not out there being discussed as much as stop and frisk is o briensaid o brien contrasted bloomberg with another wealthy candidate in the race tom steyer steyer spent a lot of money in new hampshire yet did not get a significant bump in the polls mike bloomberg has bought exposure and what that exposure has earned him is the ability to tell people his full story and i think as voters get acquainted with that they re impressed byit at joe biden s primary night party in nashua a stately lectern flanked by flags is set up at the front of the hotel ballroom but when biden spoke to the small crowd of mostly campaign staffers and volunteers

livestream standing next to his wife jill biden and we want you all to know how much we appreciate everything you vedone biden was supposed to take the stage at his primary night party but he abruptly left new hampshire this afternoon for south carolina where he s holding a campaign event tonight instead his sister valerie biden owens gave a short speech before introducing her brother who then

nevada and southcarolina state rep bruce cohen who was an early biden supporter in nashua was mingling at biden hq with his wife diane i love new hampshire new hampshire is great cohen said but we are a small population we have a handful of delegates we re a jumping off point but we re not the endpoint of the picturehere cohen said he s surprised that biden didn t gain traction in new hampshire but says he s not sweating the former vice president s prospectsyet i m not worried about him at all he said he s a brilliant person he knows what he s doing and he s looking at what s happened in new hampshire and iowa and he s taking next steps he s not here tonight because he needs to get his message out in south carolina i ll worry in june if it looks bad but i m not worried atall and he s not

old fights in our party or whether we can find anotherway in a speech to new hampshire supporters businessman andrew yang formally announced his withdrawal from the presidentialrace i am not someone

rise of new technologies central to his policy platform yang pitched a universal basic income for all adults a 1 000 a month stipend he called the freedom dividend as a key solution for many of the country s most pressingproblems all polls across the granite state should now be closed most precinct places finished up an hour ago but because individual towns run their own elections in new hampshire a handful had polling hours that extended until 8 p m et early results show sen bernie sanders in the lead with less than 10 of precincts reporting at thispoint president trump has easily won the new hampshire republican primary the associated pressprojects the president faced only nominal opposition in the race with just former massachusetts gov bill weld as a well knownchallenger but trump is sure to tout the victory four years ago amid a much more contested field trump posted his first major victory of the race winning 35 of the vote and more than doubling his nearest competitor then ohio gov johnkasich as of late tuesday afternoon a total of 853 presidential campaign events have been held in new hampshire nearly 300 fewer than the number held in iowa before the caucuses there lastweek that said for the most part the number of events each candidate held in the granite state doesn t correspond with their standing in the state spolls the most events were held by businessman andrew yang 133 and hawaii rep tulsi gabbard 130 but they have gained little traction in thepolls on the other hand vermont sen bernie sanders and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren have stronger name recognition in the region but have not visited the state in as high numbers sanders tops the new hampshire polls while warren has fluctuated throughout the campaign at times leading but currently tied for third place with severalcandidates former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg and minnesota sen amy klobuchar two midwestern candidates who don t hold the same name recognition in the area but have a chance at doing well tonight have the most visits in the granite state after yang andgabbard unlike the majority of the candidates former vice president joe biden has spent significantly less time and money in new hampshire and it s not working out well forhim after a lower than expected iowa finish and dropping poll numbers in the granite state the biden campaign announced earlier tuesday that it would be heading to south carolina before the results of the new hampshire primary arefinalized biden held a total of 46 events in new hampshire compared with his 117 events in iowa and with over a week until the south carolina primary where he has a significant polling lead biden has held 24 events in thestate about half of democratic primary voters in new hampshire said they made up their minds just in the last few days according to early exitpolls a whopping 48 said they made up their minds either in the last few days 36 or today 12 according to exit polls released by cnn combine that with the third who said the last debate was the most important factor in their consideration of whom to vote for and that could be a good thing for minnesota sen amy klobuchar another 12 said it was one of several importantfactors new hampshire public radio s sarah gibson interviewed one voter still undecided who is hoping for divine intervention as she walks into thebooth there were a couple of numbers that don t bode well for bernie sanders or his electability argument even if he wins tonight just 12 said they were first time voters and just 11 were voters under 30 that s a big drop from 2016 when 19 were 18 to29 sanders has made the case for his electability by saying he can turn out new voters but in iowa turnout was lackluster and the percentage of first time caucusgoers went down although the percentage of voters under 30 went up and they overwhelmingly caucused forsanders in new hampshire there were also splits that reflect the divide between the progressives and moderates within the democratic party there was a 36 to 35 split between those who want a candidate who can unite the country and those who want someone who can bring needed change to the country and there was a 40 to 38 split between those wanting a return to barack obama s policies and those wanting somethingnew other numbers that stood out from exit polls released by cnn andmsnbc similar to polls of democrats health care was named as the most important issue 37 followed by climate change 28 income inequality 19 and foreign policy 11 leading up to last week s iowa caucuses there were warning signs that things might not go as smoothly as democrats in the state were promising in particular precinct leaders were expected to use an untested smartphone app to tabulate and report results and had less than a month to get familiar withit today s primary in new hampshire features none of those potentialissues the folks that are running new hampshire s primary elections are election officials who have done this many times before said david levine the elections integrity fellow at the alliance for securing democracy and they are using election technology that they ve used many timesbefore whereas the iowa caucuses were run by the state party the new hampshire primary is overseen by the secretary of state s office and run at the local level by town clerks who in most cases have been administering elections foryears the state has long projected confidence in its election systems specifically because all votes in the state are cast on paperballots you want to know about being hacked you see this pencil here secretary of state bill gardner said ahead of the 2018 midterms holding up a pencil for emphasis want me to give it to you and see if you can hack this pencil we have this pencil this is how people vote in this state and you can t hack thispencil there are however a few vulnerabilities still present as reported here by new hampshire public radio s casey mcdermott most notably the state does not mandate post election audits which are widely considered a best practice for verifyingresults but on the whole experts expect tonight to go more smoothly than monday of lastweek knock on wood sen elizabeth warren s campaign manager roger lau emailed a memo to supporters ahead of the polls closing in new hampshire to give an update on what s next for thecampaign he emphasizes that the campaign is poised to organize and get out the vote in all 57 states and territories a point warren herself has stressed on the trail when asked about her viability long term he writes that the campaign is confident in its strategy to compete throughout the country not just in pockets that reflect one segment of our party oranother lau cautions against anyone making predictions at this stage calling the race a fractured one people who are predicting what will happen a week from now are the same people who a year ago predicted that beto o rourke was a frontrunner for the nomination he writes as we ve seen in the last week debates and unexpected results have an outsize impact on the race and will likely keep it volatile and unpredictable through supertuesday notably while warren has not made negative comments about her opponents this memo lists what it sees as the deficits of each of heropponents lau predicts that warren will finish in the top two in over half of the super tuesday states and says internal campaign figures show only three candidates at or above the 15 threshold in more than half of the districts warren biden and sanders in that three way race elizabeth warren is the candidate with the highest potential ceiling of support and the one best positioned to unite the party and lead the democratic ticket to defeat donaldtrump the memo also reminds supporters that the warren campaign has always been 100 grassroots funded and that s never going to change it then asks for adonation the last time democrats had an open primary in new hampshire with an incumbent republican president up for reelection was in 2004 back then massachusetts sen john kerry swept both iowa and new hampshire and won thenomination that year there were plenty of late deciding voters many thinking about electability who broke for kerry according to the exit polls more than half of new hampshire democratic primary voters said they decided in the last week and kerry won the lion s share of them 40 to former vermont gov howard dean s21 and even though voters by a nearly 2 to 1 margin said the issues were more important to them than picking someone who could beat then president george w bush of those who said beating bush was most important kerry won almost 6 in 10 of them kerry tied with dean among those who said the issues were moreimportant what s more in new hampshire about 40 of registered voters are independents which way they go can sway the primary that s because new hampshire primaries are semi open or semi closed meaning undeclared voters can participate in either primary they have to pick one in a year when only one party is holding a competitive primary more independents might be expected to vote in the competitiveone case in point in 2004 the number of independents participating in the new hampshire democratic primary was very high almost half 48 kerry won more of them than anyone else 37 to dean s23 independents though don t always mean moderates in 2016 for example bernie sanders won three quarters of independents he also won moderates too by a slightly lower 59 that s what happens when a candidate wins a state by 20points the other number to watch liberals there s a clear trend from the exit poll data since 2004 the number of self described liberals participating has ballooned from 46 in 2004 to 56 in 2008 to a whopping 68 in 2016 that obviously helped sanders the question is was that a sign of the candidates on the ballot barack obama and sanders who drew out more progressives or is it a trend in theparty primaries always draw more activist voters but the party has clearly grown more liberal since 2004 the pew research center for example found that in 2003 just 29 of democrats identified as liberal by 2019 it was46 stephanie huot was still undecided when she got herballot i was between two candidates she said and i had to kinda stand there in the voting booth for a minute but i made mydecision she d been weighing former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg and minnesota sen amy klobuchar who have been competing for moderate voters in the end she voted forbuttigieg it just came down to who i thought could take on president trump she said outside her polling place at parker varney school in manchester and i think he has a good chance at it it s only been in the last month or so i ve heard about amy and i ve heard about buttigieg for months and months so i think he probably has a bettercampaign david mccormick was also undecided until he got to the pollingplace i was really struggling mccormick said it was a last seconddecision he said although he really liked buttigieg he worried about buttigieg s electability when it came down to it he ended up voting for billionaire activist tomsteyer it felt super risky and like why am i even doing this mccormick said he s at the bottom of new hampshire polling but i do think when i imagine a democrat head to head with donald trump he s the only one who can hold hisown his oldest daughter amarra 19 also voted for steyer after worrying about a repeat of vermont sen bernie sanders loss in the 2016 democraticprimary mccormick has been bringing his kids with him to vote in the primaries for years it s our civic responsibility to vote in elections you don t want other people making decisions for you he said if you give away that right you may not get it back you should hold on to it and treat it withrespect and while most of the focus has been on the democratic ballot with trump s victory all but certain retirees ray and sally boucher still came out to cast their votes forhim for sally boucher more conservative judges is her most importantissue and to allow us to control our own lives ray boucher said that s how i seeit meanwhile debbie simard had decided early on that she d be backing former vice president joe biden i m looking for someone to get us back to where we used to be she explained i don t like the divisiveness and biden can reach across the aisle and the world leaders know him and feel safe withhim pete buttigieg kicked off primary day with stops at polling places in manchester hopkinton andnashua the former mayor of south bend ind was asked by a reporter whether he thought he d win new hampshire tonight we think so buttigieg said it feelsfantastic vermont sen bernie sanders the only democratic rival whom buttigieg has been criticizing by name over the last few days has been leading most recent polls in new hampshire sanders and buttigieg finished in a virtual tie for first in iowa lastweek in a moment where our country is so divided we can t risk further polarizing the american people that s why i m very concerned about the suggestion that either you got to be for a revolution or you must be for the status quo buttigieg said at an event last night in a subtle dig at sanders and former vice president joe biden because that s a vision of politics an all or nothing vision that most of us can t see where we fit in i m here to build a political program that all of us can see where wefit buttigieg says he s the candidate who can bring in the broadest swath of voters not just fellow democrats but also independents and republicans who he says may be alienated by sanders policy agenda or biden s appeals to a politics of thepast kim lavine attended the rally with two friends she had been trying to decide between sanders whom she supported in 2016 andbuttigieg i ve been with bernie but this is a new fresh face she said and he s honest composed hopeful she said it has been a tough choice and she has thought about how much she should factor in who may be the best candidate to defeat presidenttrump this morning lavine texted to say that she and her two friends all decided to vote forbuttigieg on the other side of the room scott and alison cummings were weighing buttigieg and minnesota sen amy klobuchar scott cummings said biden used to be on their list but after watching biden in the debates he worried about biden s ability to go toe to toe withtrump new faces are very important in washington alison cummings said biden s been there for a long time he knows the ins and outs but i think it s time for achange i want to pick someone who s likely to win the popular vote not just the primary so looking ahead to november who stands the best chance scott cummings said so we re trying to figure that out we saw amy yesterday really impressed and from what i ve seen of this gentleman we ll probably be equallyimpressed this morning alison cummings texted to say that she and her husband split their votes she voted for klobuchar and her husband voted forbuttigieg former vice president joe biden has announced that he is skipping his election night party in new hampshire so he can travel to south carolina where biden is looking for a rebound in the state s primary later thismonth the surprise announcement comes as polls in new hampshire show biden who has strength in national surveys trailing vermont sen bernie sanders and former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg some late polls also show minnesota sen amy klobuchar and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren potentially surpassing biden in today scontest biden placed fourth in iowa last week a result he characterized as a gutpunch rather than watching returns come in from new hampshire in person later this evening biden s campaign says he will address supporters via livestream biden is planning a campaign launch party at 9 p m et in columbia s c i have enjoyed traveling across new hampshire speaking to countless granite staters who understand we are in a battle for the soul of this nation and i have relished fighting for each and every one of their votes biden said in astatement i am looking forward to traveling to south carolina this evening and nevada later this week to carry our campaign forward and hear from the diverse voters whose voices must be heard in this process to select the democratic nominee who will unite this country to defeat donald trump bidenadded south carolina s primary is the first among southern states and is seen as an important test of each candidate s support among african american voters who make up nearly two thirds of the state s democratic primaryelectorate as new hampshire voters cast ballots in the country s first presidential primary today vermont sen bernie sanders and former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg are the top two candidates in the state the two candidates were in a virtual tie in the iowacaucuses the results are a boost for sanders who also leads among democrats nationally in a new quinnipiac university poll conducted after the iowacaucuses in an interview with npr faiz shakir who manages the sanders campaign said he is confident the vermont senator s message of taking on corporate interests and pushing for medicare for all will appeal to voters in newhampshire although overall turnout was flat during the iowa caucuses shakir pointed to an uptick in voters under 30 even compared with 2008 which saw an overall record turnout in the state that s proof shakir says that sanders is generating enthusiasm among younger voters but whether that excitement for sanders will move older voters is an openquestion what i would say is it s the job of all the candidates to generate that enthusiasm shakirsaid many voters in new hampshire say they are not dead set on any one candidate raising the possibility again of a muddled contest finish among the crowded slate of democratichopefuls in 2016 sanders sailed to victory with a 21 point victory over hillary clinton the eventual nominee in new hampshire the kind of landslide not anticipated during this year s democraticprimary looking beyond new hampshire shakir said sanders an independent is ready to support the eventual democratic nominee in order to bring the partytogether taking on donald trump unifies the democratic party shakir said we welcome all of our friends within the party to raise what messaging what research needs to be done to execute an argument that i m not sure any of us have quite fully landed on about what is most effective with people out there to convert them and persuade them into the democratic ranks and pull them off of donaldtrump turnout in the iowa caucuses was lackluster about 172 000 showed up to caucus approximately the same level as 2016 campaigns had hoped the figure would be closer to the highs of 2008 vermont sen bernie sanders had been promising that turnout would break the 2008 record helping him over the finishline well that turned out not to be the case and it raises questions about how wide sanders support is within the democratic party but he and democrats have another chance in new hampshire to show the party s base is enthusiastic to go to the polls in a year it faces presidenttrump new hampshire has a population of about 1 4 million people and more than 70 are registered to vote the state is known to have high levels of voter turnout and had the second highest voter turnout in the country behind minnesota during the general election in2016 the record unsurprisingly was in 2008 when about 288 000 showed up to vote the second highest level was 2016 at about250 000 past primary turnout n a is indicated because 2012 and 1996 were uncontested primaries with barack obama and bill clinton up forreelection just 24 delegates are up for grabs in new hampshire today with a candidate needing 1 991 to clinch the democratic nomination there s a lot more on the line today than thatprize here are some things in particular to lookfor can sanders expand his base sanders did well in urban areas and college towns he needs to show he can reach beyond that the democratic party doesn t need help winning in those places still a win would be a win and sanders would be in the pole position for the nomination if he does especially considering that moderates and establishment democrats don t appear to be coalescing around anyone any timesoon for buttigieg new hampshire is nice but again new hampshire is a very white state and buttigieg has struggled in polling with voters of color he needs to perform well in new hampshire but then the real test comes when the race moves to nevada and south carolina two states with much more diverseelectorates who finishes third this might be the biggest and most important question of the night biden is fading fast he s been hoping that south carolina and his support with african american voters would be his firewall but south carolina is weeks away and there may be evidence he s already declining with african americans meanwhile massachusetts sen elizabeth warren who finished third in iowa needs to be able show she can beat sanders and buttigieg the two candidates most eating into her support she polls second with progressives to sanders and second with college educated whites tobuttigieg how far can klobuchar go she s seen a sharp spike since coming close to biden in iowa and after her strong debate performance in new hampshire friday she s actually now polling third slightly ahead of warren and biden if she were to take third wow but is it too little too late she needs the donations to pour in if she s going to have a shot and that starts with a surprising finish in new hampshire ahead of some of the field sheavyweights how long do lower performing candidates continue on wealthy venture capitalist tom steyer has the personal resources to go as long as he wants but he s seen little payoff in the results he s making a serious push in south carolina but no polling so far indicates he can win the state that effort might wind up wounding biden more than any other candidate as he s making inroads with black leaders andvoters andrew yang has a deep well of support but it s not very wide he wound up with fewer than 2 000 votes in iowa out of 170 000 yang is a serious person with a serious message but if he finishes in single digits again in new hampshire he and his supporters have to ask themselves why he s running is it to make a point or is it to win and if it s to make a point for how long and will his supporters wholeheartedly get behind whoever winds up becoming the democraticnominee like iowa new hampshire is an overwhelmingly white state in 2016 its democratic primary was 93 white so why is new hampshire first and how has it stayed thatway new hampshire became the first primary in 1920 when minnesota dropped its primary and indiana moved to may after the chaos of the 1968 democratic national convention new hampshire politicians put forward legislation that required their primary to be first enacting a law a few years later here s what the lawsays the presidential primary election shall be held on the second tuesday in march or on a date selected by the secretary of state which is 7 days or more immediately preceding the date on which any other state shall hold a similar election the purpose of this section is to protect the tradition of the new hampshire first in the nation presidentialprimary notice that law gives the full power to the secretary of state to set the date of the primary and that secretary of state has been the guard dog of the first in the nation primary status for the last 40 plus years billgardner in office since 1976 gardner is the longest serving secretary of state in the country in the 1980s iowa and new hampshire struck a deal allowing iowa to hold the first caucuses and new hampshire the firstprimary over the years gardner has blocked efforts by both parties to change the order of the primaries he publicly opposed a dnc led movement to change it in 2006 and maintained the same view in 2015 when then republican party chairman reince priebus alluded to shaking things up after the 2016election but gardner may be losing power in addition to now being 71 his reign was threatened in 2018 after taking part in president trump s now defunct election integrity commission he survived re election by just four votes of statelegislators in a political year when primary traditions are under scrutiny the most quaint of them all was carried out early thismorning shortly after midnight three towns in northern new hampshire with a collective population of under 100 voted in the democratic and republicanprimaries the votes were counted without any complications nor much technology here are theresults dixville notch democrats republicans hart s location democrats republicans millsfield democrats republicans stay tuned these numbers are hardly determinative with turnout expected to easily top 200 000 in the democratic contest polls in the rest of the state will close between 7 and 8 p m et and you can follow all of the latest results righthere voting in new hampshire is much more straightforward than the iowa caucuses the npr politics team put together this handy explainer to help get you through from knowing who votes to how delegates are allocated click here to see the guide viainstagram hours before the new hampshire primary begins with a round of midnight votes president trump touched down in manchester for a rally designed to take attention away from democrats and fly the gop flag in one of the most closely divided states in thecountry the first step to victory is tomorrow and go send a message for republicans trump said before a packed arena trump lost new hampshire to hillary clinton in 2016 by about 2 700 votes and his campaign is investing heavily in the state to try and flip it in2020 monday s rally is the second pre election rally for trump who also went to des moines days before the iowa caucuses taking a dig at the chaotic outcome of that contest trump said of democrats they don t know what they re doing they can t even count theirvotes trump has regularly tried to exploit divisions among democrats he took another stab at it monday claiming without evidence that the iowa chaos was part of an effort by democrats to deny bernie sanders a victory i think they re trying to take it away from bernieagain independent voters are allowed to cast ballots in new hampshire s presidential primary and trump jokingly suggested to his supporters that they vote for the weakest democrat ontuesday who is their weakest candidate i think they re all weak said trump they re all fighting eachother trump exulted in the recent senate vote to acquit him after being impeached by the house he also brought up last week s state of the union address saying of house speaker nancy pelosi that i had somebody behind me mumbling terribly it was very distracting unprompted the crowd started chanting lock herup as rival candidates and some democratic leaders have amped up their concerns that nominating vermont sen bernie sanders would keep president trump in the white house and maybe even put democrats house majority in play sanders is returning to a familiarrebuttal so the question arises what is the best way to beat trump and i believe that the best way to beat him is to have the largest voter turnout in american history sanders told a packed coffeehouse in salem n h monday and the way you do that is by running a campaign of energy and excitement that brings people who don t always vote into the politicalprocess the key sanders said is to target and win over people who look at politics and ask themselves why should i participate in an election when the political leaders in the country are ignoringme the argument is easy to see in a setting like monday night s closing sanders event in durham a college hockey arena packed with thousands of excited young supporters there to see a megarally highlighted by new york rep alexandria ocasio cortez and the rock group thestrokes but sanders and his campaign had predicted record turnout in the iowa caucuses maybe as many as 250 000 voters and in the end participation was only slightly higher than 2016 the turnout was not as high as i wanted it to be sanders conceded though his campaign is pointing to surveys showing a spike in youngcaucus goers it s not just the sanders campaign waiting to see whether new hampshire turnout stays flat or goes up as peter hamby notes in vanity fair turnout over the course of a primary season is a solid indicator of how energized or not energized the party base is if the numbers remain relatively flat through the remaining early primary and caucus states democrats will raise serious alarms about whether the party s anti trump energy is fading at the worst possibletime at campaign events across new hampshire in the days ahead of tomorrow s primary massachusetts sen elizabeth warren has emphasized she s open to incorporating the ideas of candidates who have dropped out of the race into her owncampaign the whole idea here is we re not looking to elbow each other out she said today at a town hall inrochester it s part of her goal of being the unity candidate and reaching out to undecided voters in a state whose primary is semi open meaning unenrolled voters can vote in either the democratic or republicanprimaries she told a crowd of approximately 225 that if they looked up her climate plan they d find that whole sections came from ideas from former candidate and washington gov jayinslee she also referenced california sen kamala harris kamala s voice was strong and should be a part of our primary process warren said but i ve known kamala for a long time when kamala was no longer in the race i called her and said what i d really like to do is pick up your terrific idea on how we protect women s reproductive health how would you feel if i just added them into my set of plans i ll give you full credit because i m happy to do that and kamala said great let s do it she also mentioned incorporating the ideas of former hud secretary juli n castro on immigration castro has endorsed her and become a high profile surrogate and new york sen kirsten gillibrand s proposals on paid familyleave almost 40 million has been spent on tv and radio ads in new hampshire through tomorrow according to advertising analytics via nbc news that s far less than the 68 million spent iniowa what s remarkable is that half of all ad spending in new hampshire has come from tom steyer a billionaire venture capitalist steyer though hasn t seen much bang for his buck he s only polling around 2 in the average of the state spolls some other takeaways from thedata here are the fullnumbers all of these numbers however pale in comparison to what former new york mayor michael bloomberg is spending in other states that vote on super tuesday and later bloomberg who is worth tens of billions of dollars has now spent more than 350 million on ads since his late november campaign launch according to cnn a day before the new hampshire primary the fight over iowa s results goeson today was the deadline for campaigns to file requests for recanvassing in iowa following its troubled contest last week and the campaigns of vermont sen bernie sanders and former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg who are locked in a virtual tie did indeed file such requests according to the iowa democratic party the two requests cover 85 totalprecincts the sanders campaign believes that the recanvassing would correct errors that would result in sanders picking up one nationaldelegate our volunteers and supporters worked too hard and too many people participated for the first time to have the results depend on calculations that even the party admits are incorrect senior adviser jeff weaver said in a statement once the recanvass and a subsequent recount are completed in these precincts we feel confident we will be awarded the extra national delegate our volunteers and grassroots donorsearned last night the iowa democratic party released updated results for a small percentage of precincts and its projected allocations for its 41 national delegates 14 for buttigieg 12 for sanders eight for massachusetts sen elizabeth warren six for former vice president joe biden and one for minnesota sen amyklobuchar however the associated press which npr and other news outlets use for election returns and calls said the iowa results still may not be fully accurate and the organization remains unable to declare a winner based on the availableinformation vermont sen bernie sanders and former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg essentially tied in iowa and now new hampshire voters have the chance to reinforce that result or reset the democratic primaryrace over the last several decades when new hampshire has reinforced the iowa winner that person has gone on to be the democratic nominee every time john kerry in 2004 al gore in 2000 and jimmy carter in both 1980 and1976 but slightly more often new hampshire perhaps reflecting the personality of its people has been contrarian resetting the democratic primary in a way that portends a long drawn out race here s a lookback of course this year has its wild cards including no clear iowa winner buttigieg having his deficiencies with voters of color who will dominate later in the process sanders being opposed by a good faction of the democratic establishment that doesn t think he can win and of course former new york mayor mikebloomberg bloomberg isn t competing in any of the first four states because he got into the primary too late but he s spent more than 350 million now on ads focused on super tuesday states and beyond and joe biden s poor iowa showing has some moderates and mainstream democrats talking seriously about bloomberg scandidacy historical patterns after all are only good until they renot vermont sen bernie sanders doesn t do introspection or personal narrative that often it s issues issues issues political revolution then back to issues at his rallies and townhalls so it was notable that at nearly every stop in new hampshire this past weekend sanders would reflect back on the 2016 new hampshire primary where he trounced former secretary of state hillary clinton by more than 20points the reason that we re here today has a lot to do with new hampshire four years ago sanders told campaign volunteers in dover saturday he argued that many democrats and observers had been dismissing his agenda single payer health care free public college a 15 minimum wage as too wild too radical tooextreme the people of new hampshire said you know what these are not radical extreme ideas these are the ideas that we want he sees the 2016 primary win as a key moment of validation that while not delivering him the democratic nomination began the process of large sections of the party ultimately warming to hisviews but here s the slight problem for the sanders campaign the early contests are more about momentum and narrative than delegates which candidate is surging which candidate is struggling and in a much more crowded race no one expects sanders or any other candidate for that matter to finish with such a declarativewin so while sanders keeps reminding voters of how he ran the table in the granite state in 2016 his top advisers are trying to say essentially yes but it s a very different situation said campaign manager faiz shakir it helps that we have some benchmarks to work off of from our campaign to know how many people could potentially support this campaign how many we could bring back to this campaign but the fact that there s eight 10 other candidates out there who are working very hard for the vote splitting up the vote it s a very differentrace added senior adviser jeff weaver we re looking for a good win here but i don t think it s going to be anywhere near the magnitude of what you saw in 2016 it s justimpossible not that the campaign would complain if it did somehowhappen facing attacks from fellow democrats pete buttigieg kept up a grueling campaign schedule this weekend packing gyms and auditoriums with crowds that often topped a thousandpeople the former south bend ind mayor is trying to capitalize on the momentum of a strong showing in iowa where he s still locked in a virtual tie for first place with vermont sen bernie sanders that s made buttigieg a target especially for former vice president joe biden who finished a disappointing fourth in iowa and is competing for the same moderate voters buttigieg iscourting with attacks escalating buttigieg added some subtle swipes to his stump speech thisweekend i don t think we can take the risk of excluding anybody from this effort of saying that if you re not either for a revolution or a status quo then you don t fit buttigieg told the crowd in a high school gym in lebanon n h nodding at sanders and biden i think we re going to defeat this president by inviting everybody to be at ourside while buttigieg has mostly avoided calling out his rivals directly by sunday he was knocking sanders by name but apart from a few lines buttigieg has kept his message on an argument for generational change as well as brandishing his rust belt credentials and ability to pick off republican and independent votersthere that s a draw for voters like steven depietro who had staked out a spot in the back of the elm street middle school gym with his wife stephanie for a buttigieg rally in nashua on sunday but he s still trying to decide between two very different candidates buttigieg andsanders i want to see who s going to be the strongest candidate to beat president trump he said that s my biggest issue right now because i want trump out of the white house once he s out it s all gravy afterthat thomas filip a dentist in keene threw his support behind buttigieg early on he s seen him four times now and on saturday brought his wife along to see him again at keene state college she s still deciding between buttigieg and sen elizabethwarren i think if we re going to win in november we need to nominate someone that we re really passionate about not someone who we think other people will want to vote for filip said with his 3 year old son perched on his shoulders and waving a petesign buttigieg wraps up his final full day of the new hampshire campaign today with rallies in milford andexeter for anyone watching the new hampshire primary on television the midnight vote in dixville notch is one of the primary s most familiar traditions the citizens of the tiny town close to the canadian border cast some of the first ballots in the first in the nation presidentialprimary but as new hampshire public radio s stranglehold podcast explained the midnight vote was always a media driven event that started more than 50 years ago as a way to give the press something to report early on electionday long held up to the rest of the world as a symbol of democracy at its purest dixville notch s practices have actually come under lots of scrutiny from state election investigators since 2016 a state investigation found that some of the town s voters didn t actually live there ironically it was all the media coverage of the vote that clued in state officials to theirregularities once the ineligible voters were removed from the rolls it wasn t clear that dixville would have enough people to legally hold its own election again in 2020 the main business in town the balsams resort closed down about a decade ago and took most of dixville s voters withit but the midnight vote s fortunes changed when les otten a developer who s trying to bring the resort back to life declared he would move back and make the town his residence for voting purposes giving the town enough voters so the tradition couldcontinue midnight voting in dixville is to new hampshire like snow is to winter said otten who says his main goal is to make sure dixville continues to be a symbol of civic participation but he acknowledged that keeping the midnight vote alive might also boost his quest to reopen the town s shutteredresort state officials say they re satisfied that dixville has resolved the problems with its elections since 2016 but it s keeping a close eye to besure while dixville will be back in the spotlight there are other midnight voting locations in new hampshire including the town of millsfield which happens to be next door todixville for us in millsfield it s kind of humorous said wayne urso millsfield s self appointed townhistorian millsfield is actually the birthplace of the midnight voting tradition dating back to 1936 way before dixville when a 27 year old woman named genevieve nadig dreamt itup reporters have come to millsfield and then come into dixville and the big story that s written is all about dixville with millsfield being a side note ursosaid for tonight s midnight vote an outside public relations company is fielding media credentials and orchestrating national news coverage of dixville svote over in millsfield urso and his neighbors will get together at a local tavern their designated polling place to cast their ballots at the stroke of midnight they say the press is welcome to show up too joe biden may be downplaying expectations in new hampshire but the former vice president who has long been characterized as the front runner in the democratic presidential primary has a lot at stake in tuesday s primary after his shaky fourth place finish in the iowacaucuses and while the biden campaign has repeatedly suggested that results from the overwhelmingly white states of iowa and new hampshire should not be overinflated a similar fourth place finish in new hampshire could raise serious questions about the general election prospects of a candidate who has run his entire campaign on the premise of hiselectability this past weekend biden seemed well aware of the risks to his front runner sheen there was a newfound sense of urgency as the campaign tried to recalibrate ahead of tuesday sprimary on friday it announced a staff shakeup elevating longtime adviser anita dunn and on saturday biden held a rare wide ranging news conference with reporters adopting perhaps the most aggressive tone we ve seen from him to date sharply singling out pete buttigieg sresume this guy s not barack obama biden told reporters referring to the 38 year old former mayor of south bend ind barack obama had been senator of a really largestate for months biden has run a campaign focused squarely on president trump as if trump were his only rival but over the weekend he redirected his criticism toward the two candidates who finished on top in iowa buttigieg and vermont sen berniesanders but all this is happening as biden faces mounting pressure from another moderate rival minnesota sen amy klobuchar who s seen an uptick in recent new hampshirepolls in the final push ahead of the new hampshire primary several democratic presidential candidates are taking a negative tone about theiropponents but that s not a tactic sen elizabeth warren isembracing during town halls and get out the vote events over the weekend warren gave speeches that sounded like the speeches she s been giving throughout the campaign filled with detailed policy proposals and refrains of i ve got a plan forthat speaking to reporters after an event in concord warren said going negative isn t an effective strategy fordemocrats we re going to have to bring our party together in order to beat donald trump she explained and the way we do this is not by launching a bunch of attacks on each other and trying to tear each other down listen to warren on morning edition instead she argues the key to defeating trump is unifying as a party she says she sees herself as the candidate who can unify factions of the democraticelectorate by and large the voters attending her events appeared supportive of thisstrategy sneha magadi of lebanon n h says to listen to the words of former first lady michelle obama when they go low we go high she recites i believe in that and that s why i m here today warren is choosing the higher road which is what weneed her father sean magadi agrees saying there s already enough negativity coming from the white house the negativity has already given us one president he cautions we don t need another one likethat while john grandi of enfield n h is still deciding between warren vermont sen bernie sanders and entrepreneur andrew yang he likes that the massachusetts senator is keeping her campaignpositive why pick fights with each other he asks there s one pretty unified enemy out there being positive is what s going to get us through in the long run just stay above it all be the biggercandidate so iowa was interesting but now the democratic presidential nominating contest has moved on to new hampshire where voters head to the polls tomorrow the final polls close at 8 p m et on tuesday and then the results one hopes will come in shortlythereafter while iowa has its complicated caucus system new hampshire uses a simple secret ballot primary though it is semi open which means unenrolled voters can cast a ballot in either the democratic or republicanprimaries on the democratic side 24 delegates are up for grabs and the race has shifted significantly since iowa s caucuses former vice president joe biden s poor iowa showing has shifted him into attack mode and over the weekend he targeted both candidates who finished in a virtual tie for first in iowa vermont sen bernie sanders and former south bend ind mayor petebuttigieg sanders won new hampshire easily in the 2016 presidential race but polls show a surging buttigieg and this year among his other rivals is a fellow new england progressive senator massachusetts elizabeth warren minnesota sen amy klobuchar has also been rising in new hampshire polls over the last couple ofweeks like iowa new hampshire is not a state with much racial diversity it s about 93 white after this primary the democratic race turns later this month to the more racially diverse states of nevada and southcarolina new hampshire s results should provide more clarity as to which candidates are moving on as well and how their campaigns arefaring candidate photos amr alfiky npr sanders getty images steyer olivia sun for npr buttigieg state of massachusetts patrick u s
