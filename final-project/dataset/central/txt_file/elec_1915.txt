it read they waved and smiled as people drove by the message wasn t subtle it also wasn t an outlier either it s a slogan that s been found on t shirts at many trump rallies since at least march there are bumper stickers for sale with the slogan even a bottle of hot sauce clinton has said she carries hot sauce with her wherever she goes because of the immune boosting properties of hot peppers perhaps it was inevitable that with the first female nominee of a major political party on the ballot the race for president would have undercurrents of sexism but what wasn t inevitable is just how out in the open it has been it is nearly impossible to separate out everything underlying this moment in history would this type of vitriol be directed at any woman trying to reach the highest office in the land or is there something unique about clinton who has been on the political stage disrupting norms and drawing ire from republicans for decades and what about her opponent if clinton were running against someone else would this still be happening is this what we are teaching our little boys how much responsibility does donald trump have to bear for strategists aligned with the previous two republican presidential nominees quite a bit i don t think that jeb would have allowed that or any of the other candidates said katie packer who was deputy campaign manager for republican mitt romney in 2012 steve schmidt a senior adviser to john mccain s 2008 campaign also blamed trump he s created a permissible environment for this he said schmidt and packer are not trump fans but they speak from the experience of being part of the rigors of campaigns with gop nominees for president that both also ran against another candidate whose very presence on the ballot challenged a historical norm barack obama schmidt remembers a famous moment from 2008 there was anger schmidt said and there was angst and as sen obama was moving towards election to the presidency the crowds became angrier frankly at the end of the campaign at one point a woman stood up at and said i can t trust obama i have read about him and he s not he s not he s a he s an arab mccain stopped her he stepped forward towards her and he said no ma am schmidt recalled mccain went on he s a decent family man citizen that i just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues and that s what this campaign is all about mccain never became beloved by the base the same way his running mate sarah palin did and that was in part because of his willingness do things like that this time around perhaps unsurprisingly there s been no moment like that though there s been plenty of opportunity packer points to pictures of parents standing with their children at rallies with a variety of shirts and signs describing clinton in crude sexual terms is this what we are teaching our little boys packer asked is this what we re teaching these kids is an appropriate way to treat women that you don t agree with and there hasn t been a peep from the campaign about this stuff being offensive and so by not addressing it they have encouraged it those t shirts aren t sold by the campaign and the lowest common denominator has a way of thriving on the periphery of all campaigns but packer and schmidt argue trump s own words have fostered sexism rather than tamping it down the woman s card for example there was trump accusing clinton of playing the woman s card well i think the only card she has is the woman s card trump said in april during a victory speech after sweeping five primaries she s got nothing else going on and frankly if hillary clinton were a man i don t think she d get 5 percent of the vote the only thing she s got going is the women s vote and the beautiful thing is that women don t like her ok he doubled down on that telling a crowd in spokane wash a couple weeks later if she didn t play the woman s card she would have no chance i mean zero of winning clinton shrugged it off and tried to use it to her advantage if fighting for women s health care and paid family leave and equal pay is playing the woman card then deal me in she said in a campaign video after trump s remarks deal me in became something of a call and response catchphrase for clinton the campaign even began selling a pink 5 woman card i just don t think she has a presidential look trump who has made plenty of derogatory comments about women s appearances in this campaign said last month of clinton i just don t think she has a presidential look and you need a presidential look you have to get the job done asked directly about his comment that he didn t think clinton has a presidential look during the first debate trump again said she doesn t have the look before immediately pivoting to talking about her stamina i wasn t impressed then there was the time at a rally where he was talking about the second debate the town hall style event where the candidates walked around on stage she walks in front of me you know and when she walked in front of me believe me i wasn t impressed he said to hoots and laughter from the crowd clinton occasionally nods to her potential at making history but she studiously avoids talking about the sexism directed at her instead she deflects talking about sexism and chauvinism aimed at others backlash with women packer who has made a specialty of helping republicans better communicate with female voters said women do notice trump s language and recognize it the kinds of women that trump would need to win in a general election really recoil at that packer said and it s the kind of thing that causes them to want to defend hillary and that has shown up in the polls since the first debate and especially since the leaked audio of trump bragging about groping and kissing women clinton s lead has expanded it s been because of those very kinds of women white suburban college educated it s why places like pennsylvania colorado and new hampshire have moved more strongly to her corner in 2008 when clinton ran in the primary there were certainly signs of sexism saturday night live joked about a perceived double standard she seemed to face in the debates and if you wanted to you could buy a pantsuit wearing hillary clinton nut cracker actually it is back for 2016 with a longer suit jacket to match clinton s new style but this time as she gets closer to that highest hardest glass ceiling it s even more out in the open said debbie walsh who heads the center for american women and politics at rutgers it is ironic in so many ways walsh said that the person that this woman is running against kind of is almost a caricature of this uber masculine guy with just tremendous bravado so maybe it was fitting that in the waning minutes of the final debate as clinton was answering a question about social security and again getting in a dig at her opponent s taxes trump would interrupt such a nasty woman he interjected many female voters especially millennials scoff at the idea of supporting clinton just because she s a woman but moments like that have experts predicting 2016 could have a historically large gender gap with women overwhelmingly supporting clinton npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
