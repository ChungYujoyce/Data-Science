democratic sen tim kaine and republican gov mike pence twisted the facts in their sole debate by lori robertson eugene kiely brooks jackson robert farley d angelo gore caroline wallace vanessa schipani and jenna wang posted on october 5 2016 updated on october 5 2016 corrected on october 6 2016 farmville va vice presidential candidates mike pence and tim kaine got their one chance to debate and it was a fact checking bonanza we also flagged a host of repeated claims on job growth trump s tax returns abortion and more note to readers our managing editor lori robertson was at the debate at longwood university this story was written with the help of the entire staff based in the philadelphia and washington d c areas our annotated transcript of the debate can be found here the only 2016 debate between the vice presidential candidates was held at longwood university on oct 4 and moderated by cbsn s elaine quijano sen tim kaine of virginia the democratic vice presidential nominee and indiana gov mike pence the republican nominee spoke little about themselves instead they focused their attacks largely at the two candidates at the top of the ticket republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton pence said that s nonsense after kaine claimed trump was proposing a deportation force to go house to house and send away millions of immigrants who are here illegally trump did say that although he has since backed away from it kaine these guys and donald trump has said it deportation force they want to go house to house school to school business to business and kick out 16 million people and i cannot believe pence that s nonsense that s nonsense senator we have a deportation force it s called immigrations and customs enforcement kaine so you like the 16 million deportations pence senator that s that s nonsense actually trump himself said last november in an interview on msnbc you re going to have a deportation force and you re going to do it humanely people will leave people will leave they re going to go back where they came from that s the way it s supposed to be trump said they can come back but they have to come back legally trump was speaking of those now living here illegally currently estimated at about 11 million later trump laid out a plan to target about half that number for quick deportation but stuck by his ultimate goal of deporting all anyone who has entered the united states illegally is subject to deportation trump said in a sept 1 speech in arizona trump also has said that the children of unauthorized immigrants would have to leave even if they were born in the u s and are by law american citizens on nbc s meet the press on aug 16 2015 trump told chuck todd that they have to go todd aug 16 2015 so you re going to split up families trump chuck no no we re going to keep the families together we have to keep the families together todd but you re going to keep them together out trump but they have to go but they have to go we will work with them they have to go chuck we either have a country or we don t have a country if the u s born children of illegal immigrants are also deported the total could conceivably reach 16 million the pew research center estimated that in 2012 4 million unauthorized immigrant adults lived with one or more u s born children so nonsense or not trump indeed has called for a deportation force and the expulsion of many millions of unauthorized immigrants and even their u s born children kaine claimed that pence was the chief cheerleader for privatization of social security that s misleading kaine when congressman pence was in congress he was the chief cheerleader for the privatization of social security even after president bush stopped pushing for it congressman pence kept pushing for it it would be correct to say that pence back in 2005 was willing to go further than president george w bush in establishing voluntary private accounts that would allow workers to invest a portion of their social security payroll taxes in diversified stock mutual funds similar to those the federal government runs for its own employees and retirees pence was then chairman of the house republican study committee a group of conservative lawmakers who called for allowing workers to invest 6 percent of salary in private accounts rather than the 4 percent proposed by bush but as we ve written before it is a deception to call such a plan privatization which implies turning the entire system over to the private sector the private accounts then being proposed would have been purely voluntary and would not have been available to anyone already retired or nearing retirement pence implied clinton was wrong when she cited the fatal shooting of anafrican americanman by an african american cop as a case of implicit or unconscious bias but research shows african americans are not immune to this form of bias against members of their own racial group in his criticism of clinton pence was referring to theshooting of keith lamont scott by officer brentley vinson on sept 20 in charlotte north carolina both men are african american when asked if we ask too much of police officers in this country pence responded by criticizing what clintonsaid about the issue of law enforcement and race relations during the first presidential debate pence oct 4 hillary clinton actually referred to that moment the charlotte shooting as an example of implicit bias in the police force when she was asked in the debate a week ago whether there was implicit bias in law enforcement her only answer was that there s implicit bias in everyone in the united states senator when african american police officers involved in a police action shooting involving an african american why would hillary clinton accuse that african american police officer of implicit bias pence was right that clinton did saythat she thinks implicit bias is a problem for everyone not just police and she did refer to the shooting in charlotte that took place on sept 20 in passing during the debate but she didn t directly accuse brentley vinson the african american police officerinvolved in the shooting ofkeith lamont scott an african american man of implicit bias regardless pence was wrong when heimplied that african americans can t be subject to implicit bias of other african americans according to the stanford encyclopedia of philosophy implicit bias refers to relatively unconscious and relatively automatic features of prejudiced judgment and social behavior while implicit bias is a psychological mechanism that can influence judgmentson a variety of topics substantial research has concentrated on implicit attitudes toward members of socially stigmatized groups such as african americans women and the lgbtq community implicit bias is opposed to explicit bias or judgments a person consciously holds in other words it s possible for a person to explicitly believe that white and black americans should be treated equally for example but implicitly judge situations counter to that explicit belief scientists at harvard have used what they call an implicit association test to quantify implicit bias by measuring the strength of associations between concepts e g black people gay people and evaluations e g good bad or stereotypes e g athletic clumsy the group has looked at a variety of biases including those concerningracial issues and found that even numbers of black respondents showing a pro white bias as show a pro black bias theyhypothesize that this bias might be understood as black respondents experiencing the similar negative associations about their group from experience in their cultural environments so pence was wrong when he implied that african americans can t experience implicit bias against members of their own racial group kaine claimed that trump s plan would raise taxes on the middle class an analysis of the trump plan by a new york university professor found that some middle income taxpayers would see a tax increase but the tax foundation found that most middle income taxpayers would get a tax cut pence donald trump and i are going to cut taxes we re going to we re going to kaine you re not going to cut taxes you re going to raise taxes on the middle class asked for backup for kaine s claim the clinton campaign pointed to a vox article about an analysis of trump s tax plan bylily l batchelder of thenew york university school of law batchelder concluded that trump s plan would actually significantly raise taxes for millions of low and middle income families with children with especially large tax increases for working single parents in all batchelder estimated trump s plan would increase taxes for about 7 8 million families with minor children or roughly 25 million individuals the business backed tax foundation told us it was able to replicate a number ofbatchelder s results but its full analysis of trump s plan using the same assumptions as batchelder found kaine s comment was too sweeping as ourdistributional tables show the typical middle class family would get a net tax cutof several hundred dollars alan cole an economist with the tax foundation told us via email simply put the middle class as a whole would see a tax reduction but some middleclass families would see a tax increase batchelder s analysis was about specific examples cole said not the middle income group at large cole said batchelder s estimate of about 7 8 million households with a total of 25 million individuals sounds about right to me but he noted that the u s as a whole has about 319 million people that comes to a little less than 8 percent of the population all in all we re talking about a single digit percentage of households cole said absolutelyworth mentioning but not the middle class as a whole overall the tax foundation concluded that trump s plan would cut taxes by between 4 4 trillion and 5 9 trillion over 10 years it found that on average taxpayers would see a tax cut at every income level but that the amount and percentage of tax cuts would be greatest for those with the highest incomes pence claimed that less than 10 cents on the dollar in the clinton foundation has gone to charitable causes that s misleading pence is referring only to the amount donated by the clinton foundation to outside charities ignoring the fact that most of the clinton foundation s charitable work is performed in house one independent philanthropy watchdog did an analysis of clinton foundation funding and concluded that about 87 percent of its funding went to charity carly fiorina made a similar comment during the republican primary and as we wrote at the time simply put despite its name the clinton foundation is not a private foundation which typically acts as a pass through for private donations to other charitable organizations rather it is a public charity it conducts most of its charitable activities directly among its charitable activities training rural farmers in africa and helping them get access to seeds equipment and markets for their crops helping reforestation efforts in africa and the caribbean region lowering the cost of hiv aids medicine in nations around the world and working withlocal governments and businesses in the united states to develop wellness and physical activity plans the clinton foundation s latest irs form 990 shows total revenue of nearly 178 million in 2014 and total outside charitable grant disbursements of about 5 1 million see part ix that comes to less than 3 percent of the budget going to grants it came to about 6 percent in 2013 katherina rosqueta the founding executive director of the center for high impact philanthropy at the university of pennsylvania described the clinton foundation as an operating foundation there is an important distinction between an operating foundation vs a non operating foundation rosqueta told us back in june an operating foundation implements programs so money it raises is not designed to be used exclusively for grant making purposes when most people hear foundation they think exclusively of a grant making entity in either case the key is to understand how well the foundation uses money whether to implement programs or to grant out to nonprofits to achieve the intended social impact e g improving education creating livelihoods improving health etc according to charity navigator the clinton foundation spends about 87 percent of its expenses on programs and services it delivers it gives the clinton foundation an overall rating of four stars charity watch gave the clinton foundation an a rating the clinton foundation spends 87 percent of its budget on charitable work asaffirmed by independent charity watchdogs brian cookstra a spokesman for the clinton foundation told us in an email after the debate the clinton foundation is an operatingfoundation which means our programs do the charitable work on the ground themselves we are not a grant making organization pence said the clinton foundation has been a platform for the clintons to travel the world to have staff as we wrote in june the clinton foundation spent12 percent of its revenue on travel and conferences and 20 percent of its revenue on salaries in 2013 but the form 990 specifically breaks out those travel conference and salary expenses that are used for program service expenses versus those that are used for management or fundraising purposes for example nearly 77 percent of the 8 4 million spent on travel in 2013 went toward program services 3 4 percent went to management and general expenses and about 20 percent went to fundraising pence said the trump foundation s a private family foundation they give virtually every cent in the trump foundation to charitable causes but that s far from true there have been several examples of the donald j trump foundation making expenditures on items and groups that are not charitable causes and unlike typical family foundations the trump foundation s money has since 2008 come from others not from trump s own pocket the washington post reported sept 10 in tax records the last gift from trump was in 2008 since then all of the donations have been other people s money an arrangement that experts say is almost unheard of for a family foundation in all but four of its first 28 years of operation the trump foundation took in well under 1 million by far its biggest year was 2007 when it took in just over 4 million of which only 35 000 came from trump himself according to the washington post kaine and pence were both partly right and partly wrong in characterizing trump s statements on other countries including japan and south korea getting nuclear weapons kaine donald trump believes that the world will be safer if more nations have nuclear weapons he said saudi arabia should get them japan should get them korea should get them and when he was confronted with this and told wait a minute terrorists could get those proliferation could lead to nuclear war here s what donald trump said and i quote go ahead folks enjoy yourselves later in the debate kaine asked pence to defend trump s positions startingwith more nations should get nuclear weapons pence responded well he never said that senator trump didn t make a blanket statement about more nations getting nuclear weapons but he has indicated that perhaps japan and south korea should havenuclear weapons to protect themselves for instance here s trump in an april 3 interview with fox news chris wallace trump april 3 so north korea has nukes japan has a problem with that i mean they have a big problem with that maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from north korea wallace with nukes trump maybe they would be better off including with nukes yes including with nukes about a week earlier the new york times reported that trump had said in interviews with the newspaper that he would be open to allowing japan and south korea to build their own nuclear arsenals rather than depend on the american nuclear umbrella for their protection against north korea and china the times quoted trump as saying if the u s keeps on its path its current path of weakness they re going to want to have that anyway with or without me discussing it on march 29 cnn s anderson cooper tried to pin down trump on those comments in the back and forth trump said i don t want more nuclear weapons but also said wouldn t you rather in a certain sense have japan have nuclear weapons when north korea has nuclear weapons trump march 29 at some point we have to say you know what we re better off if japan protects itself against this maniac in north korea we re better off frankly if south korea is going to start to protect itself we have cooper saudi arabia nuclear weapons trump saudi arabia absolutely cooper you would be fine with them having nuclear weapons trump no not nuclear weapons but they have to protect themselves or they have to pay us here s the thing with japan they have to pay us or we have to let them protect themselves cooper so if you said japan yes it s fine you get nuclear weapons south korea you as well and saudi arabia says we want them too trump can i be honest with you it s going to happen anyway it s going to happen anyway it s only a question of time they re going to start having them or we have to get rid of them entirely but you have so many countries already china pakistan you have so many countries russia you have so many countries right now that have them now wouldn t you rather in a certain sense have japan have nuclear weapons when north korea has nuclear weapons and they do have them they absolutely have them they can t they have no carrier system yet but they will very soon wouldn t you rather have japan perhaps they re over there they re very close they re very fearful of north korea and we re supposed to protect cooper so you re saying you don t want more nuclear weapons in the world but you re ok with japan and south korea having nuclear weapons trump i don t want more nuclear weapons as for the go ahead folks enjoy yourselves quote that kaine mentions that wasn t directly in response to trump being told that terrorists could get hold of nuclear weapons or that proliferation could lead to nuclear war as kaine suggested instead trump said that in an april 2 campaign appearance in wausau wisconsin in talking about japan protecting itself against north korea and the two countries potentially fighting here s that quote trump april 2 we re protecting japan from north korea i would say to japan you gotta help us out and i would rather have them not arm but i m not going to continue to lose this tremendous amount of money and frankly the case could be made that let them protect themselves againstnorth korea they d probablywipe them out pretty quick and if they fight you know what that would be a terrible thing terrible good luck folks enjoy yourself if they fight that would be terrible right but if they do they do pence said that he did not say as kaine claimed that russian president vladimir putin was a better leader than president obama technically pence didn t say better leader he said that putin has been a stronger leader in russia than president obama has been in the u s kaine governor pence said inarguably vladimir putin is a better leader than president obama pence that is absolutely inaccurate i said he has been stronger on the world stage in a cnn interview on sept 8 pence said i think it s inarguable that vladimir putin has been a stronger leader in his country than barack obama has been in this country and that s going to change the day that donald trump becomes president of the united states of america two days later pence told a crowd at the liberty farm festival that his comment was meant as an indictment of obama and not an endorsement of putin when donald trump and i said that the small and bullying president of russia was a strong leader on the world stage that wasn t an endorsement of vladimir putin that was an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership of this president and hillary clinton pence said kaine claimed that trump said that nato is obsolete and that he wants to get rid of nato trump did say nato is obsolete or may be but he hasn t said that the international security alliance should be eliminated kaine that s why donald trump s claim that he wants to that nato is obsolete and that we need to get rid of nato is so dangerous pence that s not his plan kaine well he said nato is obsolete there is no question that trump has said more than once that the north atlantic treaty organization either is obsolete or may be obsolete he also previously suggested in an interview with the new york times in july that he would not automatically defend nato allies thatdo not pay their share of defense costs however as we wrote in may trump has said that he doesn t want the u s to leave the nato alliance even though he once said that he would certainly look at doing so then during the first presidential debate with clinton trump said that he is all for nato trump sept 26 i said and very strongly nato could be obsolete because they do not focus on terror and i was very strong and i said it numerous times but i m all for nato but i said they have to focus on terror also and trump has since said when i am president we will strengthen nato and there were more claims from the candidates that we ve fact checked before unemployment pence compared apples to oranges in talking about the two candidates records as governors when he said in the state of indiana we ve cut unemployment in half unemployment doubled when he was governor as we wrote in august kaine was governor during the great recession when every state saw unemployment rates rise significantly and pence who took office in 2013 has served during the subsequent economic expansion when every state but one sawjob gains job growth kaine cited a moody s analytics report on the impact of clinton s plans on job growth but heleft out important caveats kaine said independent analysts say the clinton plan would grow the economy by 10 5 million jobs the trump plan would cost 3 5 million jobs first most of those 10 million jobs would occur under current law only 3 2 million would happen as a result of clinton s plans plus moody s said the figures cited by kaine were unlikely to happen in the most likely scenario job growth under clinton was a bit higher than under current law and jobs would be added under trump but not as many as current law trump s tax returns in criticizing trump for refusing to release his tax returns kaine made a misleading comparison to richard nixon claiming that nixon released tax returns when he was under audit and chiding trump for failing to meet the nixon standard nixon never publicly released his tax returns as a candidate though he did amid a swirling tax controversy during his second term in 1973 abortion pence criticized clinton for supporting a practice like partial birth abortion adding that the very idea that a child that is almost born into the world could still have their life taken from them is just anathema to me as we have written before clinton has said she s open to restrictions on late term abortions if there are exceptions for endangerment of the life and health of the mother border security pence wrongly claimed that clinton and kaine have a plan for open borders clinton supported a bill that would have created a path to citizenship for those in the country illegally but it also would have increased border security on her campaign website clinton says she would focus resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety but the site also states that she will uphold the rule of law and protect our borders and national security minimum wage kaine repeated the misleading claim that trump said wages are too high trump has not said that overall wages are too high at a nov 10 2015 gop debate trump was asked about raising the federal minimum wage to 15 and he said he was opposed to that new jobs pence criticized kaine s economic policy by saying the policies of the obama administration which hillary clinton and sen kaine want to continue have run this economy into a ditch in response kaine claimed fifteen million new jobs were created under the obama administration actually the number of new jobs created is 10 5 million kaine s count which clinton also has used excludes public sector job losses and starts at february 2010 the low point of employment during the great recession a total of 15 1 million private sector jobs were created between february 2010 and august 2016 however overall employment including government jobs has increased by 10 5 million since obama took office in january 2009 update oct 5 we updated this story to include a link to our annotated transcript of the debate correction oct 6 we removed an item from this story regarding the fbi investigation of hillary clinton s private email system we misattributed a quote to pence based on a live rushed transcript that proved to be inaccurate kaine said that the fbi concluded that not one reasonable prosecutor would bring charges against clinton for mishandling classified information we wrote that pence disputed kaine s characterization of the fbi s findings and we mistakenly quoted pence as saying that is absolutely false but pence did not say that we regret the error fausset richardand blinder alan man is shot in charlotte as unrest stretches to second night the new york times
