 the 360 shows you diverse perspectives on the day s top stories and debates what s happening one of the most challenging pieces of guidance to help stem the spread of the coronavirus has been advising people to limit in person interactions to those they live with for some that means being stuck inside with only family members for weeks on end for those who live alone it means complete solitude at home limiting close contact with others is the most important step in containing the number of infections but sticking to those restrictions can carry a heavy mental health toll several countries have begun exploring the idea of social bubbles which allow people to expand their groups beyond their household members to alleviate the strain of isolation social bubbles are essentially partnerships between groups of people who all agree to limit their in person contact to others within the group this arrangement in theory could satisfy people s social needs while adding only a small amount of infection risk new zealand implemented a bubble system as part of its successful containment of the virus the belgian government is reportedly considering allowing citizens to create social groups of up to 10 people they can see without social distancing rules some provinces in canada recently began to allow members of two separate households to join up in double bubbles the u k government has said it may enact similar measures while no formal rules around shared household bubbles exist in the u s some american families have joined forces to alleviate the strain of lockdown why there s debate advocates for social bubbles say letting people expand their circle of friends may be an important step in establishing a sustainable way of life amid the ongoing pandemic strict isolation while the most effective means of containing the virus may not be something most people can maintain much longer bubbles could provide the social nourishment people need plus some much needed help with day to day needs like shopping and childcare with only a slight increase in risk if members stay within their groups bubbles may even prove necessary to avoid more dangerous outcomes if people become overwhelmed by quarantine fatigue and abandon distancing measures altogether some psychologists say there must be a middle ground between all of us staying at home and all of us meeting the people we want in the ways we want to a british researcher studying the feasibility of bubbles told cnn contained social circles would also make it easier to limit isolated outbreaks before they spread to the broader population skeptics of social bubbles argue that they may create more risk the more people in a group the more opportunities for someone to become infected if someone does contract the virus they risk passing it to a larger number of people social bubbles rely on a level of commitment that may be unrealistic to expect people to maintain over a long period of time some argue bubbles may be helpful only in limited circumstances some argue in which none of the members include essential workers who have to break the bubble to go to work or high risk individuals like the elderly or the immunocompromised others say the idea has merit but the u s hasn t contained the coronavirus enough yet for bubbles to be effective being part of a bubble may prevent people from even riskier behavior we know the longer distancing goes on the more likely people are to want to try these kinds of things it s lower risk than what people are doing haphazardly epidemiologist dr amesh adalja to insider larger groups mean more risk it s hard to guarantee that someone in the group isn t going to be exposed if they are they are bringing that exposure to a larger group of people than they would if they were with only their own family deborah netburn los angeles times bubbles would only work in certain circumstances people are going to have to be guided by what the situation is locally and who it is they are thinking about getting together with and what the individual risks may be in terms of people s age and other health conditions infectious diseases expert daniel kuritzkes to wall street journal bubbles with one untrustworthy member will be compromised your bubble is only as strong as its weakest link if one or more members of your group are interacting with people outside of your network the bubble becomes less effective as a preventative measure so if you must choose wisely but if you can stay home for now anagha srikanth the hill it s a good idea but more research is needed until more research is done it s impossible to know whether gradually expanding the quarantine circle of trust beyond immediate households should be part of that conversation but there s something about the idea that goes instinctively with the grain of how many people will eventually want to emerge from hiding not with a rush but gradually nervously and preferably in the company of those we love most gaby hinsliff guardian the u s doesn t have testing capacity to keep bubbles safe yet i think we need to look at the data and let science guide us before we start making recommendations about socialization we need to have the ability to contact trace test and quarantine people who may be contacts of positive cases because that will be the only way to prevent large outbreaks from taking off again infectious diseases expert dr krutika kuppalli to cnn only the right mix of people can make an effective bubble the pandemic forces us into binary choices you can probably join only one quaranteam at a time and what you re going into isn t a friendship but a partnership you can be great friends with someone you would never even contemplate starting a business with this is like that gideon lichfield mit technology review bubbles won t work if stay at home measures are lifted a full reopening of the economy and a complete return to work something that some americans are agitating for would make the bubble a fairly pointless measure molly olmstead slate is there a topic you d like to see covered in the 360 send your suggestions to
