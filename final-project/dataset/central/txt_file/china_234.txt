last saturday the new york times released more than 400 pages of internal chinese documents that provide an unprecedented inside look at the crackdown on ethnic minorities in the xinjiang region new york timesboth sides condemn china and call for a forceful response the echo of 1984 brave new world or fahrenheit 451 is unmistakable but this is not dystopian fiction the existence of these re education camps has been known for some time but nothing before had offered so lucid a glimpse into the thinking of china s bosses under the fist of mr xi from the obsessive determination to stamp out the virus of unauthorized thought to cynical preparations for the pushback to come including how to deal with questions from students returning to empty homes and untended farms the chinese government made no effort to deny the leaked documents but rather portrayed the crackdown in xinjiang as a major success against terrorism and accused the times of smearing china s antiterrorism and de extremism capabilities what the documents really reveal is not an effective antiterrorism campaign but rather the paranoia of totalitarian leaders who demand total fealty in thought and deed and recognize no method of control other than coercion and fear the whistleblower s brave action is a cry to the world international outrage could turn that into a wake up call for china s leaders despite their totalitarian swagger if the world begins to see them as pariahs not just trading partners the whistle blower and the untold thousands of chinese muslims suffering under the yoke of mr xi deserve that editorial board new york times mr xi has tried to consolidate his power and build a cult of personality and his repression of the uighurs fits that pattern but the leaked documents suggest there is internal dissent in beijing s corridors of power that could grow and challenge mr xi if his uighur repression begins to carry international costs the same applies to a crackdown in hong kong so far however the west has been largely silent and muslim countries are worse a good start would be to put xinjiang and hong kong on the public agenda of all world forums involving chinese leaders china will try to intimidate into silence countries that depend on its money and trade but that s no excuse for western leaders the world bank or united nations chinese leaders care about world opinion and they need to hear that the world will not ignore their abuses against the uighurs editorial board wall street journal china s communists would repress its people regardless of what we do but our open and extensive economic ties finance the regime s power we had hoped the regime would liberalize once it saw how rich it could become by becoming more western instead open economic ties enrich its economy while western governments turn a blind eye to the terrors the government perpetuates carrots have not worked if we want china to liberalize and if we want to reduce its potential threat to our way of life we need to start looking at using sticks china s government needs rapid economic growth to further its power and ambitions its people have become used to capitalist comforts any slowing of that growth would raise the potential for discontent and unrest among the chinese themselves it should be u s policy to slow that growth and thereby force the chinese government to choose between freedom and repression between guns and butter henry olsen washington postdated but relevant the un committee on the elimination of racial discrimination has called xinjiang a no rights zone amid the mass detention of several million ethnic and religious minorities many foreign companies appear to be benefiting from this by one estimate nearly half of europe s 150 largest companies have some presence in xinjiang the region accounts for 84 of chinese cotton production as pointed out in a recent csis study china is the world s largest cotton exporter accounting for 26 of global exports the united nations guiding principles on business and human rights calls on businesses to prevent and mitigate the actual and potential human rights abuses associated with their business practices because of the potential for gross human rights abuses of doing business in xinjiang all foreign companies there should end their business partnerships it is time for a global blacklist on all goods produced or manufactured in xinjiang michael caster the guardianother opinions below the global response to the detention of up to 1 million people in concentration camps on the basis of religion a systematic attempt to wipe out a cultural identity that verges on cultural genocide feels fairly muted few companies or organizations are boycotting china in two years the beijing winter olympics are likely to go off without a hitch the u s response is undermined by the fact that the officials drawing attention to the camps do not include president donald trump this is more than just a china problem president bashar al assad now appears virtually guaranteed to remain in power in syria india has faced little pressure over its crackdown in kashmir rohingya refugees in bangladesh are being urged by local authorities to repatriate back to myanmar where they face grisly violence that spurred them to leave in the first place if other governments in the future are tempted to use mass violence against civilians or ethnic cleansing as a means to combat terrorism or extremism there s no reason to believe they ll face serious condemnation much less serious consequences joshua keating slate dated but relevant the sexual violence against and forced sterilization of uighur women and removal of uighur children constitute crimes against humanity so why isn t the international community taking a stand even if the camps are disbanded china s gendered policies would remain in addition to demanding that the chinese government close the internment camps the u s government and the rest of the world must insist that the government end the abuse of uighur women as well elizabeth m lynch washington post why is this not the biggest story in the world now why are the muslim countries the arab ones as well as iran turkey pakistan indonesia so silent about it is it because of that sweet sweet beijing cash or do they just not care no one can plausibly begrudge beijing its desire to stop islamic extremism but the chinese communists are eradicating an ancient culture and a religion from the face of the earth in xinjiang province and the world just stands by watching because china is rich and powerful enough to get away with it rod dreher the american conservative the leak of the papers shows there is at least some resistance inside china to what is being done to muslims in xinjiang but i suspect there is a mole hunt taking place today to root out and punish whoever leaked this for that person s sake i hope they covered their tracks well it s hard to overstate what a nightmare this must be for the people on the receiving end and their families but also for some of the people tasked with administering this program i doubt the people doing the teaching in these camps want to be doing it either but they have no say there is no room in a one party system for differences of opinion once the leader has spoken finally it needs to be said that this is what it looks like when the left goes too far this is the leftist project come to complete fruition the collective good as determined by the party taking precedence over the rights of every individual and it s not some fringe system happening in a small corner of the world it s the system currently running the world s most populous country with more than four times the population of the united states john
