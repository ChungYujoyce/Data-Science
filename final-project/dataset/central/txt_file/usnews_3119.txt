conditioner company comes as a win for the president elect who made the issue of retaining manufacturing jobs in the united states a core economic focus of his campaign trump has said he will overhaul the corporate tax code to be more friendly to businesses like carrier and the company will receive economic incentives worth 7 million which were negotiated by vice president elect mike pence who is still governor of indiana according to the new york times despite the deal with trump carrier still plans to close a plant in huntington indiana which will result in about 700 jobs moving to mexico

told job announcements are almost a daily thing here in the state of indiana we re at record employment today we have more hoosiers going to work than ever before and that s why frankly along with all of you who work in this facility that that day february 10th was a heartbreaking day when carrier made the difficult decision to close this facility and move jobs out of our country we met with the leaders of the company back in march and try as we might to make the indiana case it was clear that the die was cast the simple truth was that policies coming out of our nation s capital were literally driving jobs out of this country what was missing was clear to me as your governor what was missing was leadership and change well the american people voted for change last month and even before taking office our president elect provided real leadership that made the difference applause pence you know president elect donald trump did just what he said he would do he picked up the phone i was actually in the room he picked up the phone he talked from one american to another he talked about our plans our plans to make america more competitive to reduce taxes to roll back regulations

hearts applause i m very humbled to be standing before you today i truly am my family and i are deeply moved by the opportunities the people of indiana have given us and now the american people have

victory for the governor elect he won very convincingly so we re very proud of him and you know mike has been such a wise decision for me when people were saying i don t know how good is he at decision making they d always say yeah but he picked mike pence that s a good decision and everybody loves mike he s become something very special applause i want to thank greg hayes of united technologies because when i called him he was right there i wish i could have made the call when they were doing their original decision but it worked out just as well other than i would have liked to have had an answer a year and a half ago we had a tremendous love affair with the state of indiana because if you remember during the primaries this was going to be the firewall this was where they were going to stop trump right and that didn t work out too well trump and it was a firewall for me it was a firewall and we won by 16 points and the election we just won by 20 points almost 20 points applause and that was some victory that s pretty that s pretty great and i just love the people incredible people so i got involved because of the love affair i ve had this has been a very special state to us and i ll never forget about a week ago i was watching the nightly news i won t say which one because i don t want to give them credit because i don t like them much i ll be honest laughter i don t like them not even a little bit but they were doing a story on carrier and i say wow that s something i want to see that and they had a gentleman worker great guy handsome guy he was on and it was like he didn t even know they were leaving he said something to the effect no we re not leaving because donald trump promised us that we re not leaving and i never thought i made that promise not with carrier i made it for everybody else i didn t make it really for carrier and i said what s he saying and he was such a believer and he was such a great guy he said i ve been with donald trump from the beginning and he made the statement that carrier s not going anywhere they re not leaving and i m saying to myself man and then they played my statement and i said carrier will never leave but that was a euphemism i was talking about carrier like all other companies from here on in because they made the decision a year and a half ago but he believed that that was and i could understand it i actually said i didn t make it when they played that i said i did make it but i didn t mean it quite that way so now because of him whoever that guy was is he in the room by any chance that s your son stand up you did a good job applause you did a great job right that s fantastic and i love your shirt oh wow laughter put it on cameras go ahead put it on well your son is great and he meant that didn t he he really meant it at first i said i wonder if he s being sarcastic because this ship has sailed and then i said it was 6 30 in the evening and i said boy the first thing i m going to do is go there and say do i call the head of carrier who s a great guy but i ve always learned i ve got to call the top and i heard about greg hayes he s a great executive you know i don t know if you know united technologies is one of the top 50 companies in the united states and one of the top companies anywhere in the world they make many other things other than air conditioners believe me their list of companies is incredible so i called greg hayes i heard of him but i never met him and he picked up the phone mr president elect sir how are you it s wonderful to win you know that think if i lost he wouldn t have returned my call i don t know if where is greg i don t know would you if i lost and called you i don t think you would have called i would have tried for you but i think it would have been tougher right what do you think greg yes he s sort of nodding yes you re right laughter but i called greg and i said it s really important we have to do something because you have a lot of people leaving and you have to understand we can t allow this to happen anymore with our country so many jobs are leaving and going to other countries not just mexico many many countries and china is making so much of our product that we re closing up a lot of plants and i mean i wrote down some numbers that are incredible but the numbers of manufacturing jobs that are lost especially in the rust belt and the rust belt is so incredible but we re losing companies it s it s unbelievable one after another just one after another so i said greg you ve got to help us out here we got to sit down we got to do something and i said because we just can t let it happen anyway he was incredible and he said i understand and i said i wish i made this call a year and a half ago it would have been a lot easier call only because of your son ok believe me your son whoever the hell your son is these people owe him a lot and i just went through he s out in the factory i thought they were all going to be in this room this room s not big enough unknown off mike trump yes i know i don t know who arranged that one because i had we just visited a thousand people in the factory that are going wild in the plant trump but i will tell you that united technologies and carrier stepped it up and now they re keeping actually the number s over 1 100 people which is so great which is so great ph applause and i see the people i shook hands with a lot of the people they re right behind us working i guess what is it you re so you re making so many air conditioners you didn t want to even have them come off for a half hour he s a ruthless boss he s ruthless but that s ok you know i did say one thing to the carrier folks and to the united technologies folks i said the goodwill that you have engendered by doing this all over the world frankly but within our country you watch how fast you re going to make it up because so many people are going to be buying carrier air conditioners you know we ve had such help here bobby knight nobody in indiana ever heard of bobby knight how great is bobby knight applause lou holtz gene keady we had such incredible support but i ll never forget a friend of mine called up and said during the primaries he said you know if you could get coach knight and i said you know coach knight called me a year ago this was a year before i decided to run he said if you ever run i m supporting you i said thanks coach i just don t know if i m going to be doing it and then when he said if you could get coach knight i ll tell you i got coach knight how good was bobby knight as far as we re concerned in indiana is that right applause we got bobby knight nine hundred wins two championships right two or three championships olympic gold medal pan am games but and he was unbelievable he wouldn t stop he was just going all over he was the greatest guy we came into an arena greg and we had 16 000 people inside outside we had i think 10 000 outside it was and i left this was three weeks before the primary and i left i said how are we going to lose indiana with this i didn t think we were going to lose and we didn t we won big but so i want to thank all of those folks because it really helped with indiana and with a lot of other cases so united technologies has stepped up and i have to say this they did it in such a nice and such a professional way and they re going to spend so much money on renovating this plant and i said greg say that number you know he said 16 million well the minimum number is 16 it s going to be in my opinion a lot more than that he said well i d rather say the lower number see i d rather have him say the higher number so i won t say it ok it s just a difference in philosophy do you agree both are ok but a difference in philosophy but they re going to spend more than 16 they re going to spend a lot of money on the plant and i said to some of the folks i said companies are not going to leave the united states any more without consequences not going to happen it s not going to happen i ll tell you right now applause we re losing our we re losing so much so one of the things we re doing to keep them is we re going to lowering our business tax from 35 percent hopefully down to 15 percent which would take us from the highest taxed national virtually in the world this is terrible for business to one of the lower taxed not the lowest yet but one of the lower taxed the other thing we re doing is regulations the regulations are in fact if i asked greg and your folks you would probably say regulations might be worse for you than even the high taxes which is the biggest surprise of the whole political experience i thought taxes would be number one regulations would be up there some place believe me these great leaders of industry and even the small business people who are just being crushed if they have their choice between lower taxes and a major massive cutting of regulations they would take the regulations i don t know how you feel about that greg but i just noticed i wrote down because i heard it since about six years ago 260 new federal regulations have passed 53 of which affect this plant fifty tree new regulations massively expensive and probably none of them amount to anything in terms of safety or the things that you d have regulations for six of eight of the air conditioning companies right now are located in mexico six of eight i mean think of that and 80 percent of the supply chain for mexico 80 percent is located in mexico and we re not going to have it any more so we re not going to have it any more and we like mexico we think it s wonderful i was there three months ago with the president of mexico terrific guy but we have to have a fair shake we re not getting anything we have nafta which is a total and complete disaster it s a total and complete disaster applause it s a one lane highway into mexico nothing coming our way everything going their way and i don t have to mention who signed it anymore it s so nice i don t have to mention who backed it anymore right we don t have to mention that anymore fortunately trump but it s a one way street and it s going to be changed it s going to be changed we have to bring our jobs back and when they expand one of the things that made me so happy is when greg said that they have over 10 000 jobs that they re going to be producing in the very near future and now he s looking to the united states instead of outside of the united states where almost all of those jobs would have gone so one of the reasons i wanted to do this particular conference is it s so great so many people in the other that big big beautiful plant behind us which will be even more beautiful in about seven months from now they re so happy they re going to have a great christmas that s most important but also i just want to let all of the other companies know that we re going to do great things for business there s no reason for them to leave anymore because your taxes are going to be at the very very low end and your unnecessary regulations are going to be gone we need regulations for safety and environment and things but most of the regulations are nonsense become a major industry the writing of regulations and that these companies aren t going to be leaving anymore they re not going to be taking people s hearts out they re not going to be announcing like they did at carrier that they re closing up and they re moving to mexico over 1 100 jobs and by the way that number is going to go up very substantially as they expand this area this plant so the 1 100 is going to be a minimum number so i just want to thank everybody and specifically i just have to thank the people that i met backstage incredible people the spirit the love people are crying i mean they re all crying and it s taken us a little while but think of this i don t think we even announced we were running when this deal was originally announced and in the end what happened is because that makes it much more difficult i mean it s hard to negotiate when the plant is built you know what greg said greg said but you know the plant is almost built right i said greg i don t care it doesn t make any difference don t worry about it what are we going to do with the plant rent it sell it knock it down i don t care but we re going to do and they re going to do fine with their plant i don t know if they re going to be able to do with an american company but we ll figure that out applause but where we re starting is from a much easier place that s hard a year and a half ago they make an announcement and you know all of that work is done which is why i have such respect i would say great business people they have flexibility you know if you re hardline well we re not going to move flexibility that s why they ve done so well over the years that s why it s a great company because they have flexibility but we re not going to need so much flexibility for other companies because we are going to have a situation where they re going to know number one we re going to treat them well and number two there will be consequences meaning they will be taxed very heavily at the border if they want to leave fire all their people leave make product in different companies in different countries and then think they re going to sell that product over the border which by the way will be a very strong border a very strong border believe me applause and i think companies oh we re going to build the wall people are saying do you think trump s going to build the wall trust me we re going to build a wall and by the way people are going to come through that wall we re going to have doors in that wall but they re going to come through legally and people are going to come through on worker permits to work the fields we re going to have people a lot of people are going to come through but it s going to be done through a legal process applause but one thing that s not going to come through is drugs the drugs are going to stop applause the drugs are going to stop so i just want to thank all of the people at united technologies most particularly you because you are fantastic greg i want to thank and i want you to tell me how much how many air conditioning units you sold in the last six months from today because i want to say i think it s going to be a number that even will surprise your folks because of the tremendous goodwill that you ve created i want to thank all of the workers at this plant all of the carrier workers most importantly applause i want to thank my great great vice president elect because i ll tell you what one of the really good decisions but i want to thank mike and we re going to be doing this and if i have to tell you you know doing speeches i d say they say it s not presidential to call up these massive leaders of business i think it s very presidential and if it s not presidential that s ok that s ok because i actually like doing it applause trump but we re going to have a lot of great people that can also do it and do it as well as i do it but we re going to have a lot of phone calls made to companies when they say they re thinking about leaving this country because they re not leaving this country they re not going to leave this country and the workers are going to keep their jobs and they can leave from state to state and they can negotiate good deals with the different states and all of that but leaving the country is going to be very very difficult so i want to thank everybody we love you folks i want to really really thank the people of indiana we had two massive victories in a very very short period of time and all of the workers have a great great christmas and a fantastic new year thank you very much everybody thank you thank you thank you very much applause end contact us at editors time com
