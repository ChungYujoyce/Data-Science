from a historical angle trump s a shoo in for the 2020 gop nomination only one elected president before him franklin pierce wanted but did not receive his party s nomination to run for a second term controversies while trump has benefitted from that stable economy among other achievements the administration has taken countless hits for trump s former associates his tweets and his policies two years after the election he has not released his tax returns his second supreme court pick was accused of sexual assault and his epa chief resigned amid piling ethics complaints his administration has been sued over an immigration policy that separated migrant children from their families and has watched trump s former colleagues face charges and indictments for foreign lobbying tax fraud and lying to federal officers after months of speculation former vice president joe biden announced he was running for president on april 25 we are in the battle for the soul of this nation he said during a

and then on a local county council before becoming one of the youngest senators in history at age 29 he won re election six times and served on the powerful senate foreign relations committee before barack obama tapped him as his running mate in 2008 rationale despite a few gaffes biden was well liked as a two term vice president for many democrats the experienced politician is a reminder of what they perceived as a healthy obama presidency controversies before his april 2019 announcement biden had made two other unsuccessful bids for the white house he s been criticized for the way in which he physically interacts with female colleagues often hugging and kissing them on the face sen kamala harris announced she was running for president on martin luther king jr day this is a moment in

powerful senate judiciary committee which held hearings ahead of then supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh s full senate confirmation vote there she asked him tough questions in line with her history as a prosecutor are you willing to ask the white house to authorize the fbi to investigate the claims against you she asked are you willing to ask the white house to conduct an investigation by the fbi to get to whatever you believe the bottom of the allegations that have been levied against you she repeated adding i don t want to debate with you how they do their business i m just asking are you willing to ask the white house to conduct such an investigation say yes or no and then we can move on she finally stated though kavanaugh deflected each time if elected harris would be the first female african american and first indian american president as well as the first woman to hold the highest title in the country the senator is off to a good start in the financial department in her first day of campaigning harris raised approximately 1 5 million dollars controversies harris is a successful politician today because of her past as a prosecutor but that could do her disservice too some in the criminal justice community have expressed concerns that her actions as a california district attorney and attorney general disproportionately affected marginalized communities since announcing her candidacy she s publicly addressed the criticisms i was the attorney general of california for two terms and i had a host of clients that i was obligated to defend and represent she said i couldn t fire my clients and there were unfortunately situations that occurred where my clients took positions that were contrary to my beliefs sen elizabeth warren officially announced her candidacy at a feb 9 rally in lawrence massachusetts she had previously announced an exploratory committee it won t be enough to just undo the terrible acts of this administration she told the crowd gathered in her home state we can t afford to just tinker around the edges a tax credit here a regulation there our fight is for big structural change qualifications warren earned degrees from the

wage job after her dad suffered a heart attack after he recovered he eventually became a janitor her father raised a daughter who got to be a public school teacher a law professor and a senator we got a real opportunity to build something warren says in the video working families today face a lot tougher path than my family did controversies warren released the results of a dna test in attempt to debunk claims that she was not part native american she had faced pushback on the topic during previous election cycles after it was discovered she was listed as a minority in staff directories when she taught law the report confirmed native american genes were in her pedigree but that the relative could have been from six to 10 generations ago some have criticized the connection as too distant to be of note sen cory booker announced he was running for president in a video message posted to his twitter account on feb 1 we are better when we help each other he says in the footage i believe that we can build a country where no one is forgotten no one is left behind where parents can put food on the table where there are good paying jobs with good benefits in every neighborhood where our criminal justice system keeps us safe instead of shuffling more children into cages and coffins where we see the faces of our leaders on television and feel pride not shame qualifications booker 49

rationale booker routinely sponsors bills that aim to alleviate poverty expand affordable access to healthcare and raise the minimum wage raised by two civil rights activists booker is a staunch defender of equality especially among african americans latinos and women generations of heroic americans have made our nation more inclusive more expansive and more just he said while addressing the democratic national convention in 2016 our nation wasn t founded because we all look alike or prayed alike or descended from the same family tree but our founders in their genius in this the oldest constitutional democracy on the planet earth they put forth the idea that all are created equal that we have inalienable rights like sen kamala harris booker garnered broader name recognition for questions he asked during then supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh s confirmation hearings about the sexual assault allegations lodged against him by christine blasey ford so sir let s just be clear booker started you have problems with the senators that are up here and how we conducted it but you re not saying in any way that she is a political pawn a political operative you have sympathy for her she is talking about a sexual assault is that correct moments later booker doubled down do you wish that she never came forward to which kavanaugh responded senator i did not do this if elected booker could be the first unmarried person elected president since the 1800s however he recently confirmed he has a girlfriend controversies while at stanford booker wrote a column in his college newspaper describing an incident with a young woman that took place when he was 15 after having my hand pushed away once i reached my mark he wrote the next week in school she told me that she was drunk that night and didn t really know what she was doing booker then a peer counselor wrote that if he was going to advocate against sexual misconduct he had to own up to his own mistakes when i hesitated in writing this column i realized i was basking in hypocrisy it reads so instead i chose to write and risk after a failed run for the democratic nomination in 2016 sen bernie sanders is trying again on feb 19 he announced his candidacy three years ago during our 2016 campaign when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were radical and extreme sanders wrote in an email to supporters citing healthcare education and income inequality three years have come and gone and as result of millions of americans standing up and fighting back all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of americans qualifications sanders graduated from university of chicago with a bachelor s degree in political science he moved to vermont a few years after graduation where after several unsuccessful gubernatorial and senate campaigns he was elected burlington s mayor for four consecutive terms in 1990 he was elected to the house making him the first self identifying independent elected to the chamber in decades when a senate seat opened up in 2005 sanders won the election with the backing of several prominent democrats including sen chuck schumer he s been re elected twice rationale sanders has long advocated for a 15 federal minimum wage universal healthcare and campaign finance reform he s been involved in social protests since college and has the support of many blue collar workers especially in the midwest in his 2016 run sanders claimed new hampshire s primary nomination by more than 20 points and narrowly lost to former secretary of state hillary clinton in iowa s caucuses controversies some have argued that sanders an independent uses the democratic party only when it s convenient for him i would love to hear sanders s opinion on how the democratic party can rebound and rebuild but it has to be preceded by him actually joining the party not merely using it as a vessel for his run for president wrote former obama and hillary clinton campaign member michael starr hopkins in an opinion piece for the hill others have lambasted sanders for his age requesting a new generation of politicians take the helm sanders currently 77 would be the oldest candidate to enter the ring by several years democrats would be better off with a young candidate political strategist brad bannon told the hill to those concerns sanders says i m very blessed with my health pete buttigieg the popular mayor of south bend indiana announced he was launching a presidential exploratory committee on jan 23 the show in washington right now is exhausting the corruption the fighting the lying the crisis it s got to end he said in a campaign video posted to social media right now our country needs a fresh start he made

his republican challenger before his mayoral campaigns buttigieg did economic and environmental consulting work for mckinsey company according to the center for public integrity right now our country needs a fresh start buttigieg said in his campaign announcement video if elected he d be the first openly gay president and currently 37 years old he d be the first millennial president controversies buttigieg is educated accomplished and well liked in his community but he has had some unsuccessful endeavors in 2010 he ran for indiana state treasurer and lost in 2017 he made an unsuccessful bid for chair of the democratic national committee eventually dropping out after indicating he didn t have enough votes some may argue he doesn t have enough political experience compared to the senators and other prominent democrats expected to run in 2020 beto o rourke announced he was running for president in a video posted online on march 14 this is going to be a positive campaign that seeks to bring out the very best from every single one of us he said shown in the video sitting beside his wife amy that seeks to unite a very divided country qualifications the 46 year old and father of three served three terms in the house of representatives after defeating eight term incumbent silvestre reyes in the 2012 democratic primary before the upset o rourke was an el paso city councilman member of a punk band and the founder of a small web and software company he graduated from columbia university with a bachelor s degree in english literature rationale though he s younger and less seasoned than some of his 2020 opponents o rourke not all that dissimilar from former president barack obama garnered national name recognition relatively quickly in the 2018 midterm election season o rourke raised an eye popping 80 million his republican opponent republican sen ted cruz raised just under half of that o rourke ultimately lost by about 3 to cruz but that is no small feat considering the state s conservativeness texas has not elected a democrat to a statewide position since 1994 during his senate race o rourke campaigned on increasing background checks for gun sales expanding medicaid access and instituting congressional term limits controversies o rourke was arrested for crashing a vehicle while intoxicated in 1998 though the charges were dismissed after he completed a court ordered educational program in an august 2018 op ed he apologized for the indiscretion and said it was a serious mistake for which there is no excuse he s also come under fire for how he s spent his time since losing to cruz he embarked on a road trip during which he complained of feeling like he was in and out of a funk some political commentators noted female mothers and candidates would not get the same empathy for leaving a spouse and children behind to take that kind of trip sen amy klobuchar announced she was running for president at a rally in her home state of minnesota on feb 10 we are all tired of the shutdowns and the showdowns of the gridlock and the grandstanding she said less than a month after the longest government shutdown in history ended at an impasse our nation must be governed not by chaos but by opportunity qualifications klobuchar studied political science at yale and law at the university of chicago after law school she worked as a corporate lawyer before being elected a county attorney where she focused on prosecuting violent criminals in 2006 she became the first woman elected to represent minnesota in the u s senate she has since won re election twice rationale like several of the senators she s vying against for the democratic nomination klobuchar is a member of the powerful senate judiciary committee that oversaw the confirmation hearings of brett kavanaugh as the daughter of a man who struggled with alcohol addiction asking the supreme court nominee about his alcohol use hit particularly close to home drinking is one thing but the concern is about truthfulness and in your written testimony you said sometimes you had too many drinks she said you re saying there s never been a case where you drank so much that you didn t remember what happened the night before or part of what happened kavanaugh quipped back you re asking about you know blackout he said i don t know have you in addition to her committee memberships klobuchar is also known for her popularity in minnesota she beat her last republican challenger by more than 20 points according to morning consult she s also the third most popular senator with a 60 approval rating controversies klobuchar has one of the highest staff turnover ratings among her senate colleagues according to recent huffpost and buzzfeed articles some former staffers have accused her of being difficult to work with other employees quoted in the huffpost article said the senator had high expectations that pushed them to be better and that the allegations were symptomatic of sexism an unnamed campaign spokesperson told both publications that klobuchar values the people she works with senator klobuchar loves her staff they are the reason she has gotten to where she is today sen kirsten gillibrand announced she was officially seeking the democratic nomination in march after initially announcing an exploratory committee in january qualifications gillibrand attended undergrad at dartmouth and law school at ucla before running for public office gillibrand clerked for the second circuit court of appeals and practiced private law in new york city she served in the house of representatives beginning in 2007 and was appointed to the senate in 2009 after hillary clinton vacated the seat to become secretary of state rationale gillibrand cited institutional racism greed and corruption in washington as barriers the future democratic nominee will have to overcome in order to accomplish legislation that bolsters hard working americans i believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class she said during her announcement her platform might include postal banking legislation she sponsored in 2018 that would require u s post offices to offer basic financial services like checking accounts i m going to run for president of the united states because as a young mom i m going to fight for other people s kids as hard as i would fight for my own the new york senator said on the show controversies gillibrand has become more progressive over the last decade when she was appointed to fill hillary clinton s vacant seat she opposed any sort of amnesty for undocumented immigrants according to the new york times gillibrand also used to have an a rating from the nra though the pro gun rights group has since downgraded it to an f these ideological shifts could prove problematic to progressive voters in primaries that are likely to be heated sen michael bennet a colorado democrat announced he was running for president during an interview on cbs this morning on may 2 i have a tendency to tell the truth to the people i represent in colorado and i want a chance to do that with the american people he said qualifications the 54 year old earned a bachelor s degree from wesleyan university and a law degree from yale he served as a special assistant to the u s attorney

denver public schools when colorado sen ken salazar was tapped by obama to become secretary of the interior in 2009 bennet was appointed to fill his senate seat he s since been re elected twice first in 2010 and then in 2016 rationale a former superintendent who helped improve district standards bennet is known for education reform he also gained recent traction for a fiery speech during the most recent government shutdown in which he berated fellow sen ted cruz over blaming democrats for the impasse cruz had played a role in the 2013 shutdown over the affordable care act which at the time hindered colorado from getting relief assistance after disastrous floods these crocodile tears that the senator from texas is crying for the first responders are too hard for me to take bennet said controversies bennet announced he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer in early april later that month his staff said he had a successful surgery and would require no further treatment bennet is now somewhat late to the game in what is turning out to be the most crowded democratic primary race in modern history he ll be competing against better known candidates who are now millions of dollars ahead of him in fundraising figures john hickenlooper former governor of colorado announced he was running for president via video announcement and a good morning america appearance on march 4 ultimately i m running for president because i believe that not only can i beat donald trump but that i am the person that can bring people together on the other side and actually get stuff done he said the division is keeping us from addressing big issues like climate change and the soaring costs of healthcare qualifications hickenlooper earned both his undergraduate and graduate degrees at wesleyan university where he studied english and geology respectively he worked as a geologist until he was laid off in the early 1980s and then went on to found his own brewpub called wynkoop brewing company he served two terms as denver s mayor beginning in 2003 and then was elected colorado s governor in 2010 his second and final gubernatorial term ended in january rationale the 67 year old democrat is widely perceived as a political moderate known for getting substantive legislative codified after a gunman shot and killed 12 and injured 70 more at a dark knight rises movie showing in aurora colorado in 2012 hickenlooper signed bills that expanded background checks and created new limits on ammunition clips despite over 30 of coloradans owning guns when the state passed a ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana use in 2012 hickenlooper said it took him time to warm up to the idea i was against it almost everybody i know was against it it s no fun to be in conflict with federal law he told time in november but most of the worst fears that we had in legalizing recreational marijuana haven t come to pass he continued states are the laboratories of democracy and i think this is one of the great social experiments these policy positions could bode well with younger voters who are more supportive of gun control and marijuana legalization controversies hickenlooper was accused of taking private jets owned by wealthy benefactors and not disclosing the gifts the 189 page complaint filed by a former colorado politician alleges hickenlooper took almost 100 of these flights since september 2011 the denver post reported in october a colorado political strategist told time in november that the claim lacked legitimacy from what i have seen the word scandal does not apply here craig hughes said washington state gov jay inslee announced he was running for president via video message on march 1 he s already established combating climate change as the theme of his campaign i m jay inslee and i m running for president because i am the only candidate who will make defeating climate change our nation s number one priority inslee says in the video qualifications inslee was first elected governor in 2012 and then re elected in 2016 before that he served in the u s house of representatives for more than a decade while in the house climate change was also a pressing issue for him he served on the house committee on energy and commerce inslee studied economics at the university of washington and law at willamette university rationale inslee believes climate change is one of the most pressing issues facing the united states we re the first generation to feel the sting of climate change and we re the last that can do something about it inslee says in his launch video we can do this during his tenure as governor he s made his state one of the friendliest to electric vehicles reduced washington s reliance on fossil fuels and co founded the u s climate alliance in efforts to uphold the goals of the paris agreement he also helped washington raise its minimum wage and pass a statewide paid family leave law controversies inslee is one of the lesser known democrats vying for the 2020 democratic nomination he ll also face pushback from climate deniers and perhaps those who oppose drastic climate change solutions like the statewide carbon tax he unsuccessfully pushed for in the 2018 midterms rep tulsi gabbard broke down barriers when she became the first samoan american and first hindu elected to congress before her election in 2012 she served in the hawaiian army national guard first in iraq and then kuwait before that gabbard became the youngest woman ever elected in the state when she won a hawaii house seat

gabbard has wartime experience she actually left hawaii s house in order to serve in iraq i stepped down from the legislature where i served and headed to a war zone she said at the 2012 democratic national convention as a combat veteran i know the costs of war controversies gabbard is only 37 and has limited congressional experience in comparison to other democrats expected to enter the ring other than her age she s also faced criticism for helping her father s anti gay organization the alliance for traditional marriage around the early 2000s the organization ran a successful campaign to give the state legislature power to reserve marriage to opposite sex couples there is evidence the group also supported conversion therapy according to web archives if elected she d be the youngest

development secretary qualifications castro graduated from stanford university and harvard law school like gabbard he s known for starting in politics at a young age he became san antonio s youngest

keynote address he was named hud secretary in 2014 and was reportedly considered as a running mate by 2016 democratic nominee hillary clinton under obama castro helped launch the connecthome initiative which expanded affordable broadband internet access to public housing recipients in 27 cities rationale the native texan has said he thinks he can be the antidote to trump on hot button issues like immigration while speaking to a crowd of supporters in san antonio less than 200 miles from the southern border castro said the crisis america faces is one of leadership donald trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation he said we have to have border security but there s a smart and a humane way to do it and there is no way in hell that caging children is keeping us safe controversies the office of the special counsel found that castro violated the hatch act when he appeared to advocate for and against presidential candidates during an interview leading up to the 2016 election now taking off my hud hat for a second and just speaking individually it is very clear that hillary clinton is the most experienced thoughtful and prepared candidate for president that we have this year he had told yahoo news anchor katie couric during the interview that took place at hud s broadcast studio castro later apologized for the indiscretion rep tim ryan announced he was running for president on april 4 as a congressman from youngstown ohio for almost 20 years i ve watched the american dream slip through the fingers of many americans ryan said on his campaign website

elected to congress he previously served in the ohio senate he is a member of the house appropriations committee which regulates federal spending ryan s undergraduate degree is from bowling green state university and he attended law school at university of new hampshire rationale ryan thinks he can win over white working class voters who went for trump in 2016 i am a progressive who knows how to talk to working class people and i know how to get elected in working class districts because at the end of the day the progressive agenda is what is best for working families he said on a television appearance the day he announced his candidacy controversies ryan has flip flopped on the issue of abortion previously being against the procedure due to his catholicism in 2015 he wrote an op ed announcing he had changed his mind and that he now believes we must trust women and families not politicians to make the best decision for their lives ryan also previously held an a rating from the nra which some grassroots democrats may not like after the las vegas shooting in 2017 he announced he would donate the 20 000 he had received from the nra s pac to organizations that support gun control measures andrew yang the entrepreneur who founded venture for america filed to run for president on november 6 2017 his campaign s primary policy objective is to secure what he calls a freedom dividend which would provide every american between the ages of 18 and 64 1 000 per month i m a capitalist he told the new york times in january 2018 and i believe that universal basic income is necessary for capitalism to continue qualifications yang received his bachelor s from brown university and his law degree from columbia he briefly worked as a corporate lawyer and later became ceo of test prep company manhattan gmat in 2011 he founded venture for america an americorps like program that places college graduates interested in entrepreneurship at startups in cities like detroit baltimore and pittsburgh former president barack obama also named him a white house champion of change in 2012 rationale the 44 year old son of immigrants worries that advances in automation could lend to the eventual elimination of millions of jobs including those held by truck drivers and grocery store clerks he says his ubi proposal would help ease the burden when people stop losing their jobs somehow we re going to have to provide a financial solution when 30 of the malls close in the next four years and millions of retail workers get sent home and when call center jobs get automated by artificial intelligence and 2 5 billion call center workers get sent home and when trucks start driving themselves and 3 5 million truckers riot because they can no longer feed their families he told time in february controversies yang has never been elected to a public office however he s polling as well as or even above many of his 2020 competitors who have held public office and have better name recognition one morning consult survey from may placed him at 1 among democratic primary voters nationwide and in early primary states tied with sen kirsten gillibrand and rep tim ryan rep seth moulton announced he was running for president on good morning america on april 22 i am running because i am a patriot because i believe in this country and because i have never wanted to sit on the sidelines when it comes to serving it moulton said that is why i joined that marines it is why i ran for congress to try to prevent what i saw got us into iraq from happening again and it is why i am running to take on the most divisive president in american history to bring this country back together qualifications a 40 year old marine veteran moulton is a three term congressman representing massachusetts he went to harvard for his bachelor s in physics and his master s degree in business and public policy moulton also served four terms in iraq as a marine and was awarded the bronze star he currently serves on the house committees on armed services and the budget rationale moulton is a longshot in such a crowded field but he was also a longshot during his first primary when he ran against a nine term congressman he recalls being down over 50 points in the first poll and hearing a pollster call his chances of winning statistically impossible according to the atlantic now he s one of the only candidates making national security a major theme in an announcement video he promised to cut massive weapons programs we don t need so that we have the money to invest in the future he also wants to invest in foreign aid and diplomatic relations to help us avoid the next wars according to cnbc controversies moulton is only one of 20 democrats running for president he s not among the most well known nor one of the most experienced he also received some negative attention for leading a failed attempt to prevent nancy pelosi from becoming speaker after democrats reclaimed the chamber in the 2018 midterms former starbucks ceo howard schultz announced he s seriously considering a presidential run in 2020 we re living at a most fragile time schultz said during a jan 27 60 minutes interview not only the fact that this president us not qualified to be the president but the fact that both parties are consistently not doing what s necessary on behalf of the american people and are engaged every single day in revenge politics qualifications schultz grew up in blue collar household becoming the first in his family to graduate from college after studying communications at northern michigan university post graduation schultz worked in sales and marketing at xerox before rising through the ranks at a home goods company that starbucks bought supplies from he lobbied for starbucks to hire him and proceeded to rise through their ranks too eventually becoming ceo in 1987 rationale if schultz runs in 2020 he says it will be as a centrist independent he s previously donated more than 100 000 to democratic campaigns but he s also criticized the direction in which established democrats are moving it concerns me that so many voices within the democratic party are going so far to the left he told cnbc last june schultz could appeal to fiscally conservative but socially liberal voters controversies schultz has never been elected to public office he s also faced criticism for directives advanced by starbucks under his leadership in 2015 in the midst of national allegations of police brutality schultz tried to tackle race relations by having baristas scribble race together on starbucks cups one starbucks executive received so much negative feedback about the initiative that he temporarily deleted his twitter account to get away from it schultz himself has said he dreams big sometimes too big it may be a weakness in me i m always wondering what i ll do next enough is never enough he wrote in his 2012 book pour your heart into it former rep john delaney doesn t have the strongest national name recognition nor was he in congress that long elected 2012 perhaps that is why he announced his 2020 campaign so early july of 2017 early to get ahead of better known democratic competitors qualifications delaney earned a bachelor s degree from columbia and a law degree from georgetown he also launched two companies that were traded on the new york stock exchange the democrat won his first election in 2012 after significant redistricting changes were made to maryland s map as a member of congress delaney has introduced legislation that would end partisan gerrymandering a political tactic that arguably helped him get his job representing maryland s 6th district in the first place rationale delaney spent the better part of 2018 visiting crucial electoral states while he s not the only politician to have done so he appears to be one of the only democrats to have been forthcoming about why he s visiting honesty is the best policy delaney told politico we know they re thinking about running for president or they re planning on running for president and we ask them that question directly and they lie to us and so our first introduction to them is based on a dishonest moment he said someone told him controversies even though delaney had visited iowa more than 10 times in the last year only about half of the likely democratic caucus goers knew who he was politico reported further his views are more moderate than some of the other likely democratic contenders i m a big believer in the private economy and market forces but i also believe there s a role for government in setting the rules of the road and helping take care of the most vulnerable he said in 2017 that could come to hurt him as democrats continue to prioritize
