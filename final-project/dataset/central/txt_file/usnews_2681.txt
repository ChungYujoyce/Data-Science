david shulkin a physician and former healthcare executive was an under secretary at the u s department of veterans affairs under president obama and the secretary of the va under president trump in march 2018 he was abruptly fired amid charges of improperly accepting gifts and misusing taxpayer funds for personal travel shulkin has consistently denied wrongdoing and says he was pushed out by political insiders trying to privatize the va in his forthcoming book it shouldn t be this hard to serve your country shulkin traces his thirteen tumultuous months in the trump administration as he notes in the book all direct quotes are reconstructed to the best of his memory and corroborated by his wife merle bari s contemporaneous daily diary which reflected what shulkin told her on a regular basis during his time in washington this excerpt has been edited for length and clarity around 11 a m on saturday jan 7 2017 i received a call telling me i was expected at trump tower in new york at 2 p m that afternoon after about an hour of sustained panic driving with my wife merle on snow covered roads from philadelphia my cell phone rang it was reince priebus sorry not to have called sooner but we re all set you ll be meeting with the president elect on monday at 2 00 p m monday not today we found the nearest exit turned around and headed back home later that afternoon priebus called again this time with some questions for me mainly it seemed to help him figure out how i had gotten on his call list he wanted to know how i knew trump i told him i didn t he seemed perplexed that i had no connection to the trump campaign he also wanted to know how i became under secretary for obama without commenting on any of my answers priebus asked me to meet with him for lunch on monday prior to my meeting with the president elect on sunday still mystified but intrigued i took a train to new york clarifying some final details they asked me if i wanted to enter trump tower through the main lobby or use a private entrance to avoid being seen a year and a half into my service in washington i still didn t quite understand optics and the strategy behind these kinds of decisions i saw no reason to hide a meeting with the president elect i ll go through the front door i said the next day i headed over to trump tower around which the nypd had set up a security corridor in all directions i wasn t quite sure what to expect but even if this meeting was nothing more than an exit interview i wanted the chance to tell the president elect where progress was being made at the va and what direction his new administration should take in 2014 when obama administration officials first approached me about coming to the va many of my colleagues expressed concern that the job was a no win situation they felt it was a sure fire way to ruin my career leading large hospital systems a career that had been marked by distinction they warned that the va was simply too big and complex to change others pointed out that it did not make sense to accept a dramatic pay cut in return for such enormous headaches but i took the job because i felt a sense of responsibility to our nation s veterans there are more than 20 million american veterans about a quarter of them living in rural areas and many of them need va benefits just to get by more than nine million of our veterans rely on va health care a system that is spread across the entire country with approximately 1 300 facilities and more than 340 000 employees it s the largest health care system in the u s and one of the most complicated organizations in the government dealing with the size and scope budget realities capital deficits and political pressure surrounding the va is nearly impossible under the best of circumstances i arrived in 2015 as under secretary of the veterans health administration amidst chilling reports of excessive wait times for va medical care in many parts of the country there was also an unacceptable breakdown in delivery of mental health and addiction care which left veterans of iraq and afghanistan to fend for themselves during epidemics of traumatic brain injuries and posttraumatic stress neglect that led to myriad suicides and overdoses the va health care system was all but publicly declared to be on life support but after 17 months of work and a great deal of progress on many fronts i felt optimistic energized and even more responsible than ever which is why when presented with the chaotic swirl of events that were my introduction to donald trump and his team i went in head first just inside trump tower i was met by several republican national committee staffers who escorted me to the lobby restaurant as priebus and i shook hands he told me that he no longer had time for lunch i said i understood but knowing that he was from green bay i added by the way congratulations on the packers win this weekend he smiled and said you know maybe i do have time for a quick bite making our way through the small restaurant we were stopped by swarms of diners who all seemed to want their picture taken with priebus so i became the amateur photographer as table after table stood up to pose with him we took a back table ordered chicken caesar salad and spent most of our time casually discussing our families and nonpolitical interests i gleaned nothing of substance and no explanation for why i was summoned to new york after lunch he escorted me upstairs as we approached the inner sanctum steve bannon came out to greet us and escort me into trump s office familiar to millions as the set of the apprentice against a wall of glass the president elect sat at a huge desk covered with copies of time magazine with his picture on the cover as person of the year a part of me wondered where the secret cameras were hidden as we shook hands trump announced to his staff in the room he s a good looking guy he then quickly repeated he s a good looking guy isn t he taken aback i could think of nothing better to say than nice to meet you mr president elect glancing around the room i noticed that the one non glass interior wall was filled with awards and plaques from events honoring trump i sat down in the only chair facing him across the desk it seemed by now that most of trump s inner circle were milling about in the room behind me jared kushner kellyanne conway michael cohen bannon and priebus kushner and conway were having a side conversation which they took outside then trump turned to me and asked so what s the best hospital in the city well mr trump i think it depends on you know i used to think well of this one place but i know a guy who went in there feeling okay and they just chopped his thing right off they chopped it off i wouldn t go there for anything now once again i wasn t quite sure what to say yes well no hospital is good at treating every condition i managed so if you were sick where would you go before i could answer he looked over at cohen so michael what do you think of this guy cohen and i met each other years earlier when i had been serving as the chief executive officer of new york s beth israel medical center donald he s the best in his field you really think so huh looking back at me trump asked so what do you think of mcdonald bob mcdonald the current va secretary and my boss had been appointed by president obama to replace general eric shinseki the va secretary forced to resign in the midst of the wait time crisis i think he s one of the best leaders in the country i answered truthfully he s been making really good progress and i think he should stay yeah i ve heard good things but there is no way we can keep him just not possible what do you think we need to do then answering his own question trump said i ll tell you what we need to do we need to make sure our veterans aren t waiting for care mr trump you re absolutely right we have to fix this thing it s a mess do you think we can fix it we ve been making big improvements on the wait times we ve developed same day access and we re getting more veterans he cut me off again i want our veterans to get the best then he repeated they really created a mess here can we fix it once again i assured him that i was committed to doing just that trump ruffled through a few papers on his desk and then looked up the va s an important place but there are some good ones and some bad ones but i ll tell you what s messed up they come back with ptsd you know what s really bad they come back and their wives or girlfriends didn t wait for them i swallowed trump paused for a moment and then looked up as if actually seeing me for the first time you know you don t really fit the bill the generals now they fit the bill but can they fix health care not waiting for my response he continued who do you think would make a good secretary well mr trump bob mcdonald is doing a great trump cut me off to ask about a certain african american candidate from the navy he asked if i thought he could fix health care i said i did not know anything about the gentleman what about this ceo of exxon mobil before i could answer he moved on to what are you like the number two or number three guy at va i m number three sir kushner and conway came back in still engrossed in their own private conversation passing a piece of paper back and forth soon priebus and bannon were drawn in and the volume of their sidebar escalated after a moment priebus interrupted mr trump we need your approval on this press release it s about jared s role in the administration trump glanced at the paper for a split second and then without reading it handed it back just tell me what it says i don t think we should release it just now conway said well i do kushner countered having seen all of these people parodied relentlessly over the past several weeks on saturday night live i couldn t help thinking that i d stepped into a skit with alec baldwin and kate mckinnon as the tension increased priebus leaned over to me and whispered dr shulkin we need to resolve this would you mind stepping out for 10 minutes i rose from my chair but trump swatted me back down david can hear this stay i sat back down the debate continued with trump sitting quietly until the group seemed to reach some kind of resolution then trump turned back to me so why is it so broken the va well there are many reasons starting with i think we need to let the veterans go wherever they want well there needs to be a coordinated effort i ll tell you what we re going to fix this thing if you were in charge what would you do first i would make sure that we had do you think we can fix this thing yes mr president elect i do we went on like this for another 30 minutes or so while the others wandered in and out finally trump turned to priebus bannon and cohen and asked so what do you guys think heads nodded in approval then the president elect turned to cohen and said next time you see him you can call him mr secretary confused i stood shook trump s hand and left the office i took the long elevator ride down to the trump tower lobby where i was met by a barrage of camera flashes and bright lights from tv crews reporters shouted dr shulkin did you meet with donald trump dr shulkin who ll run the va i had no idea mostly because i had no idea what had just happened i smiled and waved shyly but said nothing then i made my way quickly into the crowds on fifth avenue where i was once again unrecognizable on january 11 2017 when trump announced that he had selected me as va secretary i was as surprised as anyone little about my interactions with trump s inner circle had made clear that i was the top pick but i was pleased as it meant i got to keep serving veterans which is what i wanted to do all along i could use the experience i had gained in the obama administration with the freedom i was given in the trump administration we broke new ground after trump s inauguration by publishing our wait times and quality data expanding benefits for mental health services and adding benefits for those with other than honorable discharges we dramatically increased our technological sophistication through greater reliance on telehealth and by moving toward a new electronic health record system that would connect seamlessly with the department of defense we made real advances in timely access to care and we implemented important changes that resulted in veterans having more choice in where they received their care in large part we found a formula for moving away from the status quo and getting the system back on track part of that formula involved working more closely with the private sector and making the va more competitive with industry practices this was essentially a middle ground between a fully government run organization and privatization with americans polarized over almost every issue i hoped that caring for veterans wouldn t get entangled in the usual d c gamesmanship the longer i was in the capital the more i was sorely disappointed much of my tenure involved various factions pushing me to simply close the va or at least large parts of it that weren t working well but i didn t see how shutting down a system specifically designed to care for veterans could be in the veterans best interests my strong belief was that my job was to find solutions no matter how many problems plagued the va in order to make the existing system work better we made real progress during my time at the va the morale of the workforce was growing we were passing new legislation we were working more closely with our community partners and we were making the structural changes to ensure sustainable improvements i had found a way to get things done despite the turmoil within the trump administration and things seemed to be running smoothly until they weren t to be clear i did not set out to tell the story of how much the va accomplished in three years and how i was fired by a trump tweet on the eve of passing the most important bill in the history of veterans medical care because i wanted anyone to feel sorry for me i am telling my story because in my opinion the va is still in grave danger its doctors its administrators and most importantly our veterans are at risk as never before maintaining a strong va is also an essential piece of the puzzle that is the united states national security system we cannot expect our sons and daughters to risk their lives and fight for our freedom unless we keep our promise to care for them if and when they return home broken injured or traumatized there is no excuse for not holding up our end of the bargain the mission set forth by president abraham lincoln to care for those who have borne the battle is a sacred duty one year after i became the secretary of veterans affairs the environment in washington had grown so toxic chaotic and subversive that it became impossible for me to accomplish the important work that our veterans need and deserve when i left i promised to continue to speak out against those seeking to harm the va by putting their personal agendas ahead of the care of our veterans i am also worried about the future of public service generally which appears increasingly bleak as important positions remain unfilled and while cabinet secretaries are hired fired and publicly humiliated as if our national government were a reality television show after i was fired i told my wife and then repeated the thought in an op ed i wrote for the new york times it should not be this hard to serve your country the time i spent in government changed me and my family forever but it also gave me a renewed sense of purpose as well as a belief that systems in government can be improved it s not hopeless but it is a long road without any quick or easy solutions it also reaffirmed my belief that as long as we have the need for a military to defend our country the va must continue as a strong and effective system willing and able to serve those injured during their service it is important that americans understand what the va system is how it works and why it exists if we are willing to commit to our veterans as they have to us we can all work together to build a safer healthier and prouder country
