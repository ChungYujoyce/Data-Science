the democratic presidential nominee made claims on income inequality job growth spending and more by robert farley posted on july 29 2016 philadelphia on the night hillary clinton accepted her party s nomination for president clinton and other democrats played loose with somefacts note to readers this story was written with the help of the entire staff including some of those based in philadelphia who are at the convention site as we did for the republican national convention we intend to vet the major speeches at the democratic national convention for factual accuracy applying the same standards to both clinton misrepresented a quote from donald trump s convention speech i alone can fix it suggestinghe said he could fix everything by himself in fact trump said that as a political outsider only he can fix a rigged system he has spoken about working with others many times including in that same speech clinton and most of all don t believe anyone who says i alone can fix it those were actually donald trump s words in cleveland and they should set off alarm bells for all of us really i alone can fix it isn t he forgetting troops on the front lines police officers and fire fighters who run toward danger doctors and nurses who care for us teachers who change lives entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe he s forgetting every last one of us americans don t say i alone can fix it we say we ll fix it together other democrats used the talking point too former michigan gov jennifer granholm said last week we heard about trump s hopeless vision of our country and then he said i alone can fix it granholm went on to say that trump s version of the constitution would be i the person in order to form a more perfect union rep ted lieu of california said the scariest part of donald trump s acceptance speech wasn t the apocalyptic vision of america that he believes he sees it s that he said i alone can fix it but trump never said he d be the only one to fix absolutely everything here s what trump said in accepting the gop nomination for president on july 21 trump july 21 i have joined the political arena so that the powerful can no longer beat up on people that cannot defend themselves nobody knows the system better than me which is why i alone can fix it i have seen firsthand how the system is rigged against our citizens just like it was rigged against bernie sanders he never had a chance he quickly went on to say we are going to fix the system in talking about others joining his cause and a few sentences later he talked about working with his running mate saying we will bring the same economic success to america that mike pence brought to indiana there are other examples of trump talking of we and not i in that same speech for instance he said that we must work with all of our allies who share our goal of destroying isis and stamping out islamic terrorism and he said i will work with and appoint the best prosecutors and law enforcement officialsto get the job properly done a few days later he said we will fix it in talking about his plans for the department of veterans affairs the first step of his 10 point plan he said was to appoint a secretary of veterans affairs who will make it their personal mission to clean up the va so trump s line may make for good rhetorical flourishes at the democratic convention but trump didn t say he alone can fix everything clinton listed a number of initiatives that she plans to get done as president and said that we re going to pay for every single one of them we can t predict the future but a nonpartisan analysis found clinton s spending proposals will increase the national debt clinton we re not only going to make all of these investments we re going to pay for every single one of them and here s how wall street corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes but clinton s proposals would increase the debt by 250 billion over 10 years according to a june 27 report from the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget for clinton this small increase in debt relative to current law is the result of spending increases that are largely but not entirely paid for by revenue increases the crfb report says clinton according to the report has proposed 1 45 trillion in new spending mostly on infrastructure paid leave and education proposals but offsets that with just 1 2 trillion in new revenue from proposed tax increases for the wealthiest americans clinton said that she would raise taxes on the wealthiest americans to pay for her spending proposals because 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent but that is an outdated figure clinton and here s how wall street corporations and the super rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes not because we resent success because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent that s where the money is the most recent data from economist emmanuel saez of the university of california berkeley show that the top 1 percent of families captured 52 percent of the post recession income growth from 2009 to 2015 in fact saez estimated that the top 1 percent incomes captured 52 percent of the overall economic growth of real incomes per family over the period 1993 2015 clinton s mistake was to rely on a report that referred to outdated figures her campaign pointed to an april 2015 article from politifact com which gave sen bernie sanders of vermont a mostly true rating for his claim that 99 percent of all new income today is going to the top 1 percent to support theclaim the sanders campaign cited the work of justin wolfers a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan wolfers in a january 2015 post for the new york times upshot blog wrote that only the top 1 percent saw any income gains from 2009 to 2013 wolfers jan 27 2015 after adjusting for inflation the average income for the richest 1 percent excluding capital gains has risen from 871 100 in 2009 to 968 000 over 2012 and 2013 by contrast for the remaining 99 percent average incomes fell by a few dollars from 44 000 to 43 900 wolfers added that is so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent but wolfers had based his calculations on saez s preliminary numbers for 2013 and saez has updated his estimates for income growth twice since then in a june 2015 update saez said that from 2009 to 2014 during the economic recovery 58 percent of real income growth went to the top 1 percent and as of his june 2016 update the figure had fallen to 52 percent from 2009 to 2015 clinton overstatedthe number of jobs created since president barack obama and vice president joe biden took office clinton our economy is so much stronger than when they took office nearly 15 million new private sector jobs in fact since january 2009 when obama took office the private sector has added 10 5 million jobs clinton only counted jobs created since the low point of employment during the great recession february 2010 and disregarded the months during obama s tenure when jobs were lost a total of 14 8 million private sector jobs were created between february 2010 and june 2016 private sector jobs give an important look at overall labor market health but do not tell the whole story overall employment including government jobs has increased by 10 1 million since january 2009 and 14 4 million since february 2010 clinton dismissed one of trump s signature campaign pledges saying we will not build a wall but while clinton opposes trump s ambitious plan for a massive wall along at least half of the 2 000 mile border with mexico clinton has herself voted for and supported legislation to add more fencing along the southern border as clinton acknowledged at a town hall event on nov 9 2015 i voted numerous times when i was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in and i do think you have to control your borders on aug 2 2006 then sen clinton was among a large bipartisan majority of senators who voted in favor of 1 83 billion in funding to construct 370 miles of triple layered fencing and 461 miles of vehicle barriers along the southwest border in september of that year clinton was also among a majority of senators who supported the secure fence act of 2006 which called for construction of 700 miles of fencing and enhanced surveillance technology such as unmanned drones ground based sensors satellites radar coverage and cameras it was signed into law by president george w bush in her book hard choices clinton said she supported the 2013 senate immigration bill s 744 the border security economic opportunity and immigration modernization act page 459 clinton hard choices i only wish that the bipartisan bill passed in the senate in 2013 reforming our immigration laws could have passed the house in addition to providing a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally the billwould have funded an enhanced border security plan including additional border fencing again none of that comes close to trump s promise to build a great wall 35 to 40 feet high along 1 000 miles of the roughly 2 000 mile border with mexico natural barriers protect the remaining 1 000 miles he said but clinton has voted for and supported moreborder fencing in the past house democratic leader nancy pelosi said that there are 91 americans who are killed by gun violence each day and urged congress to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists however almost 58 of those daily gun deaths are suicides not criminal homicides pelosi for the sake of the 91 americans who are killed by gun violence each day we must break the grip of the gun lobby on congress and keep guns out of the hands of criminals and terrorists in 2014 33 599 people died from firearm injuries according to the most recent mortality report from the centers for disease control and prevention see table 10 that averages out to more than 92 gun related deaths each day but 63 5 percent of the gun deaths in 2014 or 21 334 were suicides homicides totaled10 945 and therest were accidental discharges 586 legal intervention war 515 and undetermined 270 rep sean patrick maloney of new yorktwisted the words of a speakerat the gop convention claiming he called equality a distraction maloney last week a speaker at the republican convention called equality a distraction who cares he asked well i care maloney then went on to praise the supreme court s decision on marriage equality in reality the person maloney was criticizing cares about marriage equality too maloney who is openly gay was misquoting silicon valley billionaire peter thiel the first gay person to openly declare his sexualityat a republican convention though not the first gay person to give a speech it s worth noting here that in 2014 thiel raised money to fight prop 8 in california a measure that would have banned same sex marriage so he has demonstrated that he s on the same side as maloney on that issue what thiel referred to specifically was the debate over bathroom access for transgender people not marriage equality or gender equality in general he said the bathroom debate was among fake culture wars detracting from the real issue of economic decline in america here s what thiel really said thiel july 21 when i was a kid the great debate was about how to defeat the soviet union and we won now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom this is a distraction from our real problems who cares f ake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline and nobody in this race is being honest about it except donald trump maloney is entitled to disagree with thiel s opinion but had he accuratelyquoted thiel he would have said thielcalled bathroom access a distraction not equality in general rep joaquin castro said trump defended world war ii internmentcamps trump cited the internment camps as precedent for his proposal to ban all muslim travel to the u s but he stopped just short of defending the practice castro grandchildren of americans who suffered in world war ii internment camps the same camps donald trump has defended and grew up to be business owners war heroes and public servants we reached out to the clinton campaign for backup and a spokesmanpointed to a dec 8 2015 storyin the new york times about trump defending hiscall for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on the times wrote he cast it as a temporary move in response to terrorism and invoked president franklin d roosevelt s authorization of the detention of japanese german and italian immigrants during world war iias precedent in an interview on msnbc s morning joe program on dec 8 2015 host joe scarborough asked trump if his proposal was unconstitutional trump cited roosevelt s decision to detain thousands of noncitizen japanese germans and italians in that same interview mark halperin a political analyst for msnbc repeatedly asked trump ifthe japanese internment camps went against american values trump praised roosevelt but repeatedly countered that he wasn t proposing the same thing and refused to answer trump seemed to walk right up to the line of endorsing japanese internment noting that fdr did it and is considered one of the most highly respected presidents but when asked directly if he was praising japanese internment trump said he was not robert farley with eugene kiely brooks jackson lori robertson d angelo gore and zachary gross committee for a responsible federal budget promises and price tags a
