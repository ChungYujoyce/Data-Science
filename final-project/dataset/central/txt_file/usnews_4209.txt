federal investigators concluded that a saudi military trainee who killed three service members during a shooting in december at a florida naval basehad been in contact with al qaida operatives for years planning the lethal assault that reasserted the terror group as a global threat attorney general william barr and fbi director christopher wray said monday authorities learned of the communicationafter gaining access to the contents of cellphones used by the shooter 2nd lt mohammed alshamrani until recently investigators had been blocked from the information because of the apple iphone s encrypted pass code features for months barr said apple rejected requests for assistance in unlocking the devices leaving the fbi to find its own key to the phones and ultimately alshamrani s ties to the terror group the phones contained information previously unknown to us that definitively establishes alshamrani s significant ties to al qaida in the arabian peninsula not only before the attack but before he even arrived in the united states barr said we now have a clearer understanding of alshamrani s associations and activities in the years monthsand days leading up to the attack wray said the information revealed on the phones indicates alshamrani was radicalized as early as 2015and joined the saudi air force as part of his special operation against the united states this case is a potent reminder of the stakes of our work wray said alshamrani officials said had been in almost constant contact with his terror associates speaking to operatives in yemen the night before the assault at the pensacola naval air station the attorney general said the phones contents assisted in a counterterrorism operation targeting one of alshamrani s associates abdullah al maliki barr did not elaborate on the operation that he said was recently conducted in yemen alabama rep mike rogers the ranking republican on the house homeland security committee saidthe fbi s findings underscore al qaida s persistent threat to our homeland security as we work to defeat this menace the department of homeland security and the department of defense must better coordinate to screen foreign military students who pose a risk to american servicemen and women rogers said in january barr declared the fatal shooting an act of terrorism motivatedby jihadist ideology alshamrani 21 who was part of au s training program for the saudi military was killed in the rampage dec 6 investigators found that on sept 11 2019 the shooter posted on social media that the countdown has begun he visited the 9 11 memorial in new york city over thanksgiving weekend and he posted anti american anti israeli and jihadi messages on social media two hours before the attack authorities said days after the attack the navy grounded more than 300 saudi nationals who were training to be pilots twenty one saudi trainees were expelled from the country alshamranibegan his three year course in august 2017 with english basic aviation and initial pilot training he was one of5 180 foreign students including 852 saudi nationals from 153 countries in the usa for military training manyoperate american military hardware that foreign governments buy from the united states saudi arabia is the world s largest customer for arms many of which are american made the investigation revived a long standing dispute with apple overlaw enforcement s efforts to crackencrypted passwords on suspects iphones investigators recovered two heavily damagediphones from the deceased pensacola shooter the gunman was suspected to have shot one of them in an effort to destroy it investigators rebuilt both phones but they were unable to bypass the encrypted passwords until recently wray said the fbi designed its own coding to bypass the locks when apple declined to assist and when outside companies were unable to unlock the devices while the fbi s hard work has led to an important breakthrough in this case that should be celebrated i must also express my great disappointment that it took over four months and large sums of taxpayer dollars to obtain evidence that should be easily and quickly accessible with a court order barr said apple made a business and marketing decision to design its phones in such a way that only the user can unlock the contents no matter the circumstances the attorney general said in cases like this where the user is a terrorist or in other cases where the user is a violent criminal human traffickeror child predator apple s decision has dangerous consequences for public safety and national security and is in my judgment unacceptable apple has denied justice s assertions since they were first leveled in january military trainees get closer look pentagon to restrict monitor foreign trainees to prevent repeat of pensacola navy base shooting justice vs apple doj says apple hasn t helped unlock pensacola shooter s iphones apple says it wasasked only a week ago the company said it responded to the fbi s requests for information starting hours after the attack provided every piece of information available to the companyand lent continuous and ongoing assistance to fbi field offices in florida and new york the false claims made about our company are an excuse to weaken encryption and other securitymeasures that protect millions of users and our national security the company said in a statement adding that weakening encryption will make every device vulnerable to bad actors describing the shooting as a devastating and heinous act the company said it continues to provide assistance to federal and local law enforcement when needed it is because we take our responsibility to national security so seriously that we do not believe in the creation of a backdoor one which will make every device vulnerable to bad actors who threaten ournational security and the data security of our customers apple said there is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys and the american people do not have to choose between weakening encryption andeffective investigations the dispute mirrors a standoff between the fbi and apple involving an iphone recovered in 2015 after a mass shooting in san bernardino california that left 14 people dead in that case the fbi went to court with a demand that apple assist investigators that case was dropped after the fbi secured the assistance of an outside contractor who was successful in bypassing the passcode brett max kaufman a senior staff attorney at the american civil liberties union said the justice department s criticism of apple is not warranted every time there s a traumatic event requiring investigation into digital devices the justice department loudly claims that it needs backdoors to encryption and then quietly announces it actually found a way to access information without threatening the security and privacy of the entire world kaufman said the boy who cried wolf has nothing on the agency that cried encryption
