takeaways from his speech meet the new trump same as the old trump trump s campaign billed the rally as the official beginning of his reelection bid but it was easy to mistake it forany one of the manyother rallies he s held over the past 2 1 2 years trump appeared to be more interested in airing grievances with familiar enemies such as democrats the political establishment special counsel

report new hampshire fallout more and the fake news media whom he accused of putting him under siege rather than touting his accomplishments and laying out a second term agenda as would be typical for an incumbent president for the first half hour of his remarks the president argued that life would get even worse if he loses next year accusing his opponents of un american conduct and claiming democrats want to destroy you and our country as we know it it was not until an hour into his speech that he began speaking in depth about the economy which political strategists argue is his core strength entering the race it stood in stark contrast to his predecessors many of whom have campaigned by echoing former president reagan s line about whether voters are better off than they were four years ago the dark themes were reminiscent of the 2016 campaign a sign that he is interested in running the same kind of campaign that engineered his surprise victory but trump could face challenges in controlling the debate and keeping his supporters motivated if he sticks with the same message for the next year and a half trump will cast democrats as socialists and extremists on everything from abortion rights to immigration trump plans to cast democrats as far left extremists oftentimes in harsh terms trump warned on tuesday that democrats had become depraved on the matter of border security arguing that the democrat position on open borders is morally reprehensible and a betrayal of the american middle class the president also seized on the abortion debate that ignited when alabama passed one of the most restrictive anti abortion laws in the country saying that virtually every top democrat supports ripping babies straight from the mother s womb that fight is certain to energize the president s base of evangelical supporters and regardless of their thoughts on socialism trump plans to paint the entire 2020 democratic field as the enemies of capitalism and the american way of life of the 2020 presidential contenders only sen bernie sandersbernie sandershillicon valley tech companies lead way on wfh forever states and counties plead for cybersecurity

democraticcandidates are eager to separate the party s progressive policy proposals such as medicare for all and the green new deal from the debate over socialism nonetheless trump s approach is an attempt to set himself up as a populist fighter against political elites and an angry left wing mob they went after my family my business my employees almost everyone that i ve ever known or worked with but they re really going after you the president told the crowd trump mostly holds fire on individual 2020 dems while the president spent much of his speech excoriating the democratic party he largely avoided attacking his possible challengers during one 30 minute stretch of his remarks trump mentioned 2016 democratic presidential nominee hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill

the obama administration and did not wade into other personal attacks he also hit sanders to drive home his argument about socialism trump s performance should please his advisers who want him to paint democrats with a broad brush rather than get drawn into individual fights at this stage of the race but it appears unlikely that will hold the president is reportedly planning to live tweet next week during the democrats first primary debates little talk of agenda trump barely scratched the surface when it comes to explaining to voters what he would do if they give him four more years in the white house the president touched on the unfinished business looming over his reelection race his long promised border wall and a new health care plan but he offered few details about how he plans to get each accomplished he also paid lip service to the immigration plan he rolled out last month but which has not gained traction on capitol hill he also appeared indifferent about striking a trade deal with china saying he is finewith talks falling through perhaps in an effort to show his base he will stay tough on beijing while trump may plan to argue voters should keep him in office as a good steward of the economy the gaps in his agenda could open him up to attacks from democrats that he does not have a plan to address issues like health care and the wage gap trump wants to take on the very establishment he s part of is it possible for an incumbent president in charge of one third of the federal government to run as a washington outsider trump is going to find out over the course of his speech the president railed against the unholy alliance of lobbyists and special interests and warned that nefarious entities in washington back rooms want to take away your dignity trump complained about the rigged system he said was blocking him from achieving his goals and said the swamp is fighting back so viciously and violently against him the people trying to stop our movement are the same washington insiders who spent their careers rigging the system so your losses will be their gains you know that trump said these are the same career politicians who presided over decades of lost wages the loss of our manufacturing jobs a growing wealth gap and one ruinous trade deal after another the president will have a hard time convincing washington insiders that his administration has been a breath of fresh air for government accountability countless administration officials have been forced out or even indicted for the type of conflicts of interest or scandals that trump is railing against but still there is a sense among trump s supporters that they delivered a blow to the establishment when they helped elect trump on tuesday night the president leaned into the grievances his supporters hold against the washington political and media elites whom he accuses of looking down their noses at ordinary americans they called us deplorables that was a mistake that was a big mistake trump said updated on june 19 at 8 25 a m view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the
