the chinese government has unveiled an ambitious blueprint to get 50 million children and adults playing soccer by the end of this decade with the broader objective of becoming a world football superpower by 2050 despite boasting the world s largest population and excelling at many sports particularly athletics china woefully underperforms at soccer and has only ever qualified for one world cup a statement published monday also outlines plans to have at least 20 000 soccer training centers and 70 000 pitches in place by 2020 every county should have two full size soccer fields says the

economic downturn monday s announcement appears an attempt to meet top level investment and institutional reform with a grassroots push according to christopher atkins a soccer agent based in china the key to china becoming a top football nation is starting the development of players young and improving the concept of a football culture however success on the pitch was just a small part of xi s
