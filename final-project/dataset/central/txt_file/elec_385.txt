 by eugene kiely and chloe nurik posted on april 5 2016 hillary clinton falsely claimed she is the only candidate in the presidential campaign on either side who has been attacked in advertising funded by wall street financiers and hedge fund managers actually several candidates have been the target of ads funded in part by those in the financial industry in fact by clinton s logic real estate developer donald trump seems to be the favorite target of wall street financiers and hedge fund managers not clinton clinton made her remarks on nbc s meet the press on april 3 host chuck todd showed a video clip of bernie sanders urging clinton to release the transcripts of her paid speeches to business groups asked for her response clinton said sanders was misrepresenting my record when it comes to being tough on wall street adding that wall street financiers oppose her candidacy clinton april 3 i m the only candidate in the democratic primary or actually on either side who wall street financiers and hedge fund managers are actually running ads against that s not remotely true the clinton campaign referred us to an oct 28 2015 usa today news article about future45 a super pac that has received funding from well known republican donors in the story which is headlined new republican super pac takes aim at hillary clinton usa today s fredreka schouten wrote the super pac has received financial support from ken griffin and paul singer the billionaire founders of hedge funds along with some members of td ameritrade founder j joe ricketts family it s true that singer and griffin have donated to future45 it is also true that future45 has spent about 500 000 on ads attacking clinton according to the center for responsive politics opensecrets org but singer and griffin also gave to other outside groups that have spent millions on tv ads attacking republican presidential candidates donaldtrump ted cruz chris christie jeb bush and john kasich singer who gave 250 000 to future45 donated 1 million to our principles pac an anti trump super pac and 5 million to conservative solutions pac which supported marco rubio according to opensecrets org our principles has spent 14 8 million attacking trump while conservative solutions has run 16 7 million in attack ads against trump cruz christie bush and kasich likewise kenneth griffin has given 250 000 to future45 but he also has given 5 1 million to conservative solutions according to opensecrets org and of course singer and griffin aren t the only ones in the financial industry who contributed to outside groups seeking to influence the presidential election for example keep the promise i a pro cruz super pac was formed with an 11 million donation from robert mercer the co chief executive officer of renaissance technologies a 25 billion private hedge fund firm keep the promise i hasspent nearly 9 5 million on ads including 2 2 million against marco rubio and about 900 000 against trump by contrast the group spent just 80 000 against clinton who s the top target of wall street financiers and hedge fund managers it appears to be trump by a landslide we cannot know for sure exactly how much outside groups spend on attack ads because of the way the groups report ad buys to the federal election commission here s how it works the groups must file reports on their independent expenditures which is the fec s term for a communication expressly advocating the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate in those reports the groups must identify the candidate who is either being supported or opposed in the ad that s a judgment call that causes inconsistencies in the reporting for example right to rise usa a super pac that supported jeb bush spent 81 million on tv ads by far the most of any outside group to date according to opensecrets org however right to rise usa reported that a whopping 78 4 million of that money was spent on ads supporting bush while only 2 8 million was spent on ads opposing other republican candidates mostly marco rubio nearly 1 9 million that s simply not accurate kantar media s campaign media analysis group a service that tracks political ads and estimates how much groups spend to buy airtime for the ads told us that right to rise usa spent more on negative ads 14 million and contrast ads about 19 million than it did on solely pro bush positive ads 31 million we assign political ads one of three different types of tone positive negative or contrast in the case of right to rise usa a positive ad would only mention bush a negative ad would only mention one or more of his opponents and a contrast ad would mention both bush and one or more of his opponents andrew fitzgerald kantar media ssenior political and environmental media analyst told us i suspect that the pac counts any ad that mentions bush as supporting bush even if in the process it attacks other candidates fitzgerald said nevertheless we attempted to quantify the top target of wall street financiers and hedge fund managers based on opensecrets org s analyses of the independent expenditure reports filed by the outside groups we looked at the10 outside groups that so far have spent the most on independent expenditures each spent at least 5 million seven of the top 10 received at least 1 million in donations from those inthe securities and investment and commercial banking industries which is how opensecrets org defines wall street donations we focused our analysis on those seven groups note the 1 million threshold eliminated two groups club for growth and american future fund that may have received more than 1 million from the financial sector but we don t know because they have formed 501 c organizations under irs regulations and don t have to disclose their donors club for growth and its super pac club for growth action is actively opposed to trump the seven remaining groups from the top 10 list combined to spend nearly 196 million on independent expenditures and received at least 91 7 million in contributions fromthe securities and investment and commercial banking industries they spent nearly 21 million against trump led by the anti trump our principles pac that dwarfs what was spent against the other candidates which in order were cruz 4 6 million rubio 4 1 million christie 3 6 million bush 3 1 million and kasich 2 3 million five other candidates including clinton were the target of less than 100 000 in ads total from those seven groups see our list here future45 ranks 40th on opensecrets org s list of top spending outside groups having spent less than 600 000 to date in addition to spending 508 000 on multiple ads attacking clinton future45 spent about 45 000 on a single ad attacking sanders for proposing to raise taxes to pay for free college tuition and health care during a weak economy so clinton is not as she says the only candidate in the presidential campaign on either side who has been attacked in advertising funded by wall street financiers and hedge fund managers she is not even the top target josh schwerin a clinton campaign spokesman told us that the future45 ad attacking sanders was actually a pro sanders ad in disguise he cited a liberal blogger who wrote that the ad touts sanders support for tuition free college single payer health care and higher taxes on the super rich fair enough but singer griffin and other wall street financiers and hedge fund managers gave millions more to pacs that attacked trump and other republican candidates schwerin did not address that we asked him if clinton misspoke but schwerin did not respond to that question q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
