challengers for congress in kentucky s sixth district are betting that message will ring hollow their hopes lie with voters like joyell anderson who went for president donald trump in 2016 and said

what s going to happen kentucky s sixth congressional district where two well funded democrats are running in a may primary to see who will stand against barr in november has in recent years gone solidly republican barr won 61 percent of the vote in 2016 republicans say they are confident that barr s support will remain solid this year both democratic candidates are currently too busy fighting each other over who s the biggest progressive a surefire way to lose in a district where voters don t subscribe to their liberal brand of politics said jesse hunt spokesperson for the national republican congressional committee but many analysts see enthusiasm for the party weakening in the district and have identified it as one of several dozen seats democrats might be able to pick up in the house of representatives democrats believe that voter concerns over rising medical costs and republican plans to cut medicare and medicaid will assist them in their fight to retake the house and are urging candidates to emphasize the issue particularly in swing districts republican strategists are encouraging their candidates to focus more on the economy in november s election when they do talk about healthcare many republican candidates including barr are warning voters that a democratic majority would usher in socialized medicine residents of kentucky s sixth district home to both the

federal budget and creating jobs his vision section does not mention healthcare his most important message this year he says is economic when the people that i represent sent me to washington they wanted me to focus on growing the economy barr said in an interview we ve done that in a dramatic way on healthcare barr said he believes voters are still angry over rising health insurance costs
