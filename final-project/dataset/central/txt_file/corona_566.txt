 business insider president donald trump apos s polling numbers are tanking across the board amid the coronavirus pandemic americans increasingly disapprove of his handling of the presidency and his approach to the coronavirus pandemic and he apos s trailing former vice president joe biden in the 2020 race according to polls comparatively a number of gop governors have enjoyed a surge in approval over their handling of the coronavirus unlike trump these republican leaders have consistently taken the threat of the virus seriously and followed the guidance of public health experts after trump took steps that left the us less prepared for a pandemic in his first three years as president he ignored warnings from the intelligence community and top advisers on the devastating potential of the virus while publicly downplaying the threat for weeks but as the coronavirus outbreak escalated in startling ways across the us in march leading the president to declare a national emergency trump saw his approval rating briefly go up in what pollsters dubbed a rally around the flag effect that quickly changed in april as the us death toll and unemployment rose to astronomical levels while trump simultaneously turned daily white house press briefings into campaign rally like events in which he dominated the spotlight berated reporters and spread false information in the process the contrast between trump apos s handling of the pandemic and the approach taken by a number of republican governors could not be more stark and the consequences of his actions appear to be playing out in the polls we did all the right moves the president said on wednesday the federal government rose to the challenge and this is a great success story jared kushner trump apos s son in law and senior adviser said the same day though trump and top figures in his administration have sought to paint a positive picture of the government apos s handling of the coronavirus pandemic the numbers on the crisis tell a different story the us is the center of the pandemic with the most reported cases and confirmed fatalities as of thursday there were well over 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the us alongside more than 61 000 deaths for perspective the number of americans who have died from the coronavirus in a matter of weeks is greater than the death toll of us service members in the vietnam war which the us was directly involved in for nearly a decade what apos s more recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention suggests the us death toll from the coronavirus is much higher than the official count meanwhile about 30 million americans have filed for unemployment over the past six weeks as the us economy continues to plummet because of the pandemic and its restrictions as the crisis has worsened in the us trump apos s polling numbers have also taken a nosedive an emerson college polling national survey released on tuesday showed that trump apos s job approval rating dropped 5 percentage points since march from 46 to 41 while approval of the president apos s handling of the coronavirus dropped a whopping 10 percentage points from 49 to 39 an npr pbs newshour marist poll released wednesday showed a majority of respondents 55 disapproved of trump apos s handling of the pandemic which marked a 6 point increase in disapproval over the past month and morning consult polling released on monday showed that since it reached a high point in mid march net approval of the president apos s handling of covid 19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus hit a new low and dropped 22 points overall a majority of respondents who identified as voters 51 disapproved of trump apos s coronavirus response the poll showed while 43 approved the survey was conducted between april 24 and april 26 the days that followed trump apos s controversial dangerous suggestion that disinfectant or sunlight could be injected or used inside the body to combat the coronavirus in contrast to trump the morning consult survey showed that seven in 10 voters approved of their state and local governments apos response to the virus similarly a massive survey of 22 000 americans conducted by researchers at harvard northeastern university and rutgers university showed respondents in all 50 states approved of their governors apos handling of the coronavirus pandemic more highly than trump three out of the four highest rated governors in the poll were republicans from the states of ohio massachusetts and maryland trump on march 30 alex brandon ap photo republican gov mike dewine of ohio has been praised across the country for the early steps he took to protect his state from the coronavirus such as being the first governor to close schools and his constituents evidently appreciate his handling of the crisis as well while trump has pushed for states to reopen to get the economy going dewine has closely followed the advice of public health experts and championed a more cautious approach a baldwin wallace university poll conducted in ohio and released on monday showed only 43 of respondents in the state had a favorable view of trump while 75 of them had a favorable view of dewine the poll also found about half the respondents approved of trump apos s handling of covid 19 while a whopping 85 said they approved of dewine apos s approach to the virus and three in four respondents 75 said dewine was doing a better job at handling covid 19 than trump dewine who also broke from trump by encouraging mail in voting amid the pandemic has seen a much bigger polling bump than republican governors like ron desantis of florida who tend to take their cues from the president the florida governor has been widely criticized as being too slow to respond to the pandemic and too quick to reopen and ease restrictions a fivethirtyeight analysis of polling on governors in the final quarter of 2019 versus polling on their handling of covid 19 showed that the florida governor apos s prepandemic numbers were stronger but the leaders of other states including many democratic governors saw double digit surges in approval in their approach to the crisis before the pandemic desantis apos approval rating was 58 the analysis showed while his approval for his handling of the virus was at 51 beyond dewine gop gov larry hogan of maryland has seen strong polling numbers in terms of his response to covid 19 a recent poll showed 84 of respondents in the state approved of hogan apos s handling of the crisis hogan made national headlines this month after he and his wife yumi hogan orchestrated a deal to obtain testing kits for the coronavirus from south korea the nationwide testing kit shortage has been among the most criticized aspects of the us government apos s response to the pandemic as it has significantly limited the country apos s ability to gain a full picture of the scale of the outbreak within its borders as governors have begged the federal government for more assistance and supplies trump has consistently said it apos s up to states to gain the necessary materials though hogan essentially followed trump apos s directive in buying test kits from south korea the president subsequently attacked the maryland governor massachusetts gov charlie baker another gop leader who does not automatically follow trump apos s lead has also seen strong approval numbers on his handling of covid 19 a recent boston globe suffolk university poll showed 80 of respondents in massachusetts approved of baker apos s handling of the coronavirus compared with about 28 who said the same about trump baker has openly chastised trump on several occasions during the crisis including in response the president apos s push to reopen the country as quickly as possible the massachusetts governor also recently slammed the president apos s executive order to suspend immigration to the us with some exceptions over the pandemic i apos m opposed to the decision that the president made baker said last week i apos m opposed to the order it doesn apos t make any sense and i don apos t think it makes us any safer do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you d like to share or a tip on how your town or community is handling the pandemic please email covidtips businessinsider com and
