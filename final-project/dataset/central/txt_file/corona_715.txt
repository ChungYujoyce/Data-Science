and loneliness many many people across the nation are leaning into our shared humanity and working hard to be creative about how they remain connected says lisa marsh ryerson president of the aarp foundation the charitable arm of the aarp which has nearly 40 million members as long as those circles of connection are inclusive of older adults we ll all benefit even before the pandemic 1 in 4 older adults surveyed said they struggled with social isolation and 1 in 3 with loneliness says ms ryerson now that many seniors have become cut off from personal contact or lost work isolation is a

including letter writing and video calling care packages with puzzles picturing the family and virtual meals together roy bateman a retiree who lives alone in san francisco says he is not the type to ask for help he was never very social before the virus though he valued the couple of outings a week to meet friends for lunch or go to a japanese conversation class he used to walk a lot up to 10 hours a week now he s mostly on his computer watching news and short videos because he can t concentrate or writing emails while doing a little remote volunteer work the former federal grants administrator is anxious about infection and ventures out only very late at night he lets his newspaper sit for a day and without punctuating events in the week mr bateman is losing track of time loosely measuring it by how many cans of vegetables are left in his kitchen his last grocery shopping trip was to costco on march 13 and he needs to go soon but if some unknown good samaritan called him as the governor suggests he probably would say he doesn t need anything because that s pretty much the case and he d rather pick out his own food i m not interested in getting homemade muffins he says still he appreciates the weekly call he gets from openhouse which serves lgbtq seniors it s really nice pastor d darrell griffin of oakdale covenant church an african americanchurch on chicago s south side spends a lot of time calling seniors phoning about 35 on a recent day they were just so elated to hear my voice elated that the church was thinking of them he says the church also hosts a 6 a m telephone prayer line which has been extended from five to six days a week because of the covid 19 crisis it s designed to accommodate the lowest tech parishioner the connections are not good and the leader has to remind people to mute their phones but it works and more people are joining in glenna ousley is one of the regulars she said the pandemic has made her feel cut off but not isolated the prayer line has helped it s comforting she said it s uplifting it s god affirming it s life affirming she adds we kind of feed off each other we take comfort in knowing we re not alone at the oakdale church seniors help each other richard dobbey is 71 and head of the ushers most of them elderly he s also involved in the church s men s group and they re checking in on the older seniors he

parishioners cooked or picked up spaghetti potato salad green beans three kinds of chicken and four or five cakes he said they couldn t go to the funeral so they dropped the food off at the family s house the head usher says he isn t in good health and doesn t go out much but a few days ago when the weather in chicago turned warm he walked to his driveway sat in his car and rolled down the windows i just wanted some air i did that and listened to music my wife said what are you doing it was good for me i m doing something for myself he says helping themselves and helping each other that s true for many seniors during this isolation in los angeles hugo and elba corzo used to love going out to see dancers from their native guatemala and to dance themselves now the couple in their 60s
