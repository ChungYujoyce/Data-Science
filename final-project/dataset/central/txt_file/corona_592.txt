we consolidate every article and add some fun visuals for our email subscribers click below to get our weekly articles delivered to your inbox every week most weeks our team consolidates data from the left right and center to help you get answers to pivotal policy questions in light of the covid 19 outbreak we are breaking out of our typical format to create a data hub for the latest updates on covid 19 u s center for disease controlworld health organization healthpolitics we are breaking out of our traditional article format to deliver the data you need to contextualize the covid 19 outbreak which has impacted communities across the world today we re giving you the research behind the 2009 h1n1 pandemic it is tempting to compare previous pandemics with the current covid 19 outbreak however that is not the intention of this article for several reasons including a word of caution it is tempting to compare previous pandemics with the current covid 19 outbreak however that is not the intention of this article for several reasons including h1n1 and covid 19 are different if you attempt to compare covid 19 to the h1n1 pandemic you will be comparing a different viruses withdifferent epidemiological profiles i e different rate of spread and mortality our understanding of covid 19 is evolving accurate information on covid 19 cases and mortality rates are largely dependent on availability of testing testing criteria etc long story short we re still learning about what we re dealing with here and these viruses are always changing with that said let s dive in the h1n1 pdm09 virus strain was very different from other h1n1 viruses that were circulating at the time of the pandemic cdc few young people had any existing immunity to the h1n1 pdm09 virus but nearly one third of people over 60 years old had antibodies against this virus likely from exposure to an older h1n1 virus earlier in their lives cdc in april 2009 the first patient was detected in california and 48 hours later the second case was identified over 130 miles away with no traceable connection between the patients cdc there was no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections on june 11th 2009 the world health organization who declared the start of the firstflu pandemicin 40 years read more about the 1968 h3n2 pandemic by mid june all 50 states the district of colombia puerto rico and the u s virgin islands had reported cases of 2009 h1n1 infection cdc the influenza peaked duringmay and june 2009in the united states u s a few months after it s first detection however there was a second smaller wave in fall of 2009 and the virus persisted at lower levels for several months in the spring of 2010 cdc one week after the first cases in the u s the cdc had reported cases to the who and activated their emergency operations center to beginstrengthening thenation s ability to detect and respond to public health threats cdc between april 2009 and april 2010 cdc held 60 related media events 39 press briefings and 22 telebriefings reaching more than 35 000 participants cdc in may 2009 tests to detect 2009 h1n1 began to ship domestically and globally there were some disruptions to schools in may 2009 the cdc recommended a14 day dismissal in affected schools and childcare facilities with laboratory confirmed cases of influenza a h1n1 virus peak school dismissal was in early may when980 schools were dismissed there was no vaccine to protect against influenza infection and no antibiotics to treat secondary bacterial infections in september 2009 four influenza vaccine manufacturers received approval from the food and drug administration for use of influenza a h1n1 2009 influenza vaccines in the prevention of influenza cdc mmwr while amonovalent h1n1 pdm09 vaccinewas produced it was not available in large quantities until late november after the peak of illness during which the second wave had come and gone in the united states cdc mmwr in august of 2009 who announced the end of h1n1 global influenza pandemic roughly four months after the strain was detected cdc in the aftermath of the h1n1 pandemic there is new more detailed guidance on the use ofnon pharmaceutical interventionsto slow the spread of flu during a pandemic there is more capacity to make vaccines andnew vaccine technologieshave been introduced e g cell grown and recombinant flu vaccines progress in synthetic biology means that vaccine viruses can now be created in the lab using genetic sequencing data cdc cdc uses this technology to rapidly generate vaccine viruses against newly emerging avian and swine flu viruses that periodically cause illness in humans globally 80 percent of h1n1 pdm09 virus related deaths were estimated to have occurred in people younger than 65 years of age usually people 65 years and older represent70 percent to 90 percent of seasonal influenza victims cdc from april 12 2009 to april 10 2010 cdc estimated there were 60 8 million cases 274 304 hospitalizations and 12 469 deaths in the u s due to the h1n1 pdm09 virus cdc cdc estimated that 151 700 to 575 400 people worldwide died from h1n1 pdm09 virus infection during the first year the virus circulated cdc when looking atthe risk of a disease terms like prevalence measure of disease that allows us to determine a person s likelihood of having a disease morbidity another term for illness and is an important indicator for incidence of disease and mortality death from the disease are important to understand before interpreting what you re reading ny doh influenza virus occurs annually but changes in the virus makes it difficult to treat this change can occur in 2 ways antigenic drift and antigenic shift cdc drift these are very small changes in the genetic material shift these are very large and abrupt changes in the genetic material often due to a viral leap from one species to another ex animal to human this is what occurredin both covid19 and h1n1 09 swine flu has been around and is still around it s the drifts and more often shifts that create problems for public health cdc we deliver
