chad johansen voted first for bernie sanders in 2016 and later that year for donald trump drawn to both of the presidential candidates populist anti establishment messages he backed sanders again during the new hampshire primary three months ago but the phone repair shop owner won t be casting a ballot for trump againthis november the president s promise to improve health care and the economy for small businesses have yet to materialize johansen said and the coronavirus crisis hasn t helped his view of trump everything in the west wing is just craziness he said referring to the white house the way he acts the handling of the pandemic it s just ridiculous the way people on the front lines are having to handle this themselves he isn t following the facts and isn t listening to anyone but his genius self while trump is once again expected to attract some americans who voted forsanders in the primary and thenhelped him win crucial battleground states such as michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin in 2016 polls analysts and interviews with nearly a dozen sanders voters suggest he won t be as successful this time when he faces presumptive democratic nominee joe biden sanders influence aoc and other bernie sanders allies are helping shape policy for joe biden here s who else is helping four years ago johansen and tens of thousands of fellow sandersvoters about 1 in 8 pivoted from the self described socialist democrat during the presidential primary and cast a ballot in the general election for a billionaire republican who championed capitalist ideals they liked trump s call for a rebirth in american manufacturing his willingness to confront unfair trade practices by other countries his blunt takedown of washington s power structure themes sanders pounded as well and they didn t particularly care forhillary clinton the democratic nominee sanders dropped out of the race in april conceding the nomination to biden and endorsing the former vice president a suffolk university usa today survey last month of 638 voters who backed sanders in primaries or caucuses this year found that 4 plan to vote for trump down from the 12 who voted for trump over clinton according to a 2017 cooperative congressional election study the suffolk poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points brian schaffner a tufts university political science professor who helped manage the 2017 study expects to see fewer sanders trump voters this time around four years ago sanders trump voters included conservative democrats already moving to the gop and die hards whowanted a populist to win he said it also included progressives who thought trump would be defeated and couldn t bear to vote for clinton so casting a protest vote didn t seem like a big deal he said primary among most 2020 voters on the left is making sure trump loses schaffner said so most of bernie s supporters are going to support the democratic nominee because the alternative is just something no one on that side of the aisle wants to live with for another four years several sandersvoters who spoke to usa today said they view biden much as they viewed clinton an establishment candidate backed by the very corporate interests they see as obstacles to progress we need good health care we need good education he s not going to make that possible said alana jones 30 a freelance writer from marshall missouri he s not got an honest bone in his body and yet jones said she ll hold her nose and vote for the former vice president just as she did for clinton because obviously trump is so much worse that lack of enthusiasm could cost biden in the long run said david paleologos director of the suffolk university political research center in boston that conducted the recent survey of sanders voters more joe biden needs his joe biden here s a look at the women who could be on his vice presidential shortlist paleologos calls biden a shoulder shrug candidate among sanders supporters since 3 in 5 sanders voters surveyed said they were not excited by his nomination when you get closer to election day you need bodies you need a ground game whether it s real or virtual of course you need donations but you need a network that s fueled by the candidate s appeal he said and if 60 of sanders supporters said they re not enthused about him running even though they re voting for him that s not a solid base to build upon sanders voters generally can be split into two camps those who said defeating trump in november is paramount and those who said pushing policy proposals is the top priority biden does well among the first group with 94 saying they ll vote for the former vice president in november according to the suffolk poll but among those who said policy positionsare more important only 55 said they re backing biden the restare divided with 7 voting for trump 20 voting for a third party candidate 5 skipping the election and 13 undecided chester potash 86 voted for trump four years ago and he plans to do so again in november he calls biden arrogant and a liar and drawing a favorable comparison to sanders for whom he voted twice in primaries he likes the president s willingness to take on congressional leaders like house speaker nancy pelosi d calif whom he views as entrenched and corrupt i think congress should be more like the people they live in a different world they have their own standards the retired engineer from pittsfield massachusetts said they can live the life of luxury when they retire that isn t right more bernie sanders says it s very unlikely that he will run for president again ryan clancy 27 won t be voting for trump but he s thinking about sitting out the election and notvotingfor biden either i m having trouble stomaching the thought of voting for joe biden as i think many people are said the engineer from baltimore who voted for sanders in 2016 and plans to vote for him again in maryland s june 2 primary even though sanders is no longer in the race sanders stood for something where biden sort of seems to stand for a lot of things that hillary did which obviously didn t work against trump clancy said and it doesn t seem like it ll go any different sanders made his support for biden clear and swift unlike four years ago when his endorsement of clinton was viewed as late and tepid the vermont senator has repeatedly called trump the most dangerous president in modern american history and exhorted supporters to get behind biden his politically moderate rival in turn biden has moved a bit to the left he now says public colleges and universitiesshould be free for all lower income and middle class families becauseof the coronavirus pandemic though he continues to oppose medicarefor all one of sanders signature campaign issues i think people are going to be surprised we are apart on some issues but we are awfully close on others biden told sanders during a joint live streamed appearance five days after sanders suspended his campaign in april i m going to need you not just to win the campaignbut to govern sanders endorsement could sway some reluctant supporters to get behind the formervice president paleologos said among those in the suffolk poll who knew about sanders endorsement of biden 80 were voting for biden he said among those who didn t only 63 said they would vote for the former vice president assault accusation this never happened joe biden denies sexual assault allegation calls on national archives to release records sanders needs to make a personal appeal to those voters and or biden needs to demonstrate to sanders voters how important sanders is to his administration paleologos said and that might be saying to sanders voters when i m elected sanders will be in the cabinet because the balance of the sanders voters who are not with biden need something to be enthusiastic about biden could also make some headway by choosing a running mate who appeals to progressive voters it won t be sanders because biden has pledged to pick a woman for the ticket clancy the maryland engineer said he d be likelier to vote for biden if he chose former presidential candidate elizabeth warren the massachusetts democratic senator and liberal champion who vied with sanders for the progressive vote during thecampaign almost every sanders voter usa today talked to spoke glowingly of former president barack obama but thosewarm feelings donot extend to biden whom the former president has warmly endorsed roberto gonzalez 50 volunteered in the obama campaign in 2012 but he voted for green party nominee jill stein in 2016 because he didn tlike clinton s policies and he plans to vote for trump in novemberbecause he doesn t believe biden is the change agentthe country needs right now i don t want somebody who has been already 30 years there and not doing the right thing said gonzalez the owner of a small trucking firm in anaheim california so why support trump cellar dweller biden in the basement can campaigning from home work as trump starts to travel he s unhappy with the democrats for what he sees as a conspiracy to deny sanders the nomination a sentiment shared among many sanders voters he s also critical of trump for talking too much butbelieves the president has been good for the economy donald trump is a businessman he s very smart gonzalez said sometimes everybody makes mistakes and he gets in trouble i m looking at the good things what he s doing for the country schaffner the tufts university professor said biden probably has abetter chance to win over sanders voters clinton couldn tbecause he s generally seen as more likable than she was as a candidate 2016 was a unique election in that you had the two most disliked nominees ever running against each other the tufts professor said i think people aren t going to dislike biden probably quite as much as they did clinton so it s possible there are some moderates in that group who will be ok voting for biden christopher mcgarry 35 a computer salesman from swanzey n h said he voted for both sanders and trump in 2016 because he really really disliked clinton he voted for sanders three months ago in new hampshire s primary and plans to vote for trump again in november the reason he believes biden is not fit for office because of his age and verbal gaffes iwish they would give me a better option mcgarry said biden would have been a better option 15 years ago sanders supporterkeith boos 28 has similar concerns about biden but concedes he s probably more genuine and a slight upgrade over clinton whom he ultimately supported four years ago she was an establishment candidate and i think biden is too the production designer from los angeles said but i think the team behind biden has to have learned a lot from 2016 and i think he ll learn not to discredit those bernie voters he said he seems to have less baggage but he s notwithout his baggage so i m not worlds happier so what does he like about biden i like that he s not donald trump boos said i like that a lot
