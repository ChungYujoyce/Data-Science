senate floor vote on kavanaugh to give the fbi time to investigate the allegations against him that probe is expected to be completed later this week heitkamp suggested at a campaign stop friday in north dakota that trump and gop leaders could defuse the situation by finding another nominee who would have just enough time to be confirmed before congress adjourns for the year there s a lot of lawyers in america who can sit on the court she said in grand forks according to the associated press i think this idea that there s only one person that can do this job we all need to recalibrate senate aides see heitkamp as less likely to support kavanaugh than manchin because she has a stronger record defending abortion rights his confirmation could tip the court s balance against roe v wade the landmark 1973 decision that established abortion rights nationwide heitkamp may also feel more pressure to believe ford s allegation which has exposed a significant gender divide among the electorate a recent usa today ipsos public affairs poll showed that 35 percent of women nationwide believe ford s accusation while only 21 percent of men do women opposekavanaugh 43 percent to 23

made a decision and we re all still looking and talking and comparing manchin told reporters after the meeting donnelly said he would oppose kavanaugh because he didn t have enough information to assess the allegations against him though he left himself a little bit of room to support the nominee if the fbi probe fails to turn up any corroborating evidence he cited the lack of a supplemental fbi investigation and his own inability to get all information necessary as reasons for his opposition donnelly declined to answer a question monday about whether he would be open to changing his position trump has sent signals that he may now be of a mixed opinion about kavanaugh on friday he described ford as a very fine woman and very credible the president on monday said he was surprised at how vocal kavanaugh was about the fact that he likes beer and he s had a little bit of difficulty trump noted that while he himself never drank he saw a lot of people drinking in high school they d drink beer then go crazy he said in comments that appeared to undercut the nominee s defense of his drinking habits but trump also wants red state democrats to pay a political price if kavanaugh goes down trump chewed out mcconnell 11 days ago in a private phone call from his golf club in bedminster n j for letting kavanaugh s nomination drag on according to the new york times the president later
