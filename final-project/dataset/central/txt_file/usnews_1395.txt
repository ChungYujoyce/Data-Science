as more democrats call for an impeachment inquiry just one thing is certain the conversation is not going away anytime soon congress returned to the capitol monday after a week long recess that saw several more democratic lawmakers including two committee chairmen join the growing calls for impeachment more than 55 democrats currently support an impeachment inquiry according to tallies from multiple news outlets and many are convinced the numbers will only increase i think the feeling of inevitability is growing generally said rep jamie raskin who sits on the judiciary and oversight committees and is in support of an inquiry there is a sense that the lawlessness and corruption of the white house leave us little choice people were catalyzed into action by the president s order to the executive branch to stop cooperating with all legislative inquiries calls for an inquiry began percolating more loudly last month as democrats grew frustrated by the white house s repeated stonewalling democrats are responding to the white house s defiance house majority leader steny hoyer announced there would be a floor vote on june 11 to hold attorney general barr and former white house counsel don mcgahn in contempt for defying subpoenas and thejudiciary committee will hold a set of hearings to examine special counsel robert mueller s report democrats are also prevailing in court where the administration is challenging several subpoenas but these actions are doing nothing to quell members who want an inquiry this is a question of making sure the committee has the ability to tell the american people the story said rep david cicilline a member of the judiciary committee and democratic leadership in explaining his support for an inquiry to the extent that the president continues to behave as if he s above the law and continues to prevent congress from performing their oversight the number of people who will grow frustrated and think their only option will be to open an impeachment inquiry on sunday members of that camp got a boost when rep jim clyburn the majority whip and third highest ranking democrat in the chamber said he thought the impeachment process was inevitable we re trying to make sure that we do what is necessary to educate the public make sure that the public understands exactly what we re doing why we re doing it so that people won t misinterpret this as being a political move on our part clyburn told cnn s jake tapper it sounds like you think that the president will be impeached or at least proceedings will begin in the house at some point but just not right now tapper clarified yes that s exactly what i feel said clyburn as majority whip clyburn has jurisdiction over vote counts giving him unique insight into where the caucus stands his willingness then to declare impeachment an inevitability on national television may confirm what many lawmakers and aides have been saying privately that support for an inquiry extends beyond those who have publicly called for one he s a very smart guy very experienced and a very canny politician said virginia rep don beyer my sense is that he has a pretty good finger on the pulse of the democratic caucus beyer also said comments like clyburn s are key to fostering more public support for an inquiry among the caucus it makes people feel a little more comfortable about actually coming out for the inquiry or all the way for impeachment said beyer everyone has struggled for a long time between the desire to get a lot done right now versus our constitutional responsibility to defend democracy many of us believe that what trump has done is impeachable a cnn poll released june 2 found that 76 of democrats are in favor of impeachment a 7 point increase from april but that polling also highlights the political perils of starting the process even if it s just an inquiry the poll found that 54 of voters overall said trump should not be impeached this discrepancy illustrates why clyburn may deem impeachment inevitable but not immediate it is clear that house speaker pelosi along with her leadership team wants independent voters who were key to democrats regaining the house majority to be solidly on board before anything happens what nancy pelosi is trying to do and the rest of us in the house of representatives is to develop a process by which we can efficiently move on this issue so that when we get to a vote it would be something that she calls ironclad i call effective clyburn said sunday and that is why we are trying to take our time and do this right write to alana abramson at alana abramson time com
