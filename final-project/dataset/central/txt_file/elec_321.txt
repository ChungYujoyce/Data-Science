 mark memmott eyder peralta liz halloran rep todd akin r mo talking with reporters at the missouri state fair last week orlin wagner ap hide caption rep todd akin r mo talking with reporters at the missouri state fair last week saying that the positions he and others have taken against abortion will strengthen our country and it s going to strengthen the republican party missouri rep todd akin said just before 1 30 p m et that he will not withdraw from his state s senate race by a 6 p m et deadline this evening i believe that there is something that we re missing something many americans feel in their heart of hearts believe we should be talking about he said on the syndicated mike huckabee radio show a respect of life is deeply engrained in our culture maybe the party needs to include that as part of the party akin added that he doesn t think it s fair that fumbling on one sentence his much criticized remark that most legitimate rapes don t cause pregnancies should cost him the candidacy is there a matter of some justice here akin asked i misspoke one word in one sentence on one day he believes constituents will forgive him and he said there is grassroots support for his positions on abortion update at 4 08 p m et romney calls on akin to withdraw mitt romney the presumptive republican presidential nominee and the party s de facto leader has now made it clear that akin should withdraw here s what he told reporters according to politico as i said yesterday todd akin s comments were offensive and wrong and he should very seriously consider what course would be in the best interest of our country today his fellow missourians urged him to step aside and i think he should accept their counsel and exit the senate race our original post and earlier updates it s come to this for rep todd akin of missouri as more and more of his fellow republicans call on him to drop out of his race for the senate before today s 6 p m et deadline to easily get his name off the ballot the congressman s loudest defender is his democratic opponent what s startling to me sen claire mccaskill d mo said monday is that these republican party big wigs are coming down on him and saying that he needs to kick sand in the face of the republican primary voters as our colleagues at st louis public radio say it s an odd bit of political posturing of course as frank james has pointed out over at it s all politics part of mccaskill s early campaign strategy appeared to be doing what she could to help akin become the gop nominee because he was arguably the weakest of the republicans seeking that opportunity her campaign ran negative ads against two of the three gop contenders during that party s primary her ads mentioning akin were less sharp so she isn t exactly a disinterested party in case you re just catching up with the story akin caused controversy on sunday when he said during a tv interview that in cases of legitimate rape women rarely get pregnant the implications that some women claim rape in order to justify abortions or that there s some sort of difference between rape and forcible rape led to condemnations of his remarks by democrats and republicans alike outside groups and national republican campaigns have withdrawn their financial support for akin s campaign the congressman has vowed to stay in the race but with missouri election law allowing akin to simply withdraw by 6 p m et today and then let the gop choose a new contender pressure is building on him to get out he could as the st louis post dispatch explains wait until sept 25 but would first need to seek a court order on morning edition npr s brian naylor noted that the missouri race is important to republicans because party leaders view mccaskill s seat as one of their best chances for a pick up there are currently 51 democrats in the senate and two independents who caucus with that party meanwhile cnn s piers morgan tonight had promoted an appearance by akin on last night s broadcast only to have the congressman fail to show up so cnn kept a camera trained on an empty chair and morgan said that if akin didn t come on then you are what we would call in britain a gutless little twerp update at 1 16 p m et akin making an announcement the mike huckabee radio show says akin is on live with the mike huckabee radio show now announcing his campaign decision update at 1 15 p m et missouri s top republicans ask akin to step aside this statement was just sent to reporters by aides to sen roy blunt r mo u s senator roy blunt called u s representative todd akin s recent statements totally unacceptable and issued the following joint statement together with former missouri u s senators john ashcroft kit bond john danforth and jim talent calling for akin to step aside we do not believe it serves the national interest for congressman todd akin to stay in this race the issues at stake are too big and this election is simply too important the right decision is to step aside update at 8 45 a m et in new ad akin asks for foregiveness i used the wrong words in the wrong way and for that i apologize he says and akin adds that the fact is rape can lead to pregnancy npr
