of the 44th president barack obama the story the book delves into obama s family history and his pre political years maraniss says that the president s young life was defined by his struggle as an outsider he grew up in indonesia where he had to learn a new language and hawaii where his race made him stand out his father was almost entirely absent and his mother lived abroad for much of obama s life two things obsessed me maraniss told npr s rachel martin one was the randomness of his very being the world that created him the other was how he remade himself how this person this character this hapa as they say in hawaii half white and half black found his own identity on the choom gang obama s clique at the prestigious punahou school in honolulu the choom gang were his buddies and choom is a hawaiian term that basically means to smoke marijuana and barack in his own memoir writes pretty openly and freely about his drug use during high school and college you know these were not ne er do well kids they were his buddies who liked to smoke dope and play basketball and hang out he wasn t part of the elite but he wasn t a totally disillusioned disconnected kid either he was somewhere in the middle as were all of his friends so the choom gang was basically a family and it was a place he felt he belonged as was basketball barack obama used this photo on his application to occidental college courtesy occidental college hide caption barack obama used this photo on his application to occidental college on the students he befriended during his time at occidental college he was starting to think about the larger world and he had basically the sensibility of an internationalist he lived in indonesia as a kid his mother was still in indonesia he didn t feel comfortable yet connecting particularly with some of the inner city black students at occidental he could actually deal with anybody but the people he felt most comfortable with were some of the foreign students many of whom were rather wealthy pakistanis and i don t want to make too much of that but he was half white half black himself they were neither black nor white plus they had this international sensibility i just think he felt very comfortable with them on obama s decision to leave occidental after two years he left i think primarily because occidental was too much like punahou nice weather all the time very comfortable beautiful campus a little bit confined and isolated he wanted to get into the world so ironically he goes to new york he goes there because he wants to be near harlem and find some more of his black identity and yet that doesn t happen there he makes no black friends lasting friends during his entire period in new york on his lost period in new york he felt uncomfortable around the black student organization he would go to some of the meetings but he never became part of it dozens of african american students that we interviewed there did not remember him so he basically found that same set he did at occidental some of his pakistani friends moved there after he graduated from columbia obama dated an australian woman named genevieve cook who had also spent part of her childhood in indonesia despite their shared interests and experiences she found him guarded and controlled in her journal she wrote barack still intrigues me but so much going on beneath the surface out of reach courtesy simon schuster hide caption after he graduated from columbia obama dated an australian woman named genevieve cook who had also spent part of her childhood in indonesia despite their shared interests and experiences she found him guarded and controlled in her journal she wrote barack still intrigues me but so much going on beneath the surface out of reach he found a few girlfriends who happened to be white and he just went into this deeply introspective period working out his identity and to a large degree he figured it out he found himself and part of that was this period in new york that they call the lost period but it was really just he was working out in his head very very deeply on obama s cultural homecoming in chicago what he s looking for is home and he finds it in chicago michelle is not even in my book michelle robinson his future wife but she is in a sense the hero of the book because you see this long arc toward home who am i where do i belong and he figures it out during that introspective period in new york and then he finds it on the south side of chicago where he is embraced for the first time by a black community and interacts with it every day and he sort of knows that that s where he belongs and he sees how he can rise from there but always be part of that so i consider this entire book sort of a very classic search for home which all stories are in a way npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
