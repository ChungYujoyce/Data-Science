the problem for democratic frontrunner joe biden at thursday s debate wasn t that he was so bad it was that california sen kamala harris was so good harris and south bend mayor pete buttigieg were crisp and commanding in round two of the opening democratic debates in miami more dominant in driving the conversation thaneither biden or vermont sen bernie sanders who has generally ranked second in national and state polls the impact of the back to back debates was to expand the possibilities of the democratic contest biden leads the field but he wasn t the only contender who came across as a credible president that undercuts theimage he has tried to project as the all but inevitable nominee especially if democrats really wanted to deny president donald trump a second term consider one emotional exchange i do not believe that you are a racist harris said turning to look at biden as she spoke but she said it was personal and hurtful when he recently cited with pride the compromises he had struck in the senate with two avowed segregationists he had supported legislation against school busing harris added noting that she herselfhad been bused as a child do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in america harris whose father is african american asked biden bristling accused her of mischaracterizing his comments on the segregationists i did not praise racists he said and hisposition on busing winners and losers who stood out in thursday night s debate she spoke emotionally he responded defensively while all the candidates focused most of their fire on trump and he returned the favor commenting derisively on the debate even as he met with foreign leaders at the g 20 summit in japan the evening was threaded with attacks on biden the suggestion implicitly and explicitly was that it was time for the democratic party to move beyond biden and sanders the two septuagenarians who were standing at center stage democratic debate night 1 the debate over the democratic candidate and the direction of the party is just getting started who are they who is running for president in 2020 an interactive guide one debate won t determine the trajectory of this long race of course there are 11 more debates scheduled including a second next month in detroit the opening iowa caucuses are still more than seven months away that said biden s performance in his first campaign debate in seven years left some of his supporters concerned and harris performance made her the top trending topic on google for a time biden was folksy part of his engaging political persona but hefailed to articulate a clear visionabout what exactly he would do as president harris was forceful displaying the prosecutor s skills she honed as san francisco district attorney and california attorney general but her decision to raise her hand when the nbc moderator asked which candidates would eliminate private health insurance as part of medicare for all could complicate her appeal to more moderate democrats in the primaries it surely would open her to fierce political attack from republicans in the general election if she won the nomination buttigieg also had a good night he came across as low key and thoughtful when he was asked about a fatal police shooting in south bend last week sparking a furor that forced him to curtail campaigning for several days to deal with tensions there it s a mess and we re hurting buttigieg said saying he had taken some steps but not enough to deal with the issue before the tragedy happened and the winner is trump declares a winner of the democratic debates himself at another point buttigieg seemed to strike a chord when he cast his criticism of thetrump administration s controversial policy of forcibly separating migrant children from their parents in religious terms for a party that associates with christianity to say it is ok to suggest that god would smile on the division of families at the hands of federal agents that god would condone putting children in cages has lost all claim to ever use religion language again he said thursday s debate was louder and faster than the one on wednesday that may have been the result of havingthe field s top candidates on stage and it may have reflected lessons learned that new york mayor bill de blasio for one managed to get more air time on wednesday by just jumping in for most of the candidates the debates gave them the biggest audiences of their lives a chance to break through withvoters across the country who had never seen them before more than 15 million people watched on wednesday nbc said after that opening night former housing secretary julian castro and new jersey sen cory booker got an immediate boost from what were seen as strong appearances we already hit our 5k goal booker bragged in a tweet an hour before the second debate began including a link to a fundraising page think we can raise 15k before the end of tonight s debate candidate first buttigieg becomes first openly lgbtq candidate in presidential debate the debates spotlighted the unprecedented diversity of the democratic field in demography and generation the participants included six women two african americans a latino and an openly gay man the contrast in age was striking buttigieg 37 stood to biden s right biden now 76 already hadserved in the u s senate for nine years by the time buttigieg was born california rep eric swalwell argued and not subtly that it was time for a new generation to take over he was 6 years old when a presidential candidate came to california 32 years ago and said it was time to pass the torch to a new generation of americans that candidate was then senator joe biden swalwell said then declared at the top of his voice pass the torch pass the torch i m still holding on to that torch biden fired back i want to make that clear he hopes
