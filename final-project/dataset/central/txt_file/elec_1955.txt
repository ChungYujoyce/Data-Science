 by robert farley posted on february 21 2020 railing against a fox news guest who said donald trump won the presidency despite poor debate performances trump held up a series of opt in online surveys to misleadingly claim that polls showed he won every single debate scientific polls showed otherwise in an extended riff that lasted more than 10 minutes during a rally in colorado springs colorado on feb 20 trump took issue with comments made by real clear politics associate editor a b stoddard who cautioned viewers not to count out democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg even though the former new york city mayor looked uncoachable and committed many blunders in the democratic debate on feb 19 i think that donald trump had disastrous debate performances many answers were so cringeworthy you just couldn t even believe he was still standing on the stage and he s president stoddard said on neil cavuto s fox news program on feb 20 trump initially lashed out on twitter saying that i won every one of my debates and challenged stoddard and cavuto to c heck the polls taken immediately after the debates could somebody at foxnews please explain to trump hater a b stoddard zero talent and teamcavuto that i won every one of my debates from beginning to end check the polls taken immediately after the debates the debates got me elected must be fox board member paul ryan donald j trump realdonaldtrump february 20 2020 trump expounded on that during the rally in colorado a few hours later again referencing the segment on cavuto s show but refusing to use stoddard s name and i said wait a minute i won every debate it s true trump said and we sent them polls poll after poll after poll not only won them but i won them by a lot i m just saying every poll you you know they do those polls right after 3 4 500 000 people time magazine two minutes later dan scavino the trump campaign s social media manager handed trump a stack of news clippings trump then spent the next 10 minutes reading numbers from what he called polls taken by time cnbc drudge and others immediately after the debates that indicated the public overwhelmingly believed trump won all of the primary and general election debates i won every single debate trump said then three and a half four years later i have to listen to a person saying how we didn t do well because these people trump then pointed toward the press are among the most dishonest people anywhere in the world we reached out to the trump campaign for details about which polls specifically trump was citing but we did not get a response however from the ones that trump held up we could see that he was referring to online opt in surveys such as these from time and cnbc in which readers are asked to respond or vote online for who they thought won the debate they are not scientific polls and they carry disclaimers making that clear after the first general election debate between trump and hillary clinton on sept 26 2016 trump tweeted the results of more than a half dozen of such informal polls commenting such a great honor final debate polls are in and the movement wins at the rally trump read the results from three of those polls including two from the conservative outlets breitbart and drudge both of which showed more than 75 of respondents thought trump won the debate but those opt in online surveys stand in stark contrast to the result of scientific polls here s a sampling of those polls on who won the first debate cnn orc international clinton 62 trump 27 public policy polling clinton 51 trump 40 yougov

encountered so far suggests that voters thought hillary clinton beat donald trump in monday night s debate experts at the american association for public opinion research warn that opt in internet surveys are notoriously unreliable and they have cautioned that self selection into a survey means that it is not randomized making it impossible to know the probability or likelihood of any particular individual being included in a study after several fox news hosts cited online opt in surveys to suggest that trump won the debate fox news vice president of public opinion research dana blanton sent a memo to producers and the politics team reminding them that such polls do not meet our editorial standards in the memo obtained by business insider blanton wrote that online polls like the one on drudge time etc where people can opt in or self select are really just for fun news networks and other organizations go to great effort and rigor to conduct scientific polls for good reason blanton wrote they know quick vote items posted on the web are nonsense not true measures of public opinion as most of the publications themselves clearly state the sample obviously can t be representative of the electorate because they only reflect the views of those internet users who have chosen to participate blanton wrote another problem we know some campaigns groups of supporters encourage people to vote in online polls and flood the results indeed the daily dot which covers internet culture reported after the first general election debate in 2016 that trump supporters used sites like reddit and 4chan to bombard the online surveys and manipulate the results in trump s favor whether that happened or to what degree is impossible to know but the fact that it could have happened points to the unreliability of such surveys q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
