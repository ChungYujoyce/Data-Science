old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more if a likely winning strategy is to reconstitute as much of the obama and clinton coalitions as possible it s unlikely they will be able to do so sharing the same ideological space said democratic strategist basil smikle name dropping the last two democratic presidential nominees sanders 76 and warren 69 have much in common both are heroes to the left and represent the progressive side of democratic politics that clearly has momentum within the party they have complimented one another and joined forces on common causes most recently last week on legislation that would provide debt relief to storm ravaged puerto rico they align on almost every issue one sanders ally said that s not an accident yet sources say tensions lie beneath the surface including over warren s decision to remain neutral in the 2016 democratic primary between sanders and hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more a more centrist politician there s definitely a built in rivalry there and there s definitely some unspoken tension said one sanders associate who worked on the senator s 2016 presidential bid if the two both make a charge for their party s ring in 2020 it will be difficult to avoid raising tensions further bernie feels he did run and did enormously well and he s earned the right to run again said the sanders associate who put it on warren to determine whether she wanted to take on sanders she s got to figure out if there s room for the two of them he s the one who was there has an organization still has his following and he s still getting huge crowds wherever he goes the associate added strategists say sanders and warren will be hard pressed to share the same lane leading to speculation that if both run for the white house one will have to run to the center however slightly someone most likely senator warren would have to move a little to the center to be successful in a primary and general saidsmikle whoworked for clinton and served as the executive director to the new york democratic party otherwise you leave yourself vulnerable to the right in both elections publicly warren and sanders aren t doing anything that would make people see them as rivals albeit friendly ones both warren s and sanders s offices declined to comment for this story democrats say warren has gained favor within the ranks of the democratic party on july 12 she was the only senator to attend a democratic congressional campaign committee breakfast at the committee s capitol hill headquarters at the breakfast before

economy more d calif sang warren s praises she said it was rare for a senator to join the fundraising effort for the house but thatwarren had been doing everything in her power to get democrats elected in the midterms according to sources in the room this is not typical pelosi said according to a source in the room but that s because she s done more than anyone else she s dedicated to winning sanders who put off some democrats who thought he stayed in the 2016 primary too long against clinton also has spent considerable time since that election crisscrossing the country to campaign and win loyalty from fellow democrats just last month he appeared in kansas alongside alexandria ocasio cortez the 28 year old democratic socialist who defeated incumbent rep joseph crowley in a primary for new york s 14th congressional district a few democrats say they do think there s room for both of the powerful progressives in a 2020 race after the last election cycle we need to have a vigorous debate and they re two articulate leaders who deserve to fight it out in the primary said democratic strategist jim manley who added that he s convinced both are going to run and i don t see one bowing out for the other they re going to have to battle it out over who is going to carry the left wing of the party and i can only assume both are eying each other warily we re heading for a big debate and i for one have no problem with it manley said another sanders ally requesting anonymity to speak candidly said sanders and warren will figure it out as 2020 draws closer the nature of presidential campaigns is that they re very individualistic and they ll decide on their own what they ll each do at the end of the day the ally said on the plus side they are two amazing candidates talking about a progressive future but one big minus is that it could enable a third person to do much better view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628
