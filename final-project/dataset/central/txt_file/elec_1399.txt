ways and that is instructive loading june 24 2016 britain s vote to exit the european union or brexit contains clear echoes of the choice americans face this november a future as championed by hillary clinton that favors a more open internationalist system versus the one embodied by the populist nativist donald trump mr trump himself in scotland visiting his golf courses drew the parallel friday they took their country back just like we will take america back trump tweeted after the result was announced brussels the headquarters of the eu isn t equivalent to washington but the alienation from a distant capital that many british and us citizens feel is real there was a definite flavor of make britain great again running through the leave campaign with brexit proponents arguing that british sovereignty was being undermined by unelected elites in brussels writes peter weber in the week and there s no doubt that trumpism is part of the larger strain of nationalism sweeping europe as seen in france s national front the alternative for germany party hungary s ruling nationalist fidesz party and britain s own ukip the united kingdom independence party which pushed hard for brexit the vote for brexit also contained an element of anti elitism that echoes trump s outsider message a rejection of the powers that be in politics business and the media that promoted staying in the eu british prime minister david cameron promptly announced his resignation friday opening the door to the possible rise of a distinctly trump like figure in former london mayor boris johnson though down in the polls trump has some advantages starting with enormous crowds that dwarf those that greet the less charismatic mrs clinton crowd sizes don t necessarily predict election outcomes but they are a signal of enthusiasm and trump supporters are nothing if not fervent true trump has big unfavorable ratings now at an all time high of 70 percent of americans in the latest abc news washington post poll but love him or not the billionaire real estate magnate is the driving story of the 2016 election and always it seems at the center of the news for now he s losing to clinton by an average of only five percentage points clinton is also unpopular though not nearly as unpopular as trump bottom line with more than four months to go till election day the election is far from over still there s an important way in which britain s vote to exit the eu doesn t necessarily foretell trump s election as president the us has a buffer known as the electoral college even if trump can manage to win a majority of the popular vote in november he can still lose in the electoral college which hands disproportionate power to a handful of battleground states recall george w bush s election in 2000 despite vice president al gore s victory in the popular vote the founding fathers sought to protect the nation from the risks of direct democracy until 1913 for example us senators were elected by the state legislatures not by popular vote and today even though many states and localities allow for policy to be set by ballot measures or referenda there s no mechanism to do so nationally to us opponents of the brexit thursday s vote vindicates that practice what you re seeing here is the danger of government by referendum richard haass president of the council on foreign relations said friday on cnbc the us presidential campaign of 2016 is also an example of what can happen in an increasingly democratized nomination process when outsiders like trump and bernie sanders a self described democratic socialist can take the traditional parties by storm and upend the status quo if nothing else the success so far of trump in the us and the british campaign to quit the eu shows the risk of making predictions at the start of the 2016 election campaign virtually no one saw trump winning the nomination this week before the brexit votes were in global financial markets and other prediction forums showed confidence that britain would remain in the eu as nate cohn writes in the new york times betting markets gave remain an 88 percent chance of winning as late as 6 p m eastern us time thursday remain ended up losing by four percentage points opinion polls consistently showed there was a very real chance that britain would vote to leave mr cohn points out get the monitor
