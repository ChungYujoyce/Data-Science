detroit this week many are wondering if they ll see another skirmish between kamala harris and joe biden last time the california senator s well aimed strike against the former vice president over busing gave her a boost in the polls underlying that tactical question however is a bigger one is senator harris planting herself firmly to mr biden s left or is she laying the groundwork to try to topple him as the most viable moderate in the race on monday senator harris seemed to gesture back toward the center a bit unveiling a medicare for all plan that includes a role for private insurance within the medicare system her plan calls for a 10 year transition and would be paid for partly by taxing stock and bond trades rather than the middle class right now she s looking for the center of the democratic primary electorate and she hasn t quite figured out how that matches or doesn t match with the balance that she did in california where she was a bit center right when she ran for senate says marcia godwin of the university of la verne in california as democrats await the next round of primary debates in detroit this week many are wondering if they ll see yet another skirmish between kamala harris and joe biden last time the california senator s well aimed strike against the former vice president over his past opposition to busing rocked him on his heels and gave her a big boost in the polls though it has since slipped somewhat underlying that tactical question however is an even bigger and as yet unsettled one is senator harris planting herself to mr biden s left as her previous ambush seemed to do implying she is more progressive than he or is she laying the groundwork to try to topple him as the most viable moderate in the race it s a critical question not only for senator harris but for the top tier of democratic candidates generally lately many political observers have been warning that the party s overall leftward drift could hurt them in the general election remember 1972 they say when the liberal senator from south dakota george mcgovern lost in a landslide to an unpopular incumbent president richard nixon or just think back to 2016 when donald trump lost the popular vote but won the electoral college in key battleground states in the rust belt that could happen again it s very dangerous says phil trounstine co editor and publisher of calbuzz speaking of the progressive tilt of many of the candidates democrats nationally are more moderate than the twitterverse the liberal caucus in washington and many of the presidential candidates he maintains i don t think socialism is going to be that popular in wisconsin pennsylvania and michigan the president is already defining his campaign as one against socialism a top issue among the democrats more progressive candidates medicare for all does not poll well nationally according to a july npr pbs marist poll only 41 of registered voters think that a national health insurance program that replaces private health insurance is a good idea while 54 think it s a bad idea of the leading four candidates only mr biden does not support medicare for all all hands went up in the second june debate when candidates including mr biden and senator harris were asked if they supported health coverage for unauthorized immigrants yet the npr pbs marist poll shows only 33 of americans think that s a good idea while 62 think it s a bad one some candidates including senator harris have suggested decriminalizing illegal border crossings that s tantamount to declaring publicly that we have open borders jeh johnson former homeland security secretary under president barack obama told the washington post last week the senator showcased her progressive and prosecutorial credentials when she said that under her presidency the justice department would have no choice but to pursue criminal charges against a former president trump for obstruction of justice she supports impeachment it is not surprising that she is now articulating the more progressive policies that she has supported in recent years says dianne bystrom a longtime observer of women candidates and presidential campaigns in iowa senator harris critique of the vice president and its positive impact on her polling numbers is evidence that moving to the left can create positive results for her campaign she says in an email mr trounstine believes that senator harris primary strategy is to do well enough in iowa and new hampshire try to win in south carolina and then attempt to use california as a slingshot to victory in other states a post debate july poll by quinnipiac university saw her overtake the former vice president in her home state though voters who identified themselves as democrats or democratic leaning still said mr biden would be the best leader and had the best chance of beating president trump if the senator s strategy works the danger for the democratic party is that kamala harris would not have been tested in any of the industrial midwestern states that one has to win in order to beat trump says mr trounstine roger salazar a democratic consultant in sacramento does not see 2020 unfolding as a 1972 like liberal trouncing this is not the same country that mcgovern and nixon were battling it out over this is a much different country he says people used to be more flexible in their positions now what you see is a lot less of a battle for the middle because the middle seems to be shrinking still he is concerned about the battleground states of wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania progressives need to do a better job of communicating to working class voters there that they have their best interests at heart says mr salazar they need to focus on issues of affordability and job creation senator harris proposes giving working families a tax credit of up to 6 000 a year raising teacher pay and ensuring equal pay for women of course it s textbook campaign strategy to run to the left or right in primaries to appeal to base voters and then pivot in a general election to win over a broader ideological spectrum but can a candidate like senator harris pivot is pivoting even possible in today s divided america on monday she seemed to be trying to lay the groundwork for such a move unveiling a medicare for all plan that includes a role for private insurance as long as it meets medicare standards and is within the medicare system today about a third of medicare enrollees have private insurance known as medicare advantage her plan would also extend medicare services to include for instance mental health care and it would move quickly to universal coverage by immediately signing up newborns and the uninsured while sen bernie sanders would allow four years to transition to his medicare for all plan her plan would take 10 years and it would be paid for partly by taxing stock and bond trades rather than the middle class right now she s looking for the center of the democratic primary electorate and she hasn t quite figured out how that matches or doesn t match with the balance that she did in california where she was a bit center right when she ran for senate says marcia godwin of the university of la verne in la verne calif some wonder if it s already too late i don t think there s room to move back to the center given how far left many of the candidates are and the nature of the primary turnout says pollster g terry madonna of franklin marshall college in lancaster pennsylvania even mr biden is moving further to the left though he is in the best position to tack back to the center later on says mr madonna democrats retook the house last year by running more moderate candidates who could win in swing districts but mr madonna points out that democrats also won by driving up turnout among young voters as well as with college educated women those cohorts are culturally very liberal and not opposed to having the government play a major role in many areas of the economy he says add in hostility to president trump and it explains the progressive shift since senator harris was elected to the senate in 2016 she has built a strong progressive voting record if a short one progressive punch ranks her as the third most liberal member of the senate for her lifetime voting record just below elizabeth warren with many more years under his belt sen bernie sanders ranks seventh but some question how firm her beliefs are over the course of her prosecutorial career in california for instance she changed positions on the death penalty opposing it as the san francisco district attorney when a police officer was killed then defending it as state attorney general last week she lambasted the trump administration for resuming federal capital punishment as misguided and immoral and called for a national moratorium and she has stepped back from her controversial policy to punish parents for their children s truancy which resulted in a few parents going to jail her own record is ambiguous says mr trounstine she can make it sound left she can make it sound moderate depending on what she has to be emphasizing at any given moment get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox that ideological flexibility can be useful but it can also open her up to attacks from other candidates and it could prompt voters to question her authenticity in the end political observers still expect a desire to defeat the president will override all else for democrats and that may be the biggest risk for progressive candidates says mr madonna you can t rule out that president trump can t win the electoral college again so for the democrats they re in a sense trapped in their own agenda they don t want to hinder the enthusiasm of their base voters but that may not play well enough in the rust belt link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription
