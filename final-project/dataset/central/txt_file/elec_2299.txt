world the obama administration and the clintons tried to soften his criticism of president obama s signature legislative achievement josh earnest the white house press secretary defended the affordable care act in a news briefing tuesday mr clinton and hillary clinton s presidential campaign praised the affordable care actbut said more must be done to expand access to insurance while the comments showed mr clinton can be as much of a wild card on the campaign trail as an attraction the blowback afterward has given the obama administration and the clinton campaign an opportunity to talk about what works with obamacare and what doesn t president obama has of course acknowledged that with cooperation from democrats and republicans in congress there are some things that could be done to further strengthen the law said mr earnest in the news briefing that s something that secretary hillary clinton has vowed to pursue if she is elected president of the united states and president obama is certainly going to do everything he can to support that effort mr clinton started the media firestorm at a rally in flint mich on monday speaking about how insurance premiums have risen under the affordable care act you ve got this crazy system where all of a sudden 25 million more people have health care and then the people are out there busting it sometimes 60 hours a week wind up with their premiums doubled and their coverage cut in half he said figure out an affordable rate and let people use that something that won t undermine your quality of life won t interfere with your ability to make expenses won t interfere with your ability to save money for your kids college education and let people buy in to medicare he continued according to a transcript by reuters after the rally his aides and the clinton campaign walked back the former president s comments saying mr clinton is a supporter of obamacare but wants to address lingering gaps in the insurance markets but donald trump the republican presidential nominee seized on the opportunity at a rally in arizona president bill clinton came out and told the truth about obamacare said mr trump thanking the former president for being honest when asked about clinton s comments at the white house news briefing tuesday earnest said it s not exactly clear to me what argument he was making and so i ll let him and his team explain that but he added the obama remains proud of the affordable care act the american people benefit from the way the law has been implemented in terms of expanding coverage in terms of limiting the growth in health care costs but also in terms of the many consumer protections that people who already had health insurance in the past now benefit from said earnest according to abc news angel urena mr clinton s press secretary acknowledged the former president was slightly short handed but it s clear to everyone improvement is needed that s why secretary clinton has proposed measures including tax relief to cover excessive out of pocket costs a public option and medicare buy in for those over 55 she ll build on the progress we ve made by increasing competition choice affordability and the number of americans with insurance said mr urena mrs clinton who was stymied by congress trying create affordable healthcare in the 1990s said the republicans who control congress now want to repeal the affordable care act altogether which has made it impossible for obama to attempt changes in the law since any changes require willing partners on capitol hill get the
