split not only over their candidate preferences but also about the importance of key issues in the election foreign policy the budget deficit and immigration are among the most dominant issues for republican voters each is named by 70 or more as very important to their vote in the fall but only about half of democratic voters say each of these issues are very important to their vote decisions in contrast both the environment and economic inequality rate as very important to about seven in ten democratic voters but no more than about four in ten republicans the latest national survey by the pew research center conducted sept 2 9 among 2 002 adults including 1 552 registered voters finds that terrorism and the economy are top issues for both republican and democratic voters though in both cases they rate as more important for republicans than democrats health care also remains a key issue for voters in both parties this fall with 77 saying it is very important to their vote democratic voters are more likely than republican voters 80 vs 75 to say health care will be very important to their vote in november overall opinions of the affordable care act have changed little over the past year currently 44 approve of the law while 52 disapprove the survey also finds that gop voters continue to be more engaged with the midterm election than democrats republican voters are 15 points more likely than democrats to say they ve given a lot of thought to the election and 12 points more likely to say they definitely will vote gop voters also express more enthusiasm for voting in the upcoming midterm than their democratic counterparts as a result while the so called generic ballot slightly favors the democrats 47 of voters say they plan to vote for the democratic candidate or lean toward the democrat while 42 say they plan to vote for the republican or lean republican the likely electorate is more favorable to republican candidates than the overall electorate when the generic ballot is narrowed to a subset of voters most likely to cast votes in november 1 150 likely voters the result is more divided 44 support the democratic candidate 47 support the republican candidate at a comparable stage in 2010 republicans held a 50 43 lead among likely voters in the pew research center s final pre election survey in 2010 republicans held a 48 to 42 advantage the internal dynamics of the race are similar to the 2010 campaign the gop performs strongest among whites men older voters and evangelical protestants while democratic candidates garner more support from non whites women younger voters and the religiously unaffiliated there are also wide differences in vote preferences by education those with post graduate degrees are currently the only educational group to favor democratic candidates for congress and they do so by a 19 point margin 58 vs 39 and while democrats hold a 20 point advantage among low income voters 55 to 35 among voters with family incomes under 30 000 the republicans lead among middle income voters 30 000 75 000 by 10 points 51 to 41 the economy continues to be the top issue for voters as it has been over the last several election cycles today 83 say that the economy will be very important to their vote in 2010 fully 90 of voters said this health care also remains a priority 77 say it will be very important to their vote which is identical to the share saying this in august 2010 a few months after the passage of the affordable care act three quarters of voters 75 say the issue of terrorism will be very important to their vote little changed from about the same point in the 2010 campaign 71 in september 2012 shortly before the presidential election 60 of voters said terrorism would be very important the current survey finds that concerns over islamic extremism have risen sharply in recent years it was conducted before president obama s sept 10 address on expanding u s military action against the militant group known as isis majorities also view the budget deficit 65 foreign policy 64 immigration 62 and economic inequality 57 as very important to their vote two social issues gay marriage and birth control rank lower on the importance list only about a third of voters say each will be very important to their vote this fall 36 birth control 32 gay marriage foreign policy and immigration rate as much more important issues for older voters than younger voters about seven in ten voters 65 and older 71 view foreign policy as very important to their vote as do about as many of those 50 to 64 70 among voters younger than 30 only about half 51 say this similarly just 49 of voters under 30 rate immigration as a very important issue nearly seven in ten 69 of those 65 and older and 65 of voters 50 to 64 view immigration as very important there also are racial and ethnic differences in views of immigration as a voting issue 70 of hispanic voters say immigration is very important compared with 63 of whites and 46 of blacks young voters are much more likely than older voters to consider the environment when casting their ballots 64 of 18 29 year old voters say this will be very important to their vote compared with only about half 51 of voters 50 and older women are more likely than men to rate several issues as very important particularly issues of health care and reproduction for example while more than half of women voters 55 say abortion will be very important in their decision this fall just 37 of men voters say this and although birth control is not a dominant issue for either men or women women are much more likely to say it is very important 44 say this compared with 27 of men more generally health care is also more likely to be seen as important by women 84 of women voters say health care will be very important to their vote this fall 70 of men voters say the same women also are more likely to view economic inequality as an important contributor to their vote choice 64 say it is very important compared with 49 of men among the public overall opinions about the 2010 health care law have changed little over the past year currently 52 disapprove of the health care law while 44 approve of the measure more people say the law has had an impact on the country than did so a year ago on balance the law s effects continue to be seen as more negative than positive today 45 say the law has had a mostly negative effect on the country while 33 think its impact has been mostly positive 18 say it has not had much of an effect last september 38 said the law s impact on the country was mostly negative 24 said it was positive 31 said it had not much of an impact a majority 54 continues to say the health care law has not had much of an effect on themselves or their families though somewhat fewer say this than did so a year ago 63 currently about one in four 26 see the health care law s personal effect as mostly negative while 19 say it has been mostly positive the public also continues to express more negative than positive views about the law s future impact both personally and on the country currently 46 say that over the coming years the impact of the law on the country will be mostly negative 37 anticipate a mostly positive effect and 13 do not think that the law will have much impact going forward in terms of the law s future personal impact 38 expect it will be mostly negative 27 mostly positive while a third 33 say it will not have much of an effect more democrats have a positive view of the health care law s impact on the country than did so a year ago currently 56 say the law has had a positive effect up 15 points from last september the share saying the law has had a negative effect has held fairly steady at 22 while fewer democrats say it has not had much of an effect college graduates also view the law s impact more positively today about as many college graduates view the law s effect on the country as mostly positive 41 as mostly negative 42 a year ago the balance of opinion among college graduates was more negative than positive 38 mostly negative 23 mostly positive among many other groups however there has been no improvement in opinions about the law s impact on the country for instance those who have only some college experience still view its effects more negatively than positively 48 mostly negative vs 30 mostly positive as do those with no more than a high school education 30 vs 44 the health care law continues to draw more support from non whites than from whites and from more young adults than older people while 61 of non hispanic whites disapprove of the law majorities of non hispanic blacks 73 and hispanics 60 approve of it among people under 30 more approve 55 than disapprove 41 of the law among older age groups there is more opposition than support democrats continue to approve of the law by a wide margin 72 23 but republicans oppose it by an even larger margin 88 11 these partisan differences carry over into midterm vote preferences 90 of registered voters who support the republican in their district disapprove of the health care law while 73 of those who plan to vote
