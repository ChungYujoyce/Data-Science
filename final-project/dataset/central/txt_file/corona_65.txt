a fringe theory suggests that the new coronavirus leaked by accident from a lab in wuhan researchers at the wuhan institute of virology wiv study infectious diseases including coronaviruses and did before the pandemic started so as questions about how the pandemic started continue to go unanswered the lab has drawn scrutiny matthew pottinger trump apos s deputy national security adviser asked intelligence agencies in january to look into the idea of a wuhan lab leak the new york times reported but cia officers didn apos t find any evidence there apos s a reason for that according to jonna mazet an epidemiologist at the university of california davis who has worked with and trained wiv researchers in the past i know that we worked together to develop very stringent safety protocol and it apos s highly unlikely this was a lab accident she told business insider here are four reasons why the p4 laboratory at the wuhan institute of virology in china apos s hubei province april 17 2020 hector retamal afp via getty images the wiv houses china apos s only biosafety level 4 laboratory scientists study the most dangerous and infectious microbes known to humankind in these types of facilities some of the institute apos s researchers including virologist shi zhengli have collected sampled and studied coronaviruses that circulate chinese bats in 2013 shi and her collaborators pinpointed the bat population most likely responsible for spreading sars in the shitou cave near kunming after her team sequenced the covid 19 virus shi told scientific american that she quickly checked her laboratory apos s record from the past few years to check for accidents especially during disposal then she cross referenced the new coronavirus apos genome with the genetic information of other bat coronaviruses her team had collected they didn apos t match that really took a load off my mind shi said told scientific american adding i had not slept a wink for days mazet has met and worked with shi through predict a pandemic early warning program started by the us agency for international development the program has trained staff and funded labs in 30 countries including the wiv but president donald trump shut down predict last fall i apos ve spoken to her recently mazet said of shi she is absolutely positive that she had never identified this virus prior to the outbreak happening mazet added that shi set up a secure shared database into which predict members could upload their work for public release in 2018 us officials raised concerns about safety issues at wiv according to diplomatic cables obtained by the washington post but mazet said shi apos s work in the lab and in the field was above reproach in the field they wear extreme personal protective equipment including multiple layers of gloves eye protection full body suits and masks she said she noted however that she has not personally visited the wiv and couldn apos t speak to all the research done there samples collected from bats mazet added get immediately split between some vials that contain chemicals that deactivate the virus and other containers that leave the virus alive a laboratory technician working on samples from people to be tested for the new coronavirus at fire eye laboratory in wuhan in china apos s hubei province getty all samples are then dunked into liquid nitrogen on the spot which freezes them then the vials are disinfected and transported to the lab there scientists wearing personal protective equipment ppe unload them into a freezer set to minus 80 degrees celsius when the samples are studied later researchers only use the deactivated non infectious ones mazet said adding that the vials with viable virus are locked down in a special area rather than a leak the coronavirus is more likely the latest disease to have jumped from an animal host to humans experts say this type of cross species hop called a spillover event also led to outbreaks of ebola and sars both of those viruses originated in bats and genetic research has all but confirmed the same for the new coronavirus a studypublished in february found that it shares 96 of its genetic code with coronaviruses circulating in chinese bat populations three out of every fouremerging infectious diseases come to us from other species these pathogens are known as zoonotic diseases the coronavirus is the seventh zoonotic virus to have spilled over into people in the last century a greater horseshoe bat a relative of the rhinolophis sinicus bat species from china that was the original host of the sars virus de agostini getty the 2009 2010 h1n1 pandemic swine flu started in pigs then killed nearly 300 000 people people have caught bird flus via direct contact with infected poultry other pandemic influenza strains including the 1957 asian flu and the 1968hong kong pandemic likely started inbirds too and in the last 45 years at least four epidemics have been traced back to bats the caves and wild habitats in which samples get collected from bats are dangerous places for people since humans can be exposed to the live viruses circulating in the animals mazet said shi apos s researchers navigate those caves in full ppe but tourists hunters poachers and other people who rely on animals in some capacity for food or trade wander into such places less protected the mouth of a cave off of the li river in guilin yangshuo china may 2017 shankar s flickr peter daszak president of ecohealth alliance which managed predict apos s relationship with the wiv told npr last week that his colleagues are finding 1 to 7 million people exposed to zoonotic viruses in southeast asia each year that apos s the pathway it apos s just so obvious to all of us working in the field he said a study published inmarch 2019 even predicted that bats would be the source of a new coronavirus outbreak in china that apos s because the majority of coronaviruses those that affect humans and animals can be found in china and many bats live near humans in china potentially transmitting viruses to humans and livestock the authors said the frequency of spillover events will increase as humans encroach further into wild habitats that house disease carrying species we haven apos t interacted with before mazet said researching how past spillovers happened and which habitats present the greatest risk for such events helps scientists make predictions about the next pandemic a researcher with a protective face mask holds a bat benjamin p y h lee bmc ecology image competition since 2014 shi apos s group at the wiv has received nearly 600 000 from a multi million dollar five year grant funded by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases to research the spillover of bat coronaviruses the grant which is managed by ecohealth alliance was renewed for another five years in 2019 however after being questioned about that funding at a white house briefing on april 17 president trump said his administration would end that grant very quickly a week later the national institutes of health canceled it yuan zhiming director of the wiv apos s biosafety laboratory told reuters that malicious claims about the lab had been pulled out of thin air and contradicted all available evidence the persistent circulation of the lab leak theory could impact future scientific cooperation and information sharing between the us and china according to mazet what apos s happening sociologically right now is our biggest risk who apos s going to want to work on this if they apos re the ones put under a microscope mazet said i think the real danger of what apos s going on now is that experts like shi and myself may not be able to keep collaborating to identify these viruses because of government pressures mazet said that would make it harder to discover where the covid 19 virus came from as well as to forecast and prepare for the next spillover a german scientist works on research related to a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus reuters mazet added that she worries a blame game could even put lives at risk in the short term if we point fingers at other nations that have best opportunity to develop a vaccine why would we expect them to freely share that with us mazet said collaboration is key right now otherwise you have countries developing things in parallel and you can apos t assume the us is the best at everything do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you d like to share or a tip on how your town or community is handling the
