 by robert farley posted on september 25 2015 a lawyer for donald trump fired off a letter to the conservative club for growth threatening a multi million dollar lawsuit if the group does not pull its tv ad claiming trump supports higher taxes trump s lawyer says the claim is false and libelous club for growth action the super pac of the anti tax group says it is merely exposing trump s very liberal record so who is right it s not easy to pin down trump s precise position on taxes though trump says he plans to release a very specific tax plan next week we can say this however club for growth action s ad relies on statements made by trump 15 years ago and those statements are not consistent with the proposals albeit sketchy so far that trump has provided as a candidate this year trump told time on aug 18 that his tax changes would not increase the net amount of taxes but that does not mean it will not raise taxes on some taxpayers as trump himself has said trump has said his plan will make people happy other than maybe the hedge fund guys who make hundreds of millions of dollars and pay very little tax his attorney said trump s overall plan would lower taxes the ad from club for growth action which began airing on sept 17 is part of a 1 million campaign in iowa aimed at weakening the republican front runner s campaign the ad called politician begins by showing images of democratic presidential candidates bernie sanders and hillary clinton and asks which presidential candidate supports higher taxes it s donald trump the narrator says asked for backup the club for growth referred us to a feb 15 2000 article in the advocate in which trump states my plan to impose a onetime net worth tax of 14 25 percent on the super wealthy when combined with our current projected surpluses will raise enough to pay off the national debt at that time trump was mulling a presidential bid and in a formal statement in november 1999 that laid out his plan trump did in fact propose a one time 14 25 tax on people and trusts with a net worth of over 10 million minus the value of their principal residence the revenue it generated he said would be used to pay off the debt then 5 7 trillion to give a middle class tax cut and to shore up the social security trust fund but trump isn t advocating anything like that in 2015 in his aug 18 interview with time trump said he would not propose changes that increase the net amount of taxes but he also stopped short of agreeing to sign the americans for tax reform pledge against raising taxes because i may want to switch taxes around specifically trump has repeatedly said that he would lower taxes for the middle class and would raise taxes on carried interest earned by hedge fund managers in an aug 26 interview with bloomberg s with all due respect one of the hosts john heilemann noted that that would affect not only hedge fund managers but also people in limited real estate partnerships of which you are in a fair number so you are proposing you d like to raise taxes on yourself heilemann asked that s right that s right i m ok with it trump said you ve seen my statements i do very well i don t mind paying some taxes the middle class is getting clobbered in this country you know the middle class built this country not the hedge fund guys but i know people in hedge funds they pay almost nothing and it s ridiculous ok some interpreted those remarks as trump agreeing to raise taxes on the wealthy but that may not be the case again his comments have been limited to raising taxes on carried interest earned by hedge fund managers hedge fund managers are paid in part based on the performance of their funds for investments held for more than a year those profits are called carried interest and are taxed as capital gains capital gains are taxed at a lower maximum rate 23 8 percent including a 3 8 percent tax in the affordable care act than most ordinary income which carries a top tax rate of 39 6 percent as is the case with bush s tax plan trump could unveil a plan that lowers the highest tax rate and thereby provides tax relief to the majority of wealthy taxpayers in his letter to club for growth trump attorney alan garten stated to be clear mr trump s tax plan which is scheduled to be released later this week supports a lowering of taxes on sept 23 trump said the plan will be unveiled next week it will be very long on policy and will be a great plan with a major reduction in taxes for the middle class trump said at a town hall meeting in south carolina it s going to be very specific and i think it s going to be a plan that creates incentives and i think it s going to be a plan that makes people happy other than maybe the hedge fund guys who make hundreds of millions of dollars and pay very little tax i mean those guys will not exactly love me in response to the letter from trump s attorney club for growth action released this statement from club for growth president david mcintosh tough guy donald trump starts whining when his liberal record is revealed trump has advocated higher taxes numerous times over many years trump s own statements prove that our ads are accurate they will continue to run the group also passed along a video urging viewers to listen to trump s own words the video begins with cnn s jake tapper asking trump on june 28 about his proposal in 2000 for a 14 25 percent tax on the wealthy in part to pay off the debt the video cuts to trump saying that if a 14 percent tax on the wealthy today would knock out the debt i d do that all day long but in that same interview trump went on to say well now we can t do that because the debt is so big asked why trump responded because it wouldn t work because it s too much you have to bring in jobs you have to take the jobs back from china you have to take the jobs back from mexico the club for growth video then cuts to a trump interview on fox and friends on aug 24 in which trump says rich people are paying the same as people who make very little money and i think there should be a graduation of some kind because as you make a certain amount of money i think you should have to graduate upward but that was a response to a question about a flat tax in which everyone pays the same rate regardless of income as trump noted at about the 3 25 mark in the same interview support for a graduated income tax as we currently have doesn t mean a raise in taxes that means rich people might be paying less than they are paying right now on the corporate side the new york times notes that trump has threatened to impose tariffs on american companies that put their factories in other countries and he has vowed to change laws that allow american companies to benefit from cheaper tax rates by using mergers to base their operations outside the united states in other words it is possible there would be some who pay higher taxes under trump s plan but without a detailed plan it s simply impossible to know who those people might be how many it might be or how much they might pay as vox noted it is possible perhaps even probable under jeb bush s tax plan which also would tax carried interest as ordinary income for those very hedge fund managers to see an overall tax decrease due to the lowering of the top rate it may be tempting to attack trump s tax plan in part because he has been vague about details but contrary to the club for growth action s blanket claim that trump supports higher taxes present tense trump has said that he would not raise taxes on net robert farley q
