while debating 6 feet apart due to the coronavirus outbreak the two leading contenders offered competing versions of the facts on several key issues by factcheck org posted on march 16 2020 corrected on march 16 2020 the first head to head debate of the democratic presidential primary between former vice president joe biden and sen bernie sanders focused on the government s response to the novel coronavirus outbreak we sorted through competing claims the two front runners made about the pandemic as well as other topics including social security super pacs and bailouts the two candidates also repeated claims we have checked before on health care climate change defense spending and gun control the march 15 debate was hosted by cnn and univision in a fiery back and forth over sanders claim that biden has a long history of support for cuts to social security both candidates massaged the facts biden denied sanders claim that he ever talked on the senate floor about the necessity of cutting social security in 1984 biden called for a one year spending freeze that would have included social security and he boasted about that position in 1995 during debate about a balanced budget amendment but sanders also went too far with his claim that biden has advocated such cuts sanders have you been on the floor of the senate time and time again talking about the necessity with pride about cutting social security cutting medicare cutting veterans programs biden no sanders you never said that biden no sanders implored viewers to go to youtube to check he s reaching deep into biden s legislative past to make his point as we wrote in our jan 24 story biden vs sanders on social security and medicare back in 1984 when ronald reagan was president then sen biden co sponsored a measure along with republican sen chuck grassley and others seeking a one year across the board freeze on defense and domestic spending as a way to reduce budget deficits the proposal which failed would have eliminated cost of living increases for one year for social security and medicare fast forward a decade to 1995 and biden twicecitedthat proposal to explain his support for a balanced budget amendment and to prove his bona fides as someone serious about reducing deficits for example on jan 31 1995 biden saidfrom the floor of the senate when i argued that we should freeze federal spending i meant social security as well i meant medicare and medicaid i meant veterans benefits i meant every single solitary thing in the government and i not only tried it once i tried it twice i tried it a third time and i tried it a fourth time somebody has to tell me in here how we are going to do this hard work without dealing with any of those sacred cows some deserving more protection than others i am not quite sure how you get from here to there i am sure that we should tell the american people straight up that such an amendment is going to require some big changes so bidenhasspoken on the senate floor about his one time support for a one year freeze to social security but there s more to biden s record and both sanders and biden picked from it selectively sanders noted that biden was a fan of the balanced budget amendment which sanders said called for cuts in social security but the issue is more nuanced than sanders suggests back in 1996 biden was among the democrats whovoted fora balanced budget amendment to the constitution the resolution fell just short of the two thirds majority needed to pass 64 35 biden supported anamendmentthat sought to protect the social security system from any cuts enacted as part of the balanced budget plan even though that amendment failed and biden voted for the balanced budget resolution anyway it s not accurate for sanders to say the balanced budget proposal called for cuts in social security thebalanced budget amendmentresolution did not mention social security only that t otal outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year unless three fifths of both the house and senate agreed to exceptions sanders also accused biden of taking the position that everything was on the table in budget negotiations with republicans including in your judgment cuts to social security this likely refers to biden s comments on nbc s meet the press on april 29 2007 when then presidential candidate biden told host tim russert that he would absolutely put age of eligibility and cost of living for social security and medicare on the table during discussions on reducing the deficit and biden was also involved in so called grand bargain negotiations between then president barack obama and house speaker john boehner that would have reduced the deficit through a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts and even changes to social security thenew york timesreportedthat the grand bargain would have raised the retirement age and changed the formula for calculating benefits but as thetimesreported the deal fell through as members of boehner s caucus objected to raising taxes during the debate biden said that none of those instances resulted in cuts to social security and that he nevervotedto cut social security i know because people like me helped me stop that sanders said all that i m saying is you were prepared to cut and advocate for the cuts saying that biden was prepared to advocate cuts to social security is misleading as we wrote in our story about biden s history on social security we don t know what biden might have been willing to compromise on since those deals never happened agreeing to leave an issue on the table prior to a negotiation isn t the same thing as agreeing to do it we should note that in his 2020 bid biden has proposeda planthat would increase revenue for social security byeliminatingthe payroll tax cap andexpandbenefits for some of the oldest seniors during the debate biden asked sanders to acknowledge that his campaign had taken out of context biden s comments about a tax plan championed by former house speaker paul ryan we agreed those comments were used misleadingly in a sanders campaignnewsletterto suggest biden supported the ryan plan but aswe wroteat the time biden s comments over time make clear that he has at least been willing to keep cuts to social security and medicare as negotiating chips while other democrats have taken a harder line that any cuts cannot be part of budget negotiations two days before the debate biden said he would support sen elizabeth warren s plan to change a bankruptcy law that he had backed as a senator in 2005 warren s plan would make it easier for people to obtain debt relief allowing student loan debt for example to be discharged in bankruptcy univision s ilia calder n one of the debate moderators asked biden why he had changed his position and now supported warren s plan as biden told it he made the decision to improve a bill that he knew a republican controlled congress would pass and republican president george w bush would sign into law biden i had a choice it was going to pass republican president republican congress and i offered two amendments to make sure that people under 50 000 would not be affected and women and children would go to the front of the line on alimony and support payments that s what i did it passed overwhelmingly i did not like the rest of the bill but i improved it number one later sanders noted that biden had helped write the 2005 bankruptcy bill which warren called terrible for families in need when she announced her plan to undo parts of the law sanders joe if my memory is correct you helped write that bankruptcy bill biden i did not the fact is biden had a long history with the legislation and his support for it predated bush in fact biden helped draft a version of the bankruptcy bill that congress sent to president bill clinton in 2000 only to have the democrat president pocket veto the bill before leaving office let s take a look at biden s involvement in the bankruptcy bill on march 15 1999 republican sen chuck grassley announced that he had introduced the bankruptcy reform act of 1999 with the support of democratic sens robert torricelli and biden sen chuck grassley today introduced a bipartisan plan to improve the nation s bankruptcy system the republican senator announced in a press release sens robert torricelli of new jersey and joe biden of delaware joined grassley as co sponsors of the bankruptcy reform act of 1999 in 2000 biden was a member of the house senate conference committee that resolved the differences between the chambers bankruptcy bills before sending a final version to clinton on the senate floor the day the bill passed on dec 7 2000 sen orrin hatch singled out biden among others for his work on the bill crediting its passage to biden s unwavering dedication to accomplishing the important reforms in this bill for his part biden urged clinton to reconsider his veto threat and touted provisions of the bill to protect families below the median income and make it easier for women and children to receive alimony and child support from husbands and fathers who file for bankruptcy these were the very things that biden claimed during the debate that he pushed for in 2005 in order to win his support a feature of this legislation that i think deserves much more emphasis is its historic improvement in the treatment of family support payments child support and alimony biden said on dec 7 2000 after clinton vetoed the bill grassley reintroduced the bankruptcy reform act in july 2001 and biden co sponsored it biden was a member of an informal conference committee to work on the bankruptcy bill and the committee was scheduled to have its first meeting on sept 12 2001 which as it turned out was the day after the 9 11 terrorist attack at the time congressional quarterly described biden as one of the measure s most vocal supporters it wasn t until 2005 that the bankruptcy bill became law as he did in 2000 hatch praised biden for his help on the bill on the day that the senate passed the legislation hatch said biden had worked tirelessly for years on this legislation and they have taken some tough votes to get it done and as he did in 2000 biden spoke in support of the bill s provisions that made it easier for women and children to collect alimony and child support i am here again today to show that contrary to a lot of the rhetoric that has been tossed around this bill actually improves the situation of women and children who depend on child support biden said contrary to his claims during the debate biden helped write the bankruptcy law and it wasn t just because he knew the bill was going to become law under a republican president and republican congress he was involved over the years in many attempts to enact the legislation duringan exchangeabout campaign contributions and potential federal funding of elections biden and sanders disagreed over the number of super pacs supporting sanders for president why don t you get rid of the super pac that you have right now sanders said to biden you ll get rid of the nine super pacs you have biden then said to sanders who responded i don t have nine super pacs i don t have any super pacs biden does have at least one super pac supporting his campaign unite the countrywas started by former biden aides in 2019 and it has so farspentmore than 10 million promoting biden s candidacy but sanders also has super pacs supporting his campaign although not nine of them at least not according to the documentation provided by biden s campaign the campaign emailed us a list of eight progressive organizations and several of their affiliates that are backing sanders for president the eight main groups are center for popular democracy action democratic socialists of america dream defenders make the road our revolution people s action progressive democrats of america and sunrise movement those groups and another student action are all part of a coalition called people power for bernie whichlaunchedat the end of january but according to the biden campaign s own documentation only four of their affiliates are technicallysuper pacs which can raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations unions associations and individuals and can spend that money on ads that advocate for or against the election of political candidates andhalfof themhave not been active during the 2020 cycle the rest of the groups on the list are mostly501 c 4social welfare organizations as501 c nonprofits the groups also may raise unlimited amounts of money from corporations unions and individuals but their political activity is supposed to be more limited on twitter sunrise movement one of the groups in the pro sanders coalition calledbiden s claim a smear against grassroots organizations like us unlike super pacs 501 c 4 groups sometimes called dark money groups are not required to disclose the names of their donors although some of them do also super pacs report to the federal election commission while 501 c groups report to the internal revenue service it s unclear how much money all of the groups cited by the biden campaign have spent supporting sanders during the 2020 cycle in addition to the groups cited by biden s campaign sanders also has the support ofvote nurses value pac a super pac affiliated with the largest union of registered nurses national nurses united that super pac hasspentmore than 733 000 in support of sanders according to the center for responsive politics the center alsoliststhree other super pacs backing sanders in 2020 but none of them have spent any money biden stretched the facts when he said bernie voted against the bailout to the automobile industry in addition to opposing the 2008 economic stabilization act in fact sanders supported a 15 billion measure specifically aimed at aiding the troubled auto industry in december 2008 in the midst of the worst economic slump since the 1930s that bill failed to pass the senate it s true that earlier sanders opposed a wall street bailout bill providing 350 billion for the troubled asset relief program president george w bushannounced later that he would use tarp funds to aid the auto industry too sanders could not have known that when he voted against the funds biden is referring to sanders vote in january 2009 to block release of a second 350 billion in tarp funds again mainly to aid financial institutions this time it was clear that some of that would aid automakers but it amounted to only 4 billion of the total this isn t the first time sanders has been unfairly accused of opposing the auto bailout hillary clinton made the same charge in her 2016 campaign and we wrote about it in greater detail then while talking about health care in the context of the novel coronavirus pandemic sanders pushed for his medicare for all proposal by citing two specific and different figures for the number of annual deaths linked to lacking insurance coverage and bottom line here is in terms of medicare for all despite what the vice president is saying what the experts tell us is that one of the reasons that we are unprepared and have been unprepared is we don t have a system we ve got thousands of private insurance plans sanders said that is not a system that is prepared to provide health care to all people in a good year without the epidemic we re losing up to 60 000 people who die every year because they don t get to a doctor on time it s clearly this crisis is only making a bad situation worse later the vermont senator offered a different figure you know what last year at least 30 000 people died in america because they didn t get health care when they should because we don t have universal coverage i think that s a crisis but as we ve written several times it s hard to pin down the precise number of deaths in the u s attributable to lacking insurance although multiple studies have estimated thousands of excess deaths from absent insurance coverage politifact looked last year specifically at sanders claim that 30 000 americans a year die waiting for health care because of the cost and found it lacks meaningful support either way it could be true but it also could easily not be our fact checking colleagues traced the figure to physicians for a national health program which advocates for a single payer health care system pnhp cited the findings of the oregon health insurance experiment a study in which some people in the state were given medicaid by lottery and others remained uninsured but while that study yielded important findings the death rate differential was not statistically significant politifact noted citing benjamin sommers an associate professor of health policy and economics at harvard therefore it didn t generate sufficient evidence spelling out the link between insurance coverage and mortality so it couldn t be confidently applied to the country we wrote in 2009 about another study by researchers with the harvard medical school two of whom had strong connections to pnhp that claimed 45 000 deaths a year could be attributed to the lack of health insurance we found that was at the high end of estimates but earlier studies also put the figure in the thousands the higher figure cited by sanders 60 000 may refer to a recent study from yale researchers that examined sanders medicare for all proposal that study looked at uninsured populations and the notion that uninsured people experience a 40 elevation in age specific mortality risk and concluded that universal coverage would save 68 531 lives annually discussing women s reproductive rights biden touted a 100 rating from the group naral pro choice america while it s true that the former vice president received that voting record rating from the advocacy group during some of his years in the senate that was not always the case a point made by sanders biden i think it is a woman s right to choose i think it s a woman s opportunity to be able to make that decision and in fact i ve gotten a 100 rating from naral as well sanders excuse me you have a lifetime 100 voting record from naral biden i know my record of late from naral has been 100 i don t know whether it was 25 years ago the rating highlighted by biden was selective though he didn t technically claim to have a lifelong 100 voting record rating with the group it was sanders who added the lifetime qualifier still the exchange called for further context and naral s president chimed in on twitter to provide it ilyse hogue said that while biden has been evolving over time his record was not always perfect in the group s eyes joebiden has been evolving over time but his lifetime rating from naral is not 100 his last year in congress he had a 100 annual ratings are entirely dependent on what votes come up in any given session not what a candidate feels about any given issue demdebate2020 2 ilyse hogue ilyseh march 16 2020 as hogue points out the group gives ratings to members of congress based on their legislative activity in a given year and biden s ratings reflected a mixed record in the years 1996 and 1997 for example biden s voting record score from the group was 43 and 34 respectively according tovotesmart org he got a 90 rating in 2000 and had mostly high marks in the years to follow save for a 36 rating in 2003 after three straight years of 100 ratings he was given a 75 rating in 2007 in his last year as a senator based on three key votes in the senate biden again received a 100 voting record rating according to an archived version of the group s 2008 congressional record on choice report sanders meanwhile has maintained a 100 rating since 1996 sanders was correct in saying that average inflation adjusted wages are nearly the same today as they were 45 years ago but that leaves the misleading impression that wages haven t budged over those decades real wages dropped from their peak in the early 1970s but began to rise back up again beginning in the mid 1990s sanders why is it that over the last 45 years despite the huge increase in productivity and technology the average worker today is not making a nickel more in real dollars average weekly earnings of production and nonsupervisory employees in inflation adjusted 1982 84 dollars were 319 90 for february the most recent bureau of labor statistics figures available in february 1975 45 years ago the average weekly earnings were 314 90 the peak was actually a few years earlier in 1973 at 345 95 average weekly wages hit the low point 24 years ago at 263 73 in january 1996 they have fluctuated but generally have been on an upward trend since despite sanders claim real average wages are up 21 3 since hitting that bottom of the curve for more on how there are different ways to look at wage data see our june 2019 story are wages rising or flat when the two candidates tussled over their plans to tackle climate change biden went too far in describing the low elevation of his home state of delaware biden my my state is 3 feet above sea level i don t need a lecture on what s going to happen about rising seas i know what happens i watched the whole delmarva peninsula just like it is in south carolina and the rest delaware is the lowest lying state in the u s and is highly susceptible to sea level rise from climate change but as weexplained back in november when biden made a similar claim while there are some areas that dip as low as 3 feet above sea level for the most part the state sits higher the average elevation across the state is 60 feetabove sea level a delaware geological survey map shows that a relativelysmall portionof the state mostly along the coast is 5 feet or less above sea level this time biden also referenced the delmarva peninsula which is the piece of land that juts out into the atlantic ocean south of new jersey the name comes from the three states that make up the peninsula delaware maryland and virginia as the u s geological surveynotes the peninsula was significantly affected by hurricane sandy in 2012 whichresearchsuggestswas made more intense by climate change health care spending sanders repeated his well worn and exaggerated talking point that the u s spends twice as much as any other country on health care normally he adds per capita the u s spends twice as much asmostcountries but not all as we ve said before u s per capita spending on health care totaled 10 586 in 2018 according to the most recent organization for economic cooperation and developmentdata that s twice as much as the oecd average and every country except for six switzerland norway germany sweden austria and denmark not a game changer biden repeated one of his go to lines for touting his record on climate change i wrote the first climate change bill that was in the congress he said adding that politifact said it was a game changer as we ve written onmultipleoccasions the fact checking site called biden a climate change pioneer in response to his more modest claim of being one of the first guys to introduce a climate change bill but did not use the word game changer in fact thearticleexplains that the bill which set up a presidential task force was a plan to make a plan not a piece of comprehensive legislation that addressed lowering carbon emissions or climate change adaptation trade agreements and jobs sanders again blamed two trade agreements the north american free trade agreement and the permanent normal trade relations with china for the loss of over 4 million good paying jobs but as we wrote after he made the same claim during thejanuary democratic debateandduring the 2016 primary it s unclear how many jobs have been affected by those deals sanders claim is supported by thelabor backedeconomic policy institute the epiestimatedthat by 2017 the u s has lost 3 4 million jobs since the u s grantedpermanent normal trade relationswith china in 2001 the institute alsoestimatedthat nafta cost the u s 682 900 jobs as of 2013 but other researchers disagree the congressional research service determined that nafta did not have a significant impact on jobs saying in a 2017report that the net overall effect of nafta on the u s economy appears to have been relatively modest primarily because trade with canada and mexico accounts for a small percentage of u s gdp a 2017 workingpaperpublished by the national bureau of economic research found that the job losses in manufacturing since chinajoined the word trade organization in 2001 have been partly offset by job gains in other parts of the economy underinsured sanders repeated his claim that there are 87 million uninsured or underinsured americans as we vewrittenin our coverage ofpastdebates this figure comes from astudybythe commonwealth fund the studyfoundthat o f the 194 million u s adults ages 19 to 64 in 2018 an estimated 87 million or 45 percent were inadequately insured the 87 million is composed of three categories 24 million people uninsured 43 8 million underinsured and 19 3 million people who had insurance but had been uninsured at some point in the past year defense spending sanders misleadingly used a military spending figure when discussing the issue of climate change instead of spending 1 8 trillion on weapons of destruction designed to kill each other maybe we should pool our resources and fight our common enemy which is climate change he said as we have explained before that figure is not solely for weapons it s the 2018 total world military expenditure as calculated by the stockholm international peace research institute a think tank that researches conflict armaments and more the group says it discourages the use of terms such as arms spending when referring to military expenditure as spending on armaments is usually only a minority of the total gun manufacturer lawsuits biden again accused sanders of voting to allow gun manufacturers to be exempt from lawsuits this man is the only one of the few democrats i know who voted to exempt the gun industry from being able to be sued biden said we cannot sue the gun manufacturers because he voted for that years ago it is true that sanders as a member of the house then voted in favor of the protection of lawful commerce in arms act which protects licensed manufacturers dealers sellers of ammunition and firearms as well as trade associations from civil lawsuits over the misuse of guns or ammunition in 2003 and 2005 however as we have explained the bill includes six exceptions where civil suits may be granted such as cases in which a firearm seller acted with negligence biden did acknowledge that sanders has since expressed regret over his vote on the bill and sanders has indeed called his vote a bad vote as for biden s claim that sanders is one of the few democrats i know who voted to enact the bill the majority of house democrats voted against it but in 2003 63 democrats voted yea and 59 did so in 2005 sanders is not included in those counts because he was and still is an independent correction march 16 in the original version of this story we incorrectly quoted biden when the former vice president was discussing how he would respond to the novel coronavirus as president biden said we just pass a law saying that you do not have to pay for any of this period sanders replied as a matter of fact that s not true that law has enormous loopholes i understand that nancy pelosi did her best republicans prevented it we misheard it and apparently so did sanders biden said pass not passed and
