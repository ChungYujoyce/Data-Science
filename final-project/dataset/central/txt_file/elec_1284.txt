large amount of members to have to vote for an anti immigrant amendment so that puts me in a tough spot too you know it s not just about you know do 20 people have to take a tough vote it s that 200 people had to take a tough vote so now i have to go back to my district and explain to my community why i voted why i was forced to vote for an anti immigrant amendment after the mueller report drops

caucus said that democrats won back the majority through the middle through districts like mine and so we need to make sure that you know we recognize that all districts are different what we can t do is say who belongs in the party and who doesn t even house progressives who agree with ocasio cortez s policies and like having someone to gin up energy on the issues aren t sure what to make of her approach in my experience it has never really been productive in the past rep ra l grijalva d ariz said about ocasio cortez s public shaming of members of the same party grijalva is the former chair of the progressive caucus and supports much of the agenda ocasio cortez is pushing but that s her political call the consequences are hers he said related gun control gabby giffords activism is

withocasio cortez s views every candidate is going to be associated with alexandria ocasio cortez michael mcadams a spokesman for the house republicans campaign arm said recognizing the strategy one aide to a new member who flipped a republican seat said if the aide s boss was placed next to ocasio cortez at a newsconference the aide would try to move the lawmaker to avoid photographs of the two together the aide was concerned a photo could be used by a republican opponent during a re election campaign the green new deal the sweeping environmental resolution introduced by ocasio cortez and sen ed markey d mass has become catnip for republicans supporters of the nonbinding resolution say it illustrates a vision for a cleaner environment and promotes jobs and social justice but

has since been taken down but republicans have not forgotten former rep carlos curbelo a moderate republican wholost his florida seat in november said all democrats should be worried my sympathies to them curbelo said curbelo blames the far right of his party forshifting legislation so far from the mainstream that it no longer appealed to voters in his district you cannot work hard enough to distinguish yourself because these membersat the extremes of the political spectrumwill always be at an advantage in terms of generating attention getting on national television getting retweeted curbelo said some veteran democratic strategistssay endangered lawmakers shouldn t be so worried ocasio cortez is getting people excited about democratic ideas even thoughproposals will ultimately vary on details plus they say all of the democrats who represent red and purple districts did a good job of sidestepping another bogeywoman during their last election republicans pounded democrats with ads about ties to pelosi whom they accused of being a san francisco liberal yet democrats were still able to flip the house the gop strategy is not a strategy that worked in 2018 i don t believe it is a strategy that will work going forward said brad woodhouse a democratic strategist and former spokesman for the democratic national committee and really to take republican criticism and let it live by lending it credence doesn t do anybody in the party any good woodhouse said related green new deal too ambitious for some democrats even those who say congress must do something green new deal
