after seven years of living in bologna first as a student and now as a business consultant zhang yimeng has come to consider northern italy as his second home and so when covid 19 began rampaging through europe the 27 year old from china s henan province threw himself behind relief efforts value china the firm zhang works for has helped to distribute 40 000 medical masks to two special covid 19 hospitals in milan more vital deliveries are in the works logistics is one of the most difficult things in italy at the moment so we are trying to make sure these masks get to the frontline as quickly as possible zhang tells time it s just one of many examples of how the chinese communities in virus stricken areas some 310 000 chinese live in italy alone have tried to stem the spread of the deadly pandemic which has so far sickened one million and killed 50 000 people across the globe italy has more than 13 000 covid 19 related deaths four times china s official death toll three teams of chinese doctors have been dispatched to italy so far with many other countries receiving similar help beijing has sent medics to iraq and iran ventilators to france and personal protection equipment to cambodia and the philippines sunshine comes after the storm chinese president xi jinping consoled spanish prime minister pedro s nchez but it s not all good news too often the relief efforts have been undermined by opportunism and bungling by mercenary vendors and a chinese communist party ccp desperate to spin the pandemic which began within its borders for its own propaganda purposes moreover the covid 19 pandemic has proved far from a unifying force with politicians of all stripes seizing on it not least the governments in washington and beijing to deflect blame about their own handling of the crisis and push partisan agendas keep up to date on the growing threat to global health by signing up for our daily coronavirus newsletter on wednesday vice president mike pence echoed other senior administration figures when he told cnn the reality is that we could ve been better off if china had been more forthcoming about the virus in response china s foreign ministry spokeswomen hua chunying told a regular press conference tuesday that the world should ignore the endless immoral slanders of several politicians who are habitual liars she highlighted that washington shut its wuhan consulate on jan 25 and banned recent visitors to china from the u s a week later what has the u s done in the two months since then in the spiraling relations between china and the west even the covid 19 crisis is an opportunity to score points and no opportunity can be wasted the trump administration has obfuscated its torpid response to the crisis by repeating concerns over china s official figures in turn beijing has sought to boost its soft power by recasting itself from source of the deadly pandemic to the provider of much needed aid and expertise on tuesday as rows of field hospitals were being built to treat covid 19 patients in new york city s central park a plane load of medical supplies arrived in the city from china the first of 22 scheduled flights to help slow the spread of covid 19 in the us said the state run china daily in a tweet but it is europe that has become the key propaganda battleground in a recent blog post e u chief diplomat josep borrell warned that the politics of generosity concealed a geo political component including a struggle for influence china he added is aggressively pushing the message that unlike the u s it is a responsible and reliable partner armed with facts we need to defend europe against its detractors in chinese state media reports purchases of supplies by foreign countries are conflated with aid which gloss over glaring problems with the quality of goods dispatched while the masks that value china procured for the milan hospitals were the n95 variety made by u s multinational 3m others dispatched from china have failed to meet international standards the netherlands was forced to recall 600 000 face masks bought from china some 50 000 testing kits china sent to spain were jettisoned after it was revealed they only had a 30 accuracy rate the 1 2 million chinese antibody tests that the slovak government bought for 16 million weren t up to grade prime minister igor matovic has complained czech healthcare authorities said the 300 000 quick tests purchased from china only worked on patients infected for five or more days and one third were defective turkey has also had problems with the quality of chinese medical supplies in an attempt to mitigate the fallout china s ministry of commerce said in the future exporters of medical masks thermometers protective clothing testing kits and ventilators must be both certified in china and comply with the standards of the importing nation already china was on the backfoot after reports of hoarding medical supplies early on in the crisis in february china s state controlled oil explorer petrochina co ordered employees in 20 countries to bulk buy face masks to send home reports bloomberg with scant regard for local needs many other chinese companies with overseas operations reportedly received similar directives more often however china has been on the offensive in line with an aggressive new foreign policy stance president xi promoted in a memo last year which urged diplomats to display more fighting spirit sources told reuters china s hawkish ministry of foreign affairs spokesman zhao lijian even promoted the conspiracy theory that it might be u s army who brought the epidemic to wuhan it s not the only aspect of china s tone deaf mask diplomacy as it has been dubbed to make an unforced error when xi spoke by phone to italian prime minister giuseppe conte he proposed a health silk road which critics took as a shameless attempt promote his faltering belt and road initiative global infrastructure project italy was controversially the first european nation to sign up to it but more damaging have been chinese state media s attempts to twist comments by italian scientist giuseppe remuzzi about strange pneumonias in italy in november and december as evidence covid 19 may not have originated in china at all remuzzi was actually just saying it may have spread from china earlier than documented italians are really angry about these attempts to deflect blame says theresa fallon director of the centre for russia europe asia studies creas in brussels and it seems china was even willing to sacrifice relations with italy to do so some propaganda campaigns are more brazen still according to recent analysis 46 of tweets using the hashtag forzacinaeitalia which translates as come on china and italy were generated by automated bots for graziecina meaning thanks china it was 37 china s foreign ministry spokeswoman hua even posted a video on twitter of italians in rome applauding health workers at noon from their balconies but dubbed with the chinese national anthem and claiming spuriously they were chanting grazie cina of course domestic agendas shape how china s outreach is perceived across europe the issue of chinese aid has been exploited by pro and anti e u factions in nations like italy serbia hungary very often the narrative of china coming to the rescue goes hand in hand with the narrative of the e u not offering support says lucrezia poggetti an analyst for the mercator institute for china studies in berlin some european politicians are proving stunningly opportunist serbian president aleksandar vucic said china is the only country that can help us fight covid 19 adding european solidarity does not exist despite the fact that serbia is currently applying to become an e u member meanwhile popular italian far right politician matteo salvini no friend of the e u described china s covid 19 response as a crime against humanity still china s public relations floundering doesn t mean washington is doing any better reports that donald trump was trying to poach german scientists to make a covid 19 vaccine for exclusive use in the u s caused outrage across europe says mario esteban a senior analyst specializing in e u east asia relations at the elcano royal institute in madrid for esteban washington has compounded a lack of material aid with a more general dearth of sympathy for its suffering allies in europe it s a pretty clear that the current american administration is isolationist and unilateralist which is providing room for china to improve its image beijing s failure to exploit this opportunity is proving a source of conflict with the ccp speaking to axios on hbo cui tiankai china s ambassador to the u s rubbished zhao s conspiracy theory regarding the u s military origins of covid 19 on thursday former vice foreign minister fu ying wrote an article in shanghai based state media the paper that argued china must adopt a more sophisticated approach to international diplomacy we must put forth a true three dimensional and comprehensive picture of china to international society he said ultimately of course beijing would be better served leaving propaganda in the hands of its most potent weapon the selfless efforts of ordinary chinese before we delivered those supplies medical workers had to use one mask for two days which is extremely dangerous when treating covid 19 says zhang the young consultant in bologna we plan to bring more soon we re just happy to do something for the italian community write to charlie
