 by robert farley posted on february 14 2020 democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg misleadingly stated that he cut the police practice of stop and frisk a policy that he inherited by 95 by the time he left office as mayor of new york there were nearly twice as many stops in his last year as mayor compared with the year before he took office it s true that the number of recorded stops declined steadily over the last two years of bloomberg s 12 years in office but bloomberg s statistic ignores the dramatic rise in such stops in earlier years under his watch he also fails to mention that the decline in later years came amid public backlash about the policy and mounting pressure from a class action lawsuit in bloomberg s first 10 years in office the number of stop and frisk actions increased nearly 600 from what he inherited reaching a peak of nearly 686 000 stops in 2011 there were about 192 000 documented stops in 2013 bloomberg gets to his figure of a 95 cut by cherry picking the quarterly high point of 203 500 stops in the first quarter of 2012 and comparing that with the 12 485 stops in the last quarter of 2013 a decline that would not have been possible without the numbers ballooning earlier in bloomberg s tenure bloomberg continued to defend the stop and frisk practice throughout his term as mayor and after maintaining that the policy led to a decrease in crime a justification he now acknowledges was wrong days before announcing his candidacy for president in november bloomberg said that he should have acted sooner and acted faster to cut the stops and he apologized for not doing that the issue of bloomberg s controversial use of stop and frisk as mayor of new york resurfaced in the national media after journalist benjamin dixon posted an audio clip of bloomberg defending the stop and frisk policy during an address in 2015 at the aspen institute bloomberg contended the policy was responsible for lower murder rates bloomberg now acknowledges that crime continued to come down as we reduced stops bloomberg feb 5 2015 ninety five percent of murders murderers and murder victims fit one m o you can just take a description xerox it and pass it out to all the cops they are male minorities 16 to 25 that s true in new york that s true in virtually every city inaudible and that s where the real crime is you ve got to get the guns out of the hands of people that are getting killed you want to spend the money on a lot of cops in the streets put those cops where the crime is which means in minority neighborhoods so one of the unintended consequences is people say oh my god you are arresting kids for marijuana that are all minorities yes that s true why because we put all the cops in minority neighborhoods yes that s true why do we do it because that s where all the crime is and the way you get the guns out of the kids hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them and then they start oh i don t want to get caught so they don t bring the gun they still have a gun but they leave it at home the audio posted by dixon edited out some of bloomberg s comments you can hear full bloomberg s answer here trump who has a long history of supporting stop and frisk policies tweeted and then deleted a link to dixon s tweet along with his own commentary wow bloomberg is a total racist responding to trump s tweet bloomberg issued a statement saying in part i inherited the police practice of stop and frisk and as part of our effort to stop gun violence it was overused by the time i left office i cut it back by 95 but i should ve done it faster and sooner i regret that and i have apologized and i have taken responsibility for taking too long to understand the impact it had on black and latino communities it s true as bloomberg said that he inherited the controversial stop and frisk policy a get tough on crime tactic of stopping people for suspicious activity that was begun under former mayor rudy giuliani according to data revealed by the state attorney general s office as part of an investigation into the city s policy there were a little fewer than 100 000 recorded stops in 2001 the year before bloomberg took office in the ensuing years under bloomberg the number of reported stops increased dramatically year after year peaking at nearly 686 000 in 2011 based on new york police department quarterly reports compiled by the aclu of new york from then on the number of recorded stops began a steady decline there were nearly 192 000 stops in 2013 bloomberg s final year as mayor but even in that year the data show steady declines in each quarter as we explained bloomberg is using quarterly numbers comparing the first quarter of 2012 with the fourth quarter of 2013 which shows a 94 decrease under bloomberg s successor bill di blasio who ran for mayor on a platform opposing the stop and frisk policy the number of such stops continued to decline dramatically to nearly 46 000 in di blasio s first year in office in 2014 and about 11 000 in 2018 bloomberg has attributed the decline that started in 2012 to better training although he consistently defended the stop and frisk program at the time and insisted it reduced violent crime a day after a federal judge granted class action status to a lawsuit brought by people who had been stopped the police department in may 2012 announced new training and supervision designed to address concerns about racial profiling in the application of stop and frisk the decline also came amid growing public outrage about the stop and frisk program in april 2013 a survey conducted by quinnipiac university found 51 of new york city voters disapproved of the stop and frisk policy and two thirds supported a plan to create an inspector general to monitor the police department a proposal that bloomberg opposed perhaps the biggest blow to the stop and frisk program came on aug 12 2013 when u s district court judge shira a scheindlin ruled that the city police department violated the u s constitution in the way that it carried out its stop and frisk program calling it a form of racial profiling of young black and hispanic men in her opinion scheindlin wrote that she was not ordering an end to the practice of stop and frisk and that the practice could continue if the city complied with court ordered remedies to make sure that the program did not violate the constitution the police union and bloomberg aggressively opposed the lawsuit in a press conference on the day of the ruling bloomberg called the stop question frisk policy a vital deterrent and credited the policy with playing an important part in helping to make new york city the safest big city in america and for leading to fewer guns fewer shootings and fewer homicides bloomberg attacked the judge as biased and vowed to appeal her ruling di blasio later declined to pursue the appeal less than two weeks later new york s city council passed two bills designed to provide oversight of the police department s stop and frisk policy one to create an independent inspector general to monitor the police department and another to make it easier for people to sue the police department over racial profiling bloomberg vetoed both bills but the council overrode those vetoes even after he left office bloomberg continued to defend the stop and frisk policy as recently as january 2019 bloomberg insisted the policy had led to a decline in the city s murder rate though the number of murders continued to dip even as the stop and frisk policy was phased out in a fact check article about whether stop and frisk reduced crime in new york city john macdonald a professor of criminology and sociology at the university of pennsylvania wrote that academic research concluded nypd s deployment of extra police to high crime neighborhoods contributed far more to the crime reduction than the use of stop question and frisk the additional use of stop question and frisk made almost no difference macdonald wrote the stops only had a detectable impact on crime when the stops were based on probable cause and these kinds of stops were very rare in a speech on nov 17 just days before announcing his candidacy bloomberg acknowledged that far too many innocent people were being stopped that it eroded trust from the black and latino communities and that crime did not go back up when the policy was scaled he concluded we could and should have acted sooner and acted faster to cut the stops i wish we had and i m sorry that we didn t bloomberg nov 17 over time i ve come to understand something that i long struggled to admit to myself i got something important wrong i got something important really wrong i didn t understand that back then the full impact that stops were having on the black and latino communities i was totally focused on saving lives but as we know good intentions aren t good enough now hindsight is 20 20 but as crime continued to come down as we reduced stops and has continued to come down during the next administration to his credit i now see that we could and should have acted sooner and acted faster to cut the stops i wish we had and i m sorry that we didn t bloomberg said that in 2012 in my third term we began putting more safeguards in place and we began scaling back the numbers of stops the numbers corroborate that but darius charney a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the class action case about the stop and frisk policy said it is more likely the decline in documented stops came because of a shift in the public tide against the policy and the fact that it was facing legal challenge in the courts and push back from the city council bloomberg may portray the change as coming as a result of realizing the error of his ways charney said but that doesn t seem consistent with the way he was behaving publicly bloomberg he noted was aggressive and defiant in defending the policy he fought the class action lawsuit and sought to appeal the ruling he vetoed city council efforts to rein in the program and he made numerous statements in support of stop and frisk no matter the reason for the decline in stops though bloomberg s explanation that he inherited the police practice of stop and frisk and cut it back by 95 may leave the mistaken impression that he cut the program by that amount from what he inherited in fact the practice greatly expanded under his watch and with his encouragement and then contracted from that height during his last two years in office in addition to trump s since deleted tweet forwarding the audio clip and branding bloomberg a racist trump also retweeted a post from van jones a cnn commentator and former adviser to president barack obama saying on cnn i think bloomberg has a problem because of what he did you know stop and frisk it was a horror show to be black or latino in new york city for years because you were constantly being stopped and harassed by the police whether you were doing anything wrong or not and bloomberg defended it until 20 minutes ago readers can make of bloomberg s comments what they will but trump has also long expressed support for stop and frisk policies as recently as oct 8 2018 trump recommended that chicago strongly consider stop and frisk it works and it was meant for problems like chicago it was meant for it in a radio interview with geraldo rivera on feb 13 starting around the 22 10 mark trump drew a distinction between the way the policy was applied by giuliani and bloomberg according to trump giuliani used the practice sparingly gingerly and really brilliantly bloomberg he said came in and he multiplied it times 10 if you were a black person walking down the street you were going to be stopped and frisked under bloomberg trump said and that s why they had a revolution in new york because of what he did he took rudy s stop and frisk which was done very gingerly very smartly you know a very smart job and he made it so vicious and so violent trump said and honestly if you were a black person you d be stopped two three times a day but when bloomberg was in office trump s tweets about stop and frisk don t reflect reservations about how the mayor was applying the policy in july and august 2013 around the time of the class action lawsuit ruling trump tweeted repeatedly in support of the policy and the way it was being applied and he warned that ending the policy would be a disaster and that crime would rise during the first presidential debate between trump and hillary clinton in september 2016 trump praised stop and frisk he also criticized the judge and her ruling in the new york city case and he criticized di blasio for not moving forward with an appeal trump credited the policy which he said was begun by giuliani and continued on by mayor bloomberg for bringing new york s crime rate way down when clinton noted that crime including murder continued to drop even as di blasio phased out stop and frisk trump said clinton was wrong at the time we wrote that both were right because murders went down in di blasio s first year in office but then ticked back up in 2015 in the ensuing two years however the number of murders again dropped the number of murders in new york city in 2017 2018 and 2019 were all lower than the best year under bloomberg and well below the numbers under giuliani q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
