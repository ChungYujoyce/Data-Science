as the democratic presidential candidates prepared to debate in detroit wednesday night the dozen voters who gathered to watch in the cinderblock auditorium of the flint development center some 70 miles away weren t focused on the candidates or the polls nobody was talking about senator kamala harris or former vice president joe biden as they chatted over a meal of fried chicken and spaghetti provided by black voters matter the advocacy group that hosted the watch party instead they talked about public school funding an issue which barely came up on stage in detroit for 10 minutes after the debate s scheduled 8 p m start time the organizers didn t even turn on the tv black voters make up about 20 of the democratic vote nationwide and they are an increasingly critical component of the party s electoral coalition because they often vote as a bloc the democrat who carries black voters usually wins the nomination on wednesday three candidates in particular were vying for their support biden who has community support because of his partnership with president obama harris who has sought to build a base of black women and senator cory booker the former mayor of newark n j who has emphasized criminal justice reform a quinnipiac poll released monday found biden leading with support from 53 of black voters with all of his opponents trailing in the single digits but the voters sitting on folding chairs watching the debate didn t necessarily seem pulled towards any of them between harris biden and booker no clear favorite emerged instead these flint voters seemed drawn to candidates like businessman andrew yang and rep tulsi gabbard in interviews they seemed simultaneously overwhelmed with their choices and bored by their options during the roughly 40 minute stretch of the debate that focused on the policy minutiae underpinning various medicare for all plans many of the voters were scrolling on their phones even the issues that campaigns suspected would pique their interests didn t seem to galvanize the crowd a long back and forth between biden booker and harris on their respective criminal justice records drew only a muted response despite heated online debates about criminal justice nobody in the flint room volunteered opinions about biden s 1994 crime bill or harris s time as a prosecutor or booker s criminal justice reform bill amber hassan a 38 year old flint hip hop artist said she wasn t particularly impressed with any of the front runners on wednesday night i m waiting for kamala harris to represent everyday black women she said i m not talking about phd black women i m talking about everyday middle america regular struggles black women biden she added feels entitled to it there s an air of i ve kind of got this in the bag i ve done this before she said no you haven t done this before you ve been the assistant booker she said didn t seem authentic but hassan said she was intrigued by the blonde woman meaning senator kirsten gillibrand who talked during the debate about how as a white woman she could be a messenger to her peers about matters like white privilege and she was drawn to yang i liked that he was a little more relaxed he didn t have a tie on overall these voters responded best when the candidates involved the challenges facing their community in flint they nodded when booker argued that trump won michigan partly because of the suppression of black voters they cheered when yang pointed out that we automated away 4 million manufacturing jobs hundreds of thousands right here in michigan they clapped when gabbard suggested redirecting trillions of dollars away from wasteful regime change wars and towards making sure everyone in this country has clean water to drink but the skepticism towards the establishment ran deep especially in a community that has been as failed by elected leaders as badly as flint has they were unimpressed by lip service that didn t come with an infrastructure plan or a promise of increased funding everybody uses us because it looks good said shanta smith 43 who runs a flint substance abuse facility they ll drive through flint they ll touch on it but what are you really doing for flint smith came to the debate thinking he wanted to hear from harris or booker but found himself listening closely to yang he was really talking about real issues not just attacking and playing the politics game he had his math together said smith he s not the usual candidate other voters at the watch party agreed in an informal poll conducted after the debate yang won overwhelmingly some voters did voice support for the big names kamala impressed me right out the gate because our community needs somebody who is in touch said michele kelly 60 she liked booker too she said because he lived in a low income community in newark you don t do that for show she said if you go and live in low income housing that means you love the people who are there some voters said that if nobody captures their trust they may not vote at all amber hassan who calls herself a selective voter says choosing between two imperfect candidates is like choosing between dirty lettuce or rotten lettuce and she d rather walk away with nothing we ve been lied to so many times says lendra brown 59 a former food stamp manager if she had to vote tomorrow she says i would vote for mickey mouse write to
