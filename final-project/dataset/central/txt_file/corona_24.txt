because states need to actually get things done loading april 23 2020 for america s governors one thing has become clear during the past few weeks these next steps will be exceedingly difficult nothing has tested governors like covid 19 it stretches across the entire country and has proved hard to control but opening up will be much harder than shutting down as governors compete for equipment and struggle to maintain health standards in the face of protests costs and skyrocketing unemployment no wonder they feel they could use a little backup governors nationwide are forming regional partnerships to help think through how to reopen responsibly and strategically it s an extension of how governors often operate relying on one another in emergencies but it s also a reminder that even in partisan times governors are the ultimate fix it crew judged by getting things done we know we need each other s expertise support ideas troubleshooting says david postman chief of staff to the governor of washington state the hope is that it could have a lasting effect should states face something like this again he adds let s go back and remember what we did in 2020 david postman was looking forward to his first day off in more than six weeks as chief of staff to the governor of washington state where the novel coronavirus burst early in the united states he figured the easter weekend might provide that opportunity it was not to be instead he spent the weekend teleconferencing and texting with his counterparts in oregon and california the three chiefs of staff were working on a formal collaboration between their west coast states and the governors wanted to move quickly rumblings were coming from president donald trump about an upcoming decision to reopen states economies we need to be out there we want to show people that we are working together says mr postman recalling the urgency of the moment on monday morning the governors all of them democrats agreed to guidelines for reopening their economies including a decline in the rate of the virus s spread more testing and protecting vulnerable populations the same day new york gov andrew cuomo also a democrat announced a coalition of northeastern states followed later in the week by a bipartisan great lakes group editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall on one hand states cooperate on a daily basis from local agreements on transport to larger ones that affect regions such as eastern states capping greenhouse gases and western ones sharing colorado river water and when hurricanes fires or floods hit states are quick to send firefighters and utility trucks but nothing is testing governors like covid 19 it stretches across the entire country and it is unpredictable and harder to control while governors say they will rely on science to open up their economies the science is not so clear and opening up will be harder than shutting down as governors compete for equipment and struggle to maintain health standards in the face of mounting pushback costs and skyrocketing unemployment to this point that is the key question binding these partnerships how do they reopen responsibly and strategically for instance when is it ok to allow elective surgeries or how to conduct contact tracing the coalitions are a reminder that even as the political poison in congress has leaked into the states relationships among governors are nothing like it is in washington says former new jersey gov thomas kean members of congress are graded on speeches and votes he explains governors on the other hand get graded on what you ve done period that means getting the next steps right and governors know they ll need one another the effect of this pandemic is so much more widespread than any other calamity or emergency or crisis in anyone s memory and its path and duration are hard to predict says john weingart director of the center on the american governor at rutgers university in new jersey no one wants restrictions relaxed too soon but what nobody knows is the definition of too soon emergency planning is the very first thing new governors learn about when they gather after election day for training by the national governors association a telling example for the newbies pennsylvania gov dick thornburgh in 1979 after less than three months in office he had to deal with the accident at the three mile island nuclear plant states should be able to count on federal help with resources guidance and expertise mr weingart says on thursday congress passed nearly 500 billion in coronavirus related aid on top of 2 5 trillion already passed but generally states would prefer to rely on each other as opposed to the federal government says raymond scheppach former executive director of the national governors association they understand each other and they ll get answers quicker they even have a formal compact that allows them to share assistance during emergencies including smokejumpers national guardsmen and equipment in today s crisis regional cooperation is the only way to do it says mr kean a popular two term governor in the 1980s what if new jersey were to open its beaches before new york he posits all the people in new york are going to come to our beaches he and democrat mario cuomo a formernew york governor met at least once a month over dinner or lunch they became close friends good relationships with the governors of massachusetts and north carolina also led to the governors stealing ideas from one another he says that same approach must apply now many governors say republican gov charlie baker of massachusettsspokein a local tv interview monday about the need to get over the baloney and the noise of partisan politics we re all in this together and we need to behave and act like that he said rattling off the names of his counterparts from maine to new jersey most of whom are democrats regional cooperation is vital he said last week given how integrated new england states economies are about250 000 out of state drivers enter massachusetts on an average weekday including nearly 150 000 commuters fromnew hampshire andrhode island part of the planning also requires listening to and learning from our neighboring states governor baker said though he emphasized that he would always act first and foremost in the interest of massachusetts citizens that is the balancing act ahead weighing one state s needs and even counties within states against the needs of neighbors the point was stressed by the seven midwestern governors who formed a bipartisan coalition in the broader great lakes area the group includes michigan wisconsin minnesota illinois kentucky ohio and indiana phasing in sectors of our economy will be most effective when we work together as a region they said in an april 16 statement this doesn t mean our economy will reopen all at once or that every state will take the same steps at the same time but close coordination will ensure we get this right some governors have butted heads with the president over his authority over shortages of tests and personal protective equipment and his encouragement of protesters to liberate certain democratic states from restrictions but they have generally praised the centers for disease control and prevention for its expertise and vice president mike pence for his outreach and wednesday saw california s gov gavin newsom who has led the democratic resistance against the president touting a very good phone call with president trump more testing swabs are on the way the president assured him in that way the cooperation between states is not just about filling federal gaps suggests mr weingart it seems clear that the effect of the virus is different in different parts of the country or on a different schedule and it s a healthy response for states to band together in some instances this week florida gov ron desantis announced that six southeastern states all led by republican governors are also forming a coalition to share ideas about reopening they are moving more quickly and broadly to loosen restrictions than their democratic counterparts though colorado s democratic governor announced he will let his state s stay at home order expire next week and allow businesses to reopen with restrictions mr scheppach expects that governors will become closer because of this challenge and hopes their efforts will lead to greater cooperation in the future so far the american public has given governors high marks for their handling of the crisis with 76 of democrats and 73 of republicans praising their state s governor according to a monmouth university poll released last month we know we need each other s expertise support ideas troubleshooting says washington state s mr postman should states face something like this again let s go back and remember what we did to collaborate in 2020 get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox staff writer christa case bryant contributed to this report from boston editor s note as a public service all our
