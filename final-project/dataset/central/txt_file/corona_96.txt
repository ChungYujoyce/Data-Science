underlying assumptions that have led to dramatically different projections of covid 19 infection and fatality rates can help loading april 9 2020 where can public officials turn for trusted advice on covid 19 when models of the pandemic s arc have offered such divergent projections of death rates and hospital shortages ideally scientific advisers can help officials understand the underlying assumptions that modelers have used to piece together fragmentary data but often those assumptions get lost in the fray creating an aura of certainty and dread when projections are splashed across the news with grave images i think we could be doing a lot of harm says john ioannidis an epidemiologist and statistician at stanford university who adds that that stress affects susceptibility to viral and respiratory infections others defend sobering models as essential to helping leaders and health care systems brace for a surge in demand and saving lives so far there isn t enough data to provide definitive transmission or fatality rates wide ranging variations in the adoption of and adherence to social distancing further complicate the picture there is another variable that may well tip in our favor says herman b dutch leonard a professor of public management at harvard kennedy school that s america s ability to innovate its way through crisis we are just beginning to do our best thinking he says as mayors governors and presidents weigh how best to guide their communities throughthe coronavirus crisis they must navigate dramatically divergent models of the arc of the pandemic in the united states alone leaders have already made decisions that have disrupted millions of citizens lives and cost trillions of dollars with a disproportionate economic impact on low wage earners and their families as citizens across the country wonder whether they and their loved ones will be safe how they ll pay their bills and when they ll be able to return to work some are pressing their leaders to take stricter measures while others are questioning the models that prompted such unprecedented steps the modeling debate within the scientific community is due in part to uncertainty around key questions including transmission and fatality rates and the challenge is further complicated by wide ranging variations in adoption of and adherence to preventative measures like social distancing and voluntary home quarantine editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall i think we should use all data to inform our views but we shouldn t be overconfident in the results from any one data set or even any combination of data sets says marc lipsitch a professor of epidemiology and director of the center for communicable disease dynamics at the harvard t h chan school of public health i think we re still at the stage of here are the caveats but the caveats and underlying assumptions are sometimes lost in the fray for average citizens the charts depicting expected spikes in fatality rates or hospital shortages can take on an aura of certainty and dread no matter what the numbers are if they are accompanied by pictures of people dying and of graves and trucks carrying the dead people read the numbers through these narratives through these stories says john ioannidis a professor of epidemiology at stanford university such packaging in the media compounds an already stressful environment he adds noting that stress affects susceptibility to viral and respiratory infections in such a situation with panic and horror being disseminated i think we could be doing a lot of harm two of the most prominent covid 19 models are from imperial college london and the institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme in washington state imperial s neil ferguson and his colleagues garnered headlines with their projection that if nothing were done covid 19 deaths in the united kingdomand u s over two years would total 510 000 and 2 2 million respectively and demand for critical care beds would peak at 30 times actual capacity their march 16 report which advocated social distancing is widely credited with prompting britain and many u s states to close schools churches and nonessential services the trump administration issued guidance the same day recommending that employees work at home and gatherings be limited to 10 or fewer people dr ferguson who is one of the most highly respected figures in his field came under fire for allegedly reversing course nine days later when he told british parliament that due to the u k s lockdown and social distancing policies he estimated the death toll at 20 000 and possibly substantially less the 20 000 estimate was in fact included in the original report but as one of 46 different projected death tolls ranging from 5 600 to 120 000 depending on the rate of transmission and the scope of societal restrictions see page 13 in this pdf it s unclear how effective such restrictions are a survey of 14 studies on quarantine in past disease outbreaks for example found that rates of adherence varied from 0 to 92 i think we need to be very careful with narratives that say only 20 000 died because we did the right thing says dr ioannidis who has made a career out of finding holes in medical research and cautions against a bandwagon effect among researchers last month he published a provocative article in stat warning of a once in a century evidence fiasco around covid 19 asking how policymakers could be sure they weren t doing more harm than good by implementing draconian countermeasures based on patchy data dr lipsitchwrote a rebuttal piece arguing that despite the lack of data inaction was not an option given the exponential nature of infection one of the key unknowns is the infection fatality rate under ideal circumstances fatality rates are a matter of simple arithmetic divide the number of deaths by the number of infections butwithout widespread testing of the general population it s difficult to produce a reliable denominator what s more the number of fatalities isn t entirely certain either in italy for instance there have been indications that deaths may have been eitheroverstatedorunderstated casting doubt on totals elsewhere as well the world health organization initially estimated the fatality rate for global cases at 3 4 but more recent estimates have come in lower a march 13 article in the journal science for example concluded that china s fatality rate was closer to 0 5 imperial s study put the u k rate at 0 9 the other modelgarnering a lot of attention from ihme at the university of washington didn t attempt to calculate fatality rates it focused on projecting total deaths and the strain on health care systems initially using data from wuhan china and then other locations as more data became available ihme s march 25 forecast projected lower death tollsthan numerous other models in part because it assumed that within one week all u s states would have adopted four social distancing measures that china implemented but two weeks later 41states have implemented two or fewer nevertheless imhe has since reduced its projections to 60 415 u s deaths by august and lowered its estimate of total hospital beds needed at peak demand by nearly half so how are public officials supposed to make sense of the debate within the scientific community and fast ideally their scientific advisers can help sort through the relevant studies or models including the fine print says john holdren former white house scientific adviser under president barack obama it s the responsibility of the modelers individuals and their agencies to make the assumptions and associated uncertainties clear when they describe their results and the responsibility of science advisors to policy makers to try to make sure these points are understood says dr holdren in an emailed comment the trump administration showed imhe s model at a march 31 press conference when it unveiled its own estimate of 100 000 to 240 000 fatalities also citing studies from imperial college harvard and others but the white house gave little visibility into how it arrived at those numbers i m not quite clear and i m a pretty experienced pandemic watcher about the process of deliberation says howard markel a physician and professor of the history of medicine at the university of michigan who has studied pandemics from the black death to the 1918 spanish flu and was part of a group of experts tapped to evaluate the obama administration s h1n1 influenza policies on a daily basis from 2009 to 2011 one of the critical performance factors in handling a crisis is how successfully the scientific community and political actors interface with each other says herman b dutch leonard a professor of public management at harvard kennedy school who is working with mayors from around the world through the bloomberg harvard city leadership initiative politicians are sometimes skeptical of scientists projections he says while scientists can underestimate the political difficulty of enforcing something like social distancing the scientists often act as if the mayor has a wand and can order the public to stay home but she s using up really scarce political capital which could undermine her ability to act as the pandemic worsens says professor leonard but dr markel says that a public health official changing strategy as new data comes in is analogous to a physician who adjusts his treatment of a patient as symptoms change and that should be communicated to the public it s the patient doctor relationship writ large because you re taking care of a community he says as leaders strive to give an unvarnished view of the facts without creating undue fear professor leonard says one variable may be higher than people realize america s ability to innovate its way through crisis get the monitor stories you care about
