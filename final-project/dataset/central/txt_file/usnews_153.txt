in the final days before the senate vote on the confirmation of supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh the national debate over the right course of action was distilled into one key question whom to believe the hearing process provided a stage for the striking testimony of dr christine blasey ford who accuses kavanaugh of sexual assault when they were in high school and the emotional rebuttal of kavanaugh who denies those claims a limited fbi investigation over the past week seems to have given republicans the assurance they need to vote to confirm kavanaugh while ford s supporters have turned their belief in her statements and in all survivors who find the courage to speak out into a rallying cry the news has also drawn attention to a fundamental principle of law that it turns out is more complicated than it seems the presumption of innocence senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has defended kavanaugh on the principle that he is innocent until proven guilty while senate minority leader chuck schumer has made the point that the hearings are not a lawsuit and thus the legal presumed innocence rule is basically irrelevant the two senators despite working within the same system are able to find very different guidance from the same concept but that gap isn t what s surprising says fran ois quintard mor nas a lawyer and the author of a 2010 article on the history of the presumption of innocence in the american journal of comparative law what he does find ironic is which senator is on which side as the narrowing of the concept is due in part to decades of effort by american conservatism schumer is not technically wrong quintard mor nas tells time over time the principle in the united states has been weakened considerably for various reasons and mostly by conservative justices who didn t want to expand the principle beyond the court of law in examining the history of the idea quintard mor nas went way back he found that the ancient babylonian code of hammurabi put the burden of proof on the accuser that the ancient greek statesman demosthenes wrote about the importance of not calling people criminals before they were convicted that a key third century roman legal document set forward rules about the evidence an accuser must supply and that a medieval european legal principle specified that conviction not accusation defined a criminal roman legal codes with clear analogs in u s law instructed judges to allow bail treat defendants respectfully and conduct trials as speedily as possible so that the guilty and innocent could be properly sorted an accused person was entitled to benefits that might be denied to a convict such as conducting business or passing down an inheritance the basic idea is to quintard mor nas a necessary logical premise for a functioning legal system it starts a long time ago in antiquity if you allege that someone has done something wrong the burden of proof is on you to demonstrate that what you say is true he says that s a first principle of law that everybody knows he traces the precise phrase innocent until proven guilty to johannes monachus a french clergyman and expert in church law who lived around the turn of the 14th century but as simple as it sounds it actually has two fairly distinct meanings which quintard mor nas calls the rule of proof and the shield against premature punishment the former is a legal concept applicable narrowly in a courtroom setting which declares that the burden of proof rests on a prosecutor that s the one schumer was talking about the latter is a relatively broad idea with legal and social implications that a person who has not been convicted deserves to be treated as innocent up until the moment of decision that s the one mcconnell was talking about quintard mor nas says he saw the difference between these two meanings first hand in law school as a french student i learned it was a rule of proof and a shield against punishment but when i went to georgetown to do my master s degree i learned that it was only a rule of proof he says one way in which the difference worked out was immediately clear american suspects were commonly handcuffed upon arrest a practice that to his french eyes seemed to diminish the dignity of a presumed innocent person but in the course of his research he found that the application of the idea in french history was subject to a series of ups and downs to put it mildly although a french man coined the phrase in 17th century france the maxim had some competition the idea that he who spares the guilty punishes the innocent torture was used to elicit confessions and certain punishments were meted out upon accusation rather than conviction though king louis xvi supported the presumption of innocence in the 18th century the french revolution dealt the idea a major setback quintard mor nas quotes robespierre on the subject wondering what would happen to the revolution if the king himself were presumed innocent however over time and with the knowledge of how far things could go in the other direction the presumption came back strong and in recent years french law has gone even further in strengthening the idea of the presumption of innocence in the broad sense as a matter of human dignity to which all citizens have a well defined right in anglo american law things went a different direction the idea of innocent until proven guilty was common knowledge in the english speaking world in the 17th century an idea quintard mor nas backs up with mentions in plays and other popular writings as well as legal cases and there s plenty of evidence that in the 18th and 19th century it was understood in a broad sense for example the rhode island constitution enshrines it as a right but around the end of the 19th century u s jurists started to argue that the narrow sense of the idea was a better way to apply it quintard mor nas traces the shift in part to the fight against crime around the turn of the 20th century and in its first decades in that period some american scholars even argued that a literal and broad interpretation of the presumption of innocence would cripple the legal system because it would mean you couldn t arrest someone until their guilt was proved later law and order campaigners would make similar arguments under richard nixon the justice department specifically clarified that the idea had was merely a rule of evidence with no application to pretrial proceedings quintard mor nas writes finally in the 1979 case bell v wolfish the supreme court weighed in with justice rehnquist declaring that the presumption of innocence was only to be applied inside the courtroom in his ruling he made clear as a conservative justice that the presumption of innocence was just a rule of proof that has no place before trial quintard mor nas says one recent example of how this plays out he says is that the presumption of innocence can t be used as an argument against websites that post mugshots in the u s system today the presumption of innocence is only a rule of evidence that applies only to the prosecutor that s how legal people understand it he says today it s mostly a rhetorical device outside a courtroom not anything more to quintard mor nas this trend toward a more narrow conception of presumed innocent is not a positive one you can see how swiftly and surely you evolve to a world where the words accused and convict became synonyms he says that s against a thousand years of fundamental principles of law but in today s world of course that fundamental principle isn t simple either for one thing it would be extremely hard to actually enforce the presumption of innocence as anything other than a rule of evidence quintard mor nas says he thinks that perhaps what the u s and the world need is a culture of respect whereby both accuser and accused are heard properly without anyone jumping to conclusions either way echoing a position taken by other commentators he says he s glad that more sexual misconduct accusers feel comfortable coming forward but that he urges people at the same time to be careful about the impact of their words of course he acknowledges the better situation he envisions requires that accusers are listened to and not intimidated and that both sides have faith in the judicial system working properly i might be na ve at the end of the day everybody has an agenda and you can see it in the kavanaugh hearing he says i think we can get there and we re probably not doing a good job today write to lily rothman at lily rothman
