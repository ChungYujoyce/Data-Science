washington a month after independentrep justin amash of michigan said he was considering a candidacy for president he said he would not run on saturday amash said in a series of posts on twitter that he was abandoning plans to run to become the libertarian party s nomineethis year saying he concluded that circumstances don t lend themselves to my success as a candidate for president this year and therefore i will not be a candidate amash a former republicanwho left the gop last year after calling for president donald trump s impeachment said he still believes that a candidate who is not a democrat or republican is needed to offer avision of government grounded in liberty and equality and that one can break through in the right environment but he said he determined this is not the right year after weeks of planning and considerations polarization is near an all time high electoral success requires an audience willing to consider alternatives but both social media and traditional media are dominated by voices strongly averse to the political risks posed by a viable third candidate he said more justin amash quits republican party saying u s is in a partisan death spiral more justin amash says he s considering a run for president after trump remarks he also said social distancing requirements put in place as a response to the coronavirus pandemic make it difficult for an outside candidate with less name recognition than those in the two major parties to break through amash said on april 13via twitter that he was considering a run for president after having concluded last year that trump had committed impeachable offenses in attempting to stymie former special counsel robert mueller s investigation into russian involvement in the 2016 election amash was outraged when trump this spring suggested that his authority as president over the response to coronavirus was total despite his long association with the republican party amash had just as long a history of breaking with his party while many anti trump republicans voiced support for amash when he battled publicly with the president trump at one point called amash a total lightweight and a loser on twitter many of them broke with him when he announced on april 28 that instead of running as an independent he was exploring his chances of winning the libertarian party anomination doing so some of them argued could help trump get re elected in november by taking votes away from the democratic party s presumptive nominee former vice president joe biden who many of the so called never trumpers have said they would back more could an amash candidacy help trump get reelected some trump critics think so amash brushed aside those concerns but with the libertarian party set to hold its presidential nominating convention in austin texas beginning next thursday amash decided to drop his presidential aspirations altogether while saying he plans to remain a member of the libertarian party thiswas a difficult decision for me especially having seen grassroots supporters put so much effort into this campaign it s been humbling and awesome he said some of those republicans opposing trump cheered amash s decision not to enter the race formerrep joe walsh r ill who briefly mounted a gop run for president this year against trump this year and considers amash a friend had written a column in the washington post calling amash s libertarian run a mistake on saturday he welcomed him back into the fold thank you justinamash walsh wrote on twitter now work with all of us to make sure that donald trump is defeated it was not clear that amash was a shoo in for the libertarian nomination anyway withformer california superior court judge jim gray who ran as the party s vice presidential nominee in 2012 and lawyer jacob hornberger who founded the future of freedom foundation a group that advocates for smaller government and free markets among the front runners according to a may 4 post on the libertarian party of michigan s website amash came in second in that group s online convention to hornberger 33 votes to 23 votes and some libertarian officials thought amash might have difficultly overcoming his long history as a republican though his greater name recognition played in his favor it was not immediately clear whether amash who changed his party affiliation in the last month and became the only libertarian member of the u s house plans to try to run for reelection in his current seat which he has held since 2011 but even if he does he faces a tough battle in a predominately republican district peter meijer whose family owns and operates the eponymous grocery chain is considered one of the top candidates running for the republican nomination to the seat as is state rep lynn afendoulis r grand rapids former sand lake village president tom norton is also running for the gop nod on the democratic side hillary scholten who worked at the department of justice under president barack obama is running for the nomination according to information on the michigan secretary of state s website a candidate who is not running as a nominee for a major or minor party but as an independent has until july 16 to file the required affidavits and petition signatures to be listed on the november ballot it did not appear the libertarian party had a nominee in amash s district so it s also possible he could gain access to the ballot that way if it had a convention nominating him by aug 4 in his posts saturday amash said he only came to the conclusion to drop his considerations of runningafter assessing the race appearing in media talking to delegates and donors watching the libertarian party s convention plan unfold and gathering feedback from family friends and other advisers he said given the changing nature of american life in recent months due to coronavirus he found it was difficult to find a way to break through to deliver his message and gain momentum americans are understandably more interested in what life will look like tomorrow than they are in broader policy debates and news coverage has reflected those priorities he wrote at the same time fundraising challenges posed by an idled economy will hinder advertising he also said lingering uncertainty regarding ratification of online voting the feasibility of 50 state ballot access and related legal challenges and unity after the nomination have also weighed heavily on me we must address these issues as a party to ensure we maximize our potential
