fight but has also signaled a change in his campaign by laying off campaign staffers and talking about the importance of the party platform to be written at the democratic national convention the signals are the earlymoves and machinationsof a negotiation typical in democratic contests clinton will want sanders s help in winning over his diehard supporters and unifying the party and sanders

of a general election i don t know what s left to extract rep emanuel cleaver d mo a clinton supporter said in an interview with the hill he said the democratic primary moved the discussion farther to the left than most moderate democrats would like to see some would say it even endangers a victory in november because the further you go to the left or right the further you frustrate independents cleaver said he s already impacted this election probably more than anyone else including donald trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president

possible for clinton to compromise with sanders on some policy demands we can t do it the ally said but there s going to be a place for him to weigh in on the campaign and at the convention and he should have the satisfaction that he raised some issues that have been a part of the conversation sanders allies are frustrated with what they see as recalcitrance by clinton to offer more he can t demand anything but she ll want his full cooperation one sanders ally said in the short term sanders wants a couple of things he wants to shake up the democratic party and turn it upside down because

rest of the election which is a major reason why sanders will continue to fight in the primaries throughjune 7 andpick up more delegateswhen voters in california and five other states vote the more delegates sanders wins the more power he believes he ll wield at the convention and in talks with clinton clinton allies say sanders has already pushed clinton to the left on issues such as trade where the former secretary of state now opposes the trans pacific partnership clinton has also inched toward agreeing to a 15 minimum wage saying at the last democratic debate that she would sign legislation mandating the 15 minimum if congress sent it to her sanders supporters say they ve seen encouraging signs from clinton just this week in a get out the vote speech in philadelphiaon tuesday clintonsaid the next president must keep our troops out of another costly ground war in the middle east and that wall street can never again be allowed to threaten main street she also added a line

sanders supporter and a former democratic party chair in california said the senator could have been standing behind clintonon tuesdayholding up a sign that said mission accomplished but press said sanders s success over the course of the primary illustrates there is a profound dissatisfaction with politics as usual and that clinton should make some concessions to engage those backing sanders he said she could start by more firmly saying she s for a 15 minimum wage while tuition free college might be tough for her to swallow he said she should work in that direction for hillary to move back to the center or fail to take the progressive torch and run with it would be huge mistake he said in an interview with msnbc s rachel maddowon monday clinton said sanders should take a page from her own playbook in 2008 when she supported then sen obama without conditions we got to the end in june and i did not put down conditions i didn t say you know what if sen obama does w y and z maybe i ll support him clinton said i said i am supporting sen obama but after top surrogates asked obama to help retire clinton s campaign debt amounting to more than 22 million he asked many of his campaign bundlers to chip in to help his former rival during the current election cycle clinton and sanders should start managing their relationship and sanders should continue to run cleaver said but begin to
