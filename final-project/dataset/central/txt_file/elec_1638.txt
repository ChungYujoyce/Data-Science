over whether he sees politics through blue tinted glasses loading may 9 2016 would president donald trump raise taxes on the rich or not that s a bit of an open question at the moment due to stuff mr trump said on news shows over the weekend and tax hikes of any nature of course are anathema to the republican party at least they ve been counter to gop ideology for decades in the pt pre trump era here s the background on nbc s meet the press sunday host chuck todd asked trump whether the presumptive nominee s tax plan is set in stone during the primary season trump proposed massive across the board tax cuts in essence trump said no he talked about his tax plan priorities for negotiations saying that the middle class needs to be protected business needs to be protected but the wealthy don t the rich are probably going to end up paying more trump said lots of people ok lots of washington people took this to mean he d go along with taxes on the top 1 percent that are higher than they are now trump might hike taxes on rich headlines followed monday trump is saying that is not what he meant he insists the comment referred to the fact that he realizes big policies in washington are negotiated between the parties and the white house and the legislative branch and that he d accept a tax rate for the rich higher than the one he d proposed but still lower than current policy with this very low tax that i put in the biggest of anybody i may have to raise it a little bit from that point trump told maria bartiromo monday on fox business network so the media of course picks it up that trump wants a tax increase it s just unbelievable hmm ok the original wording didn t really seem that way but it s entirely possible trump s answer on meet the press was just imprecise if that s that case he s talking about his negotiation priorities as president right we ve never written a book on the art of deals but laying out what you d take and what you wouldn t in advance doesn t seem like a great negotiation technique to us in politics you always hear top officials say something along the lines of i m not going to negotiate with myself when they re asked questions about what they do and don t want from big deals a variation on this is the classic i don t answer hypothetical questions that didn t happen in this case perhaps more important for trump lots of conservatives are angry about the way he answered this question however it s interpreted that s because they re suspicious of the presumptive nominee s motives is he a closet liberal he defends big entitlement programs doesn t talk much about gay marriage or other social issues is against bathroom laws aimed at transgender people and has a proudly non interventionist america first foreign policy on the gop trump is a ok with making america blue again or at least making the gop more like the democrats writes steve berman at the right leaning the resurgent get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox that s going to be a problem for trump going forward all his statements are going to be examined not just for how they differ from democrats but how they differ from republican positions of the recent past that will make it difficult to unify the party if that s his goal so far he s indicating that his intra party opponents need to make peace with him not the other way round i m going to do what i have to do i have millions of people that voted for me trump said on abc s this week sunday link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your
