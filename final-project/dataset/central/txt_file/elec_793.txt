updated nov 21 2019 at 1 11 pm by aaron bycoffe sarah frostenson and julia wolfe another democratic debate another poll we once again partnered with ipsos to track how wednesday s debate hosted by the washington post and msnbc affected likely primary voters feelings about the candidates the fivethirtyeight ipsos poll conducted using ipsos s knowledgepanel interviewed the same group of voters twice on either side of the debate to capture both the before and after picture to better understand which candidates did well or poorly wednesday night we plotted how favorably respondents rated the candidates before the debate vs how debate watchers rated their performance one thing that immediately stands out respondents on average thought pete buttigieg and elizabeth warren had the strongest debate performances which is especially notable for buttigieg because he was slightly less well liked going into the night candidates like amy klobuchar and cory booker who are polling well behind the leaders also got strong performance scores relative to their pre debate favorability ratings on the other hand tulsi gabbard s and joe biden s performance scores were notably low in relation to their pre debate popularity in terms of raw debate grades respondents graded candidates on a four point scale higher scores are better buttigieg and warren tied for first in their average scores they were closely followed by sanders and booker tom steyer and especially gabbard received the worst marks respondents could pick multiple candidates or someone else despite biden s relatively mediocre marks for his performance more than half of voters still said they were considering voting for him and that number actually increased by nearly 2 percentage points post debate the biggest winner though was clearly buttigieg who gained just over 6 points in potential support only sanders experienced a dip in potential support and it was very small we also asked likely democratic primary voters how favorably they felt about each candidate both before and after the debate andrew yang and klobuchar saw the largest jumps in net favorability favorable rating minus unfavorable rating 4 6 points and 4 0 points respectively buttigieg also made solid gains climbing nearly 3 points in net favorability in contrast gabbard and biden saw the biggest decrease in net favorability dropping by 4 5 points and 3 3 points gabbard s unfavorable rating increased by about 7 points excludes respondents who chose i don t know enough to say voters were also asked what matters more to them a candidate who agrees with them on most issues or someone who would have a good chance of defeating president trump and as you can see there was only a slight change in the post debate numbers compared to pre debate responses after wednesday night the share of likely democratic primary voters who prioritized issues ticked up by a few percentage points finally we asked respondents to estimate each democrat s chances of defeating trump from 0 percent no chance to 100 percent certain to win going into the debate as in other general election polls biden was the candidate voters thought was most likely to beat trump on average he still leads on that question after the fifth debate but as you can see below his average rating dropped by almost 2 points most other candidates however saw their average rating improve buttigieg in particular gained just over 3 points while klobuchar and steyer saw smaller bumps all the data presented here comes from polling done by ipsos for fivethirtyeight using ipsos s knowledgepanel a probability based online panel that is recruited to be representative of the u s population for this study the same group of respondents is interviewed before and after the debate to track whether and how their answers changed an initial wave of polling was conducted before the debates began with a follow up wave after the debate the first wave of the poll was conducted from nov 14 to nov 18 among a general population sample of adults with 3 786 respondents who say they are likely to vote in their state s democratic primary or caucus for the likely democratic primary voter subset of respondents the poll has a margin of error of 1 71 percentage points the second wave of the poll began after the debate ended and collected data from nov 20 to 21 among 2 077 likely democratic primary voters who had previously responded to the first wave it has a margin of error of 2 3 percentage points of those respondents 757 watched the debate the scatter plot comparing candidates favorability to their debate performance was calculated by assigning a 0 to 100 score to each respondent s answer to the favorability question where very favorable is equal to 100 somewhat favorable is equal to 75 heard of no opinion is equal to 50 somewhat unfavorable is equal to 25 and very unfavorable is equal to zero scores were then averaged to create an overall favorability index for each candidate respondents who hadn t heard of the candidate were not included additional contributions by laura bronner 2018 abc news internet ventures all rights reserved
