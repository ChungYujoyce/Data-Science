the problem started i haven t been able to play golf i ve been very busy mcilroy created a stir on thursday when he was asked about trump on the mckellar golf podcast mcilroy had taken trump up on an offer to play a round of golf back in 2017 but on the podcast mcilroy said he hasn t played with him since and won t in the future so i will sit here and say that the day i had with him i enjoyed but that doesn t mean i agree with everything or in fact anything that he says mcilroy said tirico mentioned mcilroy s comments to trump the president didn t respond directly about mcilroy but more generally about tour players a lot of them are very political actually a lot of them like my politics very much and some don t i guess trump said the ones that don t i don t get to see as much trump then started talking about next steps you ll never make up for the lives that were lost but we re going to rebuild and we re starting really right now at your event trump said it s the beginning of
