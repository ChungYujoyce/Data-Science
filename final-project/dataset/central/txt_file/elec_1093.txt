on wednesday evening the democrats held their fifth presidential primary debate nbc news the left doesn t see any clear winners but applauds the substantive policy discussions that took place during the debate each of these candidates answered questions playing to their strengths warren landed a punch with an exchange on her wealth tax biden talked about foreign policy and the lack of civility in america sanders touched on his signature issue of medicare for all and buttigieg took time to pitch himself a moderate alternative to the left wing of the democratic party the night gave all four frontrunners some wins and a few losses still not much happened to dramatically reshape the state of the race ella nilsen vox during the democratic debate in atlanta on wednesday night the moderators asked buttigieg specifically what he would do differently from former president barack obama who also used rhetoric about unity but faced eight years of entrenched republican opposition buttigieg didn t really have an answer amanda terkel huffington post nonetheless this was the debate that sent a signal that democrats differ far more with trump and the republicans than they do with each other the question that came to mind after some of the harsh and more narrowly focused brawls earlier in the year was how could this party possibly unite the question that dominated on wednesday was do these contenders really disagree all that much of course they do disagree as warren and sanders especially wanted to make clear by way of contrast with their more moderate adversaries but it was a salutary break from an all trump all the time washington to hear discourses on how to build houses how to make college affordable and how to help families care for their kids e j dionne jr washington post a few minutes on one night might not be the dream scenario for affordable housing advocates but there s some value just in asking studies have shown that simply being discussed at a presidential debate is a form of validation that elevates the significance of an issue in the eyes of voters hopefully viewers won t have to wait so long to hear more tim murphy mother jones in a marked contrast from several past debates gender equity took center stage at wednesday s democratic debate which featured wide ranging discussion about paid family leave abortion rights and the higher standards that women candidates must meet yang s comment highlighted a startling reality among developed countries the us is the only one that does not have a paid leave program a policy that s been shown to increase women s workforce participation reduce family s reliance on public assistance and improve children s health outcomes li zhou vox many note that biden s opposition to marijuana legalization puts him at odds with the great majority of democrats 75 plus percent of whom back legalization biden s opposition even puts him at odds with the median republican with polls showing that even a majority of republicans support legalization politically then legalization should be low hanging fruit yet biden is not quite there it s an especially bad look for biden he has a long record of pushing for punitive criminal justice and drug policies not just supporting but actually writing many of the laws in the 1980s and 90s that helped shape america s modern war on drugs for biden to hang on to marijuana prohibition then just reinforces one of the major concerns that criminal justice reformers like booker have about him german lopez vox others argue that biden was almost the only one on the stage who talked like a normal person there was a point near the end of the debate when he was talking about getting men involved in stopping domestic violence and he said that we need to keep punching at it i knew that the twitterati and the analysts would tut tut ol joe is just out of touch he doesn t know you can t use words like that meanwhile every non political junkie watching the debate thought there was nothing wrong with this biden was just using ordinary language not worrying too much if it was fully approved by the woke brigade kevin drum mother jones the right sees buttigieg and biden as the winners of the debate and criticizes the answers on housing and foreign policy the right sees buttigieg and biden as the winners of the debate and criticizes the answers on housing and foreign policy tonight s debate perhaps overshadowed by the impeachment hearings was an oddly flat showcase for the candidates where almost every candidate seemed content to tread water and play it safe right now pete buttigieg is leading in iowa elizabeth warren is leading in new hampshire and joe biden is leading in nevada in south carolina and nationally time is on the side of those leading candidates everybody else should have been making an argument against one of them but attacks on any of them were few and far between judging from the anodyne tone and relatively few direct confrontations between candidates everyone must be pretty happy with where they are right now congratulations biden warren and buttigieg you walked onto that stage in good shape and you re walking off in good shape jim geraghty national review mayor pete was the big winner of the debate even on defense nobody managed to ding him throughout the campaign so far every time a candidate has started gaining on joe biden they ve faced a barrage of attacks meant to stop their momentum the question of the night was whether lovable mayor pete could survive a knife fight with seasoned political warriors he did the socialists warren and sanders were an afterthought harris was impassioned but ineffective look for this to be a continuing theme they lost this debate badly because their messages don t appeal beyond park slope and the bay area this debate pointed to a biden vs buttigieg primary the more extreme candidates are falling back the democrats who want to be the adults in the room are winning and that is good news for the democratic party david marcus new york post elizabeth warren is exactly right that the nation has a housing deficiency too bad she absurdly asserted it s because the government wasn t doing enough from the suburbs of san francisco and los angeles to the heart of manhattan democratic city and state regulations have hindered housing development to disastrous proportions zoning initiatives on the west coast for single family homes have exacerbated commute times and homelessness and rent control pushes have failed to ameliorate rising housing costs in the east there s no question that redlining laws within our grandparent s lifetimes discriminated against people of color in abhorrent ways but the housing crises faced by recent immigrants from the southern border and fleeing suburbanites in blue metropolitan areas across the country haven t come from the laws of decades past they re products of economic hogwash enforced to this very day illustrated by a 29 increase in regulatory costs from 2011 to 2016 and reflected in a halting rate of housing development the problem runs so deep that the council of economic advisors found relaxing california zoning laws would collapse rent prices by more than half in the bay and nearly as much in los angeles tiana lowe washington examiner finally there are good arguments against president trump s foreign policy north korea for example retains its nuclear weapons program and is moving towards a resumption of long range missile tests china continues to consolidate its control over the pacific rim iran is readying a nuclear breakout vladimir putin is heartened by the partisan impeachment battles over ukraine these are issues that the 2020 democratic presidential hopefuls should jump on to offer serious alternatives but they didn t instead democrats on wednesday offered a mix of platitudes and weakness take the responses to a question from andrea mitchell as to whether they would ostracize saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman over his murder of journalist jamal khashoggi joe biden said little amy kloubachar paused and said we need a new foreign policy and cory booker said the values of freedom and democracy are what we are going to lead with wow thanks cory that profound line will really scare our enemies none of this is a recipe for american leadership or
