pete buttigieg made a campaign stop in miami last week speakingin a city defined by immigration in a county where a majority of residents are foreign born the south bend indiana mayor and democratic presidential candidate briefly spoke about providinga pathway to citizenship for the nation s 11 million undocumented immigrants and stressed the need to reshape the federal government s treatment of migrants seeking refuge in the usa the last time i was in church i was hearing scripture about taking care of the least among usand defending the poorand welcoming the stranger which is another word for immigrant he said after a couple of minutes buttigieg pivoted away from the topic shifting to gun control climate changeand the need to eliminate the electoral college in doing so he joined other top democratic candidates in largely avoiding the controversial topic of immigration in the early stages of the 2020 campaign most democratic candidates have decried the most extreme aspects of president donald trump s immigration strategy blasting his family separation policy vowing to reverse his decision to end protections for daca deferred action for childhood arrival recipientsand lamenting the images of kids in cages but they havelargely shied away from explaining how they woulddeal with the record setting surge of central american families seeking asylum secure the southern border oroverhaul a 50 year old legal immigration system that s in dire need of an update that strategy runsthe risk of allowingtrumpto define the immigration debate with his accusations that democrats support open borders and migratory lawlessness of the 24declared democratic candidates nine have some kind of immigration proposal posted on their campaign website sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts whose i have a plan for that slogan has defined her campaign does not have an immigration plan on her website sen michael bennetof colorado who was part of the gang of eight group of senators that passed a comprehensive immigration plan in 2013 dedicates just nine words to immigration on his website michael will work to fix our broken immigration system joe biden who led president barack obama s efforts to improve living conditions in the central american countries where most migrants are comingfrom barely mentions that work in the one paragraph immigration section on his website sen kamala harris of california who has tackled immigration detentionand other difficult immigration issues makes no mention of immigration on her website only three candidates have released full immigration proposals two of them former department of housing and urban development secretaryjuli n castroand author marianne williamson barely crackthe top 10 in polls the third is beto o rourke the texan who is polling higher but released hisplan only wednesday thelack of clearly articulated immigration proposals from the front runners worries many democratic operatives including simon rosenberg who has worked the issue since his time on president bill clinton s 1996 campaign through his role as a senior adviser to the 2018 democratic congressional campaign committee trump has told the country that this is one of the most important issues facing the nation if the president says that to not have a coherent strong and developed view on it is dangerous said rosenberg president of ndn a washington based liberal think tank the greatest danger for democrats on the immigration issue is to duck others said there s not much for democrats to gain by diving into thorny questions of immigration enforcement border securityand guest worker visas pushed by trump s constant twitteroutbursts and speeches about the dangers of immigration the issue consistently ranks as the top or among the top issues for republican voters not so for democrats who usually rate health care gun control and climate change far higher on their list of concerns according to a poll in october conducted by the pew research center illegal immigration was deemed the biggest problem facing the nation by republicansand the 18th biggest problem by democrats does thatmean democratic candidates are uninterested or it s too controversial or it s unimportant no it means that other issues are priorities in a democratic primary said frank sharry executive director of america s voice a group that advocates for immigrants in the usa who has advised several democratic candidates on their emerging immigration proposals democrats will have to findanswers soon at least fourcandidates will participate ina presidential forum in pasadena california on fridayhosted by immigration advocacy groups in june all the top candidates presumably will be asked about immigration during the first democratic presidential debates in miami that will be co hosted by the spanish language network telemundo that according to tom jawetz of the liberal center for american progress will be when candidates startdigging deeper into immigration and forming what will become the party platform on the issue for now he said it s important that democrats continue telling voters how shameful trump s immigration track record has been as the president forges ahead with his own interpretation of the immigration landscape jawetz said democrats will have to flesh outtheir own plans one thing we found through polling is that trump does more damage to his support when he talks than we can when we open our mouths he said but i don t think that s sustainable we re going to have an increasingly loud conversation over the next 17 months on the issue people can t afford to be silent about it
