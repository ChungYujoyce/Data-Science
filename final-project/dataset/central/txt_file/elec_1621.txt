archive hide caption jimmy carter holds up an early edition of the milwaukee sentinel which declared rep morris udall winner of the 1976 democratic primary late returns gave the state to carter tomorrow wisconsin s primary is poised to do something it has not done in more than 30 years it is about to deal a blow to a presidential front runner still more amazing is the fact the state s primary voters are expected to throw some shade on both the democratic and republican front runners an unimaginable result in the long era since world war ii for six decades wisconsin has been anything but the field of dreams for long shots and outsiders wisconsinites have voted roughly halfway through the primary calendar and they have almost always endorsed the candidates who were already winning among republicans think mitt romney and john mccain and both of the presidents named george bush plus bob dole ronald reagan gerald ford richard nixon three times and dwight eisenhower adding the democrats you have barack obama john kerry al gore bill clinton and michael dukakis not to mention john f kennedy in fact wisconsin has been fine with the front runner in both parties in every cycle since 1988 setting aside one deviation on the democratic side in 1984 and the favorite son candidates who won on both sides in 1964 wisconsin primary voters have fallen in line with the eventual nominees consistently since 1956 long before most americans alive today were even born front runner hopes may be dashed this year however things suddenly look different while donald trump and hillary clinton were ahead in the polls in wisconsin as recently as early march both have slid steadily downward since clinton has fallen behind rival bernie sanders by several percentage points while trump now trails ted cruz by double digits these trends are clear in the state s best known and most reliable poll done by marquette university law school they are also corroborated in the latest polling by the fox business channel and by cbs news the polls could be wrong of course but they do also comport with field reports and other signals from the ground wisconsin is cruzing and feeling the bern wins in wisconsin should provide a major boost for both cruz and sanders who can soar on the thermal updraft for two weeks before the next voting takes place just how much momentum they gain in their still steep climbs toward their party nominations will depend on the margins of their victories and on the media treatment those results receive in new york which votes on april 19 both trump and clinton have maintained a kind of home court advantage in new york despite their ups and downs around the country given the trend in wisconsin wins for cruz and sanders will not have that element of surprise that supercharged them in iowa for cruz and michigan for sanders but winning big will contribute to the psychology now buoying both these long shot candidates and their legions of true believers winning margins in double digits tomorrow would constitute winning big so would a super share of delegates for cruz republican rules allow him 18 delegates for the statewide win and another three for each congressional district he carries that makes it possible if not likely that cruz could take home all 42 of the wisconsin delegates there are several reasons for the cruz and sanders surge in this midwestern purple state a long history of confounding candidates wisconsin also has a contrarian streak that has produced surprises in the past while the primary has nearly always been won by the eventual nominee badger voters have also managed to send a message now and then that shook things up in 2004 john kerry solidified his grip on the democratic nomination in wisconsin s primary but his 39 percent share of the multi candidate vote barely edged john edwards 34 percent edwards said kerry should realize that objects in the rearview mirror are closer than they appear kerry subsequently chose edwards as his running mate forty years earlier in 1964 one third of the state s democratic primary vote went to alabama gov george wallace the segregationist who mounted a challenge to president lyndon johnson in protest of the civil rights bill then making its way through congress wallace ran again in the wisconsin democratic primary in 1972 receiving 22 percent of the vote to george mcgovern s winning 29 percent perhaps the two wisconsin primaries that produced the most intense media attention in the past half century took place in 1960 and 1976 the first contest matched neighboring minnesota s democratic sen hubert humphrey against the young upstart from massachusetts john kennedy the latter won decisively shifting the momentum of that year s nomination fight in 1976 liberal champion morris udall was a congressman from arizona and a mormon he thought he had won the wisconsin democratic party s nod when most people went to bed on primary night but overnight that result was reversed and in the morning georgian jimmy carter was flashing his trademark smile under a copy of the milwaukee sentinel that erroneously reported udall as the winner in a front page banner headline udall dropped out shortly thereafter leaving carter to march on to the nomination and the white house but wisconsin has not always been such a bellwether from 1912 until 1956 wisconsin republicans favored someone other than their party s eventual nominee for several cycles the state party preferred its own robert fighting bob la follette a founder and favorite of progressive republicanism even after la follette was gone the state s gop went for midwesterners such as harold stassen or hard line conservatives such as retired gen douglas macarthur whose family had roots in the state or ohio sen robert taft in 1952 the wisconsin gop preferred taft to dwight d eisenhower after ike won the nomination and the presidency that year he was able to win the wisconsin primary in 1956 the first eventual nominee of his party to do so the badger state s reputation is steeped in politics at the edge the visionary progressive la follette was a demigod on the left while the amazingly charismatic anti communist joseph r mccarthy was and is an icon on the right but in practical terms most of wisconsin s governors and senators have tended to be closer to the mainstream of their respective parties while the state is known for ideological partisanship two democrats william proxmire and herbert kohl held one of its two u s senate seats for more than half a century 1957 2012 while functioning as self defined independents it is this independent element of wisconsin s complex political identity that has informed the results of its quadrennial presidential primary as the state does not register voters by party it has always been part of the local tradition to hold an open primary for president voters can sign in on primary day take a blank ballot for each party fill one out and discard the other the clerk in the precinct never knows which ballot each voter has actually used given this tradition and the state s mid position on the calendar wisconsin has nearly always served as the confirmation of the front runner s inevitability the only cycle after 1952 when wisconsin did not presage the gop nominee was 1964 when the state party chairman got a popular congressman to run as a favorite son and then persuaded both of the party s leading national candidates barry goldwater and nelson rockefeller to stay out of the state for the sake of unity both did that was needless to say a different era npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
