coronavirus lockdowns abroad are raising questions about the upper limits of government power as health officials in the u s and around the world scramble to slow the spread of infection the u s public health toolbox contains a host of potential measures ranging from gentle prodding over hand washing to more severe actions like prohibitions on large gatherings and even sharp restrictions on the movement of infected individuals in the u s quarantine is the most extreme use of government power over people who have committed no crime said polly price a professor of law and global health at emory university currently no government in the u s federal state or local has proposed anything resembling the kind of large scale quarantine put in place in parts of china s hubei province the epicenter of the outbreak but as an increasing number of american jurisdictions declare a state of emergency and officials consider more serious responses legal experts note that tighter restrictions will face even higher constitutional hurdles in times of emergency including public health emergency the temptation to violate individual rights is at its greatest and the courts have often been called on to defend the rights of the vulnerable said harvard law professor glenn cohen more than 118 000 coronavirus cases and more than 4 200 deaths have been confirmed worldwide according to data compiled by johns hopkins university the united states has seen more than 800 cases and at least 28 deaths since tracking began in late january state officials in new york which has the highest number of active cases 173 announced on tuesday that they would deploy the national guard and create a containment zone around the city of new rochelle in westchester county as the coronavirus spreads under the plan the national guard will deliver food to homes and help with the cleaning of public spaces in the containment zone meanwhile schools and other large gathering facilities within the zone such as community centers and houses of worship will be closed the move followed a declaration by gov andrew cuomo d on saturday that new york was under a state of emergency to date at least 10 states have declared a state of emergency due to concerns over coronavirus top u s health officials have tried to soothe public anxieties while also preparing the country for more robust government intervention during an interview on sunday dr anthony fauci the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases sought to manage public expectations while cautioning that anything s possible i don t think it would be as draconian as nobody in or nobody out fauci told fox news responding to a question about the possibility of widespread quarantines but if we continue to get cases like this particularly at the community level there will be what we call mitigation where we have to essentially do social distancing keep people out of crowded places take a look at seriousness do you really need to travel and i think it s particularly important among the most vulnerable you know you don t want to alarm people but given the spread we ve seen you know anything s possible he added and that s the reason why we ve got to be prepared to take whatever action is appropriate to contain and mitigate the outbreak federal law authorizes the u s government to put in place quarantines to block diseases from crossing national and state borders though most of its public health power comes from the constitution when confronted with legal challenges to public health measures american courts have generally tried to strike a balance between the government s authority to protect the population and an individual s rights one consistent thread running throughout the court decisions is that the government is on stronger legal footing when it narrowly tailors its actions and minimizes their restrictiveness the government s actions such as trying to force people into isolation or impose quarantine would be more likely found constitutional if it focuses on isolating individuals or groups who have tested positive or which it has good reason to suspect are exposed to coronavirus said cohen the less individualized that determination the more constitutionally questionable especially if it is done without good reason linking the members of that group individually to exposure or risk he added the courts have previously recognized government authority to quarantine prevent travel require vaccinations and make people submit to medical exams according to price still defining the scope of public health authority continues to be a work in progress she said the relatively small number of cases on the books many of which were decided long ago makes it difficult to nail down the precise scope of government public health power perhaps the most famous supreme court case jacobson v massachusetts dates back to 1905 and deals with the constitutionality of requiring a smallpox vaccination major legal decisions about quarantines which have mostly been decided by state supreme courts are also quite dated because the courts have dealt with these questions so infrequently and the key cases are so long ago it is quite hard to predict the exact limit of the power of the federal or state governments in this area cohen said according to scott burris a law professor at temple university the limits on government power have less to do with the type of action than with the necessity for the measure courts are generally reluctant to interfere with emergency measures he said so prediction is difficult michelle mello a professor of law and medicine at stanford university said that as long as federal and state governments can satisfy stringent judicial scrutiny they have broad emergency powers to do pretty much whatever is necessary but mello and other experts noted that a maximalist approach is not always needed or even the most effective means of combating the spread of infection in cases where people have only incidental contact with someone believed to be infected mello said public health officials will likely continue to encourage voluntary self isolation rather than mandatory orders as president trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more and lawmakers negotiate over an economic package to counter the outbreak more government support in the form of paid sick leave distance learning opportunities and defrayed health care costs could encourage public buy in it s better for everyone when we rely on cooperation and trust rather than command and control mello said view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the contents of this site are 2020 capitol hill
