washington after president donald trump made a direct request to sen lindsey graham to call former president barack obama to testify in hearings about the origins of the russia investigation and the handling of michael flynn s case graham expressed doubtabout the idea i am greatly concerned about the precedent that would be set by calling a former president for oversight grahamsaid in a statement released today by the senate judiciary committee which he chairs the south carolina republican said that the committee would hold hearings on the origins of therussian election interference probe beginning in early june including on the fbi s investigation offlynn trump s former national security adviser trump tweeted earlier in the day that obama should be the first person called in hearings he hasrepeatedly accused the former president of unjustly targetinghis associates in what he calls obamagate without specifying what crime he thinks obama committed if i were a senator or congressman the first person i would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the usa by far is former president obama he knew everything trump said do it lindseygrahamsc just do it no more mr nice guy no more talk total exoneration trump says new fbi notes exonerate michael flynn analysts say that s not the case but graham raised issues about the separation of powers and executive privilege adding he is concerned about the precedent to call a former sitting president before the committee i don t think now s the time for me to do that i don t know if that s even possible i have grave concerns about the role of executive privilege and all kinds of issues graham told politicoin an interview on thursday i understand president trump s frustration but be careful what you wish for just be careful what you wish for flynn pleaded guilty twice to lying to the fbi in an interview about his communications with a russian ambassador and agreed to cooperate with former special counsel robert mueller s russia probe the justice department announced last week it intended todropits case against the retired army general justice department officials said the fbi s january 2017 interview was unjustified making flynn s statements irrelevant even if true flynn and his new defense team sought to withdraw his guilty plea and have accused the fbi of entrapping him into making false statements a claim the judge on the case has dismissed u s district judge emmet sullivan still has to decide on the request to drop charges more retired judge to examine if michael flynn should be held in contempt challenge doj s bid to drop case graham said thursday the first phase of judiciary committee hearings would focus on the government s decision to dismiss the flynn case as well as an in depth analysis of the unmasking requests made by obama administration officials against general flynn foreign intelligence reports routinely concealthe identities of americans when they show up during the legal surveillance of foreign entities but certain officials can request the identity be unmasked if their purpose meets a need to know standard earlier this week acting director of national intelligence richard grenell declassified a list of obama administration officials who requested for the unmasking offlynn s identity when it was picked up in a foreign intelligence report the list was given to the justice department and republican senators later released it to the public the individuals named may have received flynn s identity but the documentdeclassified by grenell does not confirm they saw the information it says declassified former vice president joe biden among obama officials who sought to unmask michael flynn each individual was an authorized recipient of the original report and the unmasking was approved through the national security agency s standard process which includes a review of the justification for the request the document reads trump allies have seized on the document s release as evidence the obama administration targeted flynn butintelligence experts have said the process of unmasking is fairly routine and there is no indication it was used illegally in this case the associated press reported thousands of u s identities have been unmasked during trump s administration according to a report from the office of the director of national intelligence from last month graham said in his statement that no president is above the law but recognized executive privilege issues that would arise by calling a former president to testify to say we are living in unusual times is an understatement graham said we have the sitting president trump accusing the former president obama of being part of a treasonous conspiracy to undermine his presidency we have the former president suggesting the current president is destroying the rule of law by dismissing the general flynn case all of this is occurring during a major pandemic as to the judiciary committee both presidents are welcome to come before the committee and share their concerns about each other if nothing else it would make for great television however i have great doubts about whether it would be wise for the country graham said
