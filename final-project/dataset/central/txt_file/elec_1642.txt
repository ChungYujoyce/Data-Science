man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more is not the only voice sounding the alarm over conflicts of interest surrounding hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more s namesake nonprofit government watchdog groups all of them champions of heightened transparency campaign finance reform and other democratic priorities are also warning of potentially very serious conflicts of interest if the clinton foundation continues as business as usual with clinton in the white house the transparency advocates are not calling for the foundation to shut its doors as trump has done from the campaign trail but they are urging the adoption of tough new firewalls to eliminate any perception that clinton foundation donors could use their wallets to gain undue access to a hillary clinton white house the clinton foundation has posed a very serious conflict of interest for the entire time that it s existed craig holman government affairs lobbyist at public citizen saidthursday the conflicts of interest are very real and that gives trump some ammunition to throw at it and we re going to hear about it until the campaign ends holman said clinton s recent vow to bar all foreign and corporate donations to the clinton foundation if she wins the presidency is a big big step in the right direction but he quickly added that alone is not enough to eliminate the pay to play perceptions now dogging the clinton campaign following revelations that top state department aides acted on the foundation s behalf when clinton headed the agency to do that he said the clintons will have to snip all family ties to the foundation including the removal of chelsea clinton from the group s board a step the clinton team said it s not ready to take chelsea clinton s role on the board will only perpetuate the pay to play perceptions and accusations the watchdogs said as long as the clinton foundation is tied to the family holman said very wealthy people and special interests will try to find a way to throw money at the feet of the clinton family and if chelsea clinton remains on the board especially if she retains a fundraising roll she would be the avenue if she really wants to get out from under the cloud she should sever ties completely with the foundation holman said larry noble general counsel at the campaign legal center agreed he warned that the state department saga even with no direct evidence that donors were given special access has created a very serious perception problem that threatens to undermine the public s faith in the government and its institutions barring foreign and corporate donations to the clinton foundation is a start he said but that alone won t counteract appearances that the game is rigged you d still have large individual donations that could raise a question noble saidthursday he emphasized that the clinton foundation debate is illustrative of a larger systemic problem surrounding money in politics a system in which even the appearance that wealthy donors have special influence stirs distrust in the public s mind regardless of how well founded a meeting is the suspicion is always going to be there is some connection to the donor s largess noble said in the case of the clinton foundation noble said he wants more separation from the potential president i d want to know what other safeguards they re going to have to ensure the foundation is not being used as a conduit to get access to the white house he said to do that the clintons must sever all connections and not have any contact with the foundation i think the foundation can still exist he said but there are going to have to be a lot of safeguards there the clinton foundation has long been dogged by conflict of interest charges but those accusations crescendoed this week after the associated press reported that an outsized number of people outside the government who gained access to clinton when she was state secretary were donors to the foundation either personally or through companies or groups trump has pounced taking every opportunity to highlight the imbroglio as part of his ongoing message that crooked hillary is simply too dishonest to merit the presidency she wants to sell out american security to the clinton foundation for a big fat pile of cash the gop nominee saidwednesdayduring a stump speech in jackson miss it s
