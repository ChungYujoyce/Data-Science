hampshire but ted cruz is not easing up it s one sign of how presidential campaigns are changing loading january 20 2016 ted cruz has got religion and he s not shy about it in every stump speech the freshman senator asks voters to pray he quotes from scripture and speaks of judeo christian values he talks about persecuted christians in the middle east and he tells the story of his father rafael cruz a cuban refugee and evangelical preacher who is a regular on the presidential campaign trail senator cruz a southern baptist from texas may seem out of place in the snows of new hampshire the second least church going state in the country but he is unabashed lift this country up in prayer cruz tells the crowd gathered in a hilltop lodge in washington n h speaking in the cadence of a preacher say father god please continue this continue this revival across this country that we can pull back from this abyss in the past a candidate like cruz might have held back on the religious rhetoric in an effort to widen his appeal in new hampshire s first in the nation primary but times have changed campaign messaging has become a national enterprise with the growth of the internet and cable television while many candidates are talking about their faith openly on the campaign trail cruz is going furthest and his respectable showing in new hampshire polls suggests that his style can win converts even among those who don t share his religious fervor he was still talking to iowa caucus goers while he was campaigning in new hampshire says fergus cullen former chairman of the new hampshire republican party there was a time when candidates could run one set of ads in iowa and no one in new hampshire would see them now you tune in to msnbc and you see what they re saying in west des moines iowa and folks in iowa see what they re saying in hanover n h victory in iowa home to the kickoff feb 1 caucuses is almost essential for cruz to have a shot at the republican nomination with less than two weeks to go he and national front runner donald trump are locked in a dead heat there in new hampshire cruz faces much lower expectations but he has to make a decent showing to keep the momentum going by doing a multiday bus tour through the granite state his first extensive visit here in two months cruz keeps his supporters and volunteers energized and his faith toned message has not made him an also ran here he s currently in a statistical dead heat for third with sen marco rubio of florida polling at 11 3 percent according to the realclearpolitics average of major polls he is not the only republican candidate to carry his faith outside evangelical iowa and the south senator rubio has also been wooing religious voters aggressively the senator who is roman catholic but also attends a southern baptist church recently released a television ad all about faith that struck political observers as unusually pointed in the past successful gop candidates including ronald reagan and george w bush have tended to be more circumspect in public about their religious beliefs ohio gov john kasich a devout episcopalian is another candidate who makes faith references a regular part of his pitch but his appeal in new hampshire where he is now polling in second place is seen as centered on his pragmatic approach to governing including expansion of medicaid in his home state under the affordable care act then there s mr trump a mainstream presbyterian whose strength among evangelicals nationally has baffled some observers given his three marriages profane language and seemingly casual knowledge of the bible but just as god talk doesn t always turn off non churchgoers it is not the only way to win the faithful either many trump supporters including the religious value his business success forceful personality and status as a nonpolitician above all else some say god will guide him to be a successful president the conservative evangelical vote for example is currently divided into three camps cruz trump and rubio according to thomas kidd a history professor at baylor university in waco texas cruz represents the jerry falwell wing referencing the late head of the moral majority trump the jimmy swaggart wing referencing the once popular health and wealth televangelist and rubio the billy graham wing writes professor kidd in the washington post kidd notes that he is a member of rubio s newly announced religious freedom advisory board mark kauzlarich reuters republican presidential candidate ted cruz speaks with james dobson r an evangelical christian author at a town hall in winterset iowa on jan 4 but cruz s faith message is seen as key to his appeal that message has been reinforced by a cruz super political action committee that just launched a website highlighting his religious story to some observers like new york times columnist david brooks cruz s apocalyptic rhetoric seems out of joint with christian traditions offering no hint of compassion gentleness and mercy in a gop primary that has become a contest to see who could be the most anti immigrant a little compassion for the stranger is in order kidd added but he said he sees no reason to question the sincerity of cruz s faith indeed to many voters cruz s message fits the times given the threat of islamic state a dysfunctional immigration system and economic uncertainty over and over at his events in new hampshire this week voters said they liked his assertive no compromise style and were not put off by his religion filled appeals he s the strongest conservative and he knows how to articulate that says david an electrician from derry n h who declined to give his last name he s not intimidated mary sprenkle a retired defense contractor worker from stoddard n h says she s leaning toward cruz because he s the most conservative in the race and a strong supporter of the constitution gun rights are important to her and to many in new hampshire a rural hunting state with a strong libertarian streak for attendees at his events cruz s talk about god is also an invitation to open up about matters of faith the yankee tendency toward reserve notwithstanding may i call you brother asks a man named phil in prefacing his question to cruz about how he would select a running mate i believe you re saved and have accepted jesus as your savior thank you brother cruz replies don t be embarrassed about your faith another questioner asks cruz about restoring the ten commandments to public schools that gives cruz an opening to talk about his 2005 victory in the united states supreme court as solicitor general of texas that allowed a monument with the ten commandments to remain on government property outside the state capitol and if hillary clinton wins the election cruz warns the nation will wind up with a five justice radical leftist majority on the supreme court we are inches away from chisels coming out to take off the crosses and stars of david on the tombstones of our soldiers he adds after the event in the lodge voters line up to talk to cruz one woman mandy pe a from walpole n h stands with five of her nine children and describes herself as a christian i ve been with cruz pretty much from the beginning because he s a constitutionalist she says at the end of the line stands a man clutching a bible and wearing a cruz sticker why cruz he is
