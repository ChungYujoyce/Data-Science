 ken rudin the nation celebrates its 236th year of independence this week a holiday that reminds us of the freedoms america s early patriots fought for and which we continue to enjoy to this day if this were truly a widespread sentiment wouldn t there be more people calling for a third party candidate ken rudin collection hide caption but there is no indication at all certainly not in this year s presidential race of any signs of voter independence from the two major parties of course it s rare for any independent or third party candidate to make a difference in the battle for the white house you have to have a recognizable name a ton of money and a cause worth campaigning on and even then it may not be enough ross perot had all three when he ran as an independent in 1992 he also attracted some 19 7 million votes more than any non major party candidate in history and how close did he get to attaining the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency he was 270 votes shy for a brief history of recent third party presidential candidates see mad at the democrats and republicans don t count on a third party political junkie sept 19 2011 this year a different approach was made this time an organization provided not a candidate but a mechanism for one to get on the ballot americans elect raised millions of dollars and already attained ballot access in 28 states on its way to all 50 states plus d c asking supporters to draft a candidate online the problem no big name came forward to run and the leading online candidate gop dropout buddy roemer failed to get the 10 000 signatures that americans elect demanded the organization and its effort folded in may while many third parties appear on the november ballots some states have tougher ballot access laws than others check out richard winger s ballot access news for the most reliable updates one party that gets a lot of headlines and ink in the months leading up to the election has historically been the libertarians as they regularly appear on every state ballot this year their nominee is gary johnson the former republican governor of new mexico who tried but failed to make a difference in this year s gop contest perhaps it s more of a democratic fantasy than anything else but some insist that johnson could pull enough votes in some states to harm mitt romney s chances the libertarians are considered the nation s most viable third party but they have surpassed 1 percent of the vote only once in 10 tries for the presidency ken rudin collection hide caption the libertarians are considered the nation s most viable third party but they have surpassed 1 percent of the vote only once in 10 tries for the presidency the truth is libertarian presidential candidates going back to their first bid in 1972 have yet to make a difference here s how they ve done 1972 john hospers director of usc school of philosophy total votes nationwide 3 673 less than 0 1 percent received one electoral vote

house member charlie rangel d n y and veteran sen orrin hatch r utah hatch survived to fight another day the verdict is still out on rangel who as of this writing leads his main challenger state sen adriano espaillat by just 802 votes with some 2 000 absentees yet to be counted this one may not be over yet but one result i never saw coming was the defeat of rep john sullivan in oklahoma s 1st cd gop primary sullivan s troubles in public life pre date his tenure in congress which began in january 2002 when he won a special election to succeed steve largent who resigned to focus on his gubernatorial bid voters knew of sullivan s history of drinking related arrests even before he upset then oklahoma first lady cathy keating in the primary but his drinking continued while in office and in june of 2009 he took a month long leave of absence to check himself into the betty ford clinic his victorious primary opponent this year navy reserve pilot and political newcomer jim bridenstine focused not on his addictions but his attendance record saying sullivan missed too many votes with the backing of tea party supporters he also charged sullivan as insufficiently conservative by most accounts sullivan failed to take bridenstine seriously until late in the campaign and then he responded with nonstop negative attacks sullivan is the eighth house member defeated in this year s primaries but only the fourth who lost to a non incumbent opponent the other seven names in italics indicate defeated in member vs member primary jason altmire d pa tim holden d pa dennis kucinich d oh don manzullo r il silvestre reyes d tx steve rothman d nj and jean schmidt r oh another house member bob turner r ny whose district was obliterated ran and lost in his party s senate primary the contempt vote on holder last thursday june 28 the house voted to hold attorney general eric holder in contempt for failing to share requested information relating to the botched fast and furious operation the action came just hours after president obama invoked executive privilege to block the house s request for internal justice department documents the vote was 255 67 many democrats accusing the gop of a partisan witch hunt walked out of the house chamber without casting a vote but 17 democrats did vote with the republicans to hold the ag in contempt jason altmire pa

mn nick rahall wv dennis ross ar and tim walz mn some of the names on this list were not a surprise a few are retiring altmire lost his bid for another term in the primary losing to critz in fact but i was surprised by a few of these votes notably those of boswell critz donnelly hochul and owens one reason may be that the national rifle association had announced that this vote would be a key one on the nra scorecard two republicans steve latourette of ohio and scott rigell of virginia voted against the measure political updates i post periodic political updates during the week on twitter you can follow me at kenrudin here are some questions from the mailbox q throughout the primary process i ve seen the option for uncommitted or no preference on ballots if these options were to get the most votes in state what would happen has uncommitted no preference ever won anywhere joshua holman havelock n c a when people talk about the sudden rise of jimmy carter in 1976 they often refer to his victory in the iowa caucuses the thing is he didn t quite win while carter finished better than any other democratic candidate that year the precinct caucuses were in fact won by an uncommitted slate which got 37 percent of the vote carter received 28 percent followed by birch bayh with 13 percent and fred harris with 10 percent but all that meant was that an uncommitted slate went into the next round the county conventions and those uncommitted folks had the option of staying uncommitted or aligning with a particular candidate by the time the process reaches the state convention most of the candidates who were active during the first go round are long gone similarly uncommitted also won the 1972 iowa precinct caucuses finishing slightly better than frontrunner ed muskie both slates ended up with about 36 percent george mcgovern was well behind with 23 percent but his showing was seen as a big boost in his unlikely path to the nomination president bill clinton essentially ran unopposed in the 1996 democratic primaries but for reasons i can t recall neither he nor anyone else was on the michigan primary ballot that year which was won by uncommitted but clinton won all 92 delegates at the convention nevada has a none of the names shown option on its ballots and sometimes that choice has finished strong in 1980 its democratic primary was won by president jimmy carter with 37 6 percent it was followed by none of the names shown with 33 6 percent and then edward kennedy with 28 8 percent at the democratic convention that year nevada s 12 delegates were roughly divided as eight for carter and four for kennedy but it s one thing for uncommitted or none of the above to do well in primaries and caucuses it would be far more interesting if that option performed well or even won in november but that hasn t happened yet q do you know where i can find the roll call vote on the censure of joe mccarthy different sources have given different results one had it 67 20 another at 67 22 one had milliken of colo voting yes while another rightwing list of the 22 heroes who voted no included him as one along with cordon of ore but another source said cordon didn t vote jeff rundell seattle wash a on dec 2 1954 the senate in a lame duck session voted to condemn mccarthy the aggressive often reckless anti communist warrior from wisconsin by a vote of 67 22 the day before the senate voted 67 20 to approve the language of the subcommittee on privileges and elections that mccarthy abused the committee s staff there was also another vote by a 64 24 margin focused on a second count but the final vote on mccarthy by the senate which decided to replace the word censure with condemn was 67 22 both milliken and cordon stuck with mccarthy the gop vote was split 22 22 here were the 22 republicans who supported mccarthy and voted no goldwater ariz knowland calif kuchel calif milliken colo purtell conn dworshak idaho welker idaho dirksen ill jenner ind

his wisconsin colleague didn t announce a vote every democrat voted yes or announced in favor of the resolution except for john kennedy of mass kennedy whose father was a strong mccarthy supporter underwent spinal surgery on oct 21 and did not announce a position on the resolution q i recently listened to your may 18th episode of the podcast and was amused that you celebrated your 300th with a cake in the shape of arizona and specifically referenced yuma certainly arizona is in the news often enough for the wrong reasons but i was wondering if there was something specific that inspired your arizona shaped cake marilee malmberg grassroots director arizona democratic party phoenix ariz a for far too many of our podcast episodes whenever my partner in crime ron elving would mention arizona or we would be talking about arizona i would invariably reply with that s great because i have a sense of yuma yes i know i know the joke is not funny but that never kept me from saying it over and over and over that explains the cake and now you know everything q i have a button that says i like judge sutton and rice pudding too can you tell me the history story allen johnston franklin tenn a this question actually came up once before believe it or not back in the nov 1 2005 political junkie column i m not kidding click here to read it as it so happens the question arrived back when harriet miers was a potential choice of president bush for the supreme court my answer back then was so clever that it s worth repeating a to the best of my understanding miers left no paper trail about her views on rice pudding maybe that s why conservatives deserted her i m not pudding you on i really want to know the story behind the judge sutton button as well as these other unidentified items actually i ve since learned the vote the american way berry whipple ringle etc is from jersey city n j in the 1950s bernard berry was the mayor and lawrence whipple and joshua ringle were city commissioners ken rudin collection hide caption well maybe not as funny as i thought in any event i m thinking of illustrating some unknown campaign buttons as a kind of regular feature in political junkie i ll put em up you tell me who they are and if you can identify any of them you get your name in this column it sure beats winning a non existent t shirt disappearing act well there were these
