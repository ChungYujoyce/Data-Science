loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more the fallout from the daily releases have raised concerns among democrats that even if clinton is elected president the controversy will follow her into the white house the clinton campaign has refused to confirm the authenticity of the emails and has sought to cast doubt on them at every turn noting that the exchanges were stolen by russian hackers and could have been doctored they have sought to deflect attention from the contents of the emails by describing the hacks as an unprecedented interference in the u s election by foreign adversaries that threatens the nation s sovereignty and they have lashed out at the media for covering what they describe as trivial political minutia rather than the national security implications of the hacked emails none of it has been enough to staunch the daily flow of new emails published by wikileaks or the media s interest in the contents of the emails instead interest appears to be ramping up over the final two weeks before election day anyone with an internet connection can dig into the thousands of pages of emails which have revealed infighting among clinton s top advisers as well as new details about the millions of dollars flowing into the clinton s charitable foundation and personal bank accounts the campaign took another hiton

clinton launched her bid for the white house nope mook responded after1 a m that morning we brought up the existence of emails in reserach sic this summer but were told that everything was taken care of since then it has been a steady stream of embarrassing revelations that have begun to generate rumblings of concern among clinton s allies and have left democrats on edge about what might come next wikileaks founder julian assange claimed to have more than 50 000 emails from podesta s account when he began releasing them earlier this month 35 000 have been made public as ofthursday leaving 15 000 yet in reserve everybody just needs to fasten their seat belts and get ready for a really rocky landing said democratic strategist craig varoga the next 11 days are going to test everyone s mettle the infighting that has been exposed is expected but embarrassing nonetheless in one fierce string of exchanges podesta clashed with longtime clinton aide philippe reines the encounter ended with podesta and reines agreeing that the former should not be involved with the campaign in another clinton s aides expressed frustration with her refusal to apologize for her email set up and called her political instincts terrible and chelsea clinton pushed to have the family separate itself from band who responded by lashing out at her as a spoiled brat that development led to perhaps the most
