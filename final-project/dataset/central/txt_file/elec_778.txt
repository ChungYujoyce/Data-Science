thursday loading march 2 2016 mitt romney on thursday will give a major speech on his view of the 2016 presidential election according to a news release from his office the republican party s 2012 presidential nominee will be appearing at the hinckley institute of politics in salt lake city the announcement said the subject of his talk was the state of the race but gave no further details hmm major speech state of the race what s that mean is mr romney going to endorse marco rubio or less likely one of the other remaining gop hopefuls we d guess that s not the case if he were he d be appearing onstage with the endorsee wherever he is campaigning that wouldn t be in utah also his friends and aides are saying it s not that kind of speech close mittromney aide says he won t endorse or get in but tomorrow s speech will be worth covering tweeted nbc campaign reporter andrew rafferty hold it a second get in it s kind of late for that since the primaries are about half over yes romney tried to run again at the start of the 2016 cycle but he got elbowed out of the race by the juggernaut of the jeb bush campaign if you remember so maybe he s having second or third thoughts or hoping that other people think he might be having those thoughts even if he isn t is romney going to anti endorse donald trump this seems more likely romney is clearly unhappy with the rise of the donald whose demeanor is the opposite of his and whose rise could mean the end of the low tax small government corporate friendly gop that romney knows and presumably loves in recent weeks romney s been sniping at mr trump from the safety of social media and doing a decent job of it his style has been to pile on when trump is already getting pressure on certain stuff thus romney has urged trump to release his back tax returns he s pushed trump to make public off the record conversations with the new york times most notably he hit trump for the latter s slowness to disavow the endorsement of former kkk official david duke a disqualifying disgusting response by realdonaldtrump to the kkk romney tweeted on monday his coddling of repugnant bigotry is not in the character of america tough words also effective words since they roused trump to respond with a fairly predictable loser taunt romney hasn t fallen into the trap of exchanging adolescent jibes about body parts with trump as senator rubio has instead romney s hit him quick on political substance and then moved on that may change thursday it s even possible romney will join the nevertrump movement and say he d never vote for trump if he s the republican nominee would that matter well it won t derail trump who at this point is only a florida primary win away from wrapping up the gop presidential prize like so many republican establishment figures romney is coming to the anti trump battle too late with too little to make a difference get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox what it might do is give romney a little free media exposure at a time when the gop establishment may be mulling over its options if there s a revolt at a contentious convention whom can the establishment offer as a legitimate trump alternative if the old gop wants to split and field its own third party candidate who might that be unlike rubio or ted cruz romney s never lost to trump so romney may be implicitly offering himself as an alternative whatever his speech s specific words link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to the
