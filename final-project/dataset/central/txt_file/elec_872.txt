here s what we know democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton speedily left a sept 11 memorial service early on sunday video showed her stumbling her legs apparently buckling she required the support of multiple people to get into her vehicle later her campaign said she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on friday and would take a break from the campaign trail for a couple days as with everything concerning the clintons there are two entangled issues here the actual issue of clinton s health and the cloud of lies and misdirection that the clinton machine has sprayed into the air around the actual issue as my colleague damon linker points out the most charitable reading of the timeline given by the campaign clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia on friday two days before they made it public is that they fully intended to lie and this although doing so would require her to keep up a public schedule that might well make her condition worse and require ever more elaborate forms of concealment in this telling the clinton campaign knew full well that clinton had pneumonia and yet did everything to conceal it if that scary video of clinton being carried into her suv hadn t been made public you can be certain the clinton camp would have kept on lying about the incident indeed they were lying about it in the hours between her leaving the 9 11 memorial and the video being released a smiling clinton was sent outside to declare that she felt great and for gratuitous effect hug a small child even though she and her team knew she had a grave communicable disease only when the video became public did the campaign offer the pneumonia explanation clinton is hardly alone in her disregard for honesty both major parties have nominated pathological liars to the presidency and let s be clear hillary clinton and donald trump are not garden variety politicians who engage in the everyday sort of quasi lying that politics demands clinton and trump lie consistently and reflexively for trump it s often because he has such a flimsy and careless grasp of the truth for clinton lying is defensive and arrogant but here s the thing the media constantly points out trump s lies they do this far less frequently with clinton and have been particularly dismissive of conservatives asking questions about clinton s health take the canonical example of chris cillizza of the washington post s politics blog the fix who is perhaps the very model of a modern washington political journalist just five days before hillary s collapse cillizza wrote an indignant post titled can we just stop talking about hillary clinton s health now he pointed out that there was no hard evidence of clinton being ill true and that there was a lot of fever swamp conspiracy theorizing around hillary mentioning as must be required by law somewhere the vince foster conspiracy theory okay fair enough except for the monumentally important facts that hillary clinton is 68 years old and has a troubled history with the truth just because she says she s fine doesn t mean she s fine there were questions around ronald reagan s health because of his age there were questions around john mccain s health when he ran made doubly icky feeling due to the fact that the health questions were also raised by the consequences of his torture in vietnam but the public really did have a right to know about mccain s health journalists were right to ask questions there s a reason that it s become de rigueur for presidential nominees to release their health records the public has a right to know but all of a sudden it s absurd to ask questions about hillary s health after her collapse and diagnosis cillizza did dutifully concede that hillary clinton s health just became a real issue in the presidential campaign but her health should have been a real issue before too hillary clinton is old she has a decades long track record of hiding things from the public it is not illegitimate to ask questions about her health in fact it s the press job so why did so many journalists scoff at questions over hillary s health likening them to area 51 style conspiracy theories in many cases because many liberal members of the liberal media want hillary to win she s a member of the progressive left sadly it seems many members of the media just can t muster the kind of distance emotional and professional that is a necessary precondition to doing their job well it s time we did better the quiet intellectual push behind conservatives court coup what the bible really says about government vladimir putin s own goal trump says it s safe to reopen schools i don t believe him trump keeps falsely accusing joe scarborough of murder and it s long past weird officials ask reckless lake of the ozarks partygoers to self quarantine
