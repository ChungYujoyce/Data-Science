first two and a half months of 2020 and rightfully so it was bonkers but now that it s settled down it s time for us to check in once again on the other major political battle of 2020 the fight for the u s senate republicans started the cycle with the advantage but democrats have had reason for optimism of late new polls have shown democratic challengers ahead of gop incumbents the party is recruiting strong candidates and perhaps most importantly given the tight correlation between presidential and senate voting former vice president joe biden the democrat who has polled the best against president trump has become the party s likely presidential nominee the most likely outcome is still that republicans maintain control of the senate though perhaps with a reduced majority the status quo favors them and most of the states where the senate will be decided lean red as a refresher republicans currently have 53 senate seats to democrats 47 1 meaning democrats need to flip four seats on net to take control or three if they also win the vice presidency but democrats have expanded the map to the point where they have a lot more pick up opportunities than republicans do so they have a lot of upside competitive u s senate seats up for election in 2020 as rated by three major election handicappers rating is the race s median rating among the cook political report inside elections and sabato s crystal ball races with a median rating of solid d or solid r are excluded special election sources cook political report inside elections sabato s crystal ball the most competitive senate races remain unchanged from late last year there haven t been any significant developments in colorado or maine for example that have dislodged them from their too close to call status instead the biggest senate news of the last couple months came in the longer shot democratic pick up opportunity of montana where gov steve bullock s entry has shaken up the race bullock was considered to be the only democrat who could put this red state in play and his announcement caused nonpartisan handicappers to move the race from solid republican to lean republican according to morning consult bullock has a 21 net approval rating approval rating minus disapproval rating and at least 83 percent of montanans are able to form an opinion of him approval rating plus disapproval rating this gives him a leg up against incumbent republican sen steve daines who has just a 16 net approval rating and at least 78 percent name recognition according to the same poll indeed democratic pollster public policy polling put out a survey shortly after bullock entered the race that found bullock and daines deadlocked at 47 percent support however the poll was sponsored by liberal group end citizens united which has endorsed bullock so you should take it with a grain of salt the special election in georgia has also seen a flurry of new candidates after now sen kelly loeffler was appointed to the vacant seat instead of republican rep doug collins collins announced in late january that he would challenge her in november s jungle primary unlike a normal georgia election all candidates in the special election regardless of party will run on the same ballot in november then if no one gets a majority the top two finishers advance to a runoff but collins isn t the only one entering the fray democrat matt lieberman the son of former sen joe lieberman has been running since last year and fellow democrat raphael warnock the senior pastor at atlanta s historic ebenezer baptist church announced in late january that he would run the democratic senatorial campaign committee quickly endorsed warnock then in february former u s attorney ed tarver became the third prominent democrat to join the race with both the republican and democratic vote splintered among several candidates it now seems extremely likely that the race will advance to a runoff election in january and unfortunately for democrats there s a chance they get locked out of a runoff completely several early polls of the race granted only one of which was nonpartisan showed collins and loeffler finishing first and second in the jungle primary however if a democrat does make it through to the runoff he might find collins or loeffler to be a relatively soft target collins s hardline conservative views may make him a poor fit for an increasingly moderate state like georgia while loeffler has faced a firestorm of criticism since it was revealed she sold millions of dollars in stocks after she received a briefing on the dangers of the coronavirus 2 in fact one gop pollster has shown her losing ground in the last few weeks although as always we shouldn t read too much into just one poll meanwhile handicappers still rate arizona as a toss up but there s an increasingly strong argument that democrats are actually favored despite the state s republican lean five polls of arizona s u s senate race have been conducted so far in march and democrat mark kelly led republican sen martha mcsally in all five his average lead was 7 percentage points public polls of arizona s u s senate race conducted in march 2020 source polls of course contrarians need only recall the fate of former tallahassee florida mayor andrew gillum in 2018 he led almost every poll of the florida governor s race yet still went down to defeat even a small systematic polling error in arizona could mean that mcsally is actually ahead most of those kelly leads are within the margin of error however kelly also has the advantage of being a monster fundraiser he took in more than 20 2 million in 2019 mcsally raised only 12 6 million finally the first few senate battlegrounds have now held their primaries which means we have a clearer picture of who will face off in the fall in north carolina former state sen cal cunningham who had the support of the dscc won the democratic primary with 57 percent of the vote that sets up a close general election with republican sen thom tillis a survey by democratic firm public policy polling claims cunningham is ahead while tillis s pollster gave the incumbent the lead and in texas republican sen john cornyn s democratic opponent will be either dscc endorsed veteran mj hegar or state sen royce west after finishing first and second in the march 3 primary the two democrats will face off in a july 14 runoff that was delayed two months by the coronavirus pandemic this could be a problem for democrats as their eventual nominee will be forced to spend time and money on an extended intraparty fight rather than stockpiling enough cash to compete with cornyn in this very expensive state also on july 14 and also months later than originally scheduled democratic sen doug jones of alabama will find out if his republican opponent will be former auburn university football coach tommy tuberville or former u s attorney general jeff sessions tuberville and sessions finished neck and neck in the first round of the gop primary on march 3 but tuberville may have the advantage in the runoff he leads in multiple polls and trump still nursing a grudge against sessions for not protecting him from the mueller probe formally endorsed tuberville a couple weeks ago no matter who wins though things look dire for jones in a mason dixon poll from early february tuberville led the democrat by 8 percentage points and sessions led him by 13 points democrats best chance at holding onto this seat likely went out the window after former alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore whose profound flaws as a candidate allowed jones to first win this seat back in 2017 failed in his comeback bid he finished fourth with just 7 percent in the gop primary earlier this month with seven months to go until election day though there is still a lot that can change in these races and others the overall race for the senate could still go either way and we ll of course keep you updated counting independent sens angus king and bernie sanders who caucus with the democrats the other senator engulfed in that scandal republican richard burr of north
