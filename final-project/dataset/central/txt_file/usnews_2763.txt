gerard butler s last action movie was about navy seals rescuing a kidnapped russian president to prevent world war iii but the least realistic part may have been when the burly scottish actor stood before a lectern in the pentagon s press briefing room to chat about it in october once a staple of military news coverage the pentagon press briefing has become a rare occurrence in the trump administration in fact it s been more than 220 days since former defense secretary james mattis delivered his final televised briefing on aug 28 and more than 310 days since former pentagon chief spokesperson dana white delivered hers on may 31 acting secretary of defense patrick shanahan has never delivered a televised briefing in his role that s not because they don t have anything to talk about either in the last eight months the pentagon has lost a defense secretary swapped out six of nine top military commanders eliminated isis territorial control of iraq and syria boosted the air wars over afghanistan and somalia and mourned the combat deaths of at least two troops in syria and 15 others in afghanistan experts warn that the lack of regular open communication between the pentagon and the press is hurting civilian military relations david lapan a former spokesman for the pentagon and later the department of homeland security told time that it raises questions about how the department of defense is following its own guiding principles of information which stipulate that standard policy is to make available timely and accurate information so that the public the congress and the news media may assess and understand the facts about national security and defense strategy it s important that the american public understands how their sons and daughters are being used for national defense how their taxpayer dollars are being used for our national defense lapan says the dod policy doesn t prescribe how information is going to be released it doesn t say you have to do televised press briefings he added but stopping what had been longstanding practice gives people reason to question why another former military spokesperson is also worried the former official who requested anonymity so that he could be candid said the diminishing visibility of top pentagon officials in the five ring 29 acre structure is largely attributable to president donald trump s reaction to negative press i m not trying to defend it because as a former spokesman myself i m a staunch advocate of being as aggressively transparent as possible he said but there is a case to be made that if you are a federal agency under this administration with a president that is this hypersensitive about press coverage and as thin skinned as he is for the protection of the institution it is logical to assume that you re going to want to be more protective and more quiet and more circumspect about what you re public on and when you re public on it one reason top officials are lying low may be that the trump administration has a lower threshold for what it deems sensitive information requiring security classification the other according to the former spokesperson is more about maintaining a positive public image than protecting military secrets in this administration there is a disdain for scrutiny it is a concerted effort under this particular commander in chief to not only desire less interaction with the press but to escape any kind of public pressure to escape public accountability and scrutiny of their decisions he said one way you can accomplish that is by engaging less with what they consider mainstream media because mainstream media are going to ask those questions they re going to probe those issues for its part the department of defense maintains that it is accessible to the media i think the public can rest assured knowing that we routinely provide journalists with access to information and to defense officials at all levels defense spokesperson tom crosson told time in an email adding that the pentagon still conducts on the record press briefings with some regularity albeit not on air and that reporters routinely accompany the acting defense secretary on work trips the pentagon remains one of the only government agencies who allow nearly unrestricted access to the building for hundreds of credentialed journalists these reporters also have 24 7 access to a team of press officers to assist with their defense related questions crosson wrote still lapan says that those things are not new substitutes for on air briefings but rather longstanding procedures that have been practiced alongside on air briefings it was always the case that reporters had 24 hour access to press officers it was always the case that reporters traveled with the secretary of defense it was always the case that they made individuals available for interviews he said it gets to the point of why an on camera briefing certainly isn t the only way to get information but that it s an important way for the press and the public to see those officials on the record kevin baron who has covered the pentagon for more than a decade and now serves as the founding executive editor of defense one an atlantic media publication says he s seen a significant shift in the relationship between pentagon officials and the media since trump took office everything changed at the beginning of the trump administration when secretary mattis came in and very quickly made an effort to keep the military out of politics as much as possible his way of doing that was to keep himself off of camera and try to find some sort of happy medium which he thought would be meeting with reporters in gaggles in their office space outside of the briefing room off camera but on record he said on travel he started taking fewer and fewer reporters i don t think the press cabin on the plane has been full in two years that change has consequences baron said there s a much more opaque view of anywhere troops are fighting overseas especially at the end of the war in syria now especially in places like somalia yemen niger nigeria mali chad and across the middle east and north africa he said to be sure the pentagon is not the only governmental agency keeping the media at bay under president donald trump white house press briefings have become shorter and more sporadic between january and november 2018 white house press secretary sarah sanders gave only 59 press briefings in comparable periods bush press secretary ari fleischer held 85 briefings in 2002 and obama press secretary robert gibbs held 95 in 2010 according to an audit reported by the guardian while fleischer s briefings lasted about 25 minutes and gibbs s rounded out an hour sanders lasted only 15 18 minutes on average the state department has become increasingly press shy too in late 2017 former state department spokesperson p j crowley called it the lowest profile state department in 45 years crowley hinted that the change was a byproduct of a disconnect between trump and the departments for which he s responsible no one s sure what the policy is crowley told the new york times if you don t know what the policy is you don t want to be communicating it you don t want to get out ahead of the president of the united states but when government officials can t tell the american people and press what s happening in public settings less reliable sources might step in and try former pentagon and dhs spokesperson lapan argued if we re not telling our story somebody is telling it for us we shouldn t do that we shouldn t allow the enemy or critics or people who don t know to be telling our story lapan said that s why we ve always thought it s important to engage with the press and to get timely and accurate information out to the public so they can understand what we do and why we do it write to abby vesoulis at abby vesoulis time com
