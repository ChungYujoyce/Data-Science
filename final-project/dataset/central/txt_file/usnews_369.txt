attorney general william barr s message at a press conference thursday morning was crystal clear there was no collusion between the russian government and donald trump s 2016 campaign while special counsel robert mueller s investigation found that russia interfered in the election in an effort to undermine the clinton campaign no one in trump s orbit or any american for that matter barr added knowingly assisted russia in that effort but while mueller may not have found any evidence that trump associates conspired with russia to interfere in the election they nonetheless had a lot of contact with russians leading up to election day in fact investigators have found that trump and at least 17 of his campaign officials and advisors had more than 100 contacts between trump associates and russians belying the campaign s november 2016 claim that there was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign according to reporting many others associated with trump were told about contacts with russian linked individuals here is a list of all of the times that trump associates interacted with russia from the early days of the 2016 election cycle to trump s inauguration these interactions are based on court records related to the special counsel s investigation documents or testimony submitted to congress as well as reporting from time and other news organizations the first invitation to meet with russians came just one month after trump announced his presidential bid on july 24 2015 british publicist rob goldstone suggested to trump s longtime personal assistant rhona graff that his client russian pop star emin agalarov could set up a meeting between trump and russian president vladimir putin the offer came amid emails inviting trump to travel to moscow to celebrate the birthday of agalarov s father who had worked with trump to bring the miss universe pageant to moscow in 2013 the emails were released by the senate judiciary committee as it investigated the infamous 2016 trump tower meeting in new york graff told goldstone it was unlikely that trump would have time to travel to moscow given his newly announced presidential campaign but said she was sure he will want to send a congratulatory note trump s longtime personal lawyer and fixer michael cohen had numerous contacts with russians throughout the 2016 campaign these started as early as the fall of 2015 according to information cohen told the special counsel s office during its investigation in a september 2015 radio interview cohen suggested that trump could meet with putin at the united nations general assembly during the special counsel investigation cohen initially claimed that was a spontaneous comment but the special counsel later said cohen admitted that by the time of his radio comments he had already conferred with trump about contacting the russian government before reaching out to gauge russia s interest in such a meeting also in september of 2015 cohen began communicating with felix sater a russian born trump business associate about a plan to build a trump tower in moscow the idea of a trump property in the russian capital had been around for decades but after trump announced his presidential bid sater reached out to cohen and set up a meeting for september according to a detailed report on the project from buzzfeed news after the meeting sater emailed cohen multiple times in october 2015 to let him know about a meeting with a developer and then to say that sater s associates would be meeting with putin and a top deputy and that he had secured financing from vtb bank a russian bank that was under u s sanctions at the time on october 13 2015 sater sent a letter of intent signed by a moscow developer to cohen and asked him to get trump s signature and on oct 28 the day of the third republican primary debate trump signed the letter sater and cohen continued to trade emails about the progress of negotiations over the next few months on november 3 2015 sater bragged about his kremlin connections saying i will get putin on this program and we will get donald elected according to emails first published by the new york times buddy our boy can become president of the usa and we can engineer it he continued i will get all of putins team to buy in on this i will manage this process the wife of russian weightlifter dmitry klokov reached out to trump s eldest daughter ivanka about helping with the trump tower moscow project though ivanka did not know the athlete or his wife she sent the communication to cohen in november of 2015 spokespeople for ivanka have downplayed her role and she has said she knew literally almost nothing about the trump tower moscow project but in cohen s testimony before congress in february of 2019 he said he briefed ivanka her husband jared kushner and donald trump jr about the project about 10 times over the course of his work on it in november of 2015 cohen spoke with a russian national who claimed to be a trusted person in the russian federation and offered the campaign political synergy and synergy on a government level according to a memo filed by the special counsel in december the russian repeatedly proposed a meeting between trump and putin the prosecutors said and told cohen that such a meeting would have a phenomenal impact because there is no bigger warranty in any project than putin s approval cohen ultimately declined the russian national s offer as he already had his deal underway with sater this description matches information about exchanges cohen had in november 2015 with klokov which were first reported by buzzfeed news klokov initially denied sending emails to cohen but when buzzfeed asked him about specifics the athlete stopped responding sater emailed cohen in mid december 2015 saying that a evgeny shmykov a former russian intelligence general needed passport information from cohen and trump to arrange visas for the pair to visit russia the trip to russia never happened as cohen soon grew frustrated with sater s work on the moscow deal but cohen did send photos of his own passport to sater according to messages published by buzzfeed on jan 14 2016 cohen emailed the office of putin s press secretary dmitry peskov to seek help with the moscow project according to the a document filed by the special counsel when cohen pleaded guilty in november 2018 cohen followed up two days later asking for someone who speaks english to contact him he then spoke with an aide to putin s press secretary for 20 minutes on jan 20 during which cohen explained the proposed moscow project and asked for the kremlin s help in securing land and financing for the tower the aid asked detailed questions and took notes the special counsel wrote and she told cohen that she would follow up with others in russia another offer for help came from an executive at a top russian social media company called vkontakte or vk konstantin sidorkov who serves as the company s partner relations director emailed trump jr and social media director dan scavino in january and november of 2016 saying he could help promote trump to vk s 100 million users the emails which were submitted to the senate judiciary committee as part of its investigation into 2016 show that the connection was brokered through goldstone the british publicist who connected a number of russians to the trump campaign scavino who is now the white house social media director expressed interest in the assistance but in 2018 he told abc news that the campaign did not pursue the idea on feb 29 2016 goldstone sent trump jr a letter from araz agalarov trump s former business associate expressing great interest in trump s bright electoral campaign goldstone told trump jr the letter offered agalarov s support and thanked him for passing it on to trump papadopoulos who has now served time in jail for lying to investigators is one of the trump associates who had frequent contacts with russians throughout the 2016 campaign he joined the campaign as an unpaid foreign policy advisor in march 2016 and on march 14 he met with joseph mifsud a london based professor who claimed to have substantial connections to russian government officials according to court documents ten days later papadopoulos met with mifsud and a russian woman who he believed was putin s niece to discuss arranging a meeting between the trump campaign and russian leadership after these meetings papadopoulos told various trump and various campaign officials including jeff sessions and sam clovis then co chairman of trump s campaign about his russian connections papadopoulos continued to work toward a trump russia meeting and in april mifsud sent an email introducing papadopoulos to ivan timofeev who he said had connections to the russian ministry of foreign affairs timofeev emailed papadopoulos on april 22 2016 thanking him for an extensive talk and the two talked over skype and emailed for the next several weeks according to the special counsel s court documents on april 26 2016 mifsud told papadopoulos about the russian hacking of hillary clinton s emails saying that russians had dirt on clinton in the form of thousands of emails and in may when timofeev told papadopoulos that his colleagues at the russian ministry of foreign affairs were open for cooperation papadopoulos forwarded this note to corey lewandowski who was then trump s campaign manager when paul manafort took over as chairman of trump s campaign in late may papadopoulos forwarded the message to him the meeting between the trump campaign and russian officials ultimately did not happen but papadopoulos continued his efforts into august of 2016

discussions about u s russia relations in a potential trump administration on may 5 2016 cohen received an invitation to attend the st petersburg forum in june delivered through sater according to
