 by lori robertson posted on may 15 2020 the wuhan institute of virology received 600 000 as part of a larger five year u s government grant to a u s based nonprofit studying emerging infectious diseases but president donald trump put the figure at 7 5 million saying he ended it we asked the white house where the 7 5 million figure may have come from but we haven t received a response false claims that the wuhan lab had received 3 7 million in national institutes of health grant money have circulated online after an april 11 daily mail story made that assertion and republican rep matt gaetz repeated it in a fox news interview the nih didn t award such a grant instead it gave a grant totaling 3 4 million beginning in 2014 to the u s based ecohealth alliance to study the risk of the future emergence of coronaviruses from bats and ecohealth distributed 600 000 of that total to the wuhan institute of virology a collaborator on the project pre approved by nih we wrote about this distortion of the ecohealth grant after the claim appeared in the conspiracy theory video plandemic trump echoed the claim in an interview that aired may 14 on fox business news host maria bartiromo asked of the wuhan institute didn t we as a country give money to that lab trump responded trump may 14 yeah as i understand it before i got here 7 5 million in 2014 and look they said they were studying different things and you know things like that happen but you know money was given by the obama administration early on i ended it i took a lot of heat too they said oh we re studying all sorts of stuff you saw what happened i ended it it s unclear what other funding the president may be including in his figure an april 16 fox news story cited another 3 4 million grant regarding a behavioral study that may have included some funding that went to the wuhan lab but the grant which was awarded to cold spring harbor laboratory in new york hasn t been terminated it was originally for 2014 2019 and a second related grant was approved this year we reached out to cold spring harbor lab and we ll update this story if we receive additional information fox news acknowledged that it was not clear exactly how much u s funding went directly to the wuhan institute of virology because it worked in collaboration with other institutions on the projects funded by the american grants in the case of the ecohealth grant the one that was canceled we do know how much went to the wuhan lab and it was well short of even 1 million in a statement the nih said the total grant to ecohealth was 3 4 million over six years 2014 through 2019 and that the grant had been terminated nih does not discuss details of the decision making process regarding specific grant awards the statement said information on the nih website shows the project began on june 1 2014 and was ended on april 24 2020 nearly all of the 3 4 million was part of a five year grant awarded in 2014 ecohealth spokesman robert kessler told us in an email and the 600 000 given to the wuhan institute of virology was part of that grant in 2019 the project was renewed for another five years and ecohealth received 292 161 in 2019 before nih canceled the grant last month usa today reported that about 76 000 had been budgeted for the wuhan lab as part of the 2019 renewal kessler confirmed to us that money had been budgeted but it hadn t been distributed to the lab before the grant was ended the wuhan china lab located in the city where the novel coronavirus outbreak began in late 2019 was pre approved as a collaborator by nih and the state department kessler said researchers used the lab to conduct genetic analyses of the viruses in each of nearly 30 countries around the world where we work we collaborate with local institutions all of which are pre approved by our federal funders ecohealth said in anapril 28 statementabout the terminated funding it s been ecohealth alliance s position for the past 15 years that coronaviruses present a clear and immediate threat to our safety that seems clearer now than ever before the nih grant technically funded through the nih s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases backed research into the emergence of coronaviruses that can affect humans and originate in bats which is the origin experts suspect of sars cov 2 or the novel coronavirus as well assevere acute respiratory syndrome orsars virus which caused a global outbreak in 2003 and the middle east respiratory syndrome ormers virus identifiedin 2012 the ecohealth project description on the nih website says that zoonotic coronaviruses meaning those that can transfer from animals to humans are a significant threat to global health and that bats appear to be the natural reservoir of these viruses the project aims to understand what factors increase the risk of the next cov emerging in people by studying cov diversity in a critical zoonotic reservoir bats at sites of high risk for emergence wildlife markets in an emerging disease hotspot china ecohealth which has received government grant money nearly every year since 2002 according to an nih database said in its april 28 statement that the research terminated by the trump administration aimed to analyze the risk of coronavirus emergence and help in designing vaccines and drugs to protect us from covid 19 and other coronavirus threats in fact genetic sequences of two bat coronaviruses that we discovered with this grant have been used as lab tools to test the breakthrough antiviral drug remdesivir clinical trials are underway to determine whether remdesivir is safe and effective in treating covid 19 the food and drug administration issued an emergency use authorization on may 1 for the drug based on early results the wuhan institute of virology has been the subject of baseless conspiracy theories claiming sars cov 2 was created or manipulated in a lab as we ve written the authors of a march article in nature medicine concluded our analyses clearly show that sars cov 2 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus university of sydney professor edward holmes who was involved in mapping the genome of sars cov 2 also said in an april statement coronaviruses like sars cov 2 are commonly found in wildlife species and frequently jump to new hosts this is also the most likely explanation for the origin of sars cov 2 responding to what he called unfounded speculation that a bat coronavirus named ratg13 being kept at the wuhan institute of virology was the origin holmes said that for various reasons he concluded sars cov 2 was not derived from ratg13 holmes said more sampling of other animals is needed to resolve the exact origins of the novel coronavirus the u s intelligence community said in an april 30 statement that it concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the covid 19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified and that it will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in wuhan in remarks the same day trump answered yes i have when asked if he had seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the wuhan institute of virology was the origin of this virus but the president also said we re going to see where it comes from and you know look you know every theory whether you had the theory from the lab you had the theory from many different the bats and the type of bat and the bat is 40 miles away so it couldn t have been here and it couldn t have been there and we have a there s a lot of theories but yeah we have people looking at it very very strongly investigations into the origin of the virus aside trump was wrong to claim the u s government has given 7 5 million to the wuhan lab under his predecessor the lab received only 600 000 through a five year grant to ecohealth alliance a grant that spanned both the obama and trump administrations and had been renewed last year we don t know how much if anything the lab may have received as part of other grants q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
