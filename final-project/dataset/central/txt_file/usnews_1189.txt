read an excerpt from the forthcoming commemorative edition on the life and legacy of george h w bush from time inc books a division of meredith corporation george bush will never be remembered for soaring rhetorical flourishes his legacy as a speaker will be defined by abrupt and much mimicked phrases such as wouldn t be prudent and read my lips but as much as he may have seemed at times to be distant at the podium the man who put pen to paper in private was less self conscious at times personable and at times combative and on occasion quite funny unlike most presidents who author autobiographies shortly after leaving office both to pay the bills and to offer an unchallenged defense of events that happened on their watch bush declined such offers leaving historians the task of assessing his tenure instead he assembled a lifetime of letters and other writings into the revealing 1999 bestseller all the best what follows is a small collection of excerpts that capture pivotal moments in his life in his own words to his mother 1942 written at the wold chamberlain naval air station minneapolis minn kissing is not an obligation a girl owes a boy regardless of how often he takes her out or how much money he spends but i don t think that it is entirely wrong for a girl to be kissed by a boy let us take this famous case barbara pierce vs george bush summer 42 i kissed barbara and am glad of it i don t believe she will ever regret it or resent it and i certainly am not ashamed of it i d tell you mrs pierce or anybody but at the same time i might as well tell you i have never felt towards another girl as i do towards her whether the feeling is mutual i cannot say to get back to my example however if barbara sort of forgets me which is not unlikely as i have no chance to see her at all i don t believe she will ever dislike me more for having kissed her she knows how i felt towards her and she must have shared some of the same feeling or she would not have allowed me to kiss her i have never kissed another girl journal entry november 7 1987 warming up for the presidential campaign brandon iowa a tiny little town more people in the middle of the little town than lived in the town they came in from everywhere the firemen dressed in yellow coats holding the crowd back young kids banners homemade signs welcoming the vice president i go into the brandon feed store and just before walking in i was shaking hands with all the people and an older woman said to me you look younger than i thought i said a lot of people say taller she said no i say a lot younger i said well i m 63 she said no shit everybody heard her all of the people standing next to her looked shocked looked kind of held back i laughed and then they laughed like mad it was absolutely fantastic one of the great moments in my life politically journal entry march 23 1990 the broccoli war is heating up on march 21st the broccoli association announces they re sending a couple of tons of the stuff but i m sticking with my position that i hate broccoli i think i ll get barbara who likes broccoli to go out and greet the broccoli caravan i refuse to give an inch on this and i so advised the press i can t stand the stuff it smells up everything and i m against it journal entry january 20 1993 last day in the white house my last walk around the white house grounds it s clear blue crisp cold and i think of the many walks i ve had around here and what a joy it s been the worst will be saying good bye to the staff today but if i lose it too bad they ve been a part of our lives and they know we care and so time goes on and i m sitting here now alone the desk is clear and the pictures are gone i leave a note on the desk for bill clinton it looks a little lonely sitting there i don t want it to be overly dramatic but i did want him to know that i would be rooting for him i think of the happiness we ve had here somebody points out well the polls look good today you re leaving with people liking you and i m saying well that s nice that s very nice but i didn t finish the job they may be pleasant in that way but i don t think they know my heartbeat to his children september 23 1998 bush ends his book with this letter this letter is about aging not about the president s conference on aging and how we should play lawn bowling get discounts at the movies turn into skin conscious sun blockers take metamucil and grow old gracefully no it s about me about what happened between last year and this between being 73 and 74 last year i could fly fish on the end rocks at the point and not be too concerned about losing my balance oh if i d been casting at one target for a while way back in the summer of 97 my spike clad feet firmly placed on two rocks and then i turned fast i d feel a little what s the word here not wobbly but unbalanced that s the feeling then there s memory i m still pretty good at faking it well i ll be darn how in the heck are you or long time no see or what you been up to if i try to read after dinner i fall asleep on the third page no matter how gripping the mystery read a briefing paper in bed no way sominex time no there is a difference now and maybe when we reconvene next year you ll notice even more of a gentle slide i hope not i want to put this aging on hold for awhile now i don t expect to be on the a team any more but i want to play golf with you and i want to fish or throw shoes and i want to rejoice in your victories be they political or business or family happiness read more in a forthcoming
