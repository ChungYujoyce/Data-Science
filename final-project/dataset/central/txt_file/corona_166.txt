 business insider after weeks of going quiet on hydroxychloroquine hcq the anti malarial drug he used to tout as a game changer for the coronavirus president trump startled everyone yesterdayby announcing that he was taking it himself this announcement eclipsed the rest of the day apos s news which may be one reason trump brought the topic up again the comments also triggered thesame widespread condemnationthe president received in the weeks he was talking up the drug in press conferences one aspect of this criticism is fair hydroxychloroquine can have dangerous side effects and there apos s still no real evidence that it works the power of suggestion and leading by example meanwhile is real the announcement by the president of the united states that he considers hcq apos s risks worth taking will likely prompt others to take it too and if taking the drug kills or hurts some people without helping them the president will be partially responsible so trump should not be talking up hcq or even sharing his own personal medical choices no matter how much his gut tells him that the drug apos s benefits offset its risk but the president apos s decision to take the drug himself is reasonable as long as he apos s taking it in safe doses with his doctor monitoring him for side effects insider apos s hydroxychloroquine expert andy dunn askeddr david boulwarewhether there is any evidence that hcq prevents or reduces the risk of coronavirus infection dr boulware is doing a study at the university of minnesota to answer this question right now here apos s dr boulware apos s response there are no data that pre exposure prophylaxis is effective to prevent coronavirus it may be it may not be we do not know in other words an expert on infectious diseases believes that the question of whether hcq prevents infection is worth a study to answer it might work it might not work we don apos t yet know as i noted last month when president trump was touting hcq as a game changer the possibility that itmightwork is persuasive logic in the face of a frightening disease that is otherwise untreatable long before the fda approved hcq for emergency use against coronavirus in fact many doctors in the us france south korea and elsewhere were prescribing it based on this logic in the ensuing month several studies have come out suggesting that hcq does not work and several other studies have been stopped because the side effects on some patients were deemed dangerous so the risks are real but for some people trump apparently included the remaining possibility that hcq mightwork seems enough to offset these risks that apos s fine and fair we all make individual risk assessments and judgments every day some of us view certain activities as too risky and view those who engage in them as reckless and stupid others believe that the benefits of the same activities outweigh their risks and choose to do them based on what we know about the possible risk reward trade off of taking hydroxychloroquine trump apos s decision is within the realm of reasonable even if you think it apos s reckless and stupid it might work it might not work when dr boulware apos s study concludes we should know one way or the other a version of this post first appeared in insider today a daily email written by henry blodget and david plotz to receive it in your inbox pleasesign up here this is an opinion column the thoughts expressed are those of the author s do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you d like to share or a tip on how your town or community is handling the pandemic please email covidtips businessinsider com and tell us your story get the latest coronavirus business economic impact analysis from business insider intelligence on how covid 19 is affecting industries get the latest coronavirus business economic impact analysis from business insider intelligence on how covid 19 is affecting industries
