by nancy gibbs this is the 90th time we have named the person who had the greatest influence for better or worse on the events of the year so which is it this year better or worse the challenge for donald trump is how profoundly the country disagrees about the answer behind time s person of the year cover it s hard to measure the scale of his disruption this real estate baron and casino owner turned reality tv star and provocateur never a day spent in public office never a debt owed to any interest besides his own now surveys the smoking ruin of a vast political edifice that once housed parties pundits donors pollsters all those who did not see him coming or take him seriously out of this reckoning trump is poised to preside for better or worse for those who believe this is all for the better trump s victory represents a long overdue rebuke to an entrenched and arrogant governing class for those who see it as for the worse the destruction extends to cherished norms of civility and discourse a politics poisoned by vile streams of racism sexism nativism to his believers he delivers change broad deep historic change not modest measures doled out in dixie cups to his detractors he inspires fear both for what he may do and what may be done in his name the revolution he stirred feels fully american with its echoes of populists past of andrew jackson and huey long and at its most sinister joe mccarthy and charles coughlin trump s assault on truth and logic far from hurting him made him stronger his appeal part hope part snarl dissolved party lines and dispatched the two reigning dynasties of u s politics yet his victory mirrors the ascent of nationalists across the world from britain to the philippines and taps forces far more powerful than one man s message we can scarcely grasp what our generation has wrought by putting a supercomputer into all of our hands all of the time if you are reading this whether on a page or a screen there is a very good chance that you are caught up in a revolution that may have started with enticing gadgets but has now reshaped everything about how we live love work play shop share how our very hearts and minds encounter the world around us why would we have imagined that our national conversation would simply go on as before same people same promises same patterns perhaps the president elect will stop tweeting but only because he will have found some other means to tell the story he wants to tell directly to the audience that wants to hear it it turned out to be a failing strategy when hillary clinton who loves policy solutions and believes in them tried to make this race a character test a referendum on trump but it was certainly understandable he presented so many challenges so many choices about what america values her popular vote victory while legally irrelevant affirmed the prospect of a female commander in chief in fact she crushed trump among voters who cared most about experience and judgment and temperament qualities that have typically mattered when choosing the leader of the free world even at his moment of victory 6 in 10 voters had an unfavorable view of trump and didn t think he was qualified to be president but by almost 2 to 1 voters cared most about who could deliver change and in that category he beat her by 68 points this is his next test the year 2016 was the year of his rise 2017 will be the year of his rule and like all newly elected leaders he has a chance to fulfill promises and defy expectations his supporters and his critics will discover together how much of what he said he actually believes in the days after the election everything was negotiable the wall became a fence crooked hillary is good people and maybe climate change is worth thinking about far from draining the swamp he fed plums to some of its biggest gators were his followers alarmed the critics were hardly reassured nearly half of americans expect race relations to worsen and many women fear that his ascent comes directly at their expense trump prefers to talk about the alienated workers who flocked to his rallies and believed a billionaire could be their tribune i love them and they love me and avers that his every action will be on their behalf but can he devise a new deal for workers in the age of automation renegotiate trade deals and reopen factories while simultaneously elevating many of the same people who profit from the trends he denounced for reminding america that demagoguery feeds on despair and that truth is only as powerful as the trust in those who speak it for empowering a hidden electorate by mainstreaming its furies and live streaming its fears and for framing tomorrow s political culture by demolishing yesterday s donald trump is time s 2016 person of the year your browser is out of date please update your browser at http update microsoft com
