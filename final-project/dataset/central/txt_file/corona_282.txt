continues to impact the united states the federal government is taking action to ease the burden on taxpayers most recently the senate passed a massive stimulus package the house voted yes too and the cares act was signed into law a key feature of the stimulus is individual checks as with anything tax related there s a little bit of confusion to help you sort it out here are a few questions and answers when will i get my check checks are supposed to be produced as rapidly as possible they began being distributed in mid april one thing that is true if you use direct deposit you ll get your money faster you can find out more here how big will my check be checks will be 1 200 per adult or 2 400 for married couples filing jointly and an additional 500 per child related stimulus check calculator how much will you receive are there income limits on checks the amount of the checks would start to phaseout for those earning more than 75 000 150 000 for joint returns and 112 500 for heads of household this is adjusted gross income agi not taxable income so before your standard or itemized deductions you ll see your number on line 8 b of your form 1040 kpe wait how does a phaseout work phaseout means that the benefit goes down as income goes up in this case for every 100 of income above those thresholds your check will drop by 5 so if you are a single filer earning 75 100 your check will be 1 195 1 200 5 if you are a single filer earning 85 000 your check will be 700 1 200 500 if you do the quick math on that it means that you ll phaseout completely meaning that you ll get nothing once you hit 99 000 as a single filer 198 000 as a married couple filing jointly or 136 500 for heads of household what about limits on kids there are no limits on the number of children that qualify the definition of child will be the same as for thechild tax credit you ll find the age and other requirements at that link will i need a social security number to get a check yes or in the alternative an adoption taxpayer identification number ditto for spouses and kids so how does this work do i need to file anything to get my check technically the checks are advances of a new temporary credit for 2020 it will not affect your normal refund in 2020 nor how much you owe since we haven t filed for 2020 yet the irs will advance your check based on your most recently filed tax return 2018 or 2019 tax return if you haven t filed a tax return and your income is from social security benefits the bill allows treasury to use the information on your 2019 form ssa 1099 social security benefit statement form rrb 1099 social security equivalent benefit statement after some initial confusion this was confirmed by the treasury and irs okay i don t understand what is a refundable tax credit a refundable credit means that you can take advantage of the credit even if you do not owe any tax unlike with a nonrefundable credit if you don t have any tax liability the extra credit is not lost but is instead refunded to you in this case the stimulus check acts like a refund for a new temporary tax credit that you get in advance based on your 2020 income that s confusing because you don t know how much you re going to earn in 2020 but it s why the irs is using earlier returns but since it s an advance payment on a new credit does not affect your normal tax refund for 2020 you won t lose out on your expected tax refund for 2020 with the check can you give me an example sure let s say you re entitled to a stimulus check for 1 200 and you get your check this year in 2020 let s also say that you were expecting a 1 500 refund in 2021 for the 2020 tax year when you get your stimulus check that doesn t change your expected refund you would still qualify for the 1 500 in 2021 but what if you didn t get your stimulus check because you didn t file in 2018 or 2019 or some other reason you ll still get your 1 500 in 2021 but you ll also get the 1 200 in 2021 either way you won t miss out by taking the check and you don t have to pay it back what if i don t get the right amount when you file your 2020 tax return the irs should compare numbers if you should have gotten a check and didn t or if you should have gotten more than you did because the irs didn t know something important like you have a kid you should get more money see my example above if the numbers on your 2020 tax return suggest that you got more than you should because of your income you should not have to pay it back don t worry most taxpayers should get just the right amount what if i am expecting a refund for the 2019 tax year your 2019 refund will not be affected by the stimulus check is my check taxable no this is not taxable income how will i get my check direct deposit if you re lucky the irs will deposit your payment directly into the same banking account you used for direct deposit on your last filed return but what if the irs doesn t have my direct deposit information you may need to register with the irs to get your check you can find out more here what if i ve moved under the law the treasury must send notice of the payment by mail to your last known address the notice will include how the payment was made and the amount of the payment the notice will also include a phone number for the appropriate point of contact at the internal revenue service irs if you didn t receive the payment you can help make sure that it goes to the right place by updating your address after a move usually you d do that on your tax return but you can also submit afederal form 8822 change of address downloads as a pdf it generally takes four to six weeks to process a change of address what if i haven t filed for 2018 and 2019 do it soon even if you have a simple zero return and don t forget to include your direct deposit banking information on your return what about retired folks retired seniors are eligible so long as they meet the other criteria social security numbers income thresholds etc as noted above if you depend on social security but normally don t file a tax return treasury will rely on your ssa 1099 form or rrb equivalent to figure and send your check what about those on government benefits and those with no income yes eligible folks include those with no income as well as those whose income comes entirely from benefit programs like as ssi or ssdi benefits i ve seen a lot of confusion about this it s because one of the original proposal limited the checks to those who earned income this is no longer the case will i still get the check if i owe the irs some money yes if your refund would normally be seized to pay a tax debt that shouldn t happen here shouldn t assuming it works as planned what if my check is normally seized for child support child support is an exception to the we won t offset your check rule under the law your check can be seized for child support arrears this is a done deal right yes it passed in the senate on wednesday night and the house on friday the president has signed it so no changes i didn t say that there could be additional guidance from the irs i still have so many questions we all do you can find some more answers here and check out these additional posts not that i don t trust you but where can i find this in writing you can read the congressional record which notes the discussion about the checks the vote and the text here downloads as a pdf the irs has confirmed some of this information and will eventually post more information on its website for the
