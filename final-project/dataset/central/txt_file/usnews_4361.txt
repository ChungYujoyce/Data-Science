in the mid 2000s i was a journalist based in shanghai and i came upon what seemed like a great story idea china s economic rise had created a fascinating dynamic with the animal realm while a growing middle class had started having pets which were frowned upon in the recent past as a bourgeois luxury attitudes generally towards animals were lagging far behind economic growth to say the least withno animal welfare lawin all of china abuses towards animals went unpunished afetish site at the time that featured women in stiletto heels crushing kittens caused an uproar but it couldn t be formally punished similarly some had started speaking out about certain traditional chinese medicine practices likeimprisoning moon bears in tiny cageswith catheters inserted in their livers to extract bile which has dubious benefits and can be easily synthesized chemically but the practice went on unimpeded but it was chinese eating habits that really captured my attention i started covering the story not long after the sars crisis had subsided i made my way south to guangdong where there is a saying that the locals will eat anything that flies except a plane and anything with four legs except a table theinfamous wet markets which sold a huge variety of exotic animal species like porcupines raccoonsand otters had been temporarily cowed by a government clampdown when i first began to investigate this story these shutdowns would unfortunately prove to be short lived thesewet markets were reported to have been the birthplace for sars and now science tells us are the possibleorigin of covid 19 which started supposedly with the consumption of pangolin or bats kept along with other wildlife in unsanitary conditions in wuhan s wet markets when i visited the markets the strangest animals for human consumption to my western eyes were turtles snakes and frogs gone were the civet cats who likely passed sars to humans wolf cubs monkeys and many other exotic animals which until recently were sold openly chinese government blame the chinese communist party for the coronavirus crisis but even with clampdown at the time it wasn t hard to connect with people who whispered of the horrifying conditions that the market operated under before sars the markets were a noah s ark of terrified animals of seemingly every variety often sick and or injured housed closely together before being slaughtered in unsanitary conditions it was a perfect birthplace for novel viruses to intermingle and leap and mutate to humans i would later learn that the chinese appetite for these animals and the conditions they were kept in weren t the only genesis for disease creation in china chinese animal husbandry practices were such that peoplefrequently lived in close proximity with their livestock often keeping these animals in their homes in fact the traditional character for home jia features a pig under a roof which showsjust how elemental this type of arrangement has been in chinese culture pigs like birds have a distinct biological ability to share their viruses with humans compared to other animals the combination of living closely with animals in particular animals that can share their diseases withhumans with a centuries old tradition of eating strange animals and or using them for medical purposes combined with unsanitary conditions created a uniquely fecund environment for human sickness hotline share your coronavirus story as if this wasn t bad enough it was easy to find a level of cruelty towards animals that was shocking in beijing where pet dogs had been abandoned en masse by their owners when false rumors circulated that dogs could carrysars i met a man who had dogs he was ready to sell as pets and others he would happily slaughter for dinner cat meatball restaurantsweren t all that hard to find in shenzhen seemingly every seafood marketfeatured fishthat had been cut open alive and placed on ice to show hearts still beating to prove how fresh they were rising wealth in china had led to rapid and massive growth of industrial meat production which combined with no animal welfare law created horrible conditions for billions of animals desire forshark fin soup which has little natural taste and is simply a status symbol was threatening to wipe out the global shark population the list went on and on it is said that a society s attitude towards animals is often a bellwether for its sense of justice and kindness i found theseattributes sorely lacking in chinaand after a few years decided to leave in no small part because of the horrors i uncovered while doing research for my animal welfare story now we re faced with the uniquely devastating challenge of covid 19 senior leaders in the u s government ledby president donald trump have taken to calling it the chinese virus or variations thereof this should be loudly condemned as it has ledto racial targeting ofasian americans it is also a diversionary tactic to distract from the incompetent response by the trump administration whose desire to scapegoat foreigners is at this point both unsurprising yet still shockingly irresponsible behavior in the midst of a crisis but we shouldn t let our impulse to defend our fellow citizens from racist attacks or our understandable desire to stand in opposition to the foolish rhetoric of right wing voices get in the wayof condemning china s tolerance of these animal welfare practices and indemanding that china finally end the most dangerous of these practices a growing chorus of critics is focused specifically on the wet markets dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases saying recently that the pandemic is a direct result of the conditions found at the wet markets it boggles my mind how when we have so many diseases that emanate out of that unusual human animal interface that we don t just shut it down he said teach the chinese government a lesson time to put china on lockdown for its dishonesty amid coronavirus crisis for centuries foreigners havetriedto change china but chinese culture has largely resisted the missionaries and businessmen that have sought to convert its people and capitalize on its huge market now the world needs to unite and push china to change for an extremely important global public health reason not for profit or proselytizing to be fair wet markets like the one in wuhan exist in other countries but it is the scale of china and the combination of its cultural traditions of medicine animal husbandry and culinary tastes that render it a unique incubator of terrible diseases as we all do our best to get through this crisis we can t lose sight of how we got here china knew after sars that its wet markets were a specific danger to public health and allowed them to resume after that particular crisis died down since that time many have predicted that these wet markets were a ticking time bomb for another novel virus we will need towork worldwide to hold china accountable in making sure these markets are changed permanently they canno longer disregard the scientific facts that tell us mixing exotic animals and eating them isn t just bad for wildlife it is human kryptonite jeremy hurewitz thecuration director atnationswell was a journalist based in prague and shanghai for nine years
