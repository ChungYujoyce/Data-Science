imposed restrictions while not alienating the swing voters he ll need in november it s led to divergent messages loading april 27 2020 with six months until election day president trump is hoping voters will see him as having done all he can to save the nation from economic meltdown while also protecting public health in a pandemic that has so far claimed 55 000 american lives that has produced seemingly contradictory messages on the one hand mr trump has been urging governors to follow science basedfederal guidelinesfor a phased opening of america at the same time he s been egging on protesters at state capitols who are rebelling against those same guidelines that are keeping most americans sheltering in place it is an apparent political effort to have his cake and eat it too in a fundamental way mr trump is also tapping into the nation s deep roots in individualism and personal responsibility as well as a growing distrust on the right in experts and elites but there s a real risk here says steven schier an emeritus political science professor at carleton college in northfield minn public opinion is clearly not with these protests to open up now so he has to worry that he s associating himself with an unpopular movement that could produce some bad results in a past life that is before covid 19 president donald trump was banking on a strong economy to usher him into a second term that calculation has largely evaporated but not entirely with six months until election day president trump is now asking voters to make a multi step mental leap remember the once robust economy and then see him as having done all he can to save the nation from economic meltdown while also trying to protect public health in a pandemic that has so far claimed 55 000 american lives the bifurcated approach has produced seemingly contradictory messages on the one hand mr trump has been urging governors to follow science based federal guidelines for a phased opening of america at the same time he s been egging on protesters at state capitols who are rebelling against those very same guidelines that are keeping most americans sheltering in place editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall it is a risky gambit an apparent political effort to have his cake and eat it too as he whips up his core supporters with calls to liberate their states while trying not to alienate the more mainstream voters he will need in november the latest poll numbers in key battleground states show mr trump losing to former vice president joe biden in a fundamental way mr trump is also tapping into the nation s deep roots in individualism and personal responsibility as well as the right s growing distrust of experts and elites he s been very good at building a base which is very loyal to him and continuing to remind the base he s on their side says historian michael kazin an expert on populism at georgetown university asthe economy gets worse more and more people will say that while the virus might be dangerous it s also dangerous to have businesses close up for good the political challenges are several fold social distancing means no campaign rallies for the foreseeable future online campaign events attracting audiences in the hundreds not thousands aren t the same that forces him to rely all the more on twitter and friendly news outlets to reach his supporters even mr trump s daily coronavirus briefings which have attracted high viewership and given him a platform to spar with media have gone south since his controversial appearance last thursday when he sparked an uproar by seeming to float the idea of ingesting disinfectants to treat covid 19 he has dialed way back on friday he took no questions and over the weekend did not hold any briefings at all monday s scheduled briefing was initially canceled then reinstated the anti lockdown rallies themselves also represent a mixed bag for mr trump on one level they reflect the spirit of rebellion that gave rise to his presidency and before that the tea party movement but they also attract fringe elements some have featured confederate battle flags and signs with swastikas some protesters bring firearms though they have been urged not to in virginia pre coronavirus protests centered on gun rights have morphed into anti quarantine protests at a drive by rally at the state capitol in richmond last week the messages contained heartfelt pleas by people eager to return to work and worried their rights are being trampled i am not a covid 19 denier says steve walker a self employed mechanic from chesterfield virginia speaking by phone after the rally but i believe that the government s response to this is overreaching he worries that if the closures aren t dialed back soon the food supply could be at risk but when asked about the gadsden don t tread on me flag his son waved out the window of their green dodge durango during the protest mr walker reveals a deeper sense of grievance the flag common at lockdown protests and a tea party symbol is a warning to the government we don t work for you you work for us mr walker says and if you continue on a course toward tyranny there will be repercussions you have a good chance of seeing armed revolt in this state much has been made of the support some anti quarantine protests have received from national groups and people with white house connections such as stephen moore who serves on the administration s advisory board for reopening the economy but supporters note no one is paying protesters or forcing them to show up the anti quarantine efforts are a natural outgrowth of the libertarian less government more freedom ethos of groups like freedomworks which has 5 million facebook followers a lot of the people who were involved in the tea party movement have remained active in freedomworks says adam brandon the group s president we re in touch in the last three years he says the group has trained 25 000 activists by sponsoring fly ins to washington and holding regional events still mr trump s all caps tweets on april 17 calling to liberate michigan minnesota and virginia were startling the day before the president had released a three phase plan to reopen america guidance aimed at helping states shift responsibly toward opening their economies without inviting a surge of new covid 19 cases in fact 8 in 10 americans support the shelter in place orders in effect in most states according to the kaiser family foundation and many governors have seen a spike in their job approval ratings amid the pandemic some governors worried the president was calling for an armed insurrection when democratic minnesota gov tim walz saw the tweet he reached out to mr trump the two eventually had a very nice call according to a trump tweet the tweeting trump isn t necessarily the phoning trump says steven schier an emeritus political science professor at carleton college in northfield minnesota but there s a real risk here professor schier says public opinion is clearly not with these protests to open up now so he has to worry that he s associating himself with an unpopular movement that could produce some bad results the three states that mr trump tweeted liberate messages at have democratic governors mr trump is hoping to win minnesota in november after barely losing there in 2016 virginia voted democratic by more than 5 percentage points but michigan is a true battleground voting for mr trump in 2016 by just a fraction of a percent and he is fighting hard to keep it in 2020 it s worth noting that the united states appears to be the only country with any significant anti quarantine protests part of it is a reflection of american political culture in which freedom of speech and freedom of assembly are enshrined in the constitution there is a lot of social media frustration over the lockdown in several european countries including the netherlands and u k but i have not seen many open demonstrations writes cas mudde a professor in the school of public and international affairs at the university of georgia in an email of course what makes the u s so remarkable is that the president is by and large opposing his own policies professor mudde also notes that mr trump is raising expectations about a return to normalcy with his public support for the protests but could soon be confronted with a second outbreak in states that soften their lockdowns including georgia where he lives if that prompts a renewed tightening of lockdown measures he adds it could turn the protesters against the president one protester tom zawistowski of akron ohio is a longtime tea party activist and has opposed the restrictive actions of his state s republican governor mike dewine the governor has won praise for shutting down ohio early but to activists like mr zawistowski it s an abuse of power he points to a high infection rate in some ohio prisons but few deaths and believes both governor dewine and mr trump are overreacting to the virus and doing deep harm to the economy in the process i m going to keep asking questions mr zawistowski said friday as he prepared for a protest in columbus ohio the next day he indicated he would not wear a mask mr brandon of freedomworks rejects the no mask approach to the protests i know the press is gravitating toward people not wearing masks he says but that s not the majority of people at the protests that s totally out of our control we re advocating that anyone who shows up first and foremost needs to keep themselves safe in the world of covid get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox staff writer story hinckley contributed to this report from richmond
