elkhart indiana the head of the county democratic party was pleased that sen elizabeth warren wanted to be here democratic voters in this deep red part of the statetypically receive little attention from white house hopefuls so warren s decision to hold a town hall meeting here last weekcame as a bit of a surprise this was really good we are usually treated as a flyover state said elkhart county chairman chad crabtree as warren posed for photos and chatted with voters after delivering her speech and doing a q a session our primary isn t until mayand in past election cycles the party has often decided on the nominee by then so candidates don t give us a whole lot of attention like every election cycle of the past several decades voters in early contests such as iowa new hampshire south carolina and nevada are still getting the bulk of attention from the more than 20 democratic candidates vying to take on president trump in fact this 19 candidates travelled to iowa sunday to campaign at iowademocrat s annual hall of fame dinner but the unwieldy field of white house hopefuls in the early going of the 2020 campaign has shown a willingness to take some detours on their way to spaghetti dinners house parties and meet and greets in iowa and new hampshire democratic candidates already have made campaign appearances in two thirds of the states andthe top eight candidates in national polls have made more than 150 campaign appearances outside of the first four earlystates thus far according to a usa today review of candidate s campaign public schedules last week on the

councilsummit and i will vote gala democrats see georgia as a potential pickup in 2020 an enthusiasm fueled largely by democrat stacey abrams narrow defeat by republican brian kemp in the governor s race the four white house hopefuls comments in atlanta largely looked past georgia s primary and to the potential for democrats in the general election this is a blue state booker said of georgia which last voted for a democratic presidential candidate in 1996 and where every statewide office is held by a republican what that means is we need to go back to organizing and build a 50 state party iowa and new hampshire have long played outsized roles in the presidential nomination contests because of their first in the nation status a strong showing in either state can create momentum a poor performance or even failure to meet polling expectations set going into the voting can sink a campaign as a result candidates have poured disproportionate amounts of time and money into winning over voters in these states the dynamic can leave outsider voters particularly those in late voting primaries feeling irrelevant it is easy here to feel discounted and invisible said jessie hubble 35 who attended warren s elkhart event she is considering voting for either warren buttigieg orbiden it s really important for candidates to reach out so people who need to hear their messages can feel close multiple factors appear to be pushing candidates to take a broader approach to their strategy early in the election cycle said karen kedrowski director for thecarrie chapman catt center for women and politics at iowa state university kedrowski noted that in two of the last three election cycles the nominee didn t lock his or her nomination until deep into the nominating contests a fact that could be pushing candidates to think earlier about the long game barack obama in 2008 and hillary clinton in 2016 didn t become the presumptive nominees until june on the republican side trump won enough delegates to secure the nomination in late may but perhaps an even more important factor is that california the biggest and most delegate rich state has moved up its primary to march 3 the super tuesday election day when 12 other states and voters living abroadwill cast their ballot from its early june date of recent election cycles missed convention biden faces stiff criticism from democrats for skipping california convention the top eight candidates in national polling already have made at least 41 campaign related appearances in the state excluding fundraisers california with about 40 million residents and three top 20 television markets is a pricey state for candidates to compete in with 495 delegates distributed proportionately it could be a game changer for whomever wins the state i think what we re seeing is a california phenomenon kedrowski said other states are also getting early attention from democratic presidential candidates top tier candidates have made 13 campaign appearances at campaign events in texas which also will vote on super tuesday former rep beto o rourke visited northeast oklahoma on sunday to meet with communities that have been impacted by severe flooding sen amy klobuchar of minnesota has made stops in nebraska and north dakota where she s highlighted her expertise on agriculture issues with michigan s presidential primary 10 months away the state has been a magnet for white house hopefuls five leading candidates have made stops in michigan in addition to seven candidates struggling in the polls the state had the closest vote margin in the 2016 election trump won the general election inmichigan presidential by 10 704 votes the first republican to win the state since 1988 michigan was one of three midwest states pennsylvania and wisconsin are the others to flip to the republicans in 2016 by narrow margins they providedtrump enough to seal his electoral victory it s probably good for the legitimacy of the process said kedrowski the iowa state political scientist of candidates campaigning further afield i can tell you sitting here in iowa we re not being neglected contributing kathleen gray andkeith
