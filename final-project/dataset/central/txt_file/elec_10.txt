mcgowen a political science professor at university of richmond said that while democrats won virginia likely won t see aradically progressive policy shift don t expect socialism mcgowen said even thoughthey re democrats they re probably more conservative than the average democrat in the country the democratic wins also signal the party s strength and recovery afterblackface scandals and sexual assault allegations rocked the state s executive offices earlier this year we ve moved forward from that northam said on cnn wednesday morning this was about a bigger picture yesterday the party was in chaos and many feared they had lost major campaigners and fundraisers in an election year after northam and attorney general mark herring both admitted to wearing blackface and lt governor justin fairfax faced sexual assault allegations from two women said rozell however the democrats image recovered with the governor s approval rating nearing 50 according to a washington post george mason

party holding power in the d c suburbs and the loss further solidifiesvirginia s blue trend turnout was high in the suburbs which may signal trouble elsewhere for president donald trump mcgowen said it may be a signalto president trump that people are energized by the stakes of the election he said democrats will now be able to do things that they have been frustrated that republicans have been blocking including passing new gun laws coleman said more virginia elections she flipped off trump and lost her job now she just won a local office guns were the most important voting issues this

groups advocating for gun control had flooded virginia with campaign donations aiding the democrats victories democratic hopefuls for the 2020 presidential race also stumped in virginia and vice president mike pence campaigned as well however don t expect virginia to seriously be in play for the 2020 race analysts said in the obama era virginia used to be one of the bellwether states coleman said now i can t see a situation where in the electoral college next year where virginia would be in a position to provide the decisive electoral votes he added the swing doesn t swing very far any more mcgowen said of virginia s apparent former status as a swing state north carolina now may prove to be more of a true battleground state and mcgowen said democrats could shift some of their virginia resources south with the 2020 census looming too democrats can lead the way on redrawing the district maps again and create lines more favorable to the party while some democrats may have pushed for a good government approach ofnon partisan lines rozell expects partisanship to continue with the map the pattern has been that the party out of power talks a good game on redistricting but once they re in power they go full in to protect their position rozell said if democrats do it right by a partisan standard they can solidify their majority for a long time the question on whether virginia is a blue or purple state will be basically over contributing the associated press follow usa today s ryan miller on twitter ryanw miller
