care for minorities going forward loading may 1 2020 mayor van johnson made a lot of unpopular decisions in aggressively shutting down savannah georgia to blunt the spread of coronavirus and he s not about to apologize savannah is 54 black and he s seen too much evidence recently and over the years that black health outcomes in america are worse than for other groups covid 19 exploited what we already knew if you were poor if you were darker if you were less educated if you did not have a home you were going to be disproportionately affected by this he says figures in georgia and beyond show these trends playing out black leaders note anecdotally that some community members didn t take the virus seriously early on but the problems now center around a lack of access to health care and historic distrust of the system now mr johnson s approach is starting to win converts in savannah and more broadly the need is for treatment that goes beyond medical care to building relationships says lisa price stevens chief medical officer of a virginia facility those relationships do everything when you talk about health back in early march shortly after mardi gras had raged in new orleans and florida welcomed spring breakers savannah mayor van johnson made an unpopular decision he canceled the second largest st patrick s day parade in the country it fit with the democratic mayor s early response to the covid 19 pandemic which was as aggressive as that of any civic leader in the south at the time he issued his city s stay at home order on march 19 more than two weeks before the statewide order in early april he closed non essential businesses including barber shops and beauty salons cracking down on 30 businesses that refused to close he ordered police drones to disperse street parties and he even broke up a fight at a local walmart which he said had become a version of the club a replacement for the loss of evening revelries editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall residents bristled at the early shutdown calling the mayor a tyrant and sending him about 2 000 mostly critical messages but mr johnson had a different perspective back when he first issued his stay at home order startling racial disparities in the country s coronavirus cases were just gaining attention now they are in stark relief black residents make up less than a third of georgia s population but account for more than half its covid 19 fatalities a trend seen nationwide some causes are seen as particular to this pandemic with a number of black leaders noting anecdotally that members of the community weren t taking the virus seriously early on but the deeper problems are chronic with the coronavirus merely amplifying long standing inequities from a lack of access to care to the related dearth of trust in the health system what this virus did was it exploited every weakness we ve had in our socioeconomic system every single one says mr johnson it exploited what we already knew if you were poor if you were darker if you were less educated if you did not have a home you were going to be disproportionately affected by this the national figures bear that out that was why he acted the way he did a lot of people are just like why we got to talk about race he adds we have to talk about race the problem is that we haven t been talking about race all of those things become very very real to us indeed at least part of mayor johnson s actions sprang from the experience of his own family his father sister and brother in law who live in new york city had each contracted the virus a deacon at his church had died now mr johnson s approach is coming into conflict with his governor s georgia gov brian kemp a republican announced the state among the last to issue a stay at home order would begin to restart its economy last week gyms bowling alleys tattoo parlors as well as hair salons and barbershops were allowed to reopen on april 24 with strict social distancing rules a move the savannah mayor called reckless premature and dangerous savannah which is 54 black has seen its cases stabilize its numbers have also been more evenly distributed across racial groups that has helped change the attitudes of many of savannah s black residents early resistance has shifted to solid support and kinder messages the mayor says this virus ain t racist says bobby lewis pitmaster at randy s bbq a popular local haunt that has stayed open for delivery and pickup no one is immune everybody has to step up as a community we re trying to get from where we ve been to where we need to be he adds van johnson s attitude has been a big part of that not everybody likes it but i do i think it s working that blunt message was needed some say when covid first came out there really was a sense that this is not a black people s disease because it started in china and went to europe says sandra elizabeth ford head of the dekalb and fulton county health departments in georgia that perception has changed since march a number of national polls have indicated that black and hispanic americans have been more concerned about the virus than white americans thepew research center found that 43 of hispanics and 31 of black adults said they were very concerned about contracting covid 19 compared with 18 of white adults there are so many dimensions that matter for african americans with this pandemic says alford young a sociologist at the university of michigan in ann arbor every social and health related and structural factor in their lives exacerbates their exposure to the virus african americans live in smaller spaces and in more densely populated communities dr young continues what s more the extended family for the black community is about as intimate as the immediate family for a lot of other americans when african americans check in on their family they re thinking cousins uncles my aunts grandparents not just siblings and parents at home the racial disparities seen in the covid 19 pandemic are nothing new and stem from structural inequities woven into american society for decades if not centuries scholars say for example the deliberate redlining of black neighborhoods to exclude them from federal programs to purchase homes has chronically depressed black wealth with education funding based on local property taxes that has contributed to underresourced schools these economic stresses have made it hard for hospitals and health clinics to survive too few residents have health insurance and medicare and medicaid simply can t pay the bills all these factors contribute to the greater vulnerability of minority populations in general and during a pandemic in particular we have an economy where you re going to see people of color disproportionately working low paying service jobs where they are essential workers but they may not be getting the rightprotective equipment says andra gillespie a political scientist at emory university in atlanta but then there is ok if you re going to ignore congregation bans and go to a party that s not race specific but just individual dumb behavior what can we empower people to do to be their own best advocate and their own defense against contracting this disease against so manysystemic odds she asks one answer is to help build trust in the health care system among black americans there s a level of distrust that s rooted in history and in lived experiences that makes it more difficult for life saving messages to get through to these communities says jamila michener professor of government at cornell university in ithaca new york that is a big reason why lisa price stevens became a doctor in the first place she s wanted to be a doctor ever since at age 7 she saw her mother save another family member with the heimlich maneuver as physicians we are innately concerned about the health care disparities and racial disparities we re seeing and particularly as an african american physician this is a passion of mine says dr stevens chief medical officer at jencare senior medical center in norfolk virginia her patients are among those most vulnerable lower income medicare eligible seniors over half of whom are people of color so treatment includes more than just medical care we work in care teams where we address the social determinants of our patient s health with social workers and case managers so that we not only address the holistic caring of the mind body and soul we re looking at where do you live housing is health how do you obtain your nutrition so i can manage your diabetes dr stevens says those relationships do everything when you talk about health she adds it s one of the reasons mayor johnson has turned things around in savannah get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox i don t live in a spirit of fear i m not going to be intimidated he continues the vast majority of
