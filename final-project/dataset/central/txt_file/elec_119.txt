fundraiser for christie the event had all the typical trappings of a trump rally with supporters wearing the trademark hats or holding signs that the silent majority stands with trump at times trump rambled moving from topic to topic at whim but striking all his familiar themes the economy trump suggested imposing a 35 tax on all products shipped to the u s by american companies who leave for cheaper pastures in other nations as president of the united states am i allowed to call the president of a company only one time it ll only take one call he said and when the crowd began chanting

build a wall so big that if they ever get up there they re going to say whoa how do i get down trump said but for trump to be successful he ll have to win over those voting for clinton or sanders
