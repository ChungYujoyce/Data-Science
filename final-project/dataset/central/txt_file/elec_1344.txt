is likely to lead the news cycle in the daysto come following the monday affair both donald trump apos s and hillary clinton apos s backers and surrogates provided plenty of thoughts on the contest which polls from cnn and politico morning consult showed viewers believed the former secretary of statewon handily those tasked with representing their respective candidates in the spin room following the titanic debate set the agenda for the presidential discussion that is until trump and clinton square off for a second time on october 9 with that said here are 33 comments from the spin room that say everything about monday apos s presidential debate yeah absolutely i think when they got over to foreign policy he ended up i think spendingway too much time responding to her if he kept on the high ground there she is a failure as a secretary of state sen david perdue of georgia on if he felt there was anything donald trump could improve on for the second debate listen he was making a side comment he did that throughout the night what he was talking about was making sure that you know he apos s not paying too much in taxes but i thought he handled that right gop chair reince priebus responding to donald trumpsayinghe was smart for not paying federal taxes he needs to shorten his answers to be a little more succinct on tax policy or other things he was having a conversation but inthat format i think if he could be a little tighter when he talked about the tax code and making sure that people have more money left at the end of the year it could be said in a lot fewer words than he said it he meandered tonight rep chris collins of new york a backer of donald trump onhow the manhattan billionaire can improve his debate performance i think he came off as a romney style plutocrat he defended the idea of not paying taxes like that was a smart move clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon on donald trumpsayinghe was smart for not paying federal taxes look at some point you have to respect the fact that you apos re american and you have an obligation to contribute to our society mark cuban on donald trumpsayinghe was smart for not paying federal taxes and god knows how many pages they are and people would say apos why didn apos t he give more money here what happened with this partnership apos with six weeks to go rep chris collins of new york a backer of donald trump explaining why trump shouldn apos t release his tax returns i think that he struggles with transparency about his business dealings i think he has worked the system particularly the legal system with bankruptcies and stiffing contractors and i think he apos s proud of that i think he sees that as being an aggressive and smart businessman i think most americans see it as it feels like the rules don apos t apply to him sen claire mccaskill of missouri on donald trump saying he apos s smart for not paying federal taxes i felt like we pretty much cleared that up what i thought wasn apos t fair was that we didn apos t get to talk about the clinton foundation we didn apos t talk about benghazi we didn apos t talk about the email scandal we got to talk about all the attacks that hillary apos s camp has made on donald trump and pretty much ignored most of the big attacks that have been hit on hillary over the last several weeks senior trump adviser sarah huckabee sanders on donald trump apos s answer to the birther question i thought the format was most strange i thought lester holt lost control early on and from that point on it was almost kind of a free for all about how the comments went back and forth and how the topics were covered just kind of strange rep chris collins of new york a backer of donald trump on the debate format i thought she did an eloquentjob of talking aboutsome of the challenges in the african american community and howdisrespectful donald trump has been by assuming that black people are voting for democrats because they apos re stupid notbecause democrats arepresenting policies like pell grants and other things that really help provide more opportunities and invest in those communities sen claire mccaskillof missourion hillary clinton apos s answer onthe racial divide in the us no not at all i think he was restrained i think donald trump did a great job and i think he showed the american people who actually want to pick the change candidate and they want to see the next president of the united states on stage and that apos s what they saw tonight gop chair reince priebus on if donald trump was overly aggressive during the debate what apos s amazing to me is she had all of these plans tonight all of these details she remembered every detail right but 39 times when the fbi asked her whether she remembered anything about how she was trained at the state department whether she even took training anything she heard about emails she couldn apos t recall 39 times she couldn apos t remember a darn thing that apos s the hillary clinton that we know gop chair reince priebus on hillary clinton apos s debate performance i thought she was far more presidential he had to keep on interrupting and she just kept on point that apos s what i think would happen on a global setting dealing with other countries mark cuban addressing donald trump apos s interruptions of hillary clinton i think it apos s donaldtrump the human being being very relaxed that apos s what a human being would do if you apos re saying something about me that i don apos t like i apos m going to interrupt you i actually thought a couple of times it was strange that she didn apos t interrupt him maybe she over prepared or didn apos t expect the format we ended up with rep chris collins of new york a backer of donald trump addressing trump apos s interruptions of hillary clinton i think it apos s outrageous that lester holt interfered in a legal discussion he knows nothing about on the side of hillary clinton and i didn apos t see him once interfere on the side of donald trump he should be ashamed of himself former new york city mayor rudy giuliani on lester holt apos s performance as debate moderator there were a lot of articles written six weeks ago apos look at the polls the race is over look at the polls the race is over apos i would say now look at the polls the race is on it apos s particularly on in states that barack obama carriedtwice wheremitt romney and john mccain both lost and they weren apos t squeakers place like pennsylvania ohio florida colorado nevada new hampshire kellyanne conway donald trump apos s campaign manager onthe tightening polls leading up to the debate i don apos t think anyone should release their tax returns i apos m just glad when donald trump doesn apos t release them we apos ll be done with this once and for all rep chris collins of new york a backer of donald trump ontrump saying he was smart for not paying federal income taxes i think lester holt did a fine job there are many issues i wish had been covered but there apos s only so much you can do in 90 minutes i was glad that mr trump raised hillary clinton apos s emails because otherwise i apos m not sure it would apos ve been he was the one who raised her emails which is very much on america apos s minds kellyanne conway donald trump apos s campaign manager on lester holt apos s performance as the debate moderator she was cool calm collected and he was flustered he was really really flustered mark cuban apos s initial take on the debate hillary blew it open in the first quarter trump had a better second quarter and then hillary ran away with it in the third quarter mark cuban apos s analysis on how the debate progressed i think he was making his point and again he was drawing the contrast he is an unconventional candidate because he apos s not a scripted career politician hillary clinton is i think she came across as robotic and cold senior trump adviser sarah huckabee sanders on donald trump apos s interruptions of hillary clinton i love the fact that he restrained himself tonight and he was a gentleman towards her especially toward the end when she was doing the thingshe apos s done a million times in paid advertisements and in the mail pieces in florida that we apos ve seen about things he apos s said here and there about women or a woman here and there over 25 years or 30 years he definitely could apos ve gone where a lot ofamerica was thinking he shouldor could go which is to talk about her husband and women and he did not and he restrained himself you know what restraint is a virtue and certainly a presidential virtue and i think many voters particularly women probably saw that and respected that a great deal kellyanne conway donald trump apos s campaign manager on his threat to discuss bill clinton apos s past near the end of the debate she clearly struck a nerve by pointing out thathis business career was launched in part thanks to a loan from his father and she wants to build an economy that empowers people that don apos t have that fortune and that clearly got under his skin from that point on his debate performance got more and more unsteady he doubled down on a bunch of lies from birtherism to his position on the iraq war clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon on donald trump apos s meltdown mitt romney was prepared mitt romney was qualified mitt romney did not spend the entire debate talking about himself instead of the american people mitt romney was a worthy foe to president barack obama in american politics this guy is almost breaking his arm patting himself on the back no specificity on how he apos s going to help the american people just that he apos s wonderful and everything is going to be great i think it apos s very unfair to compare him to mitt romney sen claire mccaskill of missouri on comparisons between mitt romney and donald trump it was hard to tell he was concentrating the whole time mark cuban who drew controversy after announcing he was seated in the front row addressing whether donald trump ever glanced at him during the debate well i think he did exactly what he needed to do he came out he looked presidential and he drew a very clear contrast with hillary clinton as the change agent in the race she apos s the status quo hillary has no credibility talking about what she will do what she apos s accomplished senior trump adviser sarah huckabee sanders on donald trump apos s debate performance well there are two ways to look at that one is at its face value but what i apos ve heard him say before is this these are tax codes that incentivize people to invest and you get a deduction for that and you also get tax credits for that so there are companies and individuals who reduce their tax liability by investing in the things those bureaucrats the very people that she apos s talking about herself as a senator that voted for things that get people the incentive to invest that puts money at risk it creates jobs it creates economic growth so just because somebody doesn apos t pay that level of tax and by the way you apos re talking to somebody that pays 38 over 10years that was my effective tax rate so i apos ve been on both sides of this but i have to tell you is that what he said is not incorrect now he should apos ve explained it a little bit more because the flip side of that is the reason these bureaucrats and politicians put incentives in there is they want people like donald trump to put their personal money at risk and invest capital to get the economy growing sen david perdue of georgia on donald trump saying he was smart for not paying federal taxes i thought it was a pretty commanding victory i think she followed the economic argument perfectly and i think he had a meltdown on stage clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon on whether hillary clinton can improve in any areas ahead of the second debate well again trump supporters aren apos t changing their minds tonight and clinton supporters aren apos t the undecidedssaw a human being in donald trump he was relaxed he spoke like a human being if he didn apos t like something she said he let people know if she said something untrue he let people know better fact check that he was very human hillary on the other hand seemed a bit rattled by the format or by him interrupting her at times and she seemed to be struggling as to what to say or do that was my sense rep chris collins of new york a backer of donald trump on how the first debate went was he well enough prepared yes of course well clearly hillary clinton jammed her head full of facts and figures for us and she was dying for all of us to hear tonight kellyanne conway donald trump apos s campaign manager after being asked if he prepared for the debate i think it apos s a grand slam home run for donald trump let me tell you why in the first 10 minutes he laid out the difference the stark contrast between what hillary clinton offers as the direction of this country and what he offers sen david perdue of georgia on donald trump apos s debate performance i think he makes the point and this is something hillary clinton can apos t run away from she deny the fact she wants to deny the fact that that entire conversation didn apos t start with her campaign and a lot of you don apos t want that to be the case but it is true that deputy campaign manager did go on cnn and apologize for what happened and she did admit that she fired the staffer in iowa sid blumenthal did shop around the story the guy from mcclatchy made it clear that that was true mark penn did write that memo so she should apologize she should apologize gop chair reince priebus on donald trump apos s answer to the birther question and whether he should apologize for leading the birther movement against president barack obama awesome clinton campaign spokesman brian fallon giving one word to describe the debate
