of those affected coronavirus creates only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough with the vast majority recovering from the virus according to the world health organization people with mild illness recover in about two weeks while those with more severe ailments may take three to six weeks to rebound in mainland china where the virus first exploded more than 80 000 people have been diagnosed but more than 60 000 already have recovered because the difference in impact can be so great global health authorities have the difficult task of alerting the public to the virus dangers
