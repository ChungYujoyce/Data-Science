fair minded readers of justice department inspector general michael horowitz s report detailing his investigation of the fbi s decision to open its crossfire hurricane investigation into potential links between russia and multiple trump campaign aides should be experiencing a dash of d j vu for the second time this year a comprehensive report has cleared an important american institution of the worst form of misconduct but at the same time exposed wrongdoing that should deeply trouble americans of both political parties the mueller report revealed that america did not face a true catastrophe the spectacle of an american presidential campaign in an active conspiracy with arguably our nation s most dangerous geopolitical foe but it did detail an avalanche of lies and deeply troubling attempts by members of the trump campaign to solicit help from russians and russian assets yet partisans spun the report as a vindication of trump and refused to utter even a peep of criticism for a campaign that at the very least was guilty of seeking an enemy s assistance similarly the ig report spares america from having to confront the dreadful possibility that the fbi fabricated a politicized investigation as part of a nakedly partisan and unlawful effort to unseat a lawfully elected president this is the deep state coup theory so often repeated by the president himself and too many of his partisan supporters according to horowitz the fbi had an authorized purpose when it opened crossfire hurricane and he reached that conclusion even though the investigation also had the potential to impact constitutionally protected activity moreover horowitz did not find documentary or testimonial evidence that political bias or improper motivation influenced the decision to open either crossfire hurricane or the fbi s four individual investigations of carter page george papadopoulos michael flynn or paul manafort u s attorney john durham tasked by attorney general bill barr to investigate the origins of the probe of trump s campaign immediately issued an unusual and cryptic statement declaring that we do not agree with some of the report s conclusions as to predication and how the fbi case was opened but in the absence of any actual evidence rebutting the inspector general horowitz s conclusions regarding an authorized purpose for the investigation and the absence of improper motivation are unambiguously good news but the ig did not write a 434 page report to praise the fbi instead when he describes the effort to obtain and then later renew a foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa warrant against former trump campaign adviser carter page he details a series of omissions that were frankly staggering in scope the fisa warrant and the warrant renewals relied a great deal on the dossier of accusations against trump and his campaign gathered by christopher steele a former british intelligence officer who was gathering information on donald trump at the behest of the hillary clinton campaign the campaign s lawyers had employed a firm called fusion gps to conduct opposition research on trump and fusion gps retained steele this fact had been widely reported and the fbi had absorbed considerable criticism for relying on a dossier that ultimately proved to wildly wrong in many key respects horowitz s report however disclosed a considerable amount of new information including the fact in its initial fisa application the fbi had overstated the significance of steele s past reporting to the fbi failed to include information relevant to the reliability of a key steele sub source including that steele himself had told the fbi information that harmed the sub source s credibility and failed to include a number of statements by page and george papodopoulos denying collaboration with russia and contradicting claims made in the steele dossier when the fbi renewed the page fisa three more times horowitz reports that the fbi made 10 additional significant errors in the three renewal applications the most shocking are the findings that the fbi withheld from the fisa court the fact that page had a prior relationship with another u s government agency and that an fbi attorney actually altered an email from the other agency to indicate that page was not a source for the other agency as the wall street journal editorial board notes the fbi was using mr page s russian contacts as evidence against him to the fisa court even as the other agency considered his reports on those russians to be helpful to the u s the errors and omissions in the fisa applications were hardly the end of the fbi s misdeeds even after the fbi terminated steele as a source department of justice attorney bruce ohr communicated with steele and ohr met with members of the crossfire hurricane team 13 times between november 21 2016 and may 15 2017 regarding his contacts with steele and fusion gps owner glenn simpson ohr s wife was an independent contractor with fusion gps from october 2015 to september 2016 horowitz recommended that the doj s office of professional responsibility and ohr s supervisors should review the ig findings and take any action they deem appropriate keep in mind this misconduct occurred in one of the most politically sensitive and ultimately high profile investigations in modern american history at a time when the fbi should have been extraordinarily focused on doing everything by the book this raises the question if the fbi behaved like this in an investigation as consequential as crossfire hurricane how does it behave in other investigations it turns out that horowitz wants to know because of the extensive compliance failures identified in this review the inspector general believes additional oig oversight work is required to assess the fbi s compliance with department and fbi fisa related policies that seek to protect the civil liberties of u s persons while this additional oversight work is welcome congress should go further it should consider meaningful fisa reform in october the american civil liberties union and more than 40 other organizations including organizations on the left and the right sent a letter to congress seeking changes to section 702 of the foreign intelligence surveillance act that would increase privacy protections for all americans statutory change would represent a concrete positive step in response to a concrete defined wrong americans are rightly dispirited in the face of fbi misconduct and trump campaign misdeeds it seems that heroes can be hard to find but if there is any silver lining in the dark cloud of 2016 it s that our institutions still do produce men like robert mueller and michael horowitz dogged investigators who revealed important truths the ball is now in the american people s court will we demand better out of presidential campaigns and law enforcement agencies or will we merely use the misdeeds as ammunition in the ceaseless war of partisan charges and counter charges that s the choice that we ll face now in 2020 and beyond contact us at editors time com
