president donald trump gave his first primetime address from the oval office on tuesday night to pitch his border wall to the american public the address came amid a partial government shutdown in its third week with no clear end in sight during his address trump called the flow of migrants across the u s mexico border a crisis and said 5 7 billion was needed to build the wall and fund additional security measures he called on democrats to support to wall and end the shutdown democrats led by house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer have refused to support funding the wall they reiterated their opposition to the border in a speech following trump s address time has a fact check of many of trump s assertions about immigration read the full transcript of trump s oval office address below my fellow americans tonight i am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border every day customs and border patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country we are out of space to hold them and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country america proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation but all americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration it strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages among those hardest hit are african americans and hispanic americans our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth heroin cocaine and fentanyl every week 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border more americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire vietnam war in the last two years ice officers made 266 000 arrests of aliens with criminal records including those charged or convicted of 100 000 assaults 30 000 sex crimes and 4 000 violent killings over the years thousands of americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don t act right now this is a humanitarian crisis a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul last month 20 000 migrant children were illegally brought into the united states a dramatic increase these children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs one in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through mexico women and children are the biggest victims by far of our broken system this is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border this is the cycle of human suffering that i am determined to end my administration has presented congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs drug smugglers and human traffickers it s a tremendous problem our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the department of homeland security these are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep america safe in fact safer than ever before the proposal from homeland security includes cutting edge technology for detecting drugs weapons illegal contraband and many other things we have requested more agents immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support furthermore we have asked congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home finally as part of an overall approach to border security law enforcement professionals have requested 5 7 billion for a physical barrier at the request of democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall this barrier is absolutely critical to border security it s also what our professionals at the border want and need this is just common sense the border wall would very quickly pay for itself the cost of illegal drugs exceeds 500 billion a year vastly more than the 5 7 billion we have requested from congress the wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with mexico senator chuck schumer who you will be hearing from later tonight has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other democrats they changed their mind only after i was elected president democrats in congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation the federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only because democrats will not fund border security my administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation but the only solution is for democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and re opens the government this situation could be solved in a 45 minute meeting i have invited congressional leadership to the white house tomorrow to get this done hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security some have suggested a barrier is immoral then why do wealthy politicians build walls fences and gates around their homes they don t build walls because they hate the people on the outside but because they love the people on the inside the only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized america s heart broke the day after christmas when a young police officer in california was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border the life of an american hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country day after day precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders in california an air force veteran was raped murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history in georgia an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing beheading and dismembering his neighbor in maryland ms 13 gang members who arrived in the united states as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16 year old girl over the last several years i ve met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration i ve held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers so sad so terrible i will never forget the pain in their eyes the tremble in their voices and the sadness gripping their souls how much more american blood must we shed before congress does its job to those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security i would ask imagine if it was your child your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken to every member of congress pass a bill that ends this crisis to every citizen call congress and tell them to finally after all of these decades secure our border this is a choice between right and wrong justice and injustice this is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the american citizens we serve when i took the oath of office i swore to protect our country and that is what i will always do so help me god thank you and goodnight write to gina martinez at gina martinez time com
