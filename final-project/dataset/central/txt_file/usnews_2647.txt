as a caffeine magnate howard schultz the billionaire former ceo of starbucks spent decades causing americans to lose sleep in the few days since he indicated a strong desire to run for president schultz has contributed to an extra dose of insomnia to the many democrats who dread a second term for president donald trump seeing as schultz is a self proclaimed lifelong democrat the reflective forecast from the sidelines has largely been that a well funded schultz candidacy would poach enough votes from whoever winds up as the actual democratic candidate that trump would waltz to victory this seems like a reasonable conclusion but it ignores a much safer one there is no accounting for the tangled and largely unreadable psychology of the american voter particularly when it comes to third party candidates what we do know is that putting aside the sui generis case of the 2000 presidential election it is uncommon for a third party candidate of any persuasion to spoil even a very close election unless you make some absurd assumptions most recently there was some speculation as to whether green party candidate jill stein tipped the scales to trump by siphoning off just enough votes from hillary clinton to hand trump narrow victories in pennsylvania michigan and wisconsin we can game this out pretty easily by making two estimates rather than invent figures for those two variables for which exit polling is absolutely useless i calculated every possible combination of values in 5 point intervals from 0 to 100 the following grid shows the percentage of stein supporters who would otherwise have voted for clinton or trump on the horizontal axis and how those voters would have split between clinton and trump on the vertical axis from 0 universal support for trump to 100 every vote going to clinton you can tap or click individual squares to see the electoral college outcome for each pair of values stein placeholder these calculations apply the turnout and party preference figures for each square to every state individually adding varying portions of stein s votes to both clinton and trump and recomputing the electoral college vote whenever a state flips as you can see green party voters could have turned over the election to clinton only in the unlikely event that virtually all of them showed up on election day and voted democratic instead only michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin were close enough to flip if clinton could have absorbed almost all of stein s voters who totaled 1 457 218 nationwide the 1992 election is more interesting because ross perot who like schultz was an extremely wealthy businessman with no political bone fides won 19 of the popular vote a tremendous windfall for a modern third party candidate but even perot s 19 7 million voters are very unlikely to have handed a reelection to president george h w bush a fellow texan unless they showed up in large numbers and contributed very little to clinton s state totals here s the same chart from 1992 perot placeholder as a thought experiment what if someone like schultz had run in 2016 here s where things get interesting with two businessman and political neophytes in the race one of whom trump was the republican nominee and the other running as an independent it s impossible to predict how voters would have reacted instead of imagining how an existing candidate s voters would have split between clinton and trump we can reverse the scale and estimate how many votes this hypothetical independent would have drawn away from the major tickets here s a scenario that estimates the third party candidate s share of the popular vote from 0 to 25 percent horizontal axis and how many votes he or she would have drawn from trump versus clinton with 0 being all from clinton and 100 being all from trump vertical axis since this scale is measuring votes subtracted instead of votes added as in the two charts above it measures trump s losses instead of clinton s gains to be visually consistent wildcard placeholder here we see a much more volatile scenario even if this ur schultz candidate drew 5 percent of the popular vote from clinton and trump with just a 60 40 split in clinton s favor the election would have flipped these calculations assume that the hypothetical third party candidate s votes are all drawn from the existing national total in 2016 and accounts for the fact that about 6 percent of his or her voters would be drawn from other third party candidates any new supporters who otherwise wouldn t have voted would not change the outcome the schultz question then becomes a lot hazier and far less of a mortal prophecy for democrats should the former ceo run but never catch on his vote total will be insufficient to make any difference should he perform in the ballpark of ross perot in 1992 he could absolutely play a spoiler role we just have no idea as to the identity of the spoilee it is perfectly plausible that a sizable number of trump s supporters in 2016 while averse to voting for the democratic nominee now find trump sufficiently distasteful to vote for a different businessman even if he is a lifelong democrat so long as it doesn t say so on the ballot some voters are hyper educated on the candidates some are faithfully devoted to a party some check in around nov 1 and a few vote for jesus as a write in those who didn t vote for the republican or democratic candidate likely did so for a reason and a fair portion were probably aware that their candidate of choice would not win that s a lot of probablies and as many synonyms as i could locate enough that seeing as schultz is perfectly entitled to run if he wants given that he was born in the united states and over the age of 35 those who d prefer trump to be a one term president might be advised to take a breath and see his possible candidacy as an opportunity write to chris wilson at chris wilson time com
