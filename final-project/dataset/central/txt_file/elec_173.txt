democrats and republicans agree on this year it s the fact that the next president will face enormous challenges domestically this president must work with congress in confronting the issues of immigration health care increased threats to national security the disappearing middle class the growing deficit social security solvency gun control renewable energy sentencing reform and more on the world stage this president will have to work with foreign leaders in dealing with isis and other terrorists climate change the containment of nuclear threats posed in north korea and iran the russian incursions in ukraine and foreign trade the presidency is not an entry level position whoever is sworn into office next january must demonstrate not only a deep understanding of the issues facing america but also possess the diplomatic skills that enable presidents to forge alliances to get things done by that measure democrats have one outstanding candidate deserving of their support hillary clinton no other candidate can match the depth or breadth of her knowledge and experience as first lady she worked tirelessly on health care reform and with bipartisan support created the children s health insurance program that provides coverage for 8 million children as a senator she reached across party lines and joined forces with conservatives including sen lindsey graham and former house speaker newt gingrich to fight for job creation and universal health care endorsement marco rubio can chart new direction for gop nash register faced tough decision in endorsements related a history of register caucus endorsements video how the iowa caucuses work as secretary of state she helped secure international sanctions against iran and redefined her job by expanding america s diplomatic agenda to include poverty women s rights the environment and other issues she is not a perfect candidate as evidenced the way she has handled the furor over her private email server in our endorsement of her 2008 campaign for president we wrote that when she makes a mistake she should just say so that appears to be a lesson she has yet to fully embrace the des moines register editorial board announces its endorsement of hillary clinton for the democratic nomination for president her changing stance on gay marriage immigration and other issues has invited accusations that she is guided less by personal conviction than by political calculations she refutes that and argues persuasively that a willingness to change one s thinking on specific issues while remaining true to what she calls the same values and principles is a virtue one lacking in most politicians over the course of two meetings clinton spent more than three hours with the editorial board answering questions in a direct and forthright manner she exhibited an impressive command of the issues though we d have liked to hear more from her on the debt and the future of social security she was somewhat prickly and defensive when discussing her emails but overall she was gracious engaging and personable her chief opponent for the nomination sen bernie sanders of vermont has proven to be an honorable and formidable campaigner and it s very likely that without him in the race candidates in both parties wouldn t be discussing america s growing inequality in wealth and income sanders has tapped into the public s anger and frustration with washington without demonizing government and resorting to the cheap demagoguery favored by donald trump and others he has shown himself to be a man of courage and principle who has the ability to rally others to his cause a link has been posted to your facebook feed but sanders admits that virtually all of his plans for reform have no chance of being approved by a congress that bears any resemblance to the current crop of federal lawmakers this is why he says voters can t simply elect him president but must instead spark a political revolution easier said than done congress has the largest republican majority since the 71st congress of 1929 31 a successful sanders presidency would hinge on his ability to remake washington in his own image it s almost inconceivable that such a transformation could take place even with democrats controlling both chambers of congress as for martin o malley the data driven wonkish former maryland governor who has gained little traction in the campaign so far he seems better suited to a cabinet level job in a clinton white house in the final analysis iowa democrats will have to choose between the lofty idealism of bernie sanders and the down to earth pragmatism of hillary clinton for some this will be a choice of whether to vote with their hearts or their heads clinton has demonstrated that she is a thoughtful hardworking public servant who has earned the respect of leaders at home and abroad she stands ready to take on the most demanding job in the world david chivers president and publisher
