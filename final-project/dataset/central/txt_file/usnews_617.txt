alaska gov mike dunleavy thinks he has a solution to years of state budget shortfalls from shrinking oil industry revenue on june 28 he used his veto power to slash more than 440 million from the state s budget the cuts are wide ranging but the university of alaska will take the biggest single hit with more than 40 of its state funding 130 million gone critics say the cuts will only hurt alaska s economy which is recovering now after three straight years of employment declines even more dunleavy is basically choosing to enter a recession nolan klouda the director for the center for economic development at the university of alaska anchorage tells time the cuts are not just meant to plug a gap in the state budget which is largely due to lower revenue from the oil industry since 1982 every full time alaska resident has received a dividend check from the state s 64 billion alaska permanent fund which was established to manage the revenue from the state s oil wealth in recent years permanent fund dividend pfd payments have ranged between 1 022 and 1 600 but dunleavy has promised alaskans about 3 000 this year what he says they should be getting if money from the permanent fund was not being siphoned off to help prop up the state budget as income from the oil industry has shrunk with the falling price of oil over the past several years we have used 14 billion from our savings to subsidize the government this situation everyone agrees is not sustainable dunleavy a republican and former school teacher said in a statement announcing the cuts on thursday state lawmaker failed to override the veto in part because many republicans who side with dunleavy refused to even go to the state capital in juneau instead they met in the anchorage suburb of wasilla klouda and mouchine guettabi a professor of economics and public policy at the university of alaska anchorage published an analysis that they said shows the cuts will hurt the state s economic fortunes their report is not without self interest the university of alaska system will have to lay off up to 1 300 faculty and staff cut programs and close campuses as a result of the cuts officials have said the university system will likely lose about 3 of its student enrollment klouda and guettabi s report says the researchers also estimate 4 200 jobs will be eliminated from alaska just in the short term because of the medicaid reductions in the governor s budget cuts health care providers will also receive less revenue which will result in workers being laid off the professors analysis says all of this is likely to worsen the state s brain drain as students and professionals move elsewhere the researchers said the cuts to the university will also effect employers ability to hire skilled graduates which according to the researchers analysis will harm alaska s economy in the long term aside from the university and healthcare the state will also cut the senior benefits program which provides monthly payments of 250 to low income senior citizens as a result of the governor s actions the state s labor unions advocates for the low income alaskans and even some business groups are lobbying state lawmakers to veto the cuts you ve got labor banking environmentalists and so many groups are all coming together trying to fight this veto never have all these factions come together like this vince beltrami the president of alaska s american federation of labor and congress industrial organizations afl cio tells time alaska s economy has been reeling from years of employment declines that started in october 2015 with the drop in oil prices alaska doesn t have a very diverse economy it s like a three legged stool you have federal spending oil and then everything else like tourism mining and fishing klouda says it s easy for one of those to shock the economy between october 2015 and september 2018 more than 12 000 jobs were lost in alaska our budget should be sustainable predictable and affordable dunleavy said in the statement announcing the cuts these vetoes should not come as a surprise to alaskans as they have been part of our proposal since february klouda says that there are better solutions out there like implementing statewide sales or income taxes or cutting back on the amount of the permanent fund dividend check this really only has downside potential klouda says this is more of a policy fix and not really an economy one write to josiah bates at josiah bates time com
