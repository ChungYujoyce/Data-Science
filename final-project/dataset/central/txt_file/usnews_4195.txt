involved as a public defender at a speech before the rainbow push coalitionthe day after the debate biden attempted to bat down harris criticism on busing he tried to downplay their debate tussle by arguing that 30 to 60 seconds on a campaign debate exchange can t do justice to a lifetime committed to civil rights biden was warmly received by the predominantly african american audience you have to weigh the entirety of what the person has done over the course of his career said joe nelson 76 a retired chicago transit authority worker i could be comfortable voting for him as president nelson described himself as torn on whether to give biden or harris his vote in illinois primary march 17 history pete buttigieg becomes first openly lgbtq candidate in presidential debate even before the police shooting that unsettled his city and forced him off the campaign trail for several days buttigiegstruggledto win over black voters he rolled out what he dubbedthe douglass plan a proposal to increase economic prosperity in the african american community that was named after the abolitionist frederick douglass the plan includes changing credit scoring and increasing access to credit he pledged that as president he wouldincrease the federal government s contracting with minority owned firms to 25 andpass a new voting rights act that would ban voter id laws and require potentially discriminatory voting law changes to be reviewed by the justice department days after buttigieg unveiled the douglass plan eric logan 54 was shot and killed by south bend police sgt ryan o neill south bend police saidthe officerwasdispatched after reports of a man breaking into automobiles in the early morning hours of june 16 when o neill arrived police said he discovered loganreaching into a car o neill said that when he approached logan produced a knife and advanced on him in a threatening way after several warnings police said o neill fired twice he was wearing a body camerabut did not turn it on during the encounter buttigieg saidbefore tuesday s speech at the rainbow push convention that his low standing in the polls with african americans has more to do with the community s lack of familiarity with him than the shooting first of all there are lot of voters i need to get to know and need to get to know me buttigieg said they need to understand the details of the douglass plan that we re continuing to roll out and frankly they need to see me in action for a longer period of time when you re new on the scene and not from a community of color you got to work much harder in order to earn that trust trust is a function largely of quantity of time rainbow push convention attendee jacqueline carrera said buttigieg was impressive but many black voters are risk averse and that plays into their willingness to give biden another shot and pass on buttigieg black voters can t risk to throw their votes on a candidate they think can only perhaps win said carrera who was undecided on whom tovotefor so they say joe has been there with us on this and joe has been with us on that and of course his obama connection carries so much weight but they feel like they can t throw their support on a candidate like buttigieg because they feel they don t know what s going to happen to him that s the challenge for him to me this is an introduction for maybe another run for president or another office down the road jackson who heads the rainbow push civil rights organization said buttigieg deserves credit for trying to find solutions for an issue wrapped up in systemic racism that has festered in south bend and other communities he s handled an awful situation well by being transparent jackson said other issues may be at play for buttigieg as he tries to win support from black voters sam johnson a democratic operative in south carolina said buttigieg struggleswith older churchgoing black voters from rural parts of his state in part because he is gay south carolina is the fourth state to vote in the 2020 primaries and hasa democratic electorate that is projected to be more than 60 african american winning black voters support is crucial to winning the state johnson a former chief of staff to columbia south carolina mayor steve benjamin said buttigieg needs to do more to drive his message to younger black voters as well as those in south carolina s larger cities who would be friendly to his message if he s going to turn his campaignaround him saying he s sorry is not going to get it done but i think his message can resonate if he shows and tells how he s going to make big change johnson said
