the growing clout of suburban voters particularly women who have been moving to the left politically loading september 12 2019 as texas moves slowly but inevitably into majority minority status it s become something of a biennial tradition to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of republican dominance in the state but next year could as the saying goes be the year lately a rash of congressional republicans opting not to run for reelection a phenomenon some are calling the texodus has fueled democrats excitement and to understand why texas politics is shifting many say you shouldn t just look at the state s growing hispanic population you should look at where those gop retirements are happening around the booming increasingly liberal cities the two broad demographic trends that are occurring nationally are number one blue collar working class voters are becoming more conservative that is turning midwestern states more republican gop sen ted cruz of texas told reporters at the monitor breakfast on thursday at the same time suburban voters in particular suburban women have been moving left that s turning states with big suburban populations states like texas states like georgia states like arizona much more purple if we lose texas he adds it s game over in the run up to the 2008 election when brandy derrick was first becoming politically aware she joined millions of texans in voting to reject democratic nominee barack obama former gop sen john mccain carried tarrant county where she lives by double digits he won texas by a similar margin but tarrant which includes the city of fort worth and its suburbs was the only urban county he won three other major metropolitan counties bexar san antonio dallas and harris houston flipped that year to join travis county austin in voting democratic and they haven t flipped back since last year tarrant county joined them voting for a statewide democrat u s senate candidate beto o rourke for the first time since 1990 ms derrick owner of legal ease bookkeeping in fort worth was not surprised i think texas as a whole is moving that way she says democrats certainly hope so but then they ve been hoping so for a while with texas slowly but inevitably moving into majority minority status it s become something of a biennial tradition in the lone star state to ask if the next election will finally mark the end of decades of republican dominance every dawn has been false last year sen ted cruz beat mr o rourke despite becoming the first top of the ticket republican to lose in all of the major texas metro areas since barry goldwater in 1964 but next year could as the saying goes be the year while no democrat won statewide in 2018 in terms of turnout and down ballot races the party had its best election in decades lately a rash of congressional republicans opting not to run for reelection a phenomenon some are calling the texodus has only fueled democrats excitement and to understand why texas politics is shifting many say you shouldn t just look at the state s growing hispanic population you should look at where those gop retirements are happening around the booming increasingly liberal cities the two broad demographic trends that are occurring nationally are number one blue collar working class voters are becoming more conservative that is turning midwestern states more republican senator cruz told reporters at the monitor breakfast on thursday at the same time suburban voters in particular suburban women have been moving left that s turning states with big suburban populations states like texas states like georgia states like arizona much more purple if we lose texas he adds it s game over as measured by job creation and population growth the texas triangle bounded by dallas fort worth houston and san antonio austin is the strongest economic region in the united states while houston is the hub of the u s energy industry big tech companies are settling in austin google and apple and dallas uber and with a large young and college educated workforce flocking to live and work in the region these texas cities and suburbs have been both gaining political power and becoming more solidly liberal research by ren e cross and richard murray at the university of houston has found thatvoters in the 27 counties around big metro areas grew from 52 of the total electorate in 1968 to 69 in 2018 meanwhile voters in the more rural counties outside the democratic strongholds in south texas decreased from 38 to 8 in that time mr o rourke in particular was effective in ginning up support and crucially for a low turnout demographic votes from young texans he carried the state s five major urban counties by a combined 790 000 votes last year six times more than mr obama in 2012 registering and turning out more voters in those cities and suburbs is at the core of texas democrats plan released this week to flip the biggest battleground state in the country the texodus suggests that republicans in the state may have the same concerns four of the five congressmen who will be stepping down next year represent suburban districts that have become increasingly competitive the fifth rep will hurd represents a vast border district that is the most competitive in the state the people texas is attracting the job opportunities are magnets for younger voters voters who are perhaps more liberal says ann bowman a political scientist at texas a m university the beto effect was mobilizing younger voters she adds are we going to see that in 2020 the general trend is for younger voters to turn out less what could boost democratic turnout is the republican ticket being led by one of the most unpopular presidents in recent memory just 45 of registered voters in texas approve of president trump while 50 don t according to a poll this week from quinnipiac university he trailed most of his democratic challengers head to head in the state in a recent university of texas at tyler survey mr trump s often harsh and divisive rhetoric trumps anything he s doing with the economy for many suburban women says nancy bocskor director of the center for women in politics and public policy at texas woman s university in denton suburban women are going to turn out and vote she adds that s a bigger wild card here than the growing number of hispanic voters decades of political dominance in texas could also now be making life more difficult for republicans as in states around the country a lack of competitive general elections has led to competitive primaries with republicans drifting further and further to the right since former president george w bush built his presidential campaign on compassionate conservatism and his ability to work with democrats while governor of texas this in turn has alienated moderate voters including in suburbs that used to be conservative strongholds if all you re doing as a political party is communicating with your primary voters that s a great way to perhaps win the next election but what it is not is a way to grow your party says harold cook a longtime democratic strategist in texas republicans in the state legislature responded to that head on in the legislative session earlier this year avoiding the polarizing cultural issues like the failed bathroom bill that had marked the 2017 session in favor of pocketbook issues like property tax and public education reform whether those efforts generated enough goodwill to help republicans 13 months from now remains to be seen i think a lot of these legislators made very smart moves to help shore up that republican brand says professor bocskor they were spot on in targeting what suburban women are concerned about yet right now the biggest issues are health care and immigration and gun control says brandon rottinghaus a political scientist at the university of houston those are all issues that break badly for republicans in terms of support from suburban women thirteen years after they traded northern california for north texas melissa and mike patruso are beginning to feel more at home politically at least in watauga a suburb north of fort worth how well beto did in the election last year that was surprising says mrs patruso and good so could 2020 be the year will texas turn blue i don t think so just yet she says we re not there yet most experts agree that democrats 18 year streak of not winning a statewide race in texas will probably continue into 2022 mr trump will likely turn out voters who support him as much as he will voters who reject him and fear of republicans losing texas and its huge cache of 38 electoral votes could also motivate conservative voters democrats further down the ballot will face a new hurdle next year with straight ticket balloting eliminated by the state legislatureafter the 2018 election and unlike that election republicans in texas now know they re in for a fight get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox democrats won t be able to take them by surprise this time says mr cook the democratic strategist there s only one way to run in an atmosphere like this and that s to run scared texas is going to be hotly contested agrees senator cruz we will see i believe record setting in fact record shattering democratic turnout in 2020 because the far left is pissed off they hate the president and that is a powerful motivator for republicans he adds the key will be to turn everybody else out if the left shows up in massive numbers and everybody else doesn t that s how we end up with an incredibly damaging election link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to the
