don t the threat of the coronavirus has hit the economy like a tempest out of nowhere just as storms typically wreak more havoc on trailer parks than ritzy suburbs this one appears to have hit the most vulnerable workers first especially those in close contact with the public some help is on the way in the form of onetime federal checks for low and middle income adults and higher and longer lasting unemployment benefits with rules loosened to include gig workers and the self employed in chicago food service workers are offering free food to former colleagues and a new gofundme campaign

timing like buying stocks in 1929 cam jennings started his company activate vegas on march 2 the start up s mission is printing and distributing handbills for businesses on the las vegas strip two weeks later nevada s governor ordered all the casinos to close and mr jennings had no choice but to suspend operations we kind of hit the ground running on the strip but there was no strip to get running on he says ruefully for alyson arnold of warwick rhode island the problem was postponements a ceremony officiant specializing in outdoor weddings she was preparing to conduct 60 weddings in 2020 her best year ever but in early march as concerns grew about travel the postponements began rolling in two in march three in april of the five ceremonies scheduled in may two are already being rescheduled one of the worst things the uncertainty everyone s sitting on the edge of their seat waiting for what will happen she says editor s note as a public service we ve removed the paywallfor all our coronavirus coverage it s free three weeks ago these workers had jobs suddenly they don t the threat of the coronavirus hit the economy like a tempest out of nowhere and just as storms typically wreak more havoc on trailer parks than ritzy suburbs this one appears to have hit the most vulnerable workers first but there s more because social distancing is the essence of the virus response jobs rooted in social contacts face some of the biggest disruptions those like mr jennings in the experiential marketing industry staffing booths at conventions or handing out branded memorabilia at sporting events quickly lost gigs when the first restrictions on huge crowds were put in place self employed people reliant on private gatherings like ms arnold were next now the forced closure of nonessential businesses in many parts of the united states has pushed huge numbers of full time employees often in low paid service industries onto the unemployment rolls dennis roberson a divorced father of four can chuckle about his last paycheck from the wormhole a bar and music venue in savannah georgia that like other nonessential businesses in town was forced to close the check got torn in half by accident when he went to cash it monday it got a little surreal there was a long queue outside the bank that was a new one it was one in one out he says still the check cleared its amount 195 i realized that s all i have for the foreseeable future he says pretty wild now he has arrived at forsyth park sporting a knit cap sunglasses and a white beard after biking to domino s to pick up a free pizza from a promotion he sits down under a tree to eat puts his ear buds in and closes his eyes it s not yet clear how many americans have been laid off last week the u s bureau of labor statistics reported that a record 3 3 million workers filed a first time claim for unemployment more than four times the previous record set in 1982 this week s thursday report set another new record 6 6 million more for a two week total near 10 million on wednesday payroll firm adp s research institute released a report showing that as early as mid march sectors such as retail and wholesale trade transportation construction and administrative support services including temp work were starting to shed thousands of workers much bigger job losses are coming warns mark zandi chief economist of moody s analytics some 56 of u s counties representing 80 of the nation s gdp are in some form of lockdown he says although many employees continue to work from home in all about a quarter of the economy is shut down he estimates so he expects the unemployment rate to hit 10 to 13 this month that would be as bad or worse than at the height of the great recession some economists expect even higher levels of unemployment the data also suggest that workers in some of the lowest paid occupations were among the first to be laid off low and low middle income households are being hit hardest by the crisis mr zandi says in massachusetts one of the top five states reporting first time jobless claims last week the biggest surge came in the health care and social assistance sector these workers run the gamut nearly half of them are home health aides delivering care to the home bound and earning nationally an average 24 000 a year the rest are licensed nurses earning twice as much and medical and health services managers earning four times as much last week more than 18 000 of them filed for unemployment in massachusetts up from 440 the week before a mind bending 4 000 increase over 37 million u s jobs may be vulnerable to potential layoffs in the short term conclude researchers at cornell university s law school that s assuming that the current crisis does not result in wider spread long term layoffs of those 37 million nonsupervisory jobs all but 2 million are low quality low paid ones paying less than 28 000 a year as measured by the researchers u s private sector job quality index the biggest group more than a quarter of those at risk workers in restaurants and other food service positions in the lake michigan shoreline community of south haven michigan dolly harris has been a server at downtown s phoenix street caf for 19 years she and her co workers were laid off march 16 as gov gretchen whitmer called on restaurants and bars to close except for takeout or deliveries now ms harris will be relying on social security and unemployment benefits to help make ends meet she was able to complete the online process of applying for unemployment after a few frustrating hours of system freeze ups as of march 29 she still did not know how much she will be receiving but expects to learn this week finances aren t the main concern for ms harris the virus is top of mind particularly because her husband has been diagnosed with a pulmonary disease that makes breathing difficult i m afraid to go out and do something in public ms harris says i thought about working a job at meijer a regional supermarket but i really don t want to bring anything home like the virus the distinguishing feature of the current downturn is its speed it was like bing bang boom next day no restaurants says joe ryal a bartender at a restaurant on chicago s north side we re all unprepared retail workers face similar shocks this week a slew of chains announced extended closures and furloughs including macy s a majority of its 125 000 employees and jcpenney many of its 85 000 workers and the sudden brake pedal on economic activity isn t affecting low paid occupations alone i m 100 commission based when they issue a stay at home order they made us part of that says eric a commercial realtor in the southwest part of michigan who declined to have his last name published because of the long lag time between showing a property and closing a sale the impact if you re not working can be severe when you have three months where you can t show any properties that s more like eight or nine months where you re not making money how long the virus threat and its economic repercussions will last is a burning question for many of the newly unemployed to be honest it s been pretty scary says ashley d a bartender at a major national restaurant chain outlet in oakland county michigan i m hopeful life will be back to normal in a few months but even if this did all quickly resolve or improve i m afraid it would take a lot of time for people to feel comfortable coming back both employees and guests i know i m leery about coming back right away we are confident we are thinking hopefully that business will come back says jes s morales who worked conventions banquets and private meetings for 33 years at the drake one of chicago s fanciest hotels serving the wealthy and occasionally the famous including bill clinton george w bush and princess diana noticing his name tag she told him she was delighted to be served by a man named jesus he recalls when tips were generous he could bring home more than 1 000 a week now as he relies on unemployment payments to cover his bills he worries about when the hotel business and other activity will recover i don t think it will come back as strong as before i think it s going to take a while he says according to mr zandi the economist it will take three to four years to get back to something resembling full employment some help is on the way to ease the adjustment congress s new 2 2 trillion coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act authorizes 1 200 for adults and 500 for children in low and middle income families checks are expected to go out over the next three weeks unemployment benefits also get a boost over the next four months extra money and extra weeks of eligibility crucially for many of the newly jobless gig workers and self employed the guidelines have been loosened so they qualify for the first time ms arnold the wedding officiant in rhode island was able to sign up online on monday mr jennings the las vegas handbill entrepreneur has had too many gigs to file online and so far has only gotten a busy signal when calling in to the unemployment office in the meantime he s serving as spokesman for the help the gig economy coronavirus income relief fund a gofundme campaign aimed at helping 100 experiential marketing workers who often travel from state to state to work conventions and other events the sponsors aim to raise 50 000 in 100 days as of wednesday they d raised more than 5 400 and helped 12 of the more than 600 people who have applied for aid it s been very grassroots mr jennings says most of our donations are people within the industry kicking in 20 bucks a similar spirit is taking place in chicago as workers in the food industry rally to help each other on a warm spring day the newly jobless mr ryal has just emerged from the big star restaurant which is giving away free food to workers in the service industry from 5 to 7 p m a scene repeated at other venues around the city i ll be able to survive says mr ryal holding a brown paper bag of groceries and a styrofoam container holding a serving of carne asada we re leaning on other people back in savannah forsyth park is nearly empty due to the stay at home order i m the captain of my own ship and it s not moving at the moment says mr roberson the now unemployed
