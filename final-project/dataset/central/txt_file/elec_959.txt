 nov 6 2019 at 8 15 am by nathaniel rakich and geoffrey skelley filed under 2019 elections fivethirtyeight there s nothing like election night with its twists and turns and this year s contests offered up a fine appetizer to prepare us for the multiple courses to come in 2020 we saw one governor s seat probably change hands while another state handed full control of power to one party here s what went down last night the race for governor in kentucky is still too close to call according to the associated press but with 100 percent of precincts reporting democratic attorney general andy beshear leads republican gov matt bevin 49 2 percent to 48 8 percent or a margin of a little more than 5 000 votes and bevin told supporters last night that he won t concede which could complicate things and lead to a recount if bevin presses the matter but in a state that otherwise elected republican candidates for statewide offices last night beshear s possible victory is notable for democrats as it s evidence that split ticket voting does still occur beshear claimed victory in a speech on tuesday night laying out his policy priorities as governor within his first week in office beshear said he would drop bevin s plan to require certain medicaid recipients to work in order to receive health coverage which could have resulted in 95 000 fewer people receiving medicaid and he also vowed to follow through on his campaign pledge of restoring the right to vote to 140 000 felons convicted of nonviolent crimes who have completed their sentences about 4 percent of kentucky s citizen voting age population kentucky is one of just two states where all felons permanently lose the right to vote unless it is individually restored by the governor however beshear s policy impact may be limited to executive action as he is still largely powerless to stop republican legislation both chambers of the kentucky legislature are still republican controlled and in kentucky a simple majority is all that s needed to override a gubernatorial veto democrats achieved an even clearer victory in virginia where democrats now control both the senate and the house in the virginia general assembly the democrats gained two seats in the senate to take a narrow 21 19 majority in the upper chamber and six seats in the house for a 55 45 majority there with democratic gov ralph northam already in charge of the commonwealth s executive branch democrats now have a trifecta complete control over law making in richmond and the first time democrats have had full control of virginia government since the early 1990s this shift could have all sorts of policy implications for virginia too one big ticket item could be gun control legislation after a shooting in virginia beach in may northam tried to push through legislation in july that included universal background checks on gun purchases and an assault weapons ban but the gop controlled legislature refused to take it up democrats could also take up raising the minimum wage to 15 as most democrats in the legislature previously backed the idea democrats have also promised to expand voting rights protect the rights of lgbtq virginians improve health care affordability and ratify the equal rights amendment to the u s constitution and last but not least democrats could have the final word on redistricting after the 2020 census though a pending constitutional amendment for a redistricting commision might alter how the state draws lines but of course not everything went democrats way republicans salvaged the night by holding onto the mississippi governorship there republican lt gov tate reeves defeated democratic attorney general jim hood 52 percent to 47 percent with 99 percent of precincts reporting but this was always considered the longest shot of the night for democrats with nonpartisan polls and election handicappers all agreeing that reeves was favored still a win s a win and republicans will hold onto their governing trifecta in the magnolia state what did all three of these races have in common well at a high level the results provided further evidence for a widening urban rural political divide in particular democrats successes on tuesday and we re including their narrow mississippi loss as a success were driven by their remarkably strong performances in suburban areas for example democrats gains in virginia pretty much all came in suburban seats and beshear and hood ran up huge margins in suburban counties compared to what the kentucky and mississippi maps looked like in 2015 and there was even more good news for democrats in the suburbs in local races we ll take a closer look at those results in an upcoming article in which we ll explore the question of what these results
