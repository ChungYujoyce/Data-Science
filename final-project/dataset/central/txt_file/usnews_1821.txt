when danni askini started feeling chest pain shortness of breath and a migraine all at once on a saturday in late february she called the oncologist who had been treating her lymphoma her doctor thought she might be reacting poorly to a new medication so she sent askini to a boston area emergency room there doctors told her it was likely pneumonia and sent her home over the next several days askini saw her temperature spike and drop dangerously and she developed a cough that gurgled because of all the liquid in her lungs after two more trips to the er that week askini was given a final test on the seventh day of her illness and once doctors helped manage her flu and pneumonia symptoms they again sent her home to recover she waited another three days for a lab to process her test and at last she had a diagnosis covid 19 a few days later askini got the bills for her testing and treatment 34 927 43 i was pretty sticker shocked she says i personally don t know anybody who has that kind of money like 27 million other americans askini was uninsured when she first entered the hospital she and her husband had been planning to move to washington d c this month so she could take a new job but she hadn t started yet now that those plans are on hold askini applied for medicaid and is hoping the program will retroactively cover her bills if not she ll be on the hook keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here she ll be in good company public health experts predict that tens of thousands and possibly millions of people across the united states will likely need to be hospitalized for covid 19 in the foreseeable future and congress has yet to address the problem on march 18 it passed the families first coronavirus response act which covers testing costs going forward but it doesn t do anything to address the cost of treatment while most people infected with covid 19 will not need to be hospitalized and can recover at home according to the world health organization those who do need to go to the icu can likely expect big bills regardless of what insurance they have as the u s government works on another stimulus package future relief is likely to help ease some economic problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic but gaps remain here is everything you need to know about what getting treated for covid 19 could cost you because of our fragmented health care system it depends on what kind of insurance you have what your plan s benefits are and how much of your deductible you ve already paid down a new analysis from the kaiser family foundation estimates that the average cost of covid 19 treatment for someone with employer insurance and without complications would be about 9 763 someone whose treatment has complications may see bills about double that 20 292 the researchers came up with those numbers by examining average costs of hospital admissions for people with pneumonia most private health insurance plans are likely to cover most services needed to treat coronavirus complications but that doesn t include your deductible the cost you pay out of pocket before your insurance kicks in more than 80 of people with employer health insurance have deductibles and last year the average annual deductible for a single person in that category was 1 655 for individual plans the costs are often higher the average deductible for an individual bronze plan in 2019 was 5 861 according to health pocket in both complicated and uncomplicated cases patients with employer based insurance can expect out of pocket costs of more than 1 300 the kaiser researchers found the costs were similar regardless of complications because many people who are hospitalized reach their deductible and out of pocket maximum many health insurance plans also require co pays or co insurance too those costs are often 15 20 for an in network doctor meaning you would pay that portion of the cost and can be much more for out of network doctors medicare and medicaid will also likely cover the services needed for coronavirus treatment but the details on deductibles for medicare and potential co pays will again depend on your plan and which state you re in for medicaid it s not pretty some hospitals offer charity care programs and some states are making moves to help residents pay for covid 19 costs beyond testing several states including maryland massachusetts nevada new york rhode island and washington have created special enrollment periods to allow more people to sign up for insurance mid year other states are requiring coverage of future vaccines or changing rules about prescription medication refills to help people stock up on essential medicines so far maine maryland massachusetts nevada new mexico new york and oregon have required insurers to waive costs for a covid 19 vaccine once one is ready and the states that have loosened rules to help people fill prescriptions include alaska colorado delaware florida maine maryland new hampshire north carolina and washington the commonwealth fund a healthcare think tank has a coronavirus tracker that s keeping a list of the moves each state has made so far the u s health care system doesn t have a good answer for you and it s a problem but there are a few things to keep in mind that could help minimize costs if you think you may have the virus the first step is to call your doctor or emergency department before showing up the cdc says this will let them prepare the office and give you instructions ahead of time but it could also save you money getting treated in a hospital will generally start off more expensive than a visit to a doctor s office another cost comes from the facilities fee which many hospitals charge anytime a patient comes through their doors for danni askini s first trip to the hospital in boston on feb 29 for example she was charged 1 804 for her emergency room visit and another 3 841 07 for hospital services other costs to watch out for include lab tests which can be out of network even if the doctor treating you is in your insurance network it s always best to ask for information in writing so that you can appeal the bills if necessary says caitlin donovan of the national patient advocate foundation and appealing is worth it often providers and insurers have reversed or lowered bills when patients go public or are covered by the media these problems aren t coming out of the blue even when we re not weathering a global pandemic americans face uniquely high health care costs compared to the rest of the world and millions of us already put off medical care because of concerns about how much it ll cost but with covid 19 sweeping across the country an old problem becomes increasingly urgent many americans could still face massive treatment bills or seek to prevent those by avoiding testing and treatment worsening the outbreak further if you re sick you need fewer barriers donovan says but also it doesn t help society to have people still crawling around going to their job and getting other people sick write to abigail abrams at abigail abrams time com
