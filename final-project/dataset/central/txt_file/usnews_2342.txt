forty seven years ago today the supreme court ruled on roe v wade establishing the legality of abortion nationwide but as another case about abortion heads to a significantly more conservative supreme court this year reproductive rights advocates and health care providers say they are preparing for a world in which the landmark 1973 decision is either significantly weakened or overturned we re at a moment where the threat is imminent for the country alexis mcgill johnson acting director and ceo of planned parenthood tells time it s already real for many women who don t have access to safe abortions in march the supreme court will hear june medical services v gee which challenges a louisiana law requiring doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of where they perform the procedure the law in question is very similar to a texas law that the supreme court struck down in 2016 in its ruling on whole woman s health v hellerstedt but the make up of the supreme court is markedly more conservative with newcomer justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh both of whom were nominated by president trump the political climate is also different in early january more than 200 members of congress filed an amicus curiae brief in the june case arguing that roe and planned parenthood v casey another case that reaffirmed the legal right to abortion should be reconsidered and if appropriate overruled legal scholars have said it s likely the supreme court will rule narrowly on june instead of completely overturning roe but even if this is not the landmark decision s last anniversary advocates note that access to safe legal abortions has already become distinctly more difficult in many parts of the country in 1976 congress first introduced the hyde amendment which banned the use of federal funds for abortion services unless the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest or threatened the life of the mother the amendment has been reauthorized every year it blocks federal funds from covering abortion through medicaid and any other federal health program since then state legislatures have also enacted a patchwork of state laws limiting when where how and why people can access abortion since 2011 states have passed more than 400 abortion restrictions according to the guttmacher institute a research group that supports reproductive rights in 2019 states passed 25 new abortion restrictions into law six states passed laws that would limit abortions once fetal cardiac activity is detected or as early as six weeks and alabama passed a near total ban on abortions roe has not been a reality for people struggling to make ends meet for decades because of hyde says destiny lopez co director of all above all a coalition of reproductive rights advocates that launched in 2013 like hyde state laws that restrict access to abortion tend to disproportionately affect certain groups including poor people people of color native americans immigrants queer and trans people people who live in rural areas members of the military and federal employees it doesn t matter if something s legal if you can t afford it says quita tinsley co director of access reproductive care southeast a fund that helps organize financial and logistical support for people seeking abortions in southern states it doesn t matter if it s legal if you can t get there arc southeast is one of many abortion funds that have popped up around the country in recent years as states increasingly have clamped down on abortion access these funds often started by grassroots activists guide patients through their state s laws around abortion and develop a plan for how each person will find the money transportation and permission they need to get the procedure some states including west virginia have passed so many restrictions on abortion over the years that only provider remains statewide west virginia bans abortions after 20 weeks bans the dilation and evacuation method of abortion and bans telemedicine abortion it also requires that minors notify their parents before receiving an abortion and that providers read a phone counseling script that doctors say is biased and inaccurate 24 hours before a patient s appointment in november 2018 west virginia voters also approved a ballot measure that changed the state s constitution to say it does not guarantee the right to abortion ending the state s coverage of the procedure through medicaid because medicaid is a federal state partnership west virginia had previously been able to cover abortion services for medicaid recipients with state funds nearly one third of west virginians are insured through medicaid and katie quinonez executive director of the state s last abortion provider women s health center of west virginia said medicaid recipients made up more than half of her center s patients before the 2018 change no private insurance carrier in west virginia covers abortion either quinonez says her state legislature has created a hostile environment for abortion access but she adds she and other abortion rights advocates aren t giving up regardless of the future of roe abortion access is something that we have to continuously fight for she says with the future of roe hanging in the balance at the supreme court advocates say they are turning their attention to preventing red states from passing more abortion restrictions and expanding access to the procedure in blue states and progressive cities a new california law for example will require public colleges to offer medication abortion on campus others are hoping to better educate voters about reproductive rights and create sanctuary cities for abortion the way local governments have done for immigration one advocacy group urge unite for reproductive and gender equity has focused on training and mobilizing youth young people are not clinging to roe to save them says kimberly inez mcguire executive director of urge young folks look at a flawed system a system that s not working a system that s actually harming them and they say you know what we don t need that we deserve better if the supreme court strikes down roe entirely mcgill johnson of planned parenthood says her organization will continue working with its state partners to flip legislative seats and governorships and help people who need abortions travel to states where they can safely have them i also want to make it clear that flying women around the country to access abortion is not a future state she says we are in it for the long game one silver lining of the current political moment advocates add is that they see more people paying attention to and joining the abortion fight everyone is now seeing what we ve been seeing coming down main street a long time says tinsley of arc southeast we ve seen some really restrictive anti abortion laws coming sweeping in the south and midwest for many years now and we ve been saying that this is only a matter of time before this becomes a national issue in 2016 the democratic party added getting rid of the hyde amendment to its national platform for the first time this year most of the democratic presidential candidates have said they support ending hyde and polling continues to show that a majority of americans support keeping abortion legal a new poll out from gallup on wednesday found that a new high of six in 10 americans are dissatisfied with the country s abortion laws i can t minimize the importance and the significance of roe when it happened in 1973 and the catalyzing effect that it has had for people s ability to determine how they want to live their lives says kwajelyn jackson executive director of feminist women s health center which provides abortion and gynecological services in atlanta at this anniversary what i want is for folks to be thinking about what does our future look like correction jan 22 the original version of this story misstated how
