in the last two weeks almost 10 million americans have filed new unemployment claims ten million americans who through no fault of their own are now out of work that s catastrophic it s the herald of a severe economic crisis that could dwarf the great recession the only way we will avert that outcome is through decisive action that gets relief directly to american workers and families as quickly as possible that s what the 2 trillion cares act was designed to do it passed with overwhelming bipartisan support because congress understands that families and small businesses are already feeling the economic impact of this crisis now it s up to president donald trump and his administration to get that help in the hands of the people who need it earlier this week i spoke with president trump and shared my recommendations for what he should do now to address this crisis it s going to require a lot of hard painstaking work unfortunately there are already signs the cares act is not being implemented quickly enough reports that the treasury may need five months to send out support checks banks that didn t receive guidance until the last minute on how to get the small business lending program up and running laid off workers who can t even log on to apply for their unemployment checks all the money in the world won t matter if americans can t access it i was in charge of administering the 800 billion recovery act of 2009 so i understand that the devil is in the details it s about accountability and transparency we need our president to lead not point fingers or lay blame we need our government to work that s why i ve offered a 10 point make it work checklistfor how the trump administration can get money out the door and into the hands of the american people it s a blueprint for what is required to administer a massive government relief program i hope president trump adopts the whole thing here are just a few of those steps hotline share your coronavirus story first he needs to get unemployment checks out on time and in full states are already overwhelmed by the millions of new claims with more sure to come they need more staff better technology and more robust systems to both accept claims and move funds out the door the white house should make sure the states get all the resources they need to increase capacity andtrump should stand up a response team with empowered senior leaders to help states navigate the inevitable challenges of distributing benefits second trump needs to get help to small businesses fast so they can keep people on the payroll the money in the cares act for small businesses should be available to every singleeligible small business regardless of how small they are where they are located or how well connected their owner is as designed the program depends on private banks to provide government backed loans but there s no mechanism to make sure they do i m calling for a banks defense production act to make sure that banks are processing loans for all who qualify within a few working days of application not sitting on this money or turning away qualified applicants trump s coronavirus chaos if trump wants to be seen as a wartime president he should start acting like one third the latest unemployment claims and employment numbers make it clear that our economic priority has to be keeping as many people on payroll as possible the administration should expand work sharing programs to all 50 states washington d c puerto rico and the u s virgin islands these programs help employers keep more workers employed with the federal government making up the difference in lost hours there is much more detail in my checklist but the driving theme is simple help as many working families and small businesses as possible as fast as possible american workers who have lost their jobs or seen their hours slashed and families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table need help immediately get direct payments into people s hands without any delays streamline the process use direct deposit and pre paid debit cards wherever possible stop trying to block oversight of the 500 billion fund for corporations because any dollar wasted through fraud or abuse is a dollar that isn t going to help an american family biden on pandemic preparedness trump is worst possible leader to deal with coronavirus outbreak andlet s put together a phase 4package immediately we re going to need it america s long term recovery is going to require far more investment and it needs to be smart and effective to help everyone so let s not waste time arguing about it one tragedy of this crisis is how much pain could have been avoided with swift decisive action above all president trump needs to step up his response to the public health crisis the failure to arrest the spread of the virus is the direct cause of the economic pain americans are suffering today none of this will matter if we don t get our front line health workers the resources and personal protective equipment they need to break the infection curve stop the spread of the virus and save american lives i know the american people will beat this we re brave and big hearted we ve emerged stronger from every crisis that has tested us as a nation and we will again this new enemy may be unseen but we have the tools the expertise the will and the spirit to defeat it there is nothing we cannot accomplish if we work together former vice president joe biden is a candidate for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination
