news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more in part because of his roots in scranton pa and his cultural empathy for voters in the rust belt and upper midwest trump has attacked biden on twitter as sleepy joe but those attacks have boosted biden s cachet among democrats who see them as proof that the president fears him biden s appeal to nonwhite voters is so far stronger than anyone else in the field in part perhaps a tribute to his loyal service to former president obama biden s critics on the left insist his standing is falsely inflated right now and that he will fall to earth as his past record on everything from criminal justice to credit card companies becomes more widely known the 76 year old former vice president has also had some verbal stumbles as when he briefly referred to the late margaret thatcher rather than theresa maytheresa

ideals he has espoused for decades he is as acerbic as ever about the media s tendency to focus on personality over policies and many of his supporters display an intense devotion to him sanders also has enormous resources his campaign raised 18 2 million in the 41 days between his launch and the end of the first quarter but can he recapture the same kind of magic that powered his 2016 campaign

her love life those flippant moments work because no one doubts warren s intellect she is a former harvard law school professor or her policy chops warren has rolled out policies on a broad range of issues which she is able to explain with specificity and accessibility her campaign has underlined this strength selling merchandise with the slogan warren has a plan for that like sanders warren is vulnerable to the suggestion that her left leaning beliefs make her less electable than other front line candidates the memory of her shaky handling of the question of her native american heritage has not disappeared for all that though warren is snapping at sanders s heels if she were to supplant him as the leading progressive candidate the landscape of the race would shift previous ranking 5 4

hill s rankings in february at the time she had been boosted by a huge launch rally in oakland a sense that she brought more charisma to the race than any other candidate and the fact that biden had not yet declared since then harris s fortunes have stagnated one persistent criticism is that she is too prone to caution her propensity to say she is willing to have a conversation about certain hot button issues has been an inviting target for her skeptics harris has also clarified or shifted her positions on several issues such as whether her vision for medicare for all involves the outright elimination of private insurance or whether police shootings should be investigated by independent prosecutors rather than local district attorneys harris the top performing black candidate in the race is so far receiving adequate but not outstanding support from nonwhite voters it s far too early to count harris out but she needs some big moments that could push her closer to the very top of the pack previous ranking 1 5 south bend ind mayor pete buttigiegpete buttigiegit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process here s how biden can win over the minority vote

field can he go any further buttigieg has embarked on an exhaustive round of media appearances which have showcased his chief assets likability an ease and clarity before the cameras and a center left appeal to comity and cooperation but there are real doubts about buttigieg s ability to appeal beyond the upscale whites who form the main pillar of his support some racially tinged controversies during his tenure in south bend could further hamper his appeal to non white voters previous ranking n a 6 former rep beto o rourke d texas o rourke is already seeking to reboot his campaign appearing

same kind of viral moment as he did in the senate race when his defense of nfl players protesting racial injustice became a sensation o rourke could come back but he is not an especially strong

find a place for himself in the crowded primary field having started his campaign talking about the transformative power of radical love he has more recently sharpened his appeal and his willingness

has referred to herself as heartland amy and she like buttigieg has done a fox news town hall klobuchar s appeal does make her distinctive to some degree but biden s dominance among centrist voters
