print edition of the washington post foreign policy is generally a difficult area to fact check differences can be more of opinions than numbers but that did not stop president obama and former governor mitt romney from making questionable claims obama romney romney has the better part of this argument here s what he said in his oct 8 vmi speech america s ability to influence events for the better in iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence the president tried and failed to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains romney did not technically say that troops should still be in iraq and romney is correct obama did try to extend a status of forces agreement that had been originally signed by the bush administration but could not get a deal with the government of iraq that would have given immunity for u s forces from prosecution under iraqi law so now obama stresses the fact that he has removed all troops from iraq while knocking romney for supporting what he originally had hoped to achieve romney romney said that obama was silent on the protests in iran but that is not quite correct obama s response was initially muted in part out of caution and because he was preserving the ability to relaunch negotiations over iran s nuclear program in iran s complex political system iran s president is not the key figure instead it is a religious leader the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei on june 13 2009 iran announced that incumbent president mahmoud ahmadinejad won a landslide victory prompting mass protests from supporters of the key opponent mir hossein mousavi on june 15 when the protests were the largest since the 1979 iranian revolution obama spoke it is up to iranians to make decisions about who iran s leaders will be he said adding that we respect iranian sovereignty and want to avoid the united states being the issue inside of iran obama added i am deeply troubled by the violence that i ve been seeing on television i think that the democratic process free speech the ability of people to peacefully dissent all those are universal values and need to be respected some commentators criticized obama for making relatively weak remarks but u s officials argued that he was trying to avoid having the iranian government claim that the protests were the work of american intrigue in an apt summation of the administration s position secretary of state hillary rodham clinton told reporters on june 17 we are obviously waiting to see the outcome of the internal iranian processes but our intent is to pursue whatever opportunities might exist in the future with iran here is how obama put it in an interview with cnbc on june 16 although there is amazing ferment taking place in iran the difference between ahmadinejad and mousavi in terms of their actual positions may not be as great as has been advertised we ve got long term interests in having them not weaponize nuclear power and stop funding organizations like hezbollah and hamas and that would be true whoever came out on top in this election obama finally toughened his stance a week later on june 23 after more violence erupted the united states and the international community have been appalled and outraged by the threats the beatings and imprisonments of the last few days obama said i strongly condemn these unjust actions and i join with the american people in mourning each and every innocent life that is lost romney romney likes to claim that obama promised to get the unemployment down to 5 4 percent by 2012 but it is not as simple as that romney is citing a 14 page report written by two obama aides before obama took the oath of office concerning a theoretical stimulus bill thus it was not an official government assessment or even an analysis of an actual plan that had passed congress still the administration later cited the report in congressional testimony giving it an official imprimatur so while obama officials may not have pledged such a goal it was certainly part of the administration s talking points obama obama has set a goal of doubling u s exports by 2014 but he seems to be getting ahead of himself exports of goods to china have gone from 69 7 billion in 2008 to 103 9 billion in 2011 according to the census bureau romney romney appears to referring to the iranian president s alleged statement that he would wipe israel off the map but as we have noted there is actually some dispute about what ahmadinejad said which would make a prosecution difficult the fact checker even gave himself a pinocchio for blithely repeating this claim in his book on condoleezza rice indeed the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide lists very specific acts none which include mere threats with intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnical racial or religious group as such killing members of the group causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group forcibly transferring children of the group to another group but there is another interesting wrinkle to this pledge presumably such a prosecution would have to be done via the international criminal court which the united states under george w bush refused to accept update romney aides confirmed he would bring such a case via the world court which can only mean the icc this is surprising given that one of his top foreign policy advisors john r bolton is such a foe of the icc romney this is a puzzling statement no iranian oil is coming in to the united states and none has come here for quite some time ronald reagan signed an executive order in 1987 banning all u s imports from iran and then president bill clinton in 1995 banned all u s participation in iranian petroleum development here s how the u s treasury puts it goods or services of iranian origin may not be imported into the united states either directly or through third countries with the following exceptions a gifts valued at 100 or less b information and informational materials c household and personal effects of persons arriving in the united states that were actually used abroad by the importer or by other family members arriving from the same foreign household that are not intended for any other person or for sale and that are not otherwise prohibited from importation and d accompanied baggage for personal use normally incident to travel a romney spokesman clarified that romney was targeting ships that at one point might carry iran oil as the governor mentioned getting europe to come along is a major point he said oil and tankers are fungible they can carry non iranian oil and if they are not able to transport oil back and forth between the u s and other countries then they are of little use to their companies this is a very serious sanction for these companies still the sanctions imposed this year do prohibit tankers with iranian oil from clearing any transactions through u s or european financial institutions and the sanctions have also cut off insurance for tankers so this has already hurt tanker companies willingness to carry iranian crude obama the obama campaign has made far too much out of this ancient comment romney made this statement in a 2007 interview with the associated press it s not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person but obama has ignored the rest of the interview in which the ap quoted romney as saying he supports a broader strategy to defeat the islamic jihad movement just a few days later romney expanded on his remarks during a debate we ll move everything to get him but i don t want to buy into the democratic pitch that this is all about one person osama bin laden because after we get him there s going to be another and another this is about shia and sunni this is about hezbollah and hamas and al qaeda and the muslim brotherhood this is a worldwide jihadist effort to try and cause the collapse of all moderate islamic governments and replace them with a caliphate romney romney says this a lot but it is an unusual statement considering that syria shares no border with iran iraq and turkey are in the way and that iran has about 1 500 miles of coastline along the persian gulf and gulf of oman leading to the arabian sea tehran certainly uses syria to supply the militant groups hezbollah and hamas but that has little to do with the water the relationship with syria could also effectively allow iran to project its power to the mediterranean and the border with israel but it is still an odd way to frame it obama romney this exchange is drawn from a headline let detroit go bankrupt onan opinion article written by romney for the new york times but he did not say that in the article he repeated the line however on television although bankrupt often conjures up images of liquidation romney is correct in that he called for a managed bankruptcy this is a process in which the company uses the bankruptcy code to discharge its debts but emerges from the process a leaner less leveraged company ultimately along with getting nearly 80 billion in loans and other assistance from the bush and obama administrations gm and chrysler did go through a managed bankruptcy but many independent analysts have concluded that taking the approach recommended by romney would not have worked in 2008 simply because the credit markets were so frozen that a bankruptcy was not a viable option at the time here s how the bipartisan congressional oversight panel in a unanimous finding framed the issue ina january 2011 report the circumstances in the global credit markets in november and december 2008 were unlike any the financial markets had seen in decades u s domestic credit markets were frozen in the wake of the lehman bankruptcy and international sources of funding were extremely limited romney obama we ve looked at this claim by romney before and it s almost as if obama had read our column the historical records of the navy showthat in 1916 the navy had 245 ships this was also the year that president woodrow wilson signed into law the naval act of 1916 which put the united states on a crash course to build a world class navy but take a look at some of the types of ships on the list steel gunboats torpedo boats and monitors these types of boats aren t on the list anymore instead the current listof navy ships includes behemoths such as aircraft carriers ssbn nuclear powered ballistic missile carrying submarines and ssgn cruise missile submarines in other words this is an apples and oranges comparison the current level of ships 285 in fiscal 2011 is actually not even the lowest since 1916 the historical list shows that the lowest ship force was reached during the bush administration when the number of ships fell to 278 in 2007 given the change over time in the composition of the naval force that probably is the most relevant comparison and the trend line is up obama obama is quoting from one disputed study at issue is a romney proposal as part of a corporate tax reform to allow foreign profits by corporations to be exempt from domestic tax the simpson bowles deficit reduction commission frequently cited by democrats and republicans recommendedsuch a system in its report a territorial tax system should be adopted to help put the u s system in line with other countries leveling the playing field the report said the study cited by obama which appeared in tax notes did not actually study romney s plan moreover it said that such a system would create 800 000 jobs overseas but not necessarily at the expense of u s jobs if unemployment rates are low romney obama as he did during a previous debate romney pointed out that massachusettsstudents led the nation in standardized test scores for math and reading while he was governor he is correct but many educational experts credit the scores to a comprehensiveeducation overhaul that the state began a decade before the republican presidential candidate becamegovernor the president mentioned that the reforms pre dated romney s term obama also said that romney reduced education funding when the republican was governor romney did indeed enact cuts to schools while dealing with a fiscal emergency he inherited during his first year in office he then approved a budget that included 249 million in additional cuts with the first budget he signed but those reductions were first approved by a veto proof democrat led legislature that essentially called its own shots josh hicks romney obama romney thanks for the call out to fact checkers mr president back in early 2011 this column awarded romney four pinocchios for the apology tour claim saying it was not borne out by the facts here s a link to our lengthy look at this claim interestingly perhaps also in a nod to fact checkers romney noted that he calls this an apology tour rather than simply asserting it as a statement of fact he also was more specific in his critique noting a 2009 speech first highlighted by former bush aide karl rove in which the president said in strasbourg france not as romney asserted in the middle east in america there s a failure to appreciate europe s leading role in the world instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges there have been times where america has shown arrogance and been dismissive even derisive but obama was making the case that both sides had misunderstood each other and so he also said but in europe there is an anti americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious instead of recognizing the good that america so often does in the world there have been times where europeans choose to blame america for much of what s bad as we put it in our original column the two sentences are a matched pair there is no apology the dictate comment also was not delivered in the middle east that came in a 2009 speech to the summit of the americas in trinidad and tobago while the united states has done much to promote peace and prosperity in the hemisphere we have at times been disengaged and times we sought to dictate our terms as for romney s criticism of the fact obama did not visit israel we have noted before that few presidents have visited israel in their first term george w bush a strong supporter of israel did not visit until the end of his second term and ronald reagan never visited at all as is our practice we generally do not award
