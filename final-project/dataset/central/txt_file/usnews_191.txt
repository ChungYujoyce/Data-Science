 washington president donald trump said monday that he is taking a malaria drug to lessen symptoms should he get the new coronavirus even though the drug is unproven for fighting covid 19 trump told reporters he has been taking the drug hydroxychloroquine and a zinc supplement daily for about a week and a half now trump spent weeks pushing the drug as a potential cure for covid 19 against the cautionary advice of many of his administration s top medical professionals the drug has the potential to cause significant side effects in some patients and has not been shown to combat the new coronavirus trump said his doctor did not recommend the drug to him but he requested it from the white house physician i started taking it because i think it s good trump said i ve heard a lot of good stories the food and drug administration warned health professionals last month that the drug should not be used outside of hospital or research settings due to sometimes fatal side effects regulators issued the alert after receiving reports of heart rhythm problems including deaths from poison control centers and other health providers trump dismissed reports of side effects saying all i can tell you is so far i seem to be ok at least two white house staffers tested positive for covid 19 earlier this month sparking concerns about the steps taken by the administration to protect the president and sending vice president mike pence and other officials into varying forms of self isolation the white house has since mandated that those in the west wing wear face coverings and has introduced daily testing for the virus for the president vice president and those they come in close contact with trump has repeatedly pushed the use of the drug with or without the antibiotic azithromycin but no large rigorous studies have found them safe or effective for preventing or treating covid 19 two large observational studies each involving around 1 400 patients in new york recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine two new ones published thursday in the medical journal bmj reached the same conclusion one by french researchers gave 84 hospitalized patients the drug and 97 others the usual care there were no differences in the odds of death need for intensive care or developing severe illness the other study from china was a stricter test 150 adults hospitalized with mild or moderate illness were randomly assigned to get hydroxychloroquine or usual care the drug made no difference in rates of clearing the virus or time to relief of symptoms and they brought more side effects in april the national institutes of health launched a study testing hydroxychloroquine versus a placebo drug in 500 hospitalized covid 19 patients last week nih announced another study to see if hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin can prevent hospitalization or death in people with mild to moderate illness about 2 000 u s adults with confirmed coronavirus infections and symptoms such as fever cough or shortness of breath will get the drugs or placebo pills ap medical writers marilynn marchione in milwaukee and matthew perrone in washington contributed to this report contact us at editors time com
