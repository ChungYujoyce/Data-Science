last week alexandria ocasio cortez d ny tweeted the electoral college isn t about fairness at all it s about empowering some voters over others every vote should be in america no matter who you are or where you come from the right thing to do is establish a popular vote twitterrep dan crenshaw r tx replied abolishing the electoral college means that politicians will only campaign in and listen to urban areas that is not a representative democracy we live in a republic which means 51 of the population doesn t get to boss around the other 49 twittersee our prior coverage of the issue here the flip side the left supports eliminating the electoral college arguing that all votes should count equally regardless of which state they re from presidential elections are currently decided by swing states ones that are less racially diverse than the country as a whole and in 2016 represented only 35 percent of eligible voters last presidential election 95 percent of candidate appearances and 99 percent of campaign spending went to fourteen states none of them are particularly rural nor with the exception of new hampshire remotely small the swing states due to their electoral significance also have a stranglehold on national policies the coal industry for example has outsize influence because of its prominence in pennsylvania so too does the ethanol industry because of iowa moreover u s tariffs have disproportionately benefited industries located in swing states and the battleground states have historically received more in federal grants than the rest of the country adam eichen the new republic a presidential candidate who focused only on america s cities and urban centers would lose there just aren t enough votes republicans live in cities just as democrats live in rural areas under a popular vote candidates would still have to build national coalitions across demographic and geographic lines the difference is that those coalitions would involve every region of the country instead of a handful of competitive states in the rust belt and parts of the south the founders feared direct democracy and accounted for its dangers with a system of representative democracy yes this republic had counter majoritarian aspects like equal representation of states in the senate the presidential veto and the supreme court but it was not designed for minority rule virtually everything was geared toward producing representative majorities that could govern on behalf of the country to diminish faction in favor of consensus jamelle bouie new york times statewide offices such as governor and senator take place all the time all of them use a simple statewide vote and yet lots and lots of statewide candidates nevertheless campaign in rural areas all the time including in states where the rural vote is just a fraction of the overall vote others have noted that there are plenty of rural voters in california and other states including at least recently texas that are uncontested and therefore get no candidate attention under the current rules there s going to be a president elected whether with a majority or a minority of the vote it s bad if the majority is rewarded with absolute rule but it s quite a bit worse i m not even aware of any vaguely plausible argument otherwise if the minority is rewarded with absolute rule and no it doesn t matter a bit if that minority is the one that crenshaw or anyone else happens to like the remedy for majority tyranny isn t to tabulate the votes in some convoluted way to get a preferred minority to win the madisonian remedies for majority tyranny are such things as having multiple branches of government each with a different form of election meaningful federalism separated institutions sharing powers and so on jonathan bernstein bloomberg many dispute iowa senator jodi ernst s claim that giving voters everywhere the exact same power to elect a president is going to silence anyone it s true that the losers relatively speaking in a shift from electoral college to a popular vote system would be closely contested battleground states that naturally attract candidate attention more than safely democratic or republican states but the real howler about this is that ernst is talking about preserving the power in presidential elections of iowa for god s sake this is the state where caucuses stand at the gateway to the presidential nominating process iowa maker of legends and breaker of hearts candidates may secretly hate the hawkeye state for the time and money it consumes or for the winter weather but they are going to pay it attention and hear its voters voices over and over again ed kilgore new york magazine dated but relevant the electoral college is essentially a vestigial structure a leftover from a bygone era in which the founding fathers specifically did not want a nationwide vote of the american people to choose their next president a national popular vote system wouldn t devalue the votes of people who live in rural states and small towns it would accurately value them by treating them equal to people who live in cities furthermore small state interests are built into the senate s math where delaware absurdly gets as many senators as california and many house districts are rural so rural and small state areas are hardly hurting for national political representation sure candidates might end up spending less time stumping in the rural areas that currently happen to be lucky enough to fall within the borders of swing states and more time in urban centers but is that really a convincing rebuttal to the pretty basic and obvious argument that in the most important electoral choice americans make their votes should be treated equally andrew prokop vox finally many rural states are ignored due to the electoral college candidates don t campaign in montana kansas or west virginia they spend time in big cities in florida pennsylvania and ohio the electoral college keeps candidates away from most states renato mariotti twitter the right opposes eliminating the electoral college arguing that it incentivizes candidates to appeal to diverse coalitions of voters the right opposes eliminating the electoral college arguing that it incentivizes candidates to appeal to diverse coalitions of voters ultimately and as a matter of history the electoral college rewards those presidential candidates or political parties that do the best job of listening to a wide variety of voters those who decided to double down with their base and ignore the rest of the country usually end up losing recent close elections have come about because everyone keeps forgetting these important underlying purposes of the electoral college many have neglected to build coalitions both parties are instead catering to their bases consequently the first party to reach out to create broad coalitions will also start winning presidential elections in landslides tara ross daily signal in our current system candidates campaign in every state in which there is a close contest whether those states are large or small rural or urban demographically diverse or homogenous and it s extremely difficult to become president without building a large coalition of voters from many parts of the country many of which have very different cultures ideas religious beliefs ideological beliefs and economic interests the electoral college system isn t perfect but it s certainly not racist as ocasio cortez suggested sparsely populated racially diverse states including liberal states like rhode island benefit from the electoral college just as much as states like montana do the purpose of the electoral college isn t to help white people it s to elevate the power of voters in states that otherwise would be completely forgotten and disenfranchised justin haskins fox news campaigning in new hampshire is very different from campaigning in california and representing all the people means representing them no less as texans or new yorkers than as citizens of an undifferentiated whole once the states are removed from the presidential election system these important and celebrated features of political locale will lose much of their significance voters in the less populous states indeed in any area that cannot be readily subsumed in a mass media market will be of decidedly secondary importance to presidential candidates under direct election the media mavens will not have to leave their offices in new york washington or los angeles to run a presidential campaign why should they as john f kennedy said in defending the electoral college in the 1950s changing the mode of presidential election affects not only presidential candidates but the whole solar system of our constitutional and political arrangements in ways that are difficult to predict but unlikely to be beneficial with a national plebiscite the customary ties that bind state and local party units to national campaigns will necessarily dissolve the national party committees will have to be radically restructured with state party representatives being displaced by political operatives bearing little or no allegiance to any state their loyalties run instead to the personal campaign apparatus of wealthy or powerful candidates michael m uhlmann the american mind some point out that in most states a candidate who receives 51 of the vote receives 100 of the electoral college votes if you re a member of the 49 your vote becomes a footnote and is not reflected in the final national electoral outcome we can achieve a more representative electoral system without completely abandoning the electoral college states should choose to assign their electoral college votes on a proportional basis rather than according to a winner take all approach this would mean that if a democrat carries the state with 70 of the vote they win most of the electors votes but 30 still go to the republican candidate making the minority vote count too brad polumbo washington examiner dated but relevant what s essential about the electoral college is the ability to have some check on direct democracy and the centralization of power that comes with it all extreme political movements are hostile to restraints on their will this is what unites the progressives who want to pack the supreme court abolish the electoral college and reform the undemocratic senate with those on the right who celebrate president trump s emergency declaration and other attempts to rule by fiat in a healthy democracy leaders are answerable not just to voters but to legislatures the courts the states and parties the decades long trend has been to dismantle this arrangement to make presidents answerable to no one but the slice of electorate that voted for them and even there those voters are increasingly more interested in seeing their leader win than in holding them accountable jonah goldberg national review democrats need to stop bashing the electoral college when they lose the 2016 election was winnable you all know this the democrats could ve easily beaten trump but their people stayed home with hillary clinton on the ticket there was just no excitement really none just compare the results from 2012 and 2016 in wayne county michigan detroit it s quite stark and decisive all clinton had to do was match obama s totals and she would ve won all she had to do was not tell coal miners that her mission would be to throw them on the street all she had to do was reach out to rural and working class voters she didn t when you don t do the leg work you only have yourself to blame matt vespa townhall 4 year old has birthday party of his dreams at costco newsweek
