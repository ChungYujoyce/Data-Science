 by robert farley posted on december 16 2019 president donald trump wrongly claimed the commission on presidential debates was forced to publicly apologize for modulating his microphone in the first 2016 general election debate the bipartisan commission did not apologize for any willful tampering but acknowledged there were issues regarding donald trump s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall trump s wariness about the commission on presidential debates the nonprofit entity that sponsors the events goes back to the first presidential debate between trump and hillary clinton in september 2016 when trump raised issues about what he said was a defective mic and suggested it may have been deliberate trickery he also labeled the debate rigged because the head guy used to work for bill clinton as we wrote then the commission was co chaired by a former clinton aide and a former republican national committee chairman the cpd currently has three co chairs frank j fahrenkopf jr who was chairman of the republican national committee from 1983 to 1989 dorothy ridings formerly a newspaper journalist president of the league of women voters and president and chief executive officer of the charitable council on foundations and kenneth wollack a former president of the national democratic institute who once served on the national staff of democrat george mcgovern s presidential campaign in 1972 the new york times reported on dec 12 that trump and his advisers were discussing the possibility of opting out of the general election debates in 2020 due to trump s concerns about the commission trump responded to that news report in a series of tweets on dec 16 i look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched do nothing democrat debates my record is so good on the economy and all else including debating that perhaps i would consider more than 3 debates donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 16 2019 to me and there are many options including doing them directly avoiding the nasty politics of this very biased commission i will make a decision at an appropriate time but in the meantime the commission on presidential debates is not authorized to speak for me or r s donald j trump realdonaldtrump december 16 2019 in the spin room after the first presidential debate on sept 26 2016 at hofstra university trump complained that they gave me a defective mic and questioned whether that was done on purpose four days after the debate the cpd released a terse statement saying there was a technical glitch with trump s microphone that affected his volume in the debate room but did not affect the audio for the 84 million people who watched the debate on television commission on presidential debates sept 30 2016 regarding the first debate there were issues regarding donald trump s audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall we reached out to the commission seeking clarification about what specifically the technical issue was and why it affected trump s microphone and not clinton s we ll update this story if we get a response according to the new york times trump said after the debate that the changing volume had distracted him and alleged again that someone had created the problem deliberately they had somebody modulating the microphone so when i was speaking the mike would go up and down trump said i spent 50 percent of my thought process working the mike the times noted that there was no evidence of sabotage we note that cpd did not apologize as trump said nor did it admit to modulating his microphone which suggests intentional meddling but the cpd did acknowledge there had been a technological malfunction that affected trump s audio in the debate room in a cnn op ed in february pushing back against criticism that it shuts out third party candidates from debates the two cpd co chairs at the time stated the cpd is run by an independent board made up of independents republicans and democrats it receives no party or government funding and no major party official serves in any capacity with the cpd the cpd which has sponsored all of the presidential debates since 1988 released a statement on dec 16 saying our record is one of fairness balance and non partisanship the commission has issued a schedule of three general election debates starting with one on sept 29 2020 at the university of notre dame as well as a vice presidential debate on oct 7 q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
