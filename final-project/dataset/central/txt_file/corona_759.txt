holiday in italy short and were waiting for a flight home from venice the initial announcement that venice was in lockdown was quite terrifying but everything at the airport is pretty calm he said i was in a bit of a panic as i thought we were going to be stuck in venice for a month last week was critical to seeing if italy s coronavirus response had managed to halt the spread if the numbers had begun to tail off it would have suggested the containment measures had worked they haven t with cases still surging the government has moved to the next stage and it s a dramatic step up it s not quite a complete lockdown planes and trains are still running and access will be permitted for emergency or essential work reasons but police will be able to stop people and ask why they re trying to enter or leave the areas covered the question is whether this is all too late it s believed the virus was circulating in italy for weeks before it was detected and there have now been cases in all 22 regions of the country the government is now taking the most extensive containment measures outside of china but is this a case of trying to shut the stable door after the horse has bolted weddings
