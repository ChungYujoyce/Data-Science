 by rem rieder lori robertson and robert farley posted on april 3 2020 corrected on april 14 2020 in a little more than a month president donald trump s language about the coronavirus has shifted from talk of 15 cases that within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero to warning of as many as 2 2 million deaths in the country if no social distancing efforts were undertaken at times the president has acknowledged he changed his assessment of the pandemic but in other cases he and vice president mike pence have tried to revise history ignoring or recasting his previous statements here we outline trump s evolving language on the deadliness of the virus its spread in the u s and how it compares with the seasonal flu we also provide a timeline of the president s comments below in an interview on cnn on april 1 pence said i don t believe the president has ever belittled the threat of the coronavirus that may be what the vice president believes but he is wrong the truth is that trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus from jan 22 to march 10 as we reported before trump made a series of statements minimizing the danger posed to the united states see our timeline below on march 16 trump reversed course imposing social distancing guidelines for 15 days the following day he said at a press conference this is a pandemic i felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic but he soon sounded a different tone again as recently as march 24 at a fox news virtual town hall trump likened the disease s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents at the time the president was considering for economic reasons whether to relax the social distancing guidelines he had imposed to combat the spread of covid 19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus trump march 24 i brought some numbers here we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu we don t turn the country off i mean every year now when i heard the number we average 37 000 people a year can you believe that and actually this year we re having a bad flu season but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu we never turn the country off we lose much more than that to automobile accidents we didn t call up the automobile companies say stop making cars we don t want any cars anymore we have to get back to work he suggested he might ease the social distancing guidelines i would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by easter he said on march 29 the president abandoned that aspiration and announced the guidelines would remain in place until april 30 in the cnn interview pence maintained that the president had been aware throughout of the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak confronted by anchor wolf blitzer with statements by trump minimizing the danger pence replied the president is an optimistic person we ve been from the very beginning when the president suspended all travel from china and stood up the white house coronavirus task force in january we have been hoping for the best but planning for the worst and that s been being worked out every single day the vice president is wrong to claim that the president suspended all travel from china from the very beginning as we have written the administration did not suspend all travel there were exceptions including for americans and their family members to the travel policy announced on jan 31 in acoronavirustask force press briefingon march 15 trump praised the task force members standing behind him saying they have been working around the clock and were doing an incredible job then he added this is a very contagious this is a very contagious virus it s incredible but it s something that we have tremendous control over the next day when asked about that statement trump attempted to reframe his past comments about the u s having the coronavirus under control well when i m talking about control i m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we re dealing with trump said if you re talking about the virus no that s not under control for any place in the world at times trump has been clear that he meant the federal government s response to the pandemic is under control such ason feb 29when talking about a natural reflex among democrats to criticize his actions and we ve done a great job trump said at the annual conservative political action conference and i ve gotten to know these professionals they re incredible and everything is under control i mean they re very very cool they ve done it and they ve done it well everything is really under control but when they put a mic in front of a democrat and the democrat said doesn t even know what s going on how is trump doing he s doing a terrible job well sadly i d probably say the same about them at other times however trump s under control comments appear to be about the coronavirus itself for example on feb 24 trumptweeted the coronavirus is very much under control in the usa oron feb 26 when trump said it s going to be very well under control now it may get bigger it may get a little bigger it may not get bigger at all we ll see what happens but regardless of what happens we are totally prepared or on feb 25 when he said at abusiness roundtablein india if you go back six months or three months ago nobody would have ever predicted but let s see i think it s going to be under control and i think i can speak for our country for our country is under control that same day during a press conference in india trump said you may ask about the coronavirus which is very well under control in our country we have very few people with it the trump administration has moved the goal posts dramatically when it comes to estimates of how many americans will contract covid 19 for weeks as he downplayed the disease s danger trump said there were just a small number of cases in the u s and that the disease would vanish by the end of march he was saying that without dramatic action like social distancing as many as 2 2 million americans could die on feb 10 when he suggested the disease would go away in april with the heat as the heat comes in trumpsaid we have 12 cases 11 cases and many of them are in good shape now see our item will the new coronavirus go away in april on feb 26 the presidentsaid as they get better we take them off the list so that we re going to be pretty soon at only five people and we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time that same day he alsosaid and again when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that s a pretty good job we ve done trump was still downplaying the scope of the problem on march 4 when hesaid w e have a very small number of people in this country infected we have a big country but by the end of the month trump was painting a stark picture of the disease s potential toll on march 29 when he announced he was extending social distancing guidelines until the end of april he said as many as 2 2 million americans could die of covid 19 if the country failed to take decisive action hesaid so you re talking about 2 2 million deaths 2 2 million people from this and so if we can hold that down as we re saying to 100 000 that s a horrible number maybe even less but to 100 000 so we have between 100 and 200 000 we all together have done a very good job but 2 2 up to 2 2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that at a white house briefing on march 31 federal health officialsraisedthe upper limit of those who might die from the disease even with mitigation efforts to 240 000 several times trump had compared the coronavirus outbreak to the seasonal flu but in the march 29 task force briefing trumpacknowledgedthat he had changed his mind about this but there were a lot of people that said i thought about it i said maybe we should ride it through you know you always hear about the flu i talk about it all the time we had a bad flu season we re in the midst of a bad flu season trump said but this is different and part of this is the unknown and part of it also is the viciousness of it two days later he repeated those remarks but said the flu comparison came from many friends and a lot of people i mean i ve had many friends business people people with great actually common sense they said why don t we ride it out a lot of people have said a lot of people have thought about it ride it out don t do anything just ride it out and think of it as the flu but it s not the flu trumpsaid that s a marked difference from his earlier comments comparing covid 19 to the flu for example in the march 24 virtual town hall trumpsaid and actually this year we re having a bad flu season but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu we never turn the country off and in a march 9 tweet hesaiddeaths from the flu average between 27 000 and 70 000 per year nothing is shut down life the economy go on at this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 22 deaths think about that in a feb 26 press conference trump made some confusing remarks that wrongly suggested the fatality rate for the flu is much higher than the rate for covid 19 aswe wrote so far the worldwide fatality rate for covid 19 has been higher but aswe have explained the rate may end up falling as more is known about the actual number of cases as for the seasonal flu or influenza it does kill thousands of americans each year and infects millions for the 2019 2020 flu season 39 million to 55 million people had flu illnesses in the u s according topreliminary estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc estimates this season s flu had caused between 24 000 and 63 000 deaths since 2010 influenza in the u s has caused between 9 million and 45 million illnesses annually the cdcsays with 12 000 to 61 000 of those resulting in death trump also has made comparisons between the coronavirus pandemic and the2009 h1n1 influenza pandemic but aswe ve written the two viruses are very different peter jay hotez a professor and dean of the tropical medicine school at baylor college of medicine told us that the novel coronavirus which is known as sars cov 2 is considerably more transmissible and more lethal than the h1n1 influenza virus the urgency to contain this coronavirus is so much greater than the h1n1 2009 one was he said here is a timeline of statements the president has made about the coronavirus outbreak in the united states beginning two days after the first case in the country was confirmed jan 22 we have it totally under control it s one person coming in from china and we have it under control it s going to be just fine cnbc interview jan 30 we think we have it very well under control we have very little problem in this country at this moment five and those people are all recuperating successfully but we re working very closely with china and other countries and we think it s going to have a very good ending for us that i can assure you a speech in michigan feb 10 now the virus that we re talking about having to do you know a lot of people think that goes away in april with the heat as the heat comes in typically that will go away in april we re in great shape though we have 12 cases 11 cases and many of them are in good shape now remarks to governors feb 14 there s a theory that in april when it gets warm historically that has been able to kill the virus so we don t know yet we re not sure yet but that s around the corner speaking to national border patrol council members feb 23 we have it very much under control in this country speaking to reporters feb 24 the coronavirus is very much under control in the usa we are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries cdc world health have been working hard and very smart stock market starting to look very good to me on twitter feb 25 you may ask about the coronavirus which is very well under control in our country we have very few people with it and the people that have it are in all cases i have not heard anything other press conferencein new delhi india feb 25 if you go back six months or three months ago nobody would have ever predicted but let s see i think it s going to be under control and i think i can speak for our country for our country is under control abusiness roundtablein new delhi india feb 26 so we re at the low level as they get better we take them off the list so that we re going to be pretty soon at only five people and we could be at just one or two people over the next short period of time so we ve had very good luck white house task force briefing feb 26 and again when you have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero that s a pretty good job we ve done press conference feb 26 i think every aspect of our society should be prepared i don t think it s going to come to that especially with the fact that we re going down not up we re going very substantially down not up press conference when asked if u s schools should be preparing for a coronavirus spreading feb 26 it s going to be very well under control now it may get bigger it may get a little bigger it may not get bigger at all we ll see what happens but regardless of what happens we are totally prepared press conference feb 27 it s going to disappear one day it s like a miracle it will disappear and from our shores we you know it could get worse before it gets better it could maybe go away we ll see what happens nobody really knows white house meeting with african american leaders feb 29 and i ve gotten to know these professionals they re incredible and everything is under control i mean they re very very cool they ve done it and they ve done it well everything is really under control speech at cpac outside of washington d c march 4 w e have a very small number of people in this country infected we have a big country the biggest impact we had was when we took the 40 plus people from a cruise ship we brought them back we immediately quarantined them but you add that to the numbers but if you don t add that to the numbers we re talking about very small numbers in the united states white house meeting with airline ceos march 4 well i think the 3 4 is really a false number interview on fox news referring to the percentage of diagnosed covid 19 patients worldwide who had died as reported by the world health organization see our item trump and the coronavirus death rate march 7 no i m not concerned at all no i m not no we ve done a great job speaking to reporters when asked if he was concerned about the arrival of the coronavirus in the washington d c area march 9 so last year 37 000 americans died from the common flu it averages between 27 000 and 70 000 per year nothing is shut down life the economy go on at this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus with 22 deaths think about that on twitter march 10 and we re prepared and we re doing a great job with it and it will go away just stay calm it will go away after meeting with republican senators march 15 this is a very contagious this is a very contagious virus it s incredible but it s something that we have tremendous control over white house task force briefing march 16 when i m talking about control i m saying we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we re dealing with we re doing a very good job if you re talking about the virus no that s not under control for any place in the world i was talking about what we re doing is under control white house task force press briefing march 17 i ve always known this is a this is a real this is a pandemic i ve felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic white house task force press briefing march 23 people get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicides over things like this when you have terrible economies you have death probably and i mean definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we re talking about with regard to the virus white house task force briefing march 24 i would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by easter fox news virtual town hall i brought some numbers here we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu we don t turn the country off i mean every year now when i heard the number we average 37 000 people a year can you believe that and actually this year we re having a bad flu season but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu we never turn the country off we lose much more than that to automobile accidents we didn t call up the automobile companies say stop making cars we don t want any cars anymore we have to get back to work fox news virtual town hall march 29 but there were a lot of people that said i thought about it i said maybe we should ride it through you know you always hear about the flu i talk about it all the time we had a bad flu season we re in the midst of a bad flu season but this is different and part of this is the unknown and part of it also is the viciousness of it white house task force press briefing so you re talking about 2 2 million deaths 2 2 million people from this and so if we can hold that down as we re saying to 100 000 that s a horrible number maybe even less but to 100 000 so we have between 100 and 200 000 we all together have done a very good job but 2 2 up to 2 2 million deaths and maybe even beyond that white house task force press briefing march 31 i mean i ve had many friends business people people with great actually common sense they said why don t we ride it out a lot of people have said a lot of people have thought about it ride it out don t do anything just ride it out and think of it as the flu but it s not the flu white house task force briefing correction april 14 we originally said our timeline of trump s statements began on jan 24 it begins on jan 22 q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
