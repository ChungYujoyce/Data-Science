the second night of the second round of the democrats presidential debates was no eloquent dialogue between moderates and the left it was an all out panderfest and at times an old fashioned slugfest by the end of this endless debate spooned out in one minute dollops i walked out with a 1 000 a month check an extra grand if i m a female untold reparations dollars if i am african american medicare from birth covering everything i ll ever need until death and the right to cross the border without any real penalty if i m from another country prosecuting criminals of any kind generally got a thumbs down while white privilege made me immune from racist police who were painted as villains and there will be no more pointless wars carbon emissions will be zero by 2030 and it may take 10 years but the government will run almost all health care while these same candidates earlier this week expressed outrage at president trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more for tweeting that baltimore was a rat infested mess they all seemed to portray our entire country as in far worse shape than that maryland oasis america it seems is not the land of full employment rising wages and decreased poverty it s not a country in which 90 percent have health insurance almost everyone has a smartphone and 64 percent own their home it s at heart a racist misogynistic country dominated by fat cats and big corporations sucking the life out of us all according to these candidates it s a dark dark place and unless we usher them into office and save it through these programs and policies that start at a mere 30 trillion america will continue to be a lost country nearly every one of the candidates called for the impeachment of president trump and yet none of them called out a specific act that the president did to merit impeachment they just said that former special counsel robert muellerrobert bob muellercnn s toobin warns mccabe is in perilous condition with

more off his front runner pedestal and while the former vice president was at times wobbly the consensus is that he held his own this time he did and he deserves some courage points for standing up for his record and releasing a health care plan based on expanding obamacare and yet one wonders how he will fare in a smaller group of candidates with sen elizabeth warrenelizabeth warrenpentagon

that one but shrugged it off as a long time ago the candidates views on trade were largely incomprehensible democrats used to be the party of protectionism working to stop the theft of jobs by low wage workers in places like china yet they all opposed the trump tariffs while pledging to have labor and environmentalists at the table for future trade deals whatever that means none of the

twin forces of technology and globalization while separated by religion ethnicity and nationality the debate s format promoted an almost comic strip view of the world with rapid fire questions and responses generally all of the questions were softballs that allowed the candidates to repeat their favorite stump speech lines or lines they crafted for the debate and sen kirsten gillibrandkirsten

at the white house on the first day if she is elected i think you can tell that there was little i liked about this debate and the direction the major candidates for the democratic nomination are taking to make it through the early rounds of survivor i felt quite differently after the tuesday debate when moderates fairly challenged the left on policies that would cost trillions that night lacked fireworks but showed the democrats as a serious party having a substantive debate even the policies i didn t agree with came off as smart and worth at least considering but the wednesday night debate was quite different as the candidates reeled off prepared lines geared toward putting identity and class politics at the heart of the revival of the party and their advancement to the next round this approach was discarded in the 90s only to return bigger than ever today as each candidate sought to outdo the other with outlandish promises and oppo research attacks mark pennis a managing
