republican presidential candidate donald trump his party s front runner for the nomination addressed the american israel public affairs committee monday discussing relations between the u s and israel a complete transcript of his remarks follows trump good evening thank you very much i speak to you today as a lifelong supporter and true friend of israel cheers applause i am a newcomer to politics but not to backing the jewish state applause in 2001 weeks after the attacks on new york city and on washington and frankly the attacks on all of us attacks that perpetrated and they were perpetrated by the islamic fundamentalists mayor rudy giuliani visited israel to show solidarity with terror victims i sent my plane because i backed the mission for israel 100 percent cheers applause in spring of 2004 at the height of the violence in the gaza strip i was the grand marshal of the 40th salute to israel parade the largest single gathering in support of the jewish state applause it was a very dangerous time for israel and frankly for anyone supporting israel many people turned down this honor i did not i took the risk and i m glad i did applause but i didn t come here tonight to pander to you about israel that s what politicians do all talk no action believe me applause i came here to speak to you about where i stand on the future of american relations with our strategic ally our unbreakable friendship and our cultural brother the only democracy in the middle east the state of israel cheers applause thank you my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran cheers applause thank you thank you i have been in business a long time i know deal making and let me tell you this deal is catastrophic for america for israel and for the whole of the middle east applause the problem here is fundamental we ve rewarded the world s leading state sponsor of terror with 150 billion and we received absolutely nothing in return applause i ve studied this issue in great detail i would say actually greater by far than anybody else laughter believe me oh believe me and it s a bad deal the biggest concern with the deal is not necessarily that iran is going to violate it because already you know as you know it has the bigger problem is that they can keep the terms and still get the bomb by simply running out the clock and of course they ll keep the billions and billions of dollars that we so stupidly and foolishly gave them applause the deal doesn t even require iran to dismantle its military nuclear capability yes it places limits on its military nuclear program for only a certain number of years but when those restrictions expire iran will have an industrial sized military nuclear capability ready to go and with zero provision for delay no matter how bad iran s behavior is terrible terrible situation that we are all placed in and especially israel applause when i m president i will adopt a strategy that focuses on three things when it comes to iran first we will stand up to iran s aggressive push to destabilize and dominate the region applause iran is a very big problem and will continue to be but if i m not elected president i know how to deal with trouble and believe me that s why i m going to be elected president folks cheers applause and we are leading in every poll remember that please cheers iran is a problem in iraq a problem in syria a problem in lebanon a problem in yemen and will be a very very major problem for saudi arabia literally every day iran provides more and better weapons to support their puppet states hezbollah lebanon received and i ll tell you what it has received sophisticated anti ship weapons anti aircraft weapons and gps systems and rockets like very few people anywhere in the world and certainly very few countries have now they re in syria trying to establish another front against israel from the syrian side of the golan heights in gaza iran is supporting hamas and islamic jihad and in the west bank they re openly offering palestinians 7 000 per terror attack and 30 000 for every palestinian terrorist s home that s been destroyed a deplorable deplorable situation applause iran is financing military forces throughout the middle east and it s absolutely incredible that we handed them over 150 billion to do even more toward the many horrible acts of terror applause secondly we will totally dismantle iran s global terror network which is big and powerful but not powerful like us applause iran has seeded terror groups all over the world during the last five years iran has perpetuated terror attacks in 25 different countries on five continents they ve got terror cells everywhere including in the western hemisphere very close to home iran is the biggest sponsor of terrorism around the world and we will work to dismantle that reach believe me believe me applause third at the very least we must enforce the terms of the previous deal to hold iran totally accountable and we will enforce it like you ve never seen a contract enforced before folks believe me applause iran has already since the deal is in place test fired ballistic missiles three times those ballistic missiles with a range of 1 250 miles were designed to intimidate not only israel which is only 600 miles away but also intended to frighten europe and someday maybe hit even the united states and we re not going to let that happen we re not letting it happen and we re not letting it happen to israel believe me cheers applause thank you thank you do you want to hear something really shocking as many of the great people in this room know painted on those missiles in both hebrew and farsi were the words israel must be wiped off the face of the earth you can forget that applause what kind of demented minds write that in hebrew and here s another you talk about twisted here s another twisted part testing these missiles does not even violate the horrible deal that we ve made the deal is silent on test missiles but those tests do violate the united nations security council resolutions the problem is no one has done anything about it we will we will i promise we will cheers applause thank you which brings me to my next point the utter weakness and incompetence of the united nations cheers applause the united nations is not a friend of democracy it s not a friend to freedom it s not a friend even to the united states of america where as you know it has its home and it surely is not a friend to israel applause with president obama in his final year yea laughter cheers applause laughter he may be the worst thing to ever happen to israel believe me believe me and you know it and you know it better than anybody so with the president in his final year discussions have been swirling about an attempt to bring a security council resolution on terms of an eventual agreement between israel and palestine let me be clear an agreement imposed by the united nations would be a total and complete disaster applause the united states must oppose this resolution and use the power of our veto which i will use as president 100 percent applause when people ask why it s because that s not how you make a deal deals are made when parties come together they come to a table and they negotiate each side must give up something it s values i mean we have to do something where there s value in exchange for something that it requires that s what a deal is a deal is really something that when we impose it on israel and palestine we bring together a group of people that come up with something that s not going to happen with the united nations it will only further very importantly it will only further delegitimize israel it will be a catastrophe and a disaster for israel it s not going to happen folks cheers applause and further it would reward palestinian terrorism because every day they re stabbing israelis and even americans just last week american taylor allen force a west point grad phenomenal young person who served in iraq and afghanistan was murdered in the street by a knife wielding palestinian you don t reward behavior like that you cannot do it applause there s only one way you treat that kind of behavior you have to confront it applause so it s not up to the united nations to really go with a solution it s really the parties that must negotiate a resolution themselves they have no choice they have to do it themselves or it will never hold up anyway the united states can be useful as a facilitator of negotiations but no one should be telling israel that it must be and really that it must abide by some agreement made by others thousands of miles away that don t even really know what s happening to israel to anything in the area it s so preposterous we re not going to let that happen cheers applause when i m president believe me i will veto any attempt by the u n to impose its will on the jewish state it will be vetoed 100 percent applause you see i know about deal making that s what i do i wrote the art of the deal laughter one of the best selling all time and i mean seriously i m saying one of because i ll be criticized when i say the so i m going to be very diplomatic one of laughter i ll be criticized i think it is number one but why take a chance laughter applause one of the all time best selling books about deals and deal making to make a great deal you need two willing participants we know israel is willing to deal israel has been trying applause that s right israel has been trying to sit down at the negotiating table without preconditions for years you had camp david in 2000 where prime minister barak made an incredible offer maybe even too generous arafat rejected it in 2008 prime minister olmert made an equally generous offer the palestinian authority rejected it also then john kerry tried to come up with a framework and abbas didn t even respond not even to the secretary of state of the united states of america they didn t even respond when i become president the days of treating israel like a second class citizen will end on day one cheers applause thank you and when i say something i mean it i mean it i will meet with prime minister netanyahu immediately i have known him for many years and we ll be able to work closely together to help bring stability and peace to israel and to the entire region meanwhile every single day you have rampant incitement and children being taught to hate israel and to hate the jews it has to stop applause when you live in a society where the firefighters are the heroes little kids want to be firefighters when you live in a society where athletes and movie stars are the heroes little kids want to be athletes and movie stars in palestinian society the heroes are those who murder jews we can t let this continue we can t let this happen any longer cheers applause you cannot achieve peace if terrorists are treated as martyrs glorifying terrorists is a tremendous barrier to peace it is a horrible horrible way to think it s a barrier that can t be broken that will end and it ll end soon believe me applause in palestinian textbooks and mosques you ve got a culture of hatred that has been fomenting there for years and if we want to achieve peace they ve got to go out and they ve got to start this educational process they have to end education of hatred they have to end it and now applause there is no moral equivalency israel does not name public squares after terrorists israel does not pay its children to stab random palestinians you see what president obama gets wrong about deal making is that he constantly applies pressure to our friends and rewards our enemies cheers applause and you see that happening all the time that pattern practiced by the president and his administration including former secretary of state hillary clinton who is a total disaster by the way laughter cheers applause she and president obama have treated israel very very badly applause but it s repeated itself over and over again and has done nothing to embolden those who hate america we saw that with releasing the 150 billion to iran in the hope that they would magically join the world community it didn t happen applause president obama thinks that applying pressure to israel will force the issue but it s precisely the opposite that happens already half of the population of palestine has been taken over by the palestinian isis and hamas and the other half refuses to confront the first half so it s a very difficult situation that s never going to get solved unless you have great leadership right here in the united states we ll get it solved one way or the other we will get it solved applause but when the united states stands with israel the chances of peace really rise and rises exponentially that s what will happen when donald trump is president of the united states cheers applause we will move the american embassy to the eternal capital of the jewish people jerusalem cheers applause and we will send a clear signal that there is no daylight between america and our most reliable ally the state of israel cheers applause the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is absolutely totally unbreakable applause they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel they must do that and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a jewish state cheers applause i love the people in this room i love israel i love israel i ve been with israel so long in terms of i ve received some of my greatest honors from israel my father before me incredible my daughter ivanka is about to have a beautiful jewish baby cheers applause in fact it could be happening right now which would be very nice as far as i m concerned laughter so i want to thank you very much this has been a truly great honor thank you everybody thank you thank you very much cheers applause contact us at editors time com
