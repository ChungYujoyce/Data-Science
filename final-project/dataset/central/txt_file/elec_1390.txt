 jessica taylor republican presidential candidate donald trump speaks as jeb bush listens during the first republican presidential debate in cleveland andrew harnik ap hide caption republican presidential candidate donald trump speaks as jeb bush listens during the first republican presidential debate in cleveland jeb bush isn t pulling punches anymore when it comes to donald trump the former florida governor has delicately danced around the billionaire businessman in the 2016 presidential primary so far but the gloves came off this week when bush called out trump as a closet democrat he was trying to stunt trump s rise while attempting to recover his own political mojo what jeb is desperately trying to do is find his swagger right now gop strategist ford o connell said the knock against jeb is that he s low voltage and not willing to fight the best way to shake those perceptions it to engage against the person who is in the media on a 24 7 loop it s a change from bush s approach to this point he hasn t lobbed many direct attacks at trump other than delicately condemning his criticism of arizona sen john mccain s war service and his attacks against fox news megyn kelly even in this month s first debate bush swatted down a story that he had allegedly called trump a buffoon and a clown saying only that trump s language had been divisive trump called bush a true gentleman the detente ended this week so far most of the top tier candidates have avoided directly attacking trump treating him with kid gloves so as not to anger the part of the gop base to which trump appeals in other words the very voters they need when they hope trump fades in split screen new hampshire town halls this week bush and trump volleyed attacks on each other bush took his most pointed jabs at the current front runner underscoring trump s past history as a democrat and the liberal positions he used to hold mr trump doesn t have a proven conservative record bush said according to the washington post he was a democrat longer in the last decade than he was a republican he has given more money to democrats than he s given to republicans bush went on to attack trump over his hard line immigration proposal arguing it was not just vitriolic but would have a massive price tag hundreds of billions of dollars of costs to implement his plans is not a conservative plan bush said this is going to be my pitch let s support someone who you don t have to guess where he stands because he s consistent because he s been governor he s consistently had the views that he has got to discuss in nh how i m a proven conservative with a record while realdonaldtrump isn t compare https t co 33y3ddzdom his massive inconsistencies aside realdonaldtrump s immigration plan is not conservative and does not reflect our nation s values over the next few days bush continued the hits on social media but trump never one to miss a moment to retaliate didn t pull his punches either at his own town hall wednesday trump blasted bush as an unelectable low energy person you know what s happening to jeb s crowd just down the street they re sleeping trump said to applause jeb bush signed memo saying not to use the term anchor babies offensive now he wants to use it because i use it stay true to yourself since then trump has also ramped up his attacks against bush on twitter the move to more hot rhetoric may have tripped bush up though consider his use of the phrase anchor babies while immigration reform is something bush is passionate about and has even written a book about he s often criticized within the gop as too liberal on the issue instead a more combative bush appeared to use the loaded phrase for the first time he was left struggling to defend his use of it it may have been a signal that the attack dog crouch he s taking is still one that isn t completely comfortable to bush who earlier said he wanted to campaign joyfully other candidates have embraced hitting trump kentucky sen rand paul went after him forcefully in the debate though his punch that trump was hedging his bets to support hillary clinton if she wins the presidency didn t appear to land other candidates like ohio gov john kasich demurred in the earlier gop debate that night former texas gov rick perry and businesswoman carly fiorina also jabbed at trump bush though needs to close the floodgates he s dropped in national polls as trump has risen and in new hampshire where bush once led trump and even newcomer kasich have seen surges cullen a former new hampshire gop chairman said the change in tone and tactics was a smart move for bush one that could help him in the granite state i think it s good politics for jeb said fergus cullen a former new hampshire republican party chairman there s 25 percent of the republicans who are entertained by donald trump but there s 60 percent of the party who say they won t vote for him under any circumstances those aren t jeb bush s people to begin with he s trying to appeal to the other 60 percent by being the adult in the room and trying to govern o connell agreed he pointed out that even if this new approach is one that s uncomfortable for bush it s necessary in a lot of elections being the studious one would have worked he said but trump has flipped the script npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
