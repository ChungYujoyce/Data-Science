 by lori robertson robert farley d angelo gore jessica mcdonald and eugene kiely posted on june 19 2019 at a rally in orlando on june 18 president donald trump officially launched his reelection campaign trump boasted that under his leadership the country is thriving prospering and booming and he asked voters for four more years to keep america great nobody s done what we have done in two and a half years he said however we found hisspeech was filled with many familiar false misleading and exaggerated statements about his record on jobs military spending veterans energy trade and more during his speech trump twice took credit for the state of america s energy production citing milestones that were achieved years ago or long expected we are by the way the number one producer of energy in the world because of what we ve done right now the president said early on in his remarks about a half hour later trump returned to the theme stating we ve ended the last administration s cruel and heartless war on american energy what they were doing to our energy should never be forgotten the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world as we veexplainedbefore citing data from the energy information administration the united states is the top producer of natural gas but that s a title the nation has heldsince 2009 the u s also produces the most petroleum and has done so since 2013 more recently this past summer the u s didtake overas the leading producer of crude oil production of crude oil however had been ramping up formany years and the milestone wasexpected according to the most recent eia data the united states is not the largest overall producer of energy that award goes to china which in 2016 produced 107 quadrillion btus oftotal primary energy a term that includes fossil fuels as well as nuclear and renewable sources in 2016 the u s was second worldwide with 84 quadrillion btus since then the u s hasincreasedits energy production to 95 quadrillion btus in 2018 the agency doesn t have more recent data for china but u s production is still below china s 2016 level trumprepeatedhis misleading claim that spending on defense is at a record high trump after past leaders slashed military budgets we are rebuilding the u s armed forces with 700 billion last year and 716 billion this year far more than ever before trump got the dollar amounts right thebipartisan budget act of 2018 a two year budget agreement that trump signed into law on feb 9 2018 set the budget authority for national defense at 700 billion in fiscal year 2018 and 716 billion in fiscal 2019 neither figure is far more than ever before in inflation adjusted dollars whenwe reviewed this claimlast year jacob cohn a research fellow at the nonpartisan center for strategic and budgetary assessments calculated the real or inflation adjusted value of national defense outlays actual spending in a fiscal year dating to 1940 which covers world war ii spending cohn adjusted past national defense spending table 3 1 based on the office of management and budget s deflators table 10 1 from the president s fiscal year 2019 budget cohn found that the most amount ever spent was in 1945 when the u s spent the equivalent of 950 1 billion in 2019 dollars more was also spent in 1943 and 1944 and in 2008 through 2012 which included the iraq and afghanistan wars we also should note that the u s spent far more on defense as a percentage of the gross domestic product during world war ii thedepartment sfiscal 2019 budget request included a graph that shows defense spending as a percentage of gdp peaked in 1944 at 35 5 percent far more than the 3 1 percent projected at the time for fiscal year 2019 wwii spending is an anomaly but spending as a percentage of gdp has routinely been higher in the past than it is now trump again made a mostly meaningless claim about the number of u s workers which he exaggerated in the process trump and today right now as we speak almost 160 million people are working that s more than ever before it s the first time ever the number of people is almost 160 million and we re going to be breaking that number soon total nonfarm employment was 151 1 million as of may according tothe most recent bureau of labor statistics projections that s the most all time but still well short of 160 million but trump s claim still doesn t mean much considering that the u s also has alarger populationthan ever before u s employment isn t at an all time high according to other also imperfect measures that factor in population for those age 16 and over thecivilian labor force participation ratewas 62 8 percent in may and theemployment population ratiowas 60 6 percent neither is the highest ever bls data also show thenational unemployment rate 3 6 percent in may nearly a 50 year low wasn t the lowest in history the president made a misleading comparison about manufacturing job growth before and after he took office trump in the eight years before i took office on average we lost 2 000 manufacturing jobs a month since my inauguration we ve added 16 000 manufacturing jobs a month that didn t happen by accident as of may manufacturing employmenthad increased by an average of 17 000 jobs per month since trump was inaugurated trump is also correct that the manufacturing sector suffered an average loss of 2 000 jobs per month under obama however trump is including 13 months at the beginning of obama s presidency that were during or immediately following thegreat recessionthat officially ended in june 2009 manufacturing employment actually increased by an average of 11 000 jobs per month if tallied from when manufacturing job losses bottomed out in february 2010 until january 2017 when obama left office this graph shows the manufacturing sector almost steadily gaining jobs in that time and since although as of may there were still 907 000 fewer people employed in manufacturing compared with december 2007 when the economic recession began trump said that he is well on his way to keeping his signature campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border but most of the construction so far has been replacement of existing fencing none of it is the type of solid wall that he once talked about during the campaign nor is it anything like the prototypes trump commissioned early in his presidency trump and we are building the wall we re going to have over 400 miles of wall built by the end of next year it s moving rapidly moving very rapidly it s beautiful i changed the design it s stronger bigger better and cheaper cheaper a lot cheaper you know sometimes when they don t give you the money you have to make it cheaper not going to happen but it s going well in awhite house meetingon june 12 when trump asked how the wall is coming along acting secretary of homeland security kevin mcaleenan said that by the end of next year dhs will have completed construction of over 400 miles in partnership with dod but a couple caveats are in order first most of those 400 miles are replacement of existing wall in may u s customs and border protectionreportedthat since january 2017 when trump took office approximately 205 miles of new and updated border barriers have been funded through the traditional appropriations process and via treasury forfeiture funding of which approximately 42 miles have been completed to date cbp hasidentified 6 1 billion over the last three fiscal years to fund 336 miles of new and replacement barriers according to the agency s fact sheet of those 336 miles 86 miles are new primary wall and another 24 miles are new levee wall but the majority 226 miles are updated barriers either primary secondary or vehicle barriers before trump took office there was already about 650 miles of fencing of various types along the border the type of steel bollard fencing now being erected is also a far different construction design thantrump once pursued during the campaign trump talked about a solid wall of precast planks and early in his presidency trump commissioned and later toured prototypes of solid wall designs however congress passed spending bills that specifically funded only fencing designs deployed as of may 2017 such as steel bollards and thereby precluding any of thewall prototypesthat trump commissioned trump packed two pieces of misinformation into one claim when he said we have never taken in 10 cents in tariffs from china we would lose 500 billion a year with china the president as he frequently does exaggerates the trade deficit he inherited with china a deficit that has increased under his leadership and he ignores the billions the u s has been collecting in tariffs for years trump and remember this and you know it as well as i do we have never taken in 10 cents from china we would lose 500 billion a year with china we rebuilt china they ve done a great job but they took us for suckers and that includes obama and biden we took they took us for suckers five hundred billion five hundred billion somebody said you mean five hundred million that s a lot too right no 500 billion actually more than that i don t want to be too specific 507 the trade deficit with china has never been 500 billion trumphas beenexaggeratingitfor years the trade deficit in goods and services with china was 308 9 billion in 2016 obama s final year in office according to the bureau of economic analysis the highest yearly deficit under obama hit 333 5 billion in 2015 but the trade deficit with china has climbed higher under trump reaching 380 8 billion in 2018 the highest annual figure dating back to 1999 according to bea thetotal trade deficitin goods and services withallcountries under obama was 503 billion in 2016 that too has gone up under trump reaching 627 7 billion in 2018 as wealso have written it s not true that the u s has never taken in 10 cents in tariffs from china setting aside that tariffs on chinese goods fall on u s importers and ultimately largely result in u s consumers paying higher prices prior to trump becoming president the u s collected 122 6 billion in customs duties from 2007 to 2016 or 12 3 billion a year on average according to theu s international trade commission dataweb last year the u s collected nearly 23 billion an increase that reflects the higher tariffs imposed on china by the trump administration trump falsely said that he and congressional republicans enacted the largest package of tax cuts and reforms in american history earlier in his speech he called it the biggest tax cut in history days before trumpsignedthe tax cuts and jobs act into law in december 2017 the nonpartisan joint committee on taxationestimatedthat it would reduce tax revenues by 1 46 trillion over 10 years the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budgetsaidthat an even more expensive plan trump proposed before that one would have been only the eighth largest tax cut as a percentage of gross domestic product and it would have been the fourth largest cut in inflation adjusted dollars the tax bill that trump signed needed to cost roughly 6 8 trillion over 10 years to beat the 1981 tax cut under president reagan which was 2 9 percent of gdp according tocrfb trump inherited a large number of federal judge vacancies which he oftenwrongly describesas an inept gift from obama he did so again in his campaign kickoff speech saying obama was very nice to us and didn t fill the positions in fact the high number of vacancies left for trump was due to a republican controlled senate blocking obama s late term picks trump i will soon have appointed my 145th judge president obama was very nice to us he didn t fill the positions i get there the first day how many judges do i have to appoint they said sir 139 now it s 145 and we ve just finished number 107 already approved sitting on the bench how about that when trump took office in january 2017 there were112 federal judicial vacancies by the end of the year that number had grown to144 it was at131as of june 19 but the high number of vacancies left for trump was not the result of complacency by obama but rather opposition to obama s judicial nominations from senate republicans whotook over a majorityduring the last two years of obama s presidency experts told us senate republicans confirmed far fewer judicial nominees in obama s last two years than had been confirmed in the last two years of previous presidents as a result in early january 2017 just before trump took office there were59 federal court nomineespending that s why trump inherited so many vacancies in referring to the special counsel investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election trump claimed they appointed 18 very angry democrats to try to take down our incredible movement as we ve written before among the 17 investigators 13 had previously registered as democrats according to thewashington post special counsel robert mueller meanwhile wasdescribed as aregistered republicanby thepostwhen then president george w bush appointed him fbi director in 2001 trump also used an unconfirmed figure for the cost of the investigation putting it at 40 million probably a hell of a lot more than that so far we know the investigation cost 25 2 million as of sept 30 according to the special counsel s expenditure statements that figure includes 12 9 million for department of justice components that support the special counsel s office and were expenditures the components would have incurred for the investigations irrespective of the existence of the sco the investigation continued for nearly another six months ending in late march if the expenses then were similar to the expenses reported for the previous six months total spending would be about 34 million but we don t yet have a publicly released final amount it s worth noting that the investigation also resulted informer trump campaign chairmanpaul manafort agreeing to forfeit assets including real estate properties and bank accounts worth an estimated 42 million to 46 million trump also went too far in claiming that his predecessor did nothing about russian interference in the 2016 election trump and in september just before the election the fbi told president obama about possible russian interference and he did nothing because he thought that hillary clinton crooked hillary was going to win that s why he did nothing he did nothing as we ve written before some democrats have said obama should have done more but it s not the case that he did nothing obama spoke to russian president vladimir putin about the issue in september 2016 and his administration worked with state officials from mid august that year until election day to prevent voting systems from being hacked also on oct 7 2016 the department of homeland security and office of the director of national intelligence issued apublic statementthat said the u s intelligence community is confident that russia s senior most officials were behind the computer hacking of the democratic party email systems the president repeated his false boast that we passed va choice after politicians have been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years obama signed thebipartisanveterans access choice and accountability act which created theveterans choice program on aug 7 2014 the program enabled veterans facing long waits or travel distances to va facilities to receive care from non va providers trump has continued the program and in june 2018 he signed the bipartisanva mission act which provided funding to keep the veterans choice program for one more year and then consolidate it and other programs into a new veterans community care program trump falsely claimed that the va couldn t do anything about employees who mistreated veterans prior to him signing accountability legislation trump and we also passed va accountability so that when somebody does bad things or mistreats our wonderful veterans we couldn t do anything with them they were protected between civil service unions and all of the problems it didn t matter you couldn t do anything now you can just say you re fired get out get out get out trumpsignedthe veterans affairs accountability and whistleblower protection act in june 2017 and it does aim tomake it easierto remove employees based on performance or misconduct but it was already possible for the va to fire employees for cause prior to that law the vafired morethan 2 000 employees each year going back to 2006 for discipline and performance reasons before trump took office according to data the department reported to the office of personnel management the president touched on one of his favorite subjects the cleanliness of the nation s air and water trump and something i want to make clear to the media we have among the cleanest and sharpest crystal clean you ve heard me say it i want crystal clean air and water anywhere on earth we are creating a future of american energy independence and yet our air and water are the cleanest they ve ever been by far we ve written about these sorts ofclaimsrepeatedly most recentlywhen piers morgan interviewed trump during the president s visit to the u k over the decades the u s has generally made progress on reducing pollution but there is little evidence to suggest that america s water and air have substantially improved since trump took office on air quality for example the existing environmental protection agency data is mixed at best theaverage national air pollutant concentrations for sulfur dioxide and ozone gota bit betterbetween 2016 and 2017 but particulate matter got worse the number ofdays with unhealthy levels of air pollutants for sensitive groups also increased from701 days in 2016 to 729 days in 2017 and was well above 2014 s low of 599 days with so few data points and lacking 2018 data which is not yet available it s difficult to make much of these trends but they do not indicate that the air is the cleanest it s ever been by far in terms of rankings the most recentenvironmental performance indexput the u s in 10th for air quality and 29th for water and sanitation although for drinking water america tied for first with nine other nations on wastewater treatment which the epi websiteexplainscan have impacts on human health and the ecosystem the u s came in at number 39 behind most of the western world trump repeated a well worn claim from the 2016 campaign claiming that his democratic opponent hillary clinton decide d that they re not going to give 33 000 emails after receiving a subpoena and deleted and acid washed them which is very expensive trump is referring to31 830 emailsthat clinton s lawyers had deemed personal and per state department policy did not have to be turned over to the government the emails were deleted in 2015 by an employee of the server management company after clinton received a subpoena related to a republican investigation into the 2012 deaths of four americans in benghazi there s no evidence that clinton knew that the emails were deleted after the subpoena was issued trump if you want to know how the system is rigged just compare how they came after us for three years with everything they have versus the free pass they gave to hillary and her aides after they set up an illegal server destroyed evidence deleted and acid washed 33 000 e mails exposed classified information and turned the state department into a pay for play cash machine t he simplest thing they get a subpoena from the united states congress and they decide that they re not going to give it so lindsey graham they delete and they acid wash which is very expensive nobody does it they acid wash those emails never to be seen again but we may find them somewhere deep in the state department as we ve written before in december 2014 clinton gave the state department 30 490 work related emails according to fbi notes of its investigation a clinton attorney in 2014 told platte river networks the company managing clinton s private server that clinton had preserved her work related emails and decided she no longer needed access to any of her e mails older than 60 days but a prn employee didn t delete the other 31 830 emails from the server until march 2015 after the republican led committee subpoena thefbi said that prn used bleachbit a free software program to delete the emails not a very expensive process as trump claims the president said we may find the deleted emails somewhere deep in the state department in fact the fbi recovered about 14 900 emails that weren t part of the work related emails clinton turned over on sept 7 2016 government officials said 30 of those emails were related to benghazi but only one had been previously undisclosed then fbi director james comey said the fbi found no evidence that any of the additional work related emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them in some way trump touted some unsubstantiated statistics when discussing his administration s progress on addressing the opioid epidemic trump june 18 we are boldly confronting the opioid and drug addiction and you know what s happening drug addiction is the scourge of our country and many other countries and we have made so much progress so much progress opioid down 17 18 19 and 21 percent in some places it s not clear which specific statistic trump is highlighting opioid could refer to the number of opioid prescriptions abuse rates or opioid related deaths among a variety of measures nevertheless similar figures were presented to trump at anopioid meetingon june 12 so we suspect trump is thinking of overdose deaths those numbers however were for all drug overdose deaths not just those involving opioids in that meeting assistant secretary for healthbrett giroirpresented the latest centers for disease control and prevention figures for overdose deaths from any drug which compared the past year s predicted tally of drug overdose deaths as of november 2018 to the same figure in november 2017 giroir june 12 nationwide overdose deaths have now fallen 4 4 percent over the past year and let s look at some specific states in new hampshire where you first announced your initiative drug overdose deaths are down 4 8 percent florida 8 1 percent west virginia 10 3 percent iowa 18 2 percent pennsylvania 18 5 percent and ohio down 23 3 percent giroir s numbers match those that appear on the cdc s website which includes a color coded interactivemapwith the declines or increases marked for each state but there is no equivalent map nor a complete set of state data for opioid related overdose deaths only 16 states and two other jurisdictions provide opioid specific information of these nearly all show a decline in opioid related deaths but only two are as large as the president suggests oklahoma saw a 24 percent drop while washington d c saw a 17 5 percent decrease the next closest is the state of new york which had an 11 2 percent decline nationally when calculated the same way as the 4 4 percent decline in total overdose deaths the drop inopioid related deaths is 2 1 percent it s possible more locales have experienced significant drops in opioid related overdose deaths and that those figures might more closely match what trump emphasized in his speech but we are unaware of such data we reached out to the white house to find the source for trump s numbers and did not receive a reply trump said that the democrats who are co sponsorsof medicare for all legislation in congress want to end medicare as we know it and terminate the private health insurance of 180 million americans who love their health insurance the bills call for expanding medicare into a national health insurance program that covers everyone so the plan would end medicare as we know it but by expanding benefits addingdental hearing and vision coverage and instituting no premiums or copays except for prescription drugs and expanding coverage private insurance which does cover nearly 180 million people now would be eliminated under the plan introduced by sen bernie sanders with the exception of possibly limited private insurance to cover the few benefits that the new universal system wouldn t and those policyholders would instead have health coverage under a new national medicare program trump vowed and we will always protect patients with preexisting conditions always always but he and republicans in congress has not supported protections that go as far as those in the affordable care act under theaca insurerscan t deny coverageor charge more based on health status republican health care bills debated in 2017 offered some preexisting condition provisions but not such a blanket protection for instance as we ve written before the house republican bill said states could get a waiver to allow insurers to charge higher premiums based on health status for one year for those who had a lapse in their insurance coverage the trump administration also has sided with the plaintiffs in a texas lawsuit seeking to find the aca unconstitutional last summer then attorney general jeff sessions said that if the lawsuit were successful the provisions in the law prohibiting insurers from denying coverage or charging premiums based on health status would have to be eliminated the administration now fully agrees with the plaintiffs that the entire law should be struck down q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
