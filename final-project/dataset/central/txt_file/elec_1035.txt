tell us more than the horserace numbers loading october 19 2015 another day another breathless report that vice president joe biden is about to announce whether he s running for president the latest from nbc news has two sources saying that mr biden will let us know by wednesday morning but we ve heard this before 11 times in fact and still no decision so don t hold your breath sooner or later though biden will end the suspense some signs point to a run cnn reports that biden associates are setting up interviews for potential staff positions on a presidential campaign biden is also reportedly meeting with top political advisers monday night the latest poll on the democratic primary race by cnn orc shows biden at 18 percent well below hillary clinton 45 percent and bernie sanders 29 percent one can look biden s share two ways either he s doing well for someone who hasn t announced or obviously campaigned or he s doing not so well third place for the sitting vice president i m not sure if a hypothetical number like that really tells you much says karlyn bowman an expert on polling at the american enterprise institute in washington as a noncandidate biden hasn t made the case for himself as the next president but he also hasn t gone through the gauntlet of a campaign the attacks the dredging up of the past the close media scrutiny when someone becomes a real life candidate things really change ms bowman said will we hear stories about his ability to connect with white males something that hillary has struggled with will there be a sympathy factor over the death of his son other poll metrics may give biden more clues to his viability as a potential candidate such as his favorability scores biden is the best liked of the democratic candidates with 51 percent of americans seeing him positively versus 37 percent negative clinton scores 46 percent positive 50 percent negative sanders is 41 29 in head to head matchups against republican front runners biden does the best of any democratic candidate he beats donald trump by 10 percentage points while clinton beats him by only 5 points and sanders by 9 against ben carson biden also does best the vice president beats the retired neurosurgeon by 8 points while clinton and sanders are in a virtual tie with the doctor clinton scores 47 percent to dr carson s 48 sanders gets 46 percent to carson s 48 but again these matchups are hypothetical there s nothing like being a declared candidate that really tests a man or a woman seeking the highest office you re never more popular than the day before you announce and the day afteryou get out of the race the saying goes biden wins kudos now for his authenticity that quality of genuineness of joe being joe that makes him appealing to many democrats but the moment he announces if he does the media will be on gaffe watch looking for anything he says or does that is out of step with obama administration policy or polite discourse it may in fact already be too late as biden himself declared in august 2003 after deciding not to run in the 2004 race you just can t parachute into a presidential campaign but even with that in mind biden confidant ted kaufman is telling former staffers to stay in close contact according to an e mail obtained by the associated press if he runs he will run because of his burning conviction that we need to fundamentally change the balance in our economy and the political structure to restore the ability of the middle class to get ahead said mr kaufman get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox another sign that there may be room for biden to get in comes from an analysis of clinton s donors fewer than 10 percent of the 833 people who raised money for the 2012 obama biden campaign have signed on to bundle donations for clinton according to usa today ultimately biden s decision could come down to his gut as he has said many times he s not sure he has the emotional energy to run
