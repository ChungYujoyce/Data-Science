 liz halloran a voter casts her ballot in stow ohio during the march 6 primary david maxwell epa landov hide caption a voter casts her ballot in stow ohio during the march 6 primary what do women want electorally speaking we know that women like men are not some monolithic bloc to quote the current occupant of the white house but as a group they are reliably influential voters more risk averse than men and pollsters tell us generally more likely than the opposite sex to vote for democrats oppose the use of military force and support government programs in 2008 unmarried women one of the nation s fastest growing demographic groups were a key to barack obama s presidential win they broke for the democratic senator from illinois over republican sen john mccain 70 percent to 29 percent married women preferred mccain 50 percent to 47 percent four years earlier unmarried women those who are single separated divorced or widowed preferred democratic presidential candidate sen john kerry 62 37 percent the margin was similarly tilted in favor of democrat al gore in the 2000 white house contest but and this is key married women supported republican george w bush in both those earlier elections by measurably wider margins than they went for mccain in 2004 for example they preferred bush over kerry by 11 percentage points so it s no surprise that female voters have been a focus of both parties going into a presidential contest that promises to be exceedingly close democrats have been fueling their republican war on women narrative republicans are counterprogramming with a focus on how women have been walloped as the economy continues to falter instead of just asking what women want the more salient question may be a two parter we put those questions to pollsters who have been tracking voter preferences in this presidential year here s what we ve come away with at this point in the race republicans will most likely continue to have marginal opportunity for inroads with unmarried women even given the faltering economy unmarried women present republicans their most vexing combination voters who are predominantly young or youngish and women both groups are very difficult for republicans says iowa based pollster j ann selzer who conducts surveys for bloomberg news mitt romney speaks to a group that included female business owners in chantilly va on may 2 jae c hong ap hide caption mitt romney speaks to a group that included female business owners in chantilly va on may 2 in some ways the task is even more difficult than trying to peel away african american votes from the democratic party they have more opportunity with hispanics than with women selzer says noting however that romney may have room to increase his margin with affluent white women says abc pollster gary langer of langer research associates a republican candidate is a hard sell among unmarried women because they are so rooted in the democratic party romney has the opportunity to gain ground with married women langer argues that incumbents like obama typically get the benefit of the doubt when people make election day choices if voters decide they re satisfied with the incumbent you move on you re done the challenger gets a look only after that initial calculation but i think obama loses some of the natural advantages of incumbency because of the economy langer says and among women those who are married are more movable and present more opportunity for the republican party he says abc s late may survey that showed a romney rebound among women though he still trailed obama in favorability 52 41 percent largely reflected republican women coalescing around the candidate at the end of the party s primary season battles but langer says those moving to romney also included a not insignificant number of non republican women independents and even some democratic women expressing a more favorable view a selzer survey for bloomberg released in march showed that women view the democratic party only a bit more favorably than they do the gop the female vote gap may benefit obama in states where contraception and abortion issues were local a new quinnipiac university polling institute survey taken in pennsylvania cited obama s strong support among women and independents as fuel for his 46 40 percent lead over romney in the keystone state president obama speaks at a white house forum on women s issues on april 6 carolyn kaster ap hide caption president obama speaks at a white house forum on women s issues on april 6 tim malloy the institute s assistant director says that comments made in march by the state s gop gov tom corbett defending a bill that would have required women to have an ultrasound before an abortion contributed to the president s hold on a steady lead corbett said that an ultrasound is not that big an issue because women just have to close your eyes during the procedure i m not saying there s a war on women but this perpetuated the perceptions that democrats have pushed malloy says the war on women narrative is a long term strategy selzer says and democrats are working to provide the evidence that it s true that included pushing the paycheck fairness act in congress last week polling in pennsylvania however also shows that romney is outperforming obama on the question of who is better on the economy while the president s personal popularity continues to exceed romney s the economy will be the key for men and women and it s up to the candidates to make their case the economy overwhelmingly is the issue of the election langer says noting that more than half of people he surveyed named it as the most important issue with all other issues measuring in the single digits in the later spring he notes we ve had a period of increasing economic discontent with a slowdown of earlier year improvements in the job market and that s weighing fairly heavily on women the president he says is vulnerable on the economy mitt romney will get a look but he has not seized the opportunity and proven that he can do better langer says the question is can he make the case that he can what women married and unmarried want isn t very different from what men want what all americans want he says a return to economic opportunity and an ability to get and hold a job there is opportunity for both obama and romney with a narrow but important cadre of female voters largely married largely moderate to help swing november s vote in their favor npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
