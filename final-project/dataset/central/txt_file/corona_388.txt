 the covid 19 pandemic has resulted in misinformation and conspiracy theories about the scale of the pandemic and the origin prevention diagnosis and treatment of the disease 1 2 3 false information including intentional disinformation has been spread through social media 2 4 text messaging 5 and mass media 6 including the tabloid media 7 conservative media 8 9 and state media of countries such as china 10 11 russia 12 13 iran 14 and turkmenistan 2 15 it has also been spread by state backed covert operations to generate panic and sow distrust in other countries 16 17 18 in some countries such as india 19 bangladesh 20 and ethiopia 21 journalists have been arrested for allegedly spreading fake news about the pandemic 22 misinformation has been propagated by celebrities politicians 23 24 including heads of state in countries such as the united states 25 26 iran 27 and brazil 28 and other prominent public figures 29 commercial scams have claimed to offer at home tests supposed preventives and miracle cures 30 31 several religious groups have claimed their faith will protect them from the virus 32 33 34 some people have claimed the virus is a bio weapon accidentally or purposefully leaked from a laboratory 35 36 a population control scheme the result of a spy operation 3 4 37 or the side effect of improvements called 5g to cell telephone networks 38 the world health organization has declared an infodemic of incorrect information about the virus which poses risks to global health 2 on 30 january 2020 the bbc reported on the growing number of conspiracy theories and bad health advice regarding covid 19 notable examples at the time included false health advice shared on social media and private chats as well as conspiracy theories such as the disease s origins in chinese bat soup and the outbreak being planned with the participation of the pirbright institute 1 39 on 31 january the guardian listed seven instances of misinformation adding the conspiracy theories about bioweapons and the link to 5g technology and including varied false health advice 40 in an attempt to speed up research sharing many researchers have turned to preprint servers such as arxiv biorxiv medrxiv and ssrn papers are uploaded to these servers without peer review or any other editorial process that ensures research quality some of these papers have contributed to the spread of conspiracy theories the most notable case was a preprint paper uploaded to biorxiv which claimed that the virus contained hiv insertions following objections the paper was withdrawn 41 42 43 according to a study published by the reuters institute for the study of journalism most misinformation related to covid 19 involves various forms of reconfiguration where existing and often true information is spun twisted recontextualised or reworked less misinformation was completely fabricated the study also found that top down misinformation from politicians celebrities and other prominent public figures while accounting for a minority of the samples captured a majority of the social media engagement according to their classification the largest category of misinformation 39 was misleading or false claims about the actions or policies of public authorities including government and international bodies like the who or the un 44 a natural experiment an experiment that took place spontaneously without human design or intervention shows the link between coronavirus misinformation and increased infection and death of two similar television news shows on the same network one took coronavirus seriously about a month earlier than the other people and groups exposed to the slow response news show had higher infection and death rates 45 the misinformation has been used by politicians interest groups and state actors in many countries for political purposes to avoid responsibility scapegoat other countries and avoid criticism of their prior decisions sometimes there is a financial motive as well 46 47 48 on 2 february 2020 the world health organization who described a massive infodemic citing an over abundance of reported information accurate and false about the virus that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it the who stated that the high demand for timely and trustworthy information has incentivised the creation of a direct who 24 7 myth busting hotline where its communication and social media teams have been monitoring and responding to misinformation through its website and social media pages 49 50 51 the who specifically debunked several claims as false including the claim that a person can tell if they have the virus or not simply by holding their breath the claim that drinking large amounts of water will protect against the virus and the claim that gargling salt water prevents infection 52 in early february 2020 facebook twitter and google announced that they were working with who to address misinformation 53 in a blog post facebook stated that it would remove content flagged by global health organizations and local authorities that violate its content policy on misinformation leading to physical harm 54 facebook is also giving free advertising to who 55 nonetheless a week after trump s speculation that sunlight could kill the virus the new york times found 780 facebook groups 290 facebook pages nine instagram accounts and thousands of tweets pushing uv light therapies content which those companies declined to remove from their platforms 56 at the end of february 2020 amazon removed more than a million products that claimed to cure or protect against coronavirus and removed tens of thousands of listings for health products whose prices were significantly higher than recent prices offered on or off amazon although numerous items were still being sold at unusually high prices as of 28 february 57 millions of instances of covid 19 misinformation have occurred across a number of online platforms 58 other fake news researchers noted certain rumors started in china many of them later spread to korea and the united states prompting several universities in korea to start the multilingual facts before rumors campaign to evaluate common claims seen online 59 60 61 62 the media has praised wikipedia s coverage of covid 19 and its combating the inclusion of misinformation through efforts led by the wiki project med foundation and the english language wikipedia s wikiproject medicine among other groups 63 64 65 many newspapers with paywalls lowered them for some or all their coronavirus coverage 66 67 many scientific publishers made scientific papers related to the outbreak open access free 68 a number of governments have made transmitting misinformation about the virus illegal in no case has action been taken against conspiracy theorists or purveyors of fake news the legislation has been instead a tool to suppress as misinformation facts that a government finds embarrassing or inconvenient this may be the extent of the virus within a country or the inadequacy of preparations for and measures taken against the virus the turkish interior ministry has been arresting social media users whose posts were targeting officials and spreading panic and fear by suggesting the virus had spread widely in turkey and that officials had taken insufficient measures 69 iran s military said 3600 people have been arrested for spreading rumors about coronavirus in the country 70 in cambodia some individuals who expressed concerns about the spread of covid 19 have been arrested on fake news charges 71 72 algerian lawmakers passed a law criminalising fake news deemed harmful to public order and state security 73 in the philippines 74 china 75 india 76 77 egypt 78 ethiopia 79 bangladesh 80 morocco 81 pakistan 82 saudi arabia 83 oman 84 iran 85 vietnam laos 86 indonesia 77 mongolia 77 sri lanka 77 kenya south africa

allegedly spreading false information about the coronavirus pandemic 100 77 the united arab emirates has introduced criminal penalties for the spread of misinformation and rumours related to the outbreak 101 myanmar blocked access to 221 news websites 102 including several leading media outlets 103 conspiracy theories have appeared both in social media and in mainstream news outlets and are heavily influenced by geopolitics 104 a number of allegations have emerged supposing a link between the virus and wuhan institute of virology wiv among these is that the virus was an accidental leakage from wiv 106 in january 2020 editors at the scientific journal nature affixed a cautionary warning to an article written by richard h ebright about the wiv in 2017 the editors warned that unverified theories unsupported by scientists were being promoted to suggest that the wiv was the source of covid 19 107 in an interview with bbc china ebright refuted several conspiracy theories regarding the wiv e g bioweapons research or that the virus was engineered but said a laboratory leak origin could not be completely ruled out 108 disinformation researcher nina jankowicz from the wilson center indicates the lab leakage claim entered mainstream media in united states during april propagated by news outlets 48 on may 8 2020 the lab leak theory was reported by nbs news citing a private analysis of cellphone location data that purports to show that wiv shut down from october 7 through october 24 2019 which in turn was being used to support the claim that there may have been a hazardous event sometime between october 6 and october 11 109 nbc s reporters noted however that the private analysis offers no direct evidence of a shutdown or any proof for the theory that the virus emerged accidentally from the lab 109 on 14 february 2020 chinese scientists explored the possibility of accidental leakage and published speculations on scientific social networking website researchgate the paper was neither peer reviewed nor presented any evidence for its claims 110 on 5 march the author of paper told wall street journal in an interview why he decided to withdraw the paper by the end of february stating the speculation about the possible origins in the post was based on published papers and media and was not supported by direct proofs 111 112 several newspapers have referenced the paper 110 scientific american reported that shi zhengli the lead researcher at wiv started investigation on mishandling of experimental materials in the lab records especially during disposal she also tried to cross check the novel coronavirus genome with the genetic information of other bat coronaviruses her team had collected the result showed none of the sequences matched those of the viruses her team had sampled from bat caves 113 in february it was alleged that the first person infected may have been a researcher at the institute named huang yanling 114 rumours circulated on chinese social media that the researcher had become infected and died prompting a denial from wiv saying she was a graduate student enrolled in the institute until 2015 and is not the patient zero 115 114 in april the conspiracy theory started to circulate around on youtube and got picked up by conservative media national review 116 6 the south china morning post scmp reported that one of the wiv s lead researchers shi zhengli was the particular focus of personal attacks in chinese social media alleging that her work on bat based viruses was the source of the virus this led shi to post i swear with my life the virus has nothing to do with the lab when asked by the scmp to comment on the attacks shi responded my time must be spent on more important matters 117 caixin reported shi made further public statements against perceived tin foil hat theories about the new virus s source quoting her as saying the novel 2019 coronavirus is nature punishing the human race for keeping uncivilized living habits i shi zhengli swear on my life that it has nothing to do with our laboratory 118 immunologist vincent racaniello stated that virus leaking theories reflect a lack of understanding of the genetic make up of sars cov 2 and its relationship to the bat virus he says the bat virus researched in the institution would not have been able to infect humans the human sars cov 2 has additional changes that allows it to infect humans 105 on 14 april the us chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark milley in response to questions about the virus being manufactured in a lab said it s inconclusive although the weight of evidence seems to indicate natural but we don t know for certain 119 on that same day washington post columnist josh rogin detailed a leaked cable of a 2018 trip made to the wiv by scientists from the us embassy the article was referenced and cited by conservative media to push the lab leakage theory 48 rogin s article went on to say that what the u s officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as sensitive but unclassified back to washington the cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the wiv lab and proposed more attention and help the first cable which i obtained also warns that the lab s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new sars like pandemic 120 rogin s article pointed out there was no evidence that the coronavirus was engineered but that is not the same as saying it didn t come from the lab which spent years testing bat coronaviruses in animals 120 the article went on to quote xiao qiang a research scientist at the school of information at the university of california berkeley i don t think it s a conspiracy theory i think it s a legitimate question that needs to be investigated and answered to understand exactly how this originated is critical knowledge for preventing this from happening in the future 120 the washington post s article and subsequent broadcasts drew criticism from virologist angela rasmussen of columbia university who stated it s irresponsible for political reporters like rogin to uncritically regurgitate a secret cable without asking a single virologist or ecologist or making any attempt to understand the scientific context 48 rasmussen later compared biosafety procedure concerns to having the health inspector come to your restaurant it could just be oh you need to keep your chemical showers better stocked it doesn t suggest however that there are tremendous problems 121 jonna mazet professor of epidemiology at the university of california davis and director of the predict project to monitor emerging viruses has commented that staff at the wuhan institute of virology were trained at us labs and follow high safety standards and that all of the evidence points to this not being a laboratory accident 108 days later multiple media outlets confirmed that us intelligence officials were investigating the possibility that the virus started in the wiv 122 123 124 125 on 23 april vox presented disputed arguments on lab leakage claims from several scientists 126 scientists suggested that virus samples cultured in the lab have significant amount of difference compared with sars cov 2 the virus institution which sampled ratg13 in yunnan the closest known relative of the nes coronavirus with a 96 shared genome edward holmes sars cov 2 researcher at the university of sydney explained that 4 of difference is equivalent to an average of 50 years and at least 20 years of evolutionary change 126 127 virologist peter daszak president of the ecohealth alliance which studies emerging infectious diseases noted the estimate that 1 7million people in southeast asia who live or work in proximity to bats are infected each year with bat coronaviruses in the interview with vox he comments there are probably half a dozen people that do work in those labs so let s compare 1million to 7million people a year to half a dozen people it s just not logical 108 126 on 30 april the new york times reported that the trump administration demanded that intelligence agencies find evidence linking wiv with the origin of sars cov 2 secretary of state and former central intelligence agency c i a director mike pompeo was reportedly leading the push on finding information regarding the virus origin analysts were concerned that pressure from senior officials could distort assessments from the intelligence community anthony ruggiero the head of the national security council which responsible for tracking weapons of mass destruction expressed frustration during a video conference that the c i a was unable to reach a definite explanation of the virus s origin according to current and former government officials as of 30 april 2020 the c i a has yet to find any information other than circumstantial to bolster the lab theory 128 129 united states intelligence officers suggested that chinese officials tried to conceal the severity of the outbreak in early days but no evidence had shown china attempted to cover up a lab accident 130 one day later trump claimed he has evidence of the lab theory but offered no further details on it 131 132 jamie metzl a senior fellow at the atlantic council claimed the sars cov 2 virus likely came from a wuhan virology testing laboratory based on circumstantial evidence he was quoted as saying i have no definitive way of proving this thesis 133 on 30 april 2020 the us intelligence and scientific communities issued a public statement dismissing the idea that the virus was not natural while the investigation of the lab accident hypothesis was ongoing 134 135 the white house suggested an alternative explanation along with a seemingly contradictory message that the virus was man made in an interview with abc news secretary of state pompeo said he has no reason to disbelieve the intelligence community that the virus was natural however this contradicted the comment he made earlier in the same interview in which he said the best experts so far seem to think it was man made i have no reason to disbelieve that at this point 136 137 138 on 4 may australian tabloid the daily telegraph claimed that a reportedly leaked dossier from five eyes an intelligence alliance alleged the probable outbreak was from the wuhan lab 139 fox news and national security commentators in the us quickly followed up the telegraph story 140 141 raising tensions within the international intelligence community 142 the australian government which is part of the five eyes alliance determined the leaked dossier was not a five eyes document but a compilation of open source materials that contained no information generated by intelligence gathering 143 the german intelligence community denied the claim of the leaked dossier instead supporting the probability of a natural cause 144 145 the australian government sees the promotion of the lab theory from the united states counterproductive to australia s push for a more broad international supported independent inquiry into the virus origins 142 senior officials in the australian government speculated the dossier was leaked by the united states embassy in canberra to promote a narrative in australian media that diverged from the mainstream belief of australia 142 143 140 beijing rejected the white house s claim calling the claim part of an election year strategy by president donald trump s republican party 146 hua chunying chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman urged mike pompeo to present evidence for his claim mr pompeo cannot present any evidence because he does not have any hua told a journalist during a regular briefing this matter should be handled by scientists and professionals instead of politicians out of their domestic political needs 146 147 the chinese ambassador in an opinion published in the washington post called on the white house to end the blame game over the coronavirus 148 149 as of 5 may assessments and internal sources from the five eyes nations indicated that the coronavirus outbreak being the result of a laboratory accident was highly unlikely since the human infection was highly likely a result of natural human and animal interaction however to reach a conclusion with total certainty would still require greater cooperation and transparency from the chinese side 150 on 16 may 2020 china reported that their current official position on the source of the covid 19 virus may be summarized as follows the conspiracy theory about the origin of the new coronavirus has no substantive content in fact there is evidence to support the natural emergence of new coronaviruses and preliminary genotyping studies have shown the relationship between the coronavirus and other bat viruses we must be careful not to blame the rumours in an irresponsible way and use the global crisis to grab political scores 151 152 as of 18 may 2020 an official un investigation into the origins of the covid 19 virus supported by over 120 countries was being considered 153 in the weeks following his april article american journalist josh rogin continued criticizing china s actions tweeting on 20 may 20 the chinese government admits it ordered wuhan labs to destroy early samples of the coronavirus but says it was for safety to avoid a lab accident but they say it s impossible the outbreak could be from a lab accident think about that 154 iran s press tv asserted that zionist elements developed a deadlier strain of coronavirus against iran 14 similarly various arab media outlets accused israel and the united states of creating and spreading covid 19 avian flu and sars 155 users on social media offered a variety of theories including the allegation that jews had manufactured covid 19 to precipitate a global stock market collapse and thereby profit via insider trading 156 while a guest on turkish television posited a more ambitious scenario in which jews and zionists had created covid 19 avian flu and crimean congo hemorrhagic fever to design the world seize countries and neuter the world s population 157 israeli attempts to develop a covid 19 vaccine prompted mixed reactions grand ayatollah naser makarem shirazi denied initial reports that he had ruled that a zionist made vaccine would be halal or impure 158 and one press tv journalist tweeted that i d rather take my chances with the virus than consume an israeli vaccine 159 a columnist for the turkish yeni akit asserted that such a vaccine could be a ruse to carry out mass sterilization 160 an alert by the us federal bureau of investigation regarding the possible threat of far right extremists intentionally spreading the coronavirus mentioned blame being assigned to jews and jewish leaders for causing the pandemic and several statewide shutdowns 161 in the united states the anti defamation league adl published a number of reports and blogs about online anti israel 162 and antisemitic conspiracy theories and misinformation concerning the origin of covid 19 its spread and the creation or profitability of vaccines among other things linking them to centuries old antisemitic tropes particularly in times of plague 163 164 165 adl also posted blogs holding large tech platforms such as facebook responsible for the viral spread of these conspiracy theories adl blamed such platforms for their failure to adopt policies requiring the removal of this content failure to enforce existing content moderation policies around hate speech and or failure to otherwise restrict the reach and amplification of this content 166 in india muslims have been blamed for spreading infection following the emergence of cases linked to a tablighi jamaat religious gathering 167 there are reports of vilification of muslims on social media and attacks on individuals in india 168 claims have been made muslims are selling food contaminated with coronavirus and that a mosque in patna was sheltering people from italy and iran 169 these claims were shown to be false 170 in the uk there are reports of far right groups blaming muslims for the coronavirus outbreak and falsely claiming that mosques remained open after the national ban on large gatherings 171 in the u s the anti defamation league adl reported on islamophobic anti muslim bigotry connected with the coronavirus 172 it has been repeatedly claimed that the virus was deliberately created by humans nature medicine published an article arguing against the conspiracy theory that the virus was created artificially the high affinity binding of its peplomers to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ace2 was shown to be most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human like ace2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise 173 in case of genetic manipulation one of the several reverse genetic systems for betacoronaviruses would probably have been used while the genetic data irrefutably showed that the virus is not derived from a previously used virus template 173 the overall molecular structure of the virus was found to be distinct from the known coronaviruses and most closely resembles that of viruses of bats and pangolins that were little studied and never known to harm humans 174 in february 2020 the financial times quoted virus expert and global co lead coronavirus investigator trevor bedford there is no evidence whatsoever of genetic engineering that we can find and the evidence we have is that the mutations in the virus are completely consistent with natural evolution 175 bedford further explained the most likely scenario based on genetic analysis was that the virus was transmitted by a bat to another mammal between 20 70 years ago this intermediary animal not yet identified passed it on to its first human host in the city of wuhan in late november or early december 2019 175 on 19 february 2020 the lancet published a letter of a group of scientists condemning conspiracy theories suggesting that covid 19 does not have a natural origin 176 amidst a rise in sinophobia there have been conspiracy theories reported on india s social networks that the virus is a bioweapon that went rogue and also fake videos alleging that chinese authorities are killing citizens to prevent its spread 177 according to the kyiv post two common conspiracy theories online in ukraine are that american author dean koontz predicted the pandemic in his 1981 novel the eyes of darkness and that the coronavirus is a bioweapon leaked from a secret lab in wuhan 178 in february conservative mp tobias ellwood chair of the defence select committee of the uk house of commons publicly questioned the role of the chinese army s wuhan institute for biological products and called for the greater transparency over the origins of the coronavirus 179 non primary source needed the daily mail reported in early april 2020 that a member of cobra an ad hoc government committee tasked with advising on crises citation needed has stated while government intelligence does not dispute that the virus has a zoonotic origin it also does not discount the idea of a leak from a wuhan laboratory saying perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in wuhan the story was later reported by asia times in january 2020 bbc news published an article about coronavirus misinformation citing two 24 january articles in the washington times that said the virus was part of a chinese biological weapons program based at the wuhan institute of virology wiv 1 the washington post later published an article debunking the theory citing us experts who explained why the wiv was unsuitable for military use that most countries had abandoned bioweapon programs as failures and that there was no evidence the virus was genetically engineered 180 on 29 january financial news website and blog zerohedge suggested without evidence that a scientist at the wiv created the covid 19 strain responsible for the coronavirus outbreak zerohedge listed the full contact details of the scientist supposedly responsible a practice known as doxing by including the scientist s name photo and phone number suggesting to readers that they pay the chinese scientist a visit if they wanted to know what really caused the coronavirus pandemic 181 twitter later permanently suspended the blog s account for violating its platform manipulation policy 182 in january 2020 buzzfeed news reported on an internet meme of a link between the logo of the wiv and the umbrella corporation the agency that created the virus responsible for a zombie apocalypse in the resident evil franchise posts online noted that racoon sic the main city in resident evil was an anagram of corona 183 snopes noted that the logo was not from the wiv but a company named shanghai ruilan bao hu san biotech ltd located some 500 miles 800km away in shanghai and that the correct name of the city in resident evil was raccoon city 183 in february 2020 us senator tom cotton r ar suggested the virus may have originated in a chinese bioweapon laboratory 184 francis boyle a law professor also expressed support for the bioweapon theory suggesting it was the result of unintended leaks 185 cotton elaborated on twitter that his opinion was only one of at least four hypotheses multiple medical experts have indicated there is no evidence for these claims 186 conservative political commentator rush limbaugh said on the rush limbaugh show the most popular radio show in the us that the virus was probably a chicom laboratory experiment and the chinese government was using the virus and the media hysteria surrounding it to bring down donald trump 187 188 on 6 february the white house asked scientists and medical researchers to rapidly investigate the origins of the virus both to address the current spread and to inform future outbreak preparation and better understand animal human and environmental transmission aspects of coronaviruses 189 american magazine foreign policy said xi jinping s political agenda may turn out to be a root cause of the epidemic and that his belt and road initiative has made it possible for a local disease to become a global menace 104 the inverse reported that christopher bouzy the founder of bot sentinel conducted a twitter analysis for inverse and found online bots and trollbots are making an array of false claims these bots are claiming china intentionally created the virus that it s a biological weapon that democrats are overstating the threat to hurt donald trump and more while we can t confirm the origin of these bots they are decidedly pro trump 190 conservative commentator josh bernstein claimed that the democratic party and the medical deep state were collaborating with the chinese government to create and release the coronavirus to bring down donald trump bernstein went on to suggest those responsible should be locked in a room with infected coronavirus patients as punishment 191 192 jerry falwell jr the president of liberty university promoted a conspiracy theory on fox news that north korea and china conspired together to create the coronavirus 193 he also said people were overreacting to the coronavirus outbreak and that democrats were trying to use the situation to harm president trump 194 the hospital ship usns mercy t ah 19 deployed to the port of los angeles to provide backup hospital services for the region on 31 march 2020 a pacific harbor line freight train was deliberately derailed by its onboard engineer in an attempt to crash into the ship but the attack was unsuccessful and no one was injured 195 196 according to federal prosecutors the train s engineer was suspicious of the mercy believing it had an alternate purpose related to covid 19 or a government takeover 197 according to the bbc jordan sather a conspiracy theory youtuber supporting the far right qanon conspiracy theory and the anti vax movement has falsely claimed the outbreak was a population control scheme created by pirbright institute in england and by former microsoft ceo bill gates this belief is held mostly by right wing libertarians nwo conspiracy theorists and christian fundamentalists 1 198 some people have alleged that the coronavirus was stolen from a canadian virus research lab by chinese scientists health canada and the public health agency of canada said that conspiracy theory had no factual basis 199 the stories seem to have been derived 200 from a july 2019 news article 201 stating that some chinese researchers had their security access to a canadian level4 virology facility revoked in a federal police investigation canadian officials described this as an administrative matter and there is absolutely no risk to the canadian public 201 this article was published by the canadian broadcasting corporation cbc 200 responding to the conspiracy theories the cbc later stated that cbc reporting never claimed the two scientists were spies or that they brought any version of the coronavirus to the lab in wuhan while pathogen samples were transferred from the lab in winnipeg canada to beijing china on 31 march 2019 neither of the samples was a coronavirus the public health agency of canada says the shipment conformed to all federal policies and there has not been any statement that the researchers under investigation were responsible for sending the shipment the current location of the researchers under investigation by the royal canadian mounted police is not being released 199 202 203 in the midst of the coronavirus epidemic a senior research associate and expert in biological warfare with the begin sadat center for strategic studies referring to a nato press conference identified suspicions of espionage as the reason behind the expulsions from the lab but made no suggestion that coronavirus was taken from the canadian lab or that it is the result of bioweapons defense research in china 204 according to washington dc based nonprofit middle east media research institute numerous writers in the arabic press have promoted the conspiracy theory that covid 19 as well as sars and the swine flu virus were deliberately created and spread to sell vaccines against these diseases and it is part of an economic and psychological war waged by the u s against china with the aim of weakening it and presenting it as a backward country and a source of diseases 205 iraqi political analyst sabah al akili on al etejah tv saudi daily al watan writer sa ud al shehry syrian daily al thawra columnist hussein saqer and egyptian journalist ahmad rif at on egyptian news website vetogate were some examples given by memri as propagators of the us biowarfare conspiracy theory in the arabic world 205 according to london based the economist plenty of conspiracy theories exist on china s internet about covid 19 being the cia s creation to keep china down 206 nbc news however has noted that there have also been debunking efforts of us related conspiracy theories posted online with a wechat search of coronavirus is from the u s reported to mostly yield articles explaining why such claims are unreasonable 207 according to an investigation by propublica such conspiracy theories and disinformation have been propagated under the direction of china news service the country s second largest government owned media outlet controlled by the united front work department 208 global times and xinhua news agency have similarly been implicated in propagating disinformation related to covid 19 s origins 209 210 multiple conspiracy articles in chinese from the sars era resurfaced during the outbreak with altered details claiming sars is biological warfare some said bgi group from china sold genetic information of the chinese people to the us which then specifically targeted the genome of chinese individuals 211 on 26 january chinese military enthusiast website xilu published an article claimed how the us artificially combined the virus to precisely target chinese people 212 213 the article was removed in early february the article was further distorted on social media in taiwan which claimed top chinese military website admitted novel coronavirus was chinese made bio weapons 214 taiwan fact check center debunked the original article and its divergence suggesting the original xilu article distorted the conclusion from a legitimate research on chinese scientific magazine science china life sciences which never mentioned the virus was engineered 214 the fact check center explained xilu is a military enthusiastic tabloid established by a private company thus it doesn t represent the voice of chinese military 214 some articles on popular sites in china have also cast suspicion on us military athletes participating in the wuhan 2019 military world games which lasted until the end of october 2019 and have suggested they deployed the virus they claim the inattentive attitude and disproportionately below average results of american athletes in the games indicate they might have been there for other purposes and they might actually be bio warfare operatives such posts stated that their place of residence during their stay in wuhan was also close to the huanan seafood wholesale market where the first known cluster of cases occurred 215 in march 2020 this conspiracy theory was endorsed by zhao lijian a spokesperson from the ministry of foreign affairs of the people s republic of china 216 217 218 219 on 13 march the us government summoned chinese ambassador cui tiankai to washington over the coronavirus conspiracy theory 220 over the next month conspiracy theorists narrowed their focus to one us army reservist a woman who participated in the games in wuhan as a cyclist claiming she is patient zero according to a cnn report these theories have been spread by george webb who has nearly 100 000 followers on youtube and have been amplified by a report by cpc owned newspaper global times 221 222 according to radio farda iranian cleric seyyed mohammad saeedi accused us president donald trump of targeting qom with coronavirus to damage its culture and honor saeedi claimed that trump is fulfilling his promise to hit iranian cultural sites if iranians took revenge for the airstrike that killed of quds force commander qasem soleimani 223 iranian tv personality ali akbar raefipour claimed the coronavirus was part of a hybrid warfare programme waged by the united states on iran and china 224 brigadier general gholam reza jalali head of iranian civil defense organization claimed the coronavirus is likely a

british tabloids that a british man and others had been cured of coronavirus with whiskey and honey 365 369 which combined with the use of alcohol based hand sanitizers as disinfectants led to the false belief that drinking high proof alcohol can kill the virus 365 366 367 similar incidents have occurred in turkey with 30 turkmenistan citizens dying from methanol poisoning related to coronavirus cure claims 370 371 in kenya the governor of nairobi mike sonko has come under scrutiny for including small bottles of the cognac hennessy in care packages falsely claiming that alcohol

said he wouldn t feel anything if infected and has described quarantines and other measures taken to slow the spread of covid 19 as scorched earth tactics 389 bolsonaro openly attempted to force state and municipal governments to revoke the social isolation measures they had begun by launching an anti social distancing campaign called o brasil n o pode parar brazil can t stop it received massive backlash both from the media and from the public and was blocked by a court order 390 391 some analysts have noted that bolsonaro s positions mimic those of us president donald trump who also tried to downplay the pandemic and then pressured states to abandon social distancing 392 whistleblowing from various chinese doctors including li wenliang publishing data from ai fen on 30 december 2019 revealed that wuhan hospital authorities were already aware the virus was a sars like coronavirus and patients were being put under quarantine 393 in the early stages of the outbreak the chinese national health commission said it had no clear evidence of human to human transmissions 394 on 20 january 2020 it announced that human to human transmission of the coronavirus had already occurred 395 research published on 29 january 2020 indicated that among officially confirmed cases human to human transmission may have started in december of 2019 and the delay of disclosure on the results until then rather than earlier in january brought criticism of health authorities 394 wang guangfa one of the health officials said that there was uncertainty regarding the human to human transmission 396 and he was infected by a patient within 10 days of making the statement 396 397 on 26 january 2020 the editor of the state owned people s daily tweeted a claim that the first building of the huoshenshan hospital had been completed in only 16 hours the daily beast reported the next day that the building shown in the picture accompanying the tweet was actually a marketing photo of a modular container building sold by the henan k home steel structure company and not of the actual hospital a human rights watch researcher claimed that the post was part of the chinese government s misinformation campaign to hype the government s response 398 the tweet was later removed and replaced with a video of the modular container buildings being assembled at huoshenshan hospital again stating that the first building had been completed in only 16 hours 399 on 15 february 2020 china s paramount leader and party general secretary xi jinping published an article which claimed he had learned of the epidemic on 7 january 2020 and had the same day issued a request for information on activities to contain the spread of the disease however yahoo news reported that the original public announcement of that 7 january 2020 meeting did not mention the epidemic and claimed that xi s claim was unsupported by the evidence 400 401 reports from cnn and the washington post said chinese government officials in response to the outbreak launched a coordinated disinformation campaign seeking to spread doubt about the origin of the coronavirus and its outbreak 402 403 a review of chinese state media and social media posts in early march 2020 conducted by the washington post found that anti american conspiracy theories circulating among chinese users gained steam through a mix of unexplained official statements magnified by social media censorship and doubts stoked by state media and government officials 404 united states department of state officials 405 as well as sinologist dali yang have said the campaign was intended to deflect attention away from the chinese government s mishandling of the crisis 404 at a press conference on 12 march 2020 two spokesmen for the chinese ministry of foreign affairs zhao lijian and geng shuang promoted the conspiracy theory that the coronavirus had been bio engineered by western powers and suggested that the us government specifically the us army had spread the virus 216 403 no evidence supports these claims 403 406 zhao also pushed these conspiracy theories on twitter which is blocked in mainland china but is used as a public diplomacy tool by chinese officials to promote the chinese government and defend it from criticism 403 china s ambassador to south africa also made these claims on twitter 402 407 some chinese state media had propagated the speculation that the virus may have spread in italy before the wuhan outbreak after italian doctor giuseppe remuzzi mentioned reports of strange pneumonia cases in november and december he later said his words were twisted 408 409 in addition articles from counterpunch 410 and asia times 411 as well as the chinese scientist zhong nanshan have brought up speculations that the virus may not have originated in china 412 an intentional disinformation campaign by china was discussed among the group of seven g7 413 and the chinese efforts were condemned by the us department of state 402 which criticized chinese authorities for spreading dangerous and ridiculous conspiracy claims 405 the us summoned china s ambassador to the united states cui tiankai to issue a stern message over the chinese government s claims 405 cui had disavowed the us military conspiracy theory as crazy in a february interview and affirmed his belief in another one in mid march 414 it was reported in april 2020 that china has clamped down on the publication of research on the origin of the virus requiring that all academic papers containing information on covid 19 be vetted by china s ministry of science and technology before they can be published 415 cnn for example published a report about the imposition of new restrictions and central government vetting quoting an anonymous chinese researcher s belief that the crackdown is a coordinated effort from the chinese government to control the narrative and paint it as if the outbreak did not originate in china 416 cuban president miguel d az canel claimed on twitter that cuban interferon alfa 2b was being used to treat and cure covid 19 in china linking to an article written by state owned newspaper granma 1 the chinese embassy in cuba also made similar claims several latin american news outlets 417 418 relayed the story which was also relayed on social media and the claims were eventually translated to portuguese and french 419 in reality the interferon was made by a chinese company in china using cuban technology and it was under clinical trials in china as a potential cure but it was not actively being used as such as the claims suggested 419 twitter suspended thousands of accounts linked to el fagr an egypt based media group taking direction from the egyptian government to amplify messaging critical of iran qatar and turkey 420 421 iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said the us created a special version of the virus that is specifically built for iran using the genetic data of iranians which they have obtained through different means 342 27 bahrain accused iran of biological aggression that is criminalised by international law by lying about the extent of the outbreak in iran 422 mexico s federal government has been slow to respond to the covid 19 pandemic as of late march 2020 with a great deal of criticism 423 president andr s manuel l pez obrador has continued to hold rallies be tactile with crowds and downplay the threat of the pandemic to mexicans health and to the mexican economy 23 424 the european union watchdog group euvsdisinfo reported that russia was pushing what they believe was false information related to the sars cov 2 pandemic through pro kremlin outlets 425 on 18 march russian presidential spokesman dmitry peskov denounced the findings 426 mark galeotti a rusi senior associate fellow questioned these claims and wrote that it seems strange that the kremlin itself would launch and push a disinformation campaign at the very time it is clearly launching a soft power charm offensive on the back of the pandemic 13 as coronavirus spread throughout europe on february 26 president aleksandar vu i called for a press conference where he addressed the possibility of the virus impacting serbia this news conference made headlines after a pulmonologist dr branimir nestorovi made joking statements about the virus calling it the most laughable virus in the history of mankind and suggested that women should travel to then virus affected italy for shopping because estrogen protects them the president who was visible in the background expressing amusement and chuckling at this during the tv broadcast later denied any accusations of portraying the virus as such by dr nestorovi 427 in april 2020 a decree that limited access to public information about covid 19 was announced and a journalist has been arrested for writing an article on alleged shortages of medical equipment and neglect of medical staff but after public outcry and reactions from the eu rsf and ipi it was revoked and the journalist has been released 95 428 429 the declared goal of the decree was to limit the spread of fake news about the coronavirus in serbia on april 21 dr predrag kon being a guest on a tv show irilica on happy tv confirmed that there was indeed a lack of medical supplies 430 431 reporters without borders reported that the government of turkmenistan had banned the word coronavirus and that people could be arrested for wearing masks or discussing the pandemic 432 433 the organization later corrected their report clarifying that the word itself was not banned but maintaining it had been removed from informational brochures and the government was restricting information about the virus and providing very one sided information 434 according to chronicles of turkmenistan state media did not begin reporting on the measures that had been taken until 25 march 435 the bbc quoted an anonymous turkmen citizen who said citizens may get into trouble for suggesting that covid 19 had spread to turkmenistan the bbc article also states that the turkmen government is working to control a possible outbreak 436 according to the buzzfeed news twitter took down a pro united arab emirates network of accounts that was pushing propaganda about the coronavirus 437 the mail on sunday newspaper which played a key role in disseminating the theory that the virus was developed by a chinese lab in january 2020 claimed in april that the theory was being taken seriously by the uk government and reported that a member of prime minister boris johnson s emergency committee of senior officials cobra said there is a credible alternative view to the zoonotic theory based on the nature of the virus perhaps it is no coincidence that there is that laboratory in wuhan it is not discounted 438 439 according to the washington post republican government members were largely influenced by series of articles by richard a epstein of the hoover institution who in a series of articles consistently played down the scale of the epidemics ridiculed the panic being spread by progressives made a number of incorrect statements about the sars cov 2 virus misapplied and misconstrued darwinian evolutionary theory in regards to the pandemics and predicted about 500 deaths at the end of the epidemics 440 several members of the us senate particularly richard burr r nc and kelly loeffler r ga have come under scrutiny for sales of large amounts of stocks before the financial markets crashed due to the outbreak sparking accusations that they had insider knowledge from closed door briefings while many of them publicly downplayed the risks posed by the health crisis to the us public 441 442 443 444 for instance an audio recording from 27 february revealed that burr senate intelligence committee chairman gave dire warnings to a small group of well connected constituents in private contrasted in severity to his public statements and not known to the public that the virus is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history advising against travel to europe 13 days before official warnings 15 days before the ban saying schools will be likely be closed 16 days before the closure and suggesting the military might be mobilized learned three weeks later from the recording 445 bill de blasio the mayor of new york city was widely criticized for providing poor and misleading information to the public 446 447 448 on 10 march he said he would keep schools open and if an infected student was found to be in class it would take only a day to clean and re open the school de blasio also said if you re under 50 and you re healthy which is most new yorkers there s very little threat here 449 during a photo op at a public 3 1 1 call center he told a caller there was no need to self quarantine despite the fact she had just returned from italy his instructions to the caller were subsequently reversed by city officials 449 united states secretary of state mike pompeo in april 2020 has refused to rule out the conspiracy theory that covid 19 escaped from wuhan institute of virology during experiments and china covered it 450 451 senate majority leader mitch mcconnell in may 2020 falsely claimed that clearly the obama administration did not leave to the trump administration any kind of game plan for pandemics lara trump the president s daughter in law stated that mcconnell was exactly right however the obama administration had in actuality left a pandemic response playbook of 69 pages that document explicitly cited novel coronaviruses as needing a major governmental response additionally in january 2017 the obama administration had gone through an exercise in pandemic response with incoming trump administration members 452 united states president donald trump and his top economic adviser larry kudlow have been accused of spreading misinformation about the coronavirus on 25 february trump said i think that whole situation will start working out we re very close to a vaccine 454 455 456 457 at the time sars cov 2 had been spreading in the united states undetected for weeks 458 and new vaccine development may require a minimum of a year to prove safety and efficacy to gain regulatory approval 459 in an interview with sean hannity on 4 march trump also claimed that the death rate published by the who was false that the correct fatality rate was less than 1percent and said well i think the 3 4 percent is really a false number 460 461 462 that the potential impact of the outbreak was exaggerated by democrats plotting against him and that it was safe for infected individuals to go to work 463 464 in a later tweet trump denied having made claims regarding infected individuals going to work contrary to footage from the interview 464 the white house accused media of intentionally stoking fears of the virus to destabilize the administration 465 the stat news reported that president trump and members of his administration have also said that us containment of the virus is close to airtight and that the virus is only as deadly as the seasonal flu their statements range from false to unproven and in some cases underestimate the challenges that public health officials must contend with in responding to the virus 466 around the same time the airtight claim was made sars cov 2 was already past containment the first case of community spread of the virus had been confirmed and it was spreading faster than severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus with a case fatality rate at least seven times the rate for seasonal flu 467 468 469 trump repeatedly compared covid 19 to influenza despite the fact that covid 19 s mortality rate is estimated to be approximately ten times higher on 26 february he stated this is a flu this is like a flu on 9 march trump compared the 546 known us cases of covid 19 at the time and the 22 known deaths at the time to the tens of thousands of us deaths from flu each year on 24 march trump argued that we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu but we ve never closed down the country for the flu on 27 march he stated you can call it a flu on 31 march trump changed his stance it s not the flu it s vicious i knew everything i knew it could be horrible and i knew it could be maybe good 470 471 472 473 on 2 march trump told the media he had heard that a covid 19 vaccine would be available in a matter of months with a year being an outside number after trump attended a discussion where his senior health official anthony fauci told him this process would take a year to a year and a half at a minimum fauci later said during that discussion trump repeatedly quizzed the leaders of pharmaceutical companies on the time needed to produce vaccines stating i like the sound of a couple of months better 474 the length of time is due in part to regulations and safeguards intended to guarantee efficacy and safety 475 on 4 march trump blamed the barack obama administration for making a decision that delayed covid 19 testing by the trump administration the policy in question had never been modified by the obama administration despite plans to do so the policy s overall legal roots date to 2004 before the obama administration under the umbrella of emergency use authorizations the old policy stated that laboratory developed tests should not be used for clinical diagnoses without fda s approval clearance or authorization during an emergency declaration however this policy was historically treated as a recommendation and generally unenforced with no clear legal authority of the fda in this area the trump administration continued to require laboratories to apply to the fda for approval but allowed the laboratories to test while the fda processed the applications 476 on 6 march trump over promised on the availability of covid 19 testing in the united states claiming that anybody that wants a test can get a test firstly there were criteria needed to qualify for a test recommendations were needed from doctors or health officials to approve testing secondly the lack of test supplies resulted in some being denied tests even though doctors wanted to test them 477 478 on 19 march trump falsely claimed the drug chloroquine was approved by the food and drug administration as a treatment for covid 19 this led the fda to say it had not approved any drugs or therapies for covid 19 and strongly advised people against taking it outside of a hospital or clinical trial due to possibly fatal side effects 479 while trump claimed that we re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately the leader of the fda said the drug would still need to be tested in a large pragmatic clinical trial on subjects infected with covid 19 480 while trump promoted chloroquine as a potential game changer fauci said positive results thus far were still based on anecdotal evidence and not definitive evidence from clinical trials 481 at a later press briefing trump prevented fauci from answering a question about the medical evidence of the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine 482 trump also remarked that re purposing existing drugs for covid 19 is safe and not killing people chloroquine is a form of treatment for malaria while its derivative hydroxychloroquine is a form of treatment for lupus or arthritis however most drugs may cause side effects 483 potentially serious side effects from chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine include irregular heartbeats tinnitus blurred vision muscle weakness or mental changes 483 484 overdoses of these drugs have been documented in scientific literature including fatal overdoses 483 demand for chloroquine in lagos nigeria sharply increased after trump s comments with three people overdosing by 23 march 485 an arizona engineer in his 60s died after ingesting a fish tank cleaner containing chloroquine phosphate in a vitamin cocktail prepared by his wife the wife stated she intended to medicate her husband against the coronavirus after hearing trump tout the potential benefits of chloroquine during a public briefing 486 on 21 march trump addressed a shortage of ventilator supply in the united states claiming that carmaker companies general motors gm and ford are making them right now when the companies were not producing ventilators at the time and had yet to change their factories production abilities 487 on 30 march trump claimed his administration inherited a broken test for covid 19 that wasn t from us that s been there a long time he said the claim was illogical because no previous administration could have prepared a test for a disease which had yet to emerge covid 19 emerged during trump s presidency having first been reported on december 31 2019 488 the test was designed in 2020 by the centers for disease control under the trump administration 489 trump continued to make the false claim on 19 april 490 from 2 to 9 april the white house was in a standoff with cnn which frequently declined to air the daily coronavirus task force briefings and which fact checked trump s remarks the white house said that if cnn did not begin airing the part of the briefing that featured the task force members including mike pence then the white house would disallow national health experts including anthony fauci and deborah birx from appearing on cnn pence relented and allowed robert r redfield to appear on cnn 491 during a 15 april white house news conference president trump said the us government is trying to determine if the covid 19 virus emanated from the wuhan institute of virology 492 493 the vice director of the wuhan institute of virology called the accusations a conspiracy theory 494 on 23 april after a homeland security official stated that certain disinfectants can kill the coronavirus on surfaces trump openly wondered if disinfectants could be used on humans by injection saying it d be interesting to check if that was a potential treatment injecting disinfectants into the body is dangerous and potentially lethal trump also suggested another interesting method to be tested we hit the body with a tremendous whether it s ultraviolet or just very powerful light supposing you brought the light inside of the body which you can do either through the skin or in some other way he asked coronavirus response coordinator deborah birx if heat or light can be used as a treatment to which birx stated she had not seen any treatments using heat or light trump attributed these ideas to him being a person that has a good you know what 496 497 the next day the white house accused the media of taking trump s words out of context while trump defended himself by claiming he d spoken in a very sarcastic manner and that he d addressed his comment to reporters just to see what would happen this despite the video showing he had addressed not reporters but rather deborah birx directly and had also been looking at bill bryan head of the dhs science and technology division in his defense trump also tried revising his comment to say disinfectant would kill the virus on the hands and that would make things much better 498 disinfectants are useful for destroying microorganisms on inert surfaces not on living tissue and applying disinfectants on skin has the potential to cause irritation or chemical burns 499 after the president s remarks the united states environmental protection agency the makers of lysol the world health organization and other government officials issued various advisories pointing out that it is already known to be harmful to use disinfectants or ultraviolet radiation on human bodies instead of inanimate surfaces and birx explained that these were not under investigation as possible treatments 500 after trump s comments hundreds of calls were made to the maryland health department emergency hotline asking if it was right to ingest clorox or alcohol cleaning products whether that was going to help them fight the virus stated the republican governor of maryland larry hogan he called for the white house to communicate very clearly on the facts because people certainly pay attention when the president of the united states is standing there giving a press conference 501 other increases in calls to poison control centers were reported in the city of new york and the states of michigan tennessee and illinois the state of illinois also reported incidents where people have used detergents for sinus rinses and gargling with a mixture of bleach and mouthwash 501 501 officials of the state of kansas said on 27 april that a man drank disinfectant because of the advice he d received but did not clarify the source of the advice 502 when trump was asked by a reporter about a spike in people using disinfectant after your comments last week trump interrupted the question stating i can t imagine why the reporter continued by asking do you take any responsibility trump replied no i don t 502 the un who has warned of criminal scams involving perpetrators who misrepresent themselves as representatives of the who seeking personal information from victims via email or phone 503 also the federal communications commission has warned consumers not to click on links in suspicious emails or give out personal information in emails text messages or phone calls claiming to be representatives from the cdc 504 many financial companies like wells fargo 505 and loandepot 506 have posted similar warnings on their websites cybersecurity firm check point stated there has been a large increase in phishing attacks to lure victims into unwittingly installing a computer virus under the guise of coronavirus themed emails containing attachments cyber criminals use deceptive domains such as cdc gov org instead of the correct cdc gov or even spoof the original domain so it resembles specific websites more than 4 000 coronavirus related domains have been registered 507 police in new jersey united states reported incidents of criminals knocking on people s doors and claiming to be from the cdc they then attempt to sell products at inflated prices or otherwise scam victims under the guise of educating and protecting the public from the coronavirus 508 links that purportedly direct to the johns hopkins university coronavirus map but instead direct to a false site that spreads malware have been circulating on the internet 509 510 some media outlets including daily mail and rt as well as individuals disseminated a video showing a chinese woman eating a bat falsely suggesting it was filmed in wuhan and connecting it to the outbreak 511 512 however the widely circulated video contains unrelated footage of a chinese travel vlogger wang mengyun eating bat soup in the island country of palau in 2016 511 512 513 514 wang posted an apology on weibo 513 514 in which she said she had been abused and threatened 513 and that she had only wanted to showcase palauan cuisine 513 514 the spread of misinformation about bat consumption has been characterized by xenophobic and racist sentiment toward asians 104 515 516 in contrast scientists suggest the virus originated in bats and migrated into an intermediary host animal before infecting people 104 517 united states hospitals have been silencing doctors and other staff threatening to fire them if they publicly speak about inadequacies in working conditions and lack of equipment 518 519 the washington state nurses association says there is an effort by hospitals to preserve their image 518 some conservative figures who in the united states downplayed the scale of the pandemic saying it has been exaggerated by whom as part of an effort to hurt president trump some people pointed to empty hospital parking lots as evidence that the virus has been exaggerated despite the empty parking lots many hospitals in new york city and other places experienced thousands of covid 19 related hospitalizations 520 social media posts and internet memes claimed that covid 19 means chinese originated viral infectious disease 19 or similar as supposedly the 19th virus to come out of china 521 in fact the who named the disease as follows co stands for corona vi for virus dfor disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified 31 december 2019 522 in march conspiracy theorists started the false rumor that maatje benassi a u s army reservist was patient zero of the pandemic the first person to be infected with coronavirus benassi was targeted due to her participation in the 2019 military world games before the pandemic started even though she never actually tested positive for the virus conspiracy theorists even connected her family to the dj benny benassi as a benassi virus plot even though ben has no relation to maatje and also never had the virus 523 a social media joke suggesting lions had been freed to keep people off the streets in moscow was passed around as if it were true 524 525 during the pandemic many false and misleading images or news reports about the environmental impact of the coronavirus pandemic were shared by clickbait journalism sources and social media 526 a viral post that originated on weibo and spread on twitter claimed that a pack of elephants descended on a village under quarantine in china s yunnan got drunk on corn wine and passed out in a tea garden 527 a chinese news report debunked the claim that the elephants got drunk on corn wine and noted that wild elephants were a common sight in the village the image attached to the post was originally taken at the asian elephant research center in yunnan in december 2019 526 following reports of reduced pollution levels in italy as a result of lockdowns images purporting to show swans and dolphins swimming in venice canals went viral on social media the image of the swans was revealed to have been taken in burano where swans are common while footage of the dolphins was filmed at a port in sardinia hundreds of miles away 526 the venice mayor s office clarified that the reported water clarity in the canals was due to the lack of sediment being kicked up by boat traffic not due to a lack of water pollution that was initially reported 528 following the lockdown of india a video clip purporting to show the extremely rare malabar civet a critically endangered possibly extinct species walking the empty streets of meppayur went viral on social media experts later identified the civet in the video as actually being the much more common small indian civet 529 another viral indian video clip showed a pod of humpback whales allegedly returning to the arabian sea offshore from mumbai following the shutdown of shipping routes however this video was found to have actually been taken in 2019 in the java sea 530 claims that the simpsons had predicted the coronavirus pandemic in 1993 accompanied by a doctored screenshot from the show where the text corona virus was layered over the original text apocalypse meow without blocking it from view were later found out to be false with the claim being widely spread on social media 531 532 a tweet started an internet meme that bank of england 20 banknotes contained a picture of a 5g mast and the sarscov 2 virus facebook and youtube removed items pushing this story and fact checking organisations established that the picture is of margate lighthouse and the virus is the staircase at the tate britain 533 534 535
