capture the nearly 10 million laid off and furloughed americans who filed initial jobless claims the past two weeks as much of the nation s economy was shut down to contain the spread of the virus that s because labor s survey was conducted the week ending march 14 before most states ordered residents to stay at home and nonessential businesses such as restaurants movie theaters and most stores to close this is terrible but unfortunately it s nothing compared to what s coming in april says ianshepherdson chief economist of pantheon macroeconomics still the 701 000 payrolllosses are the most since 800 000 jobs were shed in march 2009 during the depths of the great recession and they end a record 113 month streakof gains dating to october 2010 economists surveyed by bloomberg estimated

stressed or worried about anything most analysts say the economy is is already mired in a deep but likely short recession capital economics predicts gross domestic output will fall at a stunning 40 annual rate in the second quarter assuming the outbreak begins to wane by summer economists expect a strong rebound in the second half of the year as shuttered businesses reopen in the meantime the 2 2 trillion dollar stimulus passed by congress is intended to encourage many small businesses to retain or rehire employees by promising to forgive loan to firms that maintain staffs still the massive layoffs and lingering consumer fears of contagion could leave the economy diminished for some time with unemployment that falls but remains elevated compared to pre crisis levels in a sign of the economy s breathtaking turnabout u s employers added well over 200 000 jobs in both january and february labor on friday revised down gains for the two months by a total 59 000 but that still leaves

crosshairs which states will be hit hardest by coronavirus related job losses see the list as expected leisure and hospitality was hit hardest with 459 000 job losses though even that total reflects just the initial surge of cuts walloping the industry healthcare lost 61 000 jobs professional and business services 52 000 retail 46 000 construction 29 000 and manufacturing 18 000 the numbers show the breadth of the pandemic s impact across the economy even auto and other manufacturers have closed factories because of fears of infection and professional businesses such as law and marketing

broader measure of unemployment that includes americans working part time even though they want full time jobs discouraged workers who have stopped looking and the unemployed leapedfrom 7 near a 20 year low to 8 7 highest since march 2017 the share of americans working or looking for jobs tumbled from a seven year high of 63 4 to 62 7 lowest since late 2017 that further reveals that the official unemployment rate doesn t capture all of the workers pushed to the sidelines by the economic blows of the pandemic average hourly earnings increased 11 cents to 28 62 bumpingup the annual gain from 3 1 to 3 many of the workers losing jobs last month were low paid restaurant and retail workers and that could have nudged average pay increaseshigher economists said wage growth has hovered around 3 the past year despite falling unemployment that made it tougher for businesses to find qualified workers now the recession is leaving a surplus of workers that s likely topush pay increases lower wage
