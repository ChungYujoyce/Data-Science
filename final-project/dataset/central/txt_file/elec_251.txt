that works with any politician any more gone is the era of reagan republicans and fdr democrats today successful politicians are mostly singular entities that have a difficult time extending their brand when they are not themselves on the ballot he said payne said the same applies to the successful coalition obama built during his two presidential campaigns in terms of electoral success you cannot replicate the obama coalition and what it represented he said that coalition has yet to be successfully transferred to any other politician in obama s orbit not hillary clinton not joe biden
