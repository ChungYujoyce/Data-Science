new support for embattled alabama gop senate nominee roy moore from president trump and the republican national committee rnc could mean trouble for gop candidates across the country in 2018 democrats are already targeting top gop nominees in pivotal senate battles about moore questioning whether they stand by the rnc s decision to back moore financially after allegations that he pursued teenage girls decades ago when he was in his 30s meanwhile moderate republicans are sounding alarms about the impact backing someone accused of sexual assault could have on the national republican brand all things being equal the republican party has set itself up for a wave election in 2018 said gop strategist rick tyler an outspoken trump critic the seduction is now complete he said the gop made a deal with the devil back in 2016 the problem with making a deal with the devil is that the devil is always going to change the terms the deal now has been changed to where the republican party is endorsing accused child molesters for public office and i think that may be irreparable top republican leaders in washington have spent the past month since a woman said in a washington post report that moore initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 and he was 32 wrestling with how to handle moore key republicans including senate majority leader mitch mcconnelladdison mitch mitchell

arm both cut fundraising ties with moore as more allegations piled on including a woman saying moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 some senators began considering expelling moore if he won but with many of the latest polls showing moore regaining his lead on democratic candidate doug jones who has trounced him in fundraising many republicans are changing course ahead of the dec 12 special election after days of focusing his criticism on jones trump finally gave moore a full throated endorsement on twitter on monday and called the alabama republican from air force one to offer his support trump had already planned a florida rally on friday just 20 miles from the alabama border now that the endorsement is official trump can be even more overt in his support the rnc followed the president s lead on monday night reinstating its support for moore with plans to fundraise for the alabama gop in the final fundraising report before the election jones hauled in more than 10 1 million compared to moore who only brought in about 1 7 million mcconnell also softened his stance over the weekend arguing that alabama voters should decide if moore should be in the senate the nrsc hasn t reinstituted its fundraising agreement with moore s campaign but the rnc s decision to back moore means that he once again has the national party s blessing democrats have been quick to seize

wis to do the right thing now or explain to voters later why standing with washington republicans was more important than standing up to a child molester jesse ferguson a former top aide to the dccc told the hill that republican candidates would individually have to answer for their party s support of moore but he added that attacking republicans on moore also lets democrats portray the gop as putting trump and his wishes above morality for voters who have concerns about president trump the fact that the republican party threw their principles overboard in order to do what the president demanded is a stark reminder for voters that republicans in congress s top priority is president trump ferguson said that conversation could be particularly salient with female voters gop strategists said especially as americans reconcile with the growing cultural conversation about sexual harassment the gop presidential ticket did far better with women than many expected in 2016 despite the harassment allegations against trump levied during the campaign but recent polls have shown democrats widening their lead among female voters a key voting bloc in democratic wins across virginia last month democrats hope that top republicans support for moore will help them build on that success with female voters there was clearly a disconnect with hillary and white educated female voters i don t think that disconnection was necessarily a full embrace of trump and all the baggage he brought to the conversation former rnc chairman michael steele told the hill it s a misguided calculation to think that those women are still going to be after we ve seen this year and particularly over the last few weeks where the party has seemingly endorsed pedophilia and is much more inclined to believe the man accused of those actions rather than the women who are the victims he said for trump and his gop allies the calculus is clear a vote for moore gives the party another republican to help support the president s agenda they hope moore s vote will help achieve more republican legislative victories that candidates can point to in 2018 i think he s going to do very well we don t want to have a liberal democrat in alabama believe me we want strong borders we want stopping crime we want the things we represent trump said tuesday about moore but other republicans including tyler believe the gamble on moore could be disastrous for the gop and trump even if moore wins saying that roy moore is unfit and then saying he s worth a tax vote is the worst kind of hypocrisy they may have a short term win here and get a vote but i think they ll pay for it in 2018 he said adding that the house and senate majorities could be in play in the midterms if trump thinks he has problems now he can t imagine what kind of problems he would have with a democratic majority with subpoena power view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202
