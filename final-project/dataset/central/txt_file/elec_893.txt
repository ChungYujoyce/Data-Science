keep me logged in twenty democratic presidential candidates had their first chance to square off on the same stage this week a handful of them took steps that could help them stand out in the jammed field while others struggled or gained little ground on a crowded debate stage some of the race s early leaders met expectations as contenders candidates such as sen elizabeth warren d mass and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg earned plaudits in surveys and from pundits others also had performances during the wednesday and thursday night debates that made them stand out for better or worse a strong debate performance can help to propel a candidate with donors and media coverage but it hardly guarantees a surge or sustained success in a primary on the other hand one poor performance does not necessarily deter a candidate s campaign especially if they come into the debate with strong support here are five of the candidates that both post debate polls and pundits identified as the winners and losers of the two nights of debate in miami harris took swings at president donald trump early in thursday night s debate she criticized the republican tax plan and his immigration policy but she created the most memorable moment of either night when she targeted a democratic rival the senator from california criticized former vice president joe biden the primary s early frontrunner over his record on race and the desegregation of school busing in personal terms there was a little girl in california who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day and that little girl was me harris said she called his comments about working with segregationist senators hurtful in a tweet democratic presidential candidate john delaney

thursday up from 7 9 before the first debate according to morning consult polling done for fivethirtyeight her net favorability rating favorable minus unfavorable views of the senator jumped by 9 2 percentage points biden for his part said harris mischaracterized his record on race he said he worked as a public defender instead of a prosecutor which harris was as district attorney in san francisco and attorney general in california i think that you should do your homework on this issue castro said to fellow texan and former rep beto o rourke after a heated exchange on whether the u s should decriminalize immigration the obama administration s housing and urban development secretary started the night s discussion on immigration by saying a photo of a drowned father and 23 month old daughter trying to gain asylum in the u s should piss us all off he ended the night with the fourth most speaking time out of the 10 participants according to the washington post castro entered the night as a relative unknown only about 39 of likely democratic voters had an opinion of him entering the night morning consult found but after the debates 47 8 of respondents had a favorable view of him versus only 11 7 who had an unfavorable opinion his net favorability rating increased 16 1 percentage points more than even harris did in addition 1 7 of likely democratic voters said they would

points nearly as much as harris rose according to morning consult still backing for booker barely changed in the survey only 2 8 of respondents said they would support him following the debates about

limit biden hit some popular talking points for democratic voters he addressed trying to return dignity to the middle class and build on obamacare to expand health care coverage in the u s but harris put biden on his heels in the most talked about moment in two nights of debates the former vice president defended himself by saying he didn t oppose busing in the u s what i opposed was busing
