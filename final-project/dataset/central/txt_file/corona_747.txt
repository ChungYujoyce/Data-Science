foxbusiness that there was in fact a deal we have an agreement that reflects what the president talked about in his speech the other night he s very focused on making sure that we can deal with the coronavirus he said the frantic eleventh hour talks that brought the sides together highlight the urgency facing leaders from both parties to take aggressive actions to contain the fast moving virus for reasons of both public health and national morale as members of congress we have a solemn and urgent responsibility to take strong serious action to confront and control this crisis and to put families first and stimulate the economy pelosi wrote in a letter to democraticmembers announcing the deal the deadly pandemic has roiled the stock market upended small businesses and large industries alike and cancelled major sporting and political events around the country millions of americans could lose income or their jobs entirely due to mass public closures work from home orders and the economic downturn sure to follow the agreementannounced friday aims to ease some of the economic stress by providing financial assistance to those most directly affected by the crisis including unemployment and paid leave benefits perhaps more importantly the deal aims to calm some of the public trepidation and market turmoil of recent weeks by demonstrating that washington policymakers can put aside partisan differences and unite quickly behind an emergency response befitting at least in rhetoric the severity of the crisis on friday pelosi and mnuchin spoke no fewer than 13 times by phone as they neared an agreement aides said to get there they had to iron out a small handful of stubborn wrinkles that threatened to sink the entire package disagreements that were finally resolved late friday evening republicans for instance had insisted on the inclusion of language known as the hyde amendment explicitly barring the use of federal funds for abortions democrats conceded and threw it in republicans also balked at democrats initial paid leave provision which would have required employers to provide the benefit not only for the coronavirus but for all future public health emergencies the final compromise bill removed the permanent language limiting the benefit to the current outbreak in addition republicans were concerned about the effects of the paid leave expansion on small businesses the final bill provides subsidies to businesses with 500 employees or fewer mnuchin said obviously we expect the bigger corporations to pick up these costs he told fox the deal comes on the heels of an initial 8 3 billion package signed by trump last week that focused largely on the most immediate health concerns surrounding the crisis including a boost in the nation s efforts to locate victims treat them and stop the spread of the deadly epidemic the second round of relief focuses more squarely on mitigating the economic fallout of the coronavirus giving priority to those most directly affected by the outbreak house lawmakers are now set to vote on the bipartisan package late friday night before heading home for a 10 day break the senate has canceled its recess plans for next week and will take up the house passed measure then the fast moving events reflect the heightened urgency facing lawmakers as they try to assess the scope of the coronavirus and contain its economic fallout around the country and the world early in the week house leaders signaled they would pass a democratic bill on thursday and then leave town for their pre scheduled 10 day

crush of calamities put pressure on leaders of both chambers to roll up their sleeves and secure an agreement prodded by vulnerable lawmakers wary of facing voters in their districts without doing so first while house and senate republicans had objected to the democrats initial bill trump s support for the revised package is likely to convince many republicans in both chambers to get on board central to the package are provisions to provide paid sick leave for affected workers bolster unemployment insurance for those who lose their jobs as a result of the crisis expand federal food aid for low income families and children and ensure free coronavirus testing pelosi said friday that it s the last provision that s the most crucial we can only defeat this outbreak if we have an accurate
