protectionism mr trump and mr xi held a highly successful meeting the white house says in a statement it says the us tariffs on chinese goods will remain unchanged for 90 days but warns if at the end of this period of time the parties are unable to reach an agreement the 10 percent tariffs will be raised to 25 percent the us says china agreed to purchase a not yet agreed upon but very substantial

an incredible deal that would have an incredibly positive impact on farming what i d be doing is holding back on tariffs china will be opening up china will be getting rid of tariffs mr trump said stephen mcdonell bbc china correspondent in beijing china has pretty much given up nothing in this deal because the future tariffs threatened from the beijing side were retaliatory in nature and only to be applied if the united state escalated for this it has gained a 90 day reprieve during which time both sides have pledged to ramp up talks when china s foreign minster wang yi spoke to reporters after the meeting he said the two leaders had agreed to open up each other s markets and that this process could lead to the resolution of legitimate us concerns this was either an acknowledgment that washington does have legitimate concerns or a way of differentiating those american concerns which are reasonable from those which are not actually legitimate this is not a suspension of the trade war
