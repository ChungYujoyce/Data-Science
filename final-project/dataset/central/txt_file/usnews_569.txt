mary joyce of overland park kans is a lifelong republican her husband dave has voted for both parties but idolizes richard nixon as one of the nation s greatest presidents two years ago the couple did what they usually do voted a straight republican ticket including a vote for donald trump for president and kevin yoder for congress thanks to voters like the joyces trump won kansas by more than 20 points while yoder won the state s 3rd congressional district by more than 10 but on a sunny day in late october as yellow leaves fanned off late autumn trees the joyces walked into their local early voting location and voted for two democrats laura kelly for governor and sharice davids for congress i got tricked into voting for trump says mary joyce 55 i m sorry i did and while yoder has been her congressman for nearly a decade joyce wants to replace him with davids a 38 year old lesbian attorney who would be one of the first native american women in congress if she s elected i want yoder out of there she says if democrats win the house in november it will be partly because of people like mary joyce trump voters who aren t part of his rabid base suburban women who are fed up with the president s antics and conservatives who have less loyalty to the gop than party leaders would like to believe it will be in short because of places like kansas s 3rd district where yoder is trailing davids in a district that now leans democratic according to the nonpartisan cook political report meanwhile davids is just the kind of candidate democrats are counting on nov 6 she s part of a group of first time democratic female candidates running for office in record numbers this year davids has the support of groups like emily s list which works to elect pro choice women democrats she s moderate enough to attract voters like the joyces she wants to work within the current health care system instead of rushing to implement medicare for all and she supports immigration reform but not abolishing ice a position she clarified after first suggesting she did want to get rid of the agency while some progressive voters are drawn to her campaign because of the possibility of electing the nation s first native american woman to congress as well as kansas s first openly lgbtq representative davids talks less about her heritage or her sexuality than her experience as a first generation college student we don t have enough people in congress who know what it s like to go to community college says davids who went on to graduate law school and still carries more than 100 000 in student debt there are a lot of issues like that that i am probably a little more familiar with than maybe some of the folks who have been in congress for a really long time the race remains close and yoder still has a slight fundraising edge in the contest but davids has raised nearly 4 million mostly from individual donors and the national republican congressional committee recently canceled a 1 2 ad buy for yoder an acknowledgement of the incumbent s vulnerability if you asked me six months ago i would have said that she has a chance but odds are the incumbent will win says don haider markel professor of political science at the university of kansas it definitely leans in her favor right now haider markel says the district is a perfect example of the kind of district that could be hard for republicans to keep this year moderate suburban full of college educated women who may have voted republican in the past but are sick of trump the president is still popular in this state that voted overwhelmingly to elect him but his numbers have gone south here according to a morning consult poll 46 of kansas respondents now disapprove of the president up from 32 at the beginning of his term not everybody agree that davids momentum is real i suspect the same phenomenon that concealed support for trump in 2016 is probably at play writes paul johnson director of the center for research methods and data analysis at the university of kansas in an email i expect there is a silent anti female anti liberal anti native american anti gay segment of the population that does not appear too well in phone polls but they have a tendency to show up on election day but voters outside an early voting location here represented the spectrum of voters that democrats need to reach in order to pick up seats like this one suburban women newly eligible young people and people with pre existing conditions who are concerned about the gop s plans for the nation s health care system debbie hawthorne 64 said she s voted for both parties in the past but this time she voted for davids because she s not a republican madison holloway who cast her first vote on her 19th birthday said she voted for davids because i m excited to vote for a woman mary conley 62 said that she voted for davids to get fresh blood in congress her husband tom conley 63 has prostate and rectal cancer and went to vote on saturday wearing a small black pouch that contained his chemotherapy treatment it s actually a matter of life and death says mary conley if our insurance didn t cover 120 000 of his treatment per month he d be dead in 8 months mary joyce also has a pre existing condition a rare form of muscular dystrophy that requires her to walk with a cane and may ultimately claim her life but she spoke less about health care coverage and more about putting a check on the president she voted for i believed what he said his campaign promises to make america great again she says i feel he s made a sham of the office write to charlotte alter at charlotte alter time com
