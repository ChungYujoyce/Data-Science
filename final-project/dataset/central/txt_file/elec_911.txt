first votes are counted in the iowa caucuses democrats are workingto energize one of their biggest strengths young voters it s not just a short gamefor democrats seeking the party s nomination democrats from county organizers to national party leadership are lookingto build on last year s momentum to defeatpresident donald trump in the general election in the 2018 midterms turnout amongvoters ages 18 to 29 more than doubled from 2014 and they overwhelmingly backed democrats like past cycles students arecoordinating with campaigns and enlisting supporters college democratgroups especially those in early voting states such as iowa new hampshire and south carolina are hosting town halls and meet and greets with presidential hopefuls democrats are also training students to caucus and register first time voters butthoseefforts also come as political activism amongyoung liberals is already heightened ondisplay in 2018 andagain this summer when hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streetsacross the u s demandingaction on climate change neithermurly nor giroux both 18 were old enough to vote in 2016 giroux said she s still split between sanders and warren calling the other democrats in the field very in the middle and i m way more far left mulry said young progressives aremotivated because of the severity of what s at stake in 2020 carolyn dewitt president and executive director of rock the vote said young voters have incredible power to determine the direction of the country noting nearly 40 of the electorate in 2020 will be millennial or generation z voters rock the vote a nonpartisan nonprofit hasworked for three decadesto register young voters inform them of the voting process and increase their participation if young people young adults turn out to vote it s kind of a game over situation dewitt said they can dominate and determine pretty much everything the record breaking numbers we saw last year i expect that we will continue to see those next year but there is a lot of work that we need to do more young iowa democrats coming of age in the trump era approach 2020 caucuses with new urgency withprogressive causes such as gun control andclimate change bringing louder battle cries from young voters andcompetitive races in traditionally conservative states like texas and georgia 28 2 of eligible youth voterswent to the polls in 2018 that s compared with 13 of eligible young voters who votedin the 2014 midterms according to research from the nonpartisan center for information and research on civic learning and engagement circle at the tisch college of civic life at tufts university voters 30 andolder increased their turnout as well but only by 10 percentage points democratic congressional candidates won 67 of voters ages 18 to 29 in 2018 a greater than 2 to 1 margin than the32 of young people who voted for republicans it marked the largest share of the youth vote won by democratsin recent political history surpassing even the margins underpresident barack obama when democratic congressional candidateswon60 of the youth vote in 2008 and 2012 obama won 66 of young voters in 2008 things have really shifted and there s no sign of slowing that down right now that i can tell saidkei kawashima ginsberg director of circle she said it s not simply a backlash against trump rather issues like racial equity climate change and gun control have attracted young people who tend to be more diverse to democrats there s a definite explicit statement from young people that they need leaders that will support their priorities at a recent cory booker meet and greetin washington d c madeline sweitzer 24 called 2020 probably the most important presidential election of our lifetime thenonprofit worker who is leaning toward supportingwarren said her vote is lessabout partisanship for a democrat and more about removing a president she believes has pushed policies that hurtworking people when i vote i guess i m not just voting for a democrat i m voting for someone that i think would actually help people and make their lives better sweitzer said kawashima ginsbergsaid registration of first time young voters before 2020 is already oneyear ahead of a typical cycle a strong indicator they are already receivingcontact from campaigns and advocacy groups noquestion she said youth turnout willincrease from 2016 when 46 of eligible voters 18 to 29 voted according to the u s census in the 2016 presidential election voters 18 to 29 years were the only age group to increasetheir voting rate from 2012 with a bounce of 1 1 t according to census figures but hillary clinton received a smaller share of the youth vote than obama although she won 55 of the youth vote topping trump s 40 it was a 5 point drop from obama s level in 2012 and an 11 point drop from 2008 tohave success against trumpin 2020 somedemocrats say it scritical to turn that trend around the caveat young people who historically don t vote at the same levels as olderage groups remained underrepresented in the 2018 midterms despite the gains young people accounted for just 11 of the overall vote even though they accounted for 21 of all eligible voters and 18 of registered voters but young voters made up significant ground their share ofoverall votes cast increasedby 4 percentage points from 2014 while it decreased by 4 percentage points among voters 30 and older itmeans young people had greater influence as a voting blocthan past elections and their influence willexpand furtherin 2020 if that pattern holds if we can stay on this trajectory and use due diligence in supporting young voters and growingvoters i think they will be pivotal kawashima ginsberg said there s no question about that i think they will decide the race starting in the primary youth turnout in 2018 according to circle increased by more than 20 percentage points from 2014 in four states new jersey california virginiaand minnesota the states with the highest youth turnout in 2018 among youth were minnesota 43 7 montana 42 7 colorado 40 8 and oregon 39 2 most of these states are considered safe or leaning for democratsin 2020 onlymontana voted for trump in 2016 although the trump campaign has targeted minnesota as a state topick up erin perrine deputy communications director for trump s reelection campaign said the president is energizing and engaging voters of all ages and will do so well past 2020 when asked about the surge of young people who voted for democrats in the midterms his common sense policies coupled with a booming economy has benefited all americans whether you are a college graduate entering the workforce or a retiree whoseprescription drug prices have been lowered this administration has delivered she added we will not only expand on the 2016 electoral map but we will also increase support across demographics coura fall a 19 year old from american university in washington d c who supports warren was among the new voters who cast her first ballotin the 2018 midterms she will be voting absentee next year inrhodeisland the daughter of undocumented immigrants from senegal fallsaid trump s election was a rude awakening for young people who thought they were living in a post racial society and everything was going to be great i just feel like the power to vote is just so important and so massive fall said and it seems so simple but like you literally get to shape your government to what you want it to be and that s why i take it so seriously marissa soltoff a 22 year oldrecentgraduate ofgeorge washington university said she supported sanders inthe 2016 primary and almost cried at clinton being the nominee but voted for her anyway this year she s deciding between sanders warren rep tulsi gabbard and sen kamala harris bernie is the og soltoff said adding that she likes candidates who are not just playing into the establishment that we currently have she said each is actually fighting for and advocating for real change that s actually going to benefit people rather than just the party establishment warren sanders and pete buttigieg are among campaignsthat have national directors devoted solely to the youth vote several campaignshavepaid staffers in early primary states devoted to student organizers and college outreach each touts canvassingefforts aimed at young voters buttigieg 37 the youngest candidate in the race has adopted the tagline a new generation of american leadership his campaign credits a cnn town hall performance earlier this year for spawning a students for pete across the country the sanders campaign held an online summer school for more than 1 500 students at627 colleges and community colleges it was billed as a two week crash course on political organizing similarly former vice president joe biden has a team joe organizing fellowship an eight week online program aimed at teaching the ins and outs of grassroots organizing warren held a conference call with organizers to kick off students with warren which includes students at high schools community colleges universities and graduate schools this is our moment to dream big fight hard and win warren told the crowd at last week s university of new hampshire town hall she opened her remarks with a nod to young voters blasting a new new hampshire state law backed by republican gov chris sununu that created tougher voting restrictions critics have said it will make it more difficult for out of state collegestudents to vote i want to say something that i know is very controversial in some places in new hampshire like maybe the governor s office i believe in the right of every american citizen to vote including college students in the 2016 democratic primary sanders used a wave of support among youth voters to carry his bidagainst clinton but this time around support among young voters is more split in the primary particularly with warren polling has shown both have pushed socially and economicallyliberalmessages that include eliminating student debt and free college tuition a generational divide dominates democratic voters a new new york times siena college poll of iowa democrats found with more than 85 of voters younger than 30 saying they prefer a candidate promising fundamental change seventy percent of voters older than 65 said they want a candidate who will return washington to normalcy it helps explain the popularity of sanders and warren among young people whose economic populist messages have also raised questions about their electability in a one on one matchup against trump joe calvello a campaign spokesman for the sanders campaign said young people have experienced the failures of the current system he said they are shackled by student debt are on track for a lower standard of living than their parents and know better than anyone how much is at stake in 2020 we need to nominate a candidate for president that will inspire millions upon millions of young people to be engaged in the political process for the first time bernie sanders is the only candidate that will do that marisol samayoa buttigieg s deputy national press secretary said a real crisis faces young people with issues like climate change and voting rights she said that s why young people are responding to buttigieg s platform of structural and generational change young voters are done waiting for washington to act on these issues and pete s the only candidate ready to meet these challenges with the urgency it requires she said a quinnipiac university national poll in october found that 31 of democratic voters ages 18 to 34 support sanders while 30 back warren third among young voters in the poll was buttigieg at 12 biden was at 6 in the 18 34 category tiedwith harris a recent usa today suffolk university national poll found sanders also leading voters ages 18 34with 23 but biden faring much better tied with warren with young voters at19 but the new york times siena college poll painted a troubling picture for biden in iowa includingless support among voters 45 or younger than andrew yang biden whotops his peers significantly in support of people over the age of 65 pushed backwhen asked about his lagging support among youth voters during an interview on 60 minutes some progressive democrats have warned a biden nomination would not excite young people like other candidates would the fact of the matter is if you take a look at who votes in these primaries overwhelmingly people over the age of 50 vote in these primaries biden said in the interview he added that he wants people engaged and voting but criticized proposals such as medicare for all as relying on far reaching assertions that can t deliver true change pete kavanaugh biden sdeputy campaign manager said the campaign is going to compete for every vote and takes youth organizing very seriously are there going to be some variants in polling across ages and demographics kavanaugh said sure but i think we are making very concerted efforts to reach out to younger voters and i think we re beginning to see the fruits of that labor especially when we re able to engage with students in a one on one setting reach joey garrison on twitter joeygarrison reachrebecca morin on twitter rebeccamorin
