not donald trump who s touting the idea even as young americans increasingly question it loading september 1 2016 when hillary clinton spoke in front of a group of veterans on wednesday she invoked a concept that has long shaped how many conservative americans have understood their country and its place within the world if there is one core belief that has guided and inspired me every step of the way it is this the united states is an exceptional nation mrs clinton told those gathered at the american legion s national convention in cincinnati i believe we are still lincoln s last best hope of earth still reagan s shining city on a hill still robert kennedy s great unselfish compassionate country such lofty talk of american exceptionalism has been woven into the nation s dna since the time of the puritans many scholars say the united states many believe is a unique nation with a special perhaps god ordained role to play upon the global stage but within the crosscurrents of this topsy turvy election cycle the roles of the presidential candidates have flipped on wednesday clinton spoke of the value of the american military both to secure american interests abroad and to act as the global force for freedom justice and human dignity meanwhile donald trump has said the assumptions behind american exceptionalism are insulting to the rest of the world i don t like the term he said last year the reversal comes amid a deeper shift within the country itself the rising generation of millennials more often sees american exceptionalism as connected to ideals than to the exertion of its power polls find a new patriotism in american may be rising wrote lynn vavreck in the new york times in the context of this election however clinton s more traditional speech makes perfect sense says mark naison professor of african american studies and history at fordham university in new york she has just spent a month courting republicans potentially alienated by trump after all in general her speech underlined her long held hawkish positions on the use of the american military the united states is not only an exceptional nation she said it is also indispensable nation as a force for good this is not a typical democratic talking point on the left and in most precincts of the democratic party the word is used sneeringly while republicans embrace it enthusiastically says jerald podair professor of history and american studies at lawrence university in appleton wis indeed republicans explicitly trumpet american exceptionalism in their party platform the republican nominee however has expressed the view of many liberals over the years in 2013 after russian president vladimir putin criticized president obama s use of the phrase american exceptionalism mr trump agreed calling it insulting to the rest of the world then in april last year a month before he announced his candidacy trump repeated the critique telling the texas patriots political action committee a tea party group i don t want to say we re exceptional we re more exceptional because essentially we re saying we re more outstanding than you i don t like the term i never liked it when i see these politicians get up and say the american exceptionalism i think you re insulting the world trump s position has hints of the growing generational shift but millennial ideals appear to go deeper on the surface millennials report having fewer traditional notions of patriotism only 15 percent of 18 to 29 year olds describe the us as the greatest country in the world while half of 30 to 64 year olds still make that claim yet as the monitor reported this week on san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick s decision not to stand for the national anthem many millennials see the country s exceptionalism in acts of questioning and through a desire to fix its flaws this includes a vigorous critique of the idea of america as a special nation and a force for good in the world especially by minority thinkers american exceptionalism has its roots in the ideologies and genocidal practices of land conquest from manifest destiny to the occupations of iraq and afghanistan says dylan rodriguez a professor of ethnic studies at the university of california riverside in an email inseparable from the history of us white supremacist thought which includes eugenics and the legal edifices of jim crow apartheid this is an exceptionalism that nurtures a dynamically racist commitment to social darwinism early in his tenure obama drew the ire of conservatives after he casually dismissed a question about american exceptionalism i believe in american exceptionalism just as i suspect that the brits believe in british exceptionalism and the greeks believe in greek exceptionalism he said in 2009 but obama now says he believes in american exceptionalism with every fiber of my being though on new terms that echo millennials america s exceptionalism is rooted in the history of american protests and battles for freedom he says in his speech for the 50th anniversary of the selma to montgomery marches last year obama gave a whitmanesque litany from the hopeful strivers who cross the rio grande because we want our kids to know a better life to the slaves who built the white house and the economy of the south and to the countless laborers who laid rail and raised skyscrapers and organized for workers rights among others that s what it means to love america he said that s what it means to believe in america that s what it means when we say america is exceptional clinton s speech on wednesday offered hints of that vision though specifically as a means of contrasting herself with trump my opponent misses something important she told the veterans when we say america is exceptional it doesn t mean that people from other places don t feel deep national pride just like we do it means that we recognize america s unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress a champion for freedom and opportunity get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox in that way the idea of what makes america great could be a central campaign theme this november says professor naison this vision of the us not only as a beacon of freedom for nations but as a place where oppressed people might want to move to is precisely the vision she wants to juxtapose to donald trump s vision of the us as a walled society cutting back on its global obligations link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight
