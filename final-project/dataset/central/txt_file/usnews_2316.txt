in principle it s probably good for democracy when voters have a wide array of options at polls assuming that is that they have some general sense of who the candidates are at present 24 candidates have declared their candidacy for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination to be precise that figure is actually north of 700 but a mere two dozen have accrued enough attention from pollsters and donors to be considered at least vaguely viable new rules for minimum viability in polling and donors may limit the number of candidates who ever see the podium side of a debate but as of now the field is one person shy of major league baseball s 25 player limit to active rosters for most of the season if you are a devoted baseball fan you can probably rattle off a fair portion of your team s lineup can you do the same for the legions of democratic hopefuls test your knowledge with the following interactive all you have to do is type in the correct spelling of each candidate s last name for trickier spellings we ll notify you if you re close to the right answer to help you out the candidates are organized by the highest office if any that they have held and whether they re currently still serving in that capacity once you ve identified a candidate you can click or tap his or her name for their abbreviated political resume while the republicans had a similarly crowded field in 2016 making room for two dozen hopefuls is a new challenge for democrats who fielded eight candidates in 2008 two of whom are running again this cycle and six in 2016 it is a challenge for the participants as well as they jockey to carve out unique coherent platforms and messages they also have to perpetually remind voters what their name is write to chris wilson at chris wilson time com
