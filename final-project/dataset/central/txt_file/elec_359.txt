cost of living for millions of americans who feel left behind said matt gorman spokesman for the national republican congressional committee we will run on tax reform and win on tax reform in 2018 but republicans have struggled to sell their message to voters an nbc news wall street journal poll conducted this month found that just 24 percent of respondents think the gop s bill is a good idea versus 41 percent who say it s a bad plan while just 22 percent say it will benefit people of all classes versus 63 percent who think it s primarily designed to benefit wealthy americans and corporations those numbers play right into the message from democrats who are warning that millions of middle class americans will see a tax hike while many of those receiving cuts would see the benefits erased in the form of higher health costs this is fairly a big opening the door is open pelosi said most people know that they re not getting any tax break in this bill polls heading into the
