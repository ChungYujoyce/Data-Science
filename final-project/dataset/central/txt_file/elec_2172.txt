 scott horsley gop presidential candidate mitt romney speaks at a campaign rally in bowling green ohio on wednesday j d pooley getty images hide caption president obama s campaign continues to hammer presumptive republican nominee mitt romney over the gop challenger s refusal to release more of his tax returns romney has provided one year s record and promised a second year s worth of returns but even some of his fellow republicans now say that s not enough obama s campaign launched a new tv ad this week shining a spotlight on what is and isn t known about romney s taxes asking what is mitt romney hiding so far romney and his family trusts have released their 2010 tax returns which fill hundreds of pages he got an extension for his 2011 return and has promised to release that as soon as it s ready no later than mid october romney says that should be enough people always want to get more we re putting out what s required plus more he said last week on cnn those are the two years that people will have and that s all that s necessary for people to understand something about my finances retirement account but tax professionals still have plenty of questions for example lee sheppard a contributing editor at the journal tax notes wants to know how romney amassed so much money in his tax deferred retirement account all we know is really that it s a big number and we re a little bit baffled as to how it got so big sheppard says candidates list their assets in broad ranges so we know romney s retirement account is worth somewhere between 21 million and 102 million law professor ed kleinbard of the university of southern california says that s a lot of money considering the most romney could ever contribute to the account was 30 000 a year either gov romney is sort of the modern day equivalent of jack and his magic beans who somehow created a mighty beanstalk or he took a very aggressive position with respect to valuing insider stock kleinbard says kleinbard means that romney might have loaded up his retirement account with assets from his private equity firm bain capital and assigned artificially low values to those assets in order to get around the federal contribution limits if so romney would still have to pay taxes on the real value of the assets when they re withdrawn from the account but in the meantime the money can grow tax free tax notes sheppard says that s an advantage most taxpayers don t have if you happen to work for a partnership and your compensation is arranged this way you get this very beneficial treatment sheppard says romney s campaign didn t respond to npr s questions about his retirement account but his taxes have been dogging the candidate since the gop primary at an nbc debate in january romney argued that there s nothing wrong with minimizing taxes i pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more he said i don t think you want someone as the candidate for president who pays more taxes than he owes role at marriott romney was equally aggressive toward taxes in the business world for years he was a director of marriott international the hotel company founded by willard marriott kleinbard who worked on wall street and served as chief of staff for congress joint committee on taxation says marriott had a reputation marriott was always a tax shelter promoter s first call he says marriott was one of those companies that just loved to buy tax shelters bloomberg reported this year on one marriott tax shelter known as son of boss it involved creating paper losses to offset taxes on real income the internal revenue service challenged the shelter and marriott lost in court judges called the shelter fictitious and a scheme and the company was forced to pay 29 million kleinbard notes that when the shelter was adopted romney was the chairman of marriott s audit committee it s the job of the chair of the audit committee of marriott to say hey wait a minute just because we have an opinion from winkin blinkin and nod saying that this is a terribly clever idea i need to apply some common sense as opposed to just signing on the bottom line kleinbard says a statement from marriott says the company only engages in tax deals it believes are lawful marriott only engages in transactions that we believe are in accordance with the tax code and that we think will create shareholder value it said kleinbard sees a pattern for romney of cutting tax corners asked about his taxes in that nbc debate romney sidestepped the real question is not so much my taxes but the taxes of the american people romney said romney whose 2010 tax rate was less than 14 percent says he wants to overhaul the tax code which he calls far too complex far too intrusive and far too great npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
