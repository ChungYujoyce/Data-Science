six words that s all it took to craft one of the most enduring quotes throughout the career of president george h w bush who died on nov 30 2018 at the age of 94 just eight months after his wife barbara bush read my lips no new taxes spoken by bush during his 1988 run for the presidency the quote helped bush defeat michael dukakis became a cornerstone of his saturday night live persona embodied by dana carvey and also caught him in a political snare at a time of major budget deficits and spending needs bush was as many had predicted unable to get by with cuts alone before his first year in office was complete he had signed into law a stealth budget that while leaving the income tax alone raised various fees and levies in 1990 david letterman was joking that bush s catchphrase should be updated to read my lips i was lying sure enough it was clear that the original promise had to go but how did bush end up making such a promise in the first place in covering george h w bush s january 1989 inauguration time got the backstory had bush honestly said as did dukakis that he would raise taxes only as a last resort the country might have had a genuine debate why didn t he why instead did bush voluntarily saddle himself with a seemingly intractable position roger ailes the media magician who crafted the bush ads that permitted dukakis no quarter was one of the architects of read my lips the point is really pretty simple says ailes at the time the race was close and dukakis had given us an opening by talking about taxes as a last resort now let me tell you the people believe politicians are going to raise their taxes all the polls confirm this so they re interested in figuring out which candidate is really going to do it only as a last resort when a guy like dukakis says what he says no matter how responsible it may be the people take it to mean that he ll raise taxes as a first resort what you have to say to get on top of an issue like taxes is that you d rather see your kids burned in the street than raise them it wasn t the easiest case to make to bush but he understood the stakes we did what we had to do but though the promise itself proved impossible to keep george h w bush s words themselves have had a longevity far beyond their time read the full story on the occasion of bush s 1989 inauguration here in the time vault a new breeze is blowing write to lily rothman at lily rothman time com
