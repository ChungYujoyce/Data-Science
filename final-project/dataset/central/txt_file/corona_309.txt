 may 19 2020 at 3 02 pm by maggie koerth clare malone chadwick matlin and kaleigh rogers filed under coronavirus cwick chadwick matlin deputy editor clare kaleigh and maggie thanks for joining me to talk about the president s medicine cabinet yesterday president trump revealed that he s taking hydroxychloroquine an anti malarial medication to help prevent him from contracting covid 19 trump s comments were the culmination of his interest in the drug which he has hyped for months as a way to help fight the pandemic let s talk about what the science says about hydroxychloroquine what trump has said about it and what it says about trump that he s taking it so let s start with the science which is about the only thing that can ground us in this frenzied moment can hydroxychloroquine prevent someone from getting covid 19 clare malone clare malone senior political writer readers can on their own time imagine what else is in the president s gold plated medicine cabinet maggie maggie koerth senior science writer what we re basically looking at here is a massive lack of evidence for anything chad kaleigh kaleigh rogers science and politics reporter the results from the few studies that have been done are mixed at best some have found hydroxychloroquine reduced the duration of covid 19 others have found no difference between using the drug and not and at least one found there was actually a worse outcome for patients who were on hydroxychloroquine versus those who were not maggie there are ongoing studies of better quality happening i m particularly interested in one that s looking at covid 19 incidence and outcomes in lupus patients who were already taking hydroxychloroquine for their chronic illness but we just don t have evidence to say it does anything kaleigh we do know from past trials of hydroxychloroquine that it can cause abnormal heart rhythms so the president s claim that there s no harm in trying it is not based on evidence this isn t like taking vitamin c cwick and are these all studies that test for whether hydroxychloroquine prevents covid 19 or are they testing whether it improves treatment of the disease kaleigh most trials i ve seen are to treat covid 19 not to prevent it though there is at least one trial currently testing it out for preventive use cwick so trump s decision to take it preventively complicates things further we re in the dearth iest corner of the dearth of evidence maggie you have the science side of things which is mostly proceeding as it ought to and you have the political side which is full of hype and boom or bust demand cwick with that said clare why is trump doing this or maybe the better question why is trump telling us he s doing it clare malone on a personal level trump is likely taking it because of the recent infections of white house staff and because well as we all know he s a germaphobe but i think it s a piece of his public response to the outbreak he attempted in a quite pitched way at first to convince the public that things were not as bad as they were made out to be he promised a non entity of a disease at first and compared it to the flu the idea of taking this drug plays into all that in a more tamped down way because he s offering the public a sort of cure or hope i don t think it s a slip of the tongue but it is a key part of his own thinking about the virus and a key part of how he wants to talk about it in public cwick that s interesting clare one of the defining characteristics of this disease has been its uncertainty that s in part because we haven t known how to treat those who are sick let alone make the rest of us immune trump seems to be saying if a medication is good enough to make the president feel safer it s good enough to make you feel safer maggie i m interested clare in whether we ve seen presidents get so specific in their hope peddling before it seems normal for a president to say oh there s all this research being done and we will have options let s fund them but it feels to me like trump has uniquely used the bully pulpit to tout specific products hydroxychloroquine that abbott laboratories test when there was more than one option out there and it s come back to bite him multiple times because when science is moving fast most of the good ideas are going to fail at first pinning hope on specific brands and products seems like a real risk he s taken on clare malone right chad the president has gotten a ton of flak for his refusal to wear a mask but that s also part of his messaging it s certainly odd that he s taking this drug and not wearing a mask but he s a big believer in the sort of traditional displays of masculine strength that american politicians have thought the public likes to see his no mask thing is the pandemic equivalent of presidential candidates not wearing winter coats while campaigning in iowa in january cwick this isn t about promoting promising research or the latest trial results he is in effect becoming part of the trial himself kaleigh except it s not controlled randomized or blind so his trial is scientifically meaningless i drink coffee every day and haven t gotten covid 19 yet maybe that s a prophylactic too this is the logic of anecdotal evidence maggie so this reminds me of the study i saw about how men were significantly less likely than women to take non pharmaceutical preventive measures in a health crisis like wearing masks but were more likely than women to take pharmaceutical measures kaleigh his announcement that he s taking it certainly felt defiant like he s doubling down in spite of the evidence he also spent some time yesterday criticizing a veterans affairs study which found that patients on hydroxychloroquine actually had a higher risk of death cwick kaleigh your point about the va study is super interesting we ve seen how the president can dismiss news and findings that run counter to the narrative he wants to promote and part of his political struggle during this crisis has been knowing when to embrace the science and when to reject it out of hand by putting his chips in on one drug the drug itself becomes a cause to rally behind and news that disputes its power becomes easier for trump to critique essentially hydroxychloroquine has become part of the white house policy agenda clare malone also if you ve eschewed a lot of the science in your initial stages of your response you might as well bet big on a miracle cure right maybe you ll be right and people will credit with you being early to the party americans do love pharmaceutical solutions to their problems shoutout here to former sen bob dole the og american politician pharmaceuticals spokesman kaleigh it is strange that he got so fixated on this one possible treatment though the antiviral drug remdesivir by contrast actually has some promising early results why is trump so interested in hydroxychloroquine he has scoffed at questions about whether he say owns stock in a company that produces the drug but he also hasn t provided a lot of explanation about why he s so fascinated with it cwick some would have you believe that it might be an issue of cronyism here s the new york times from april some associates of mr trump s have financial interests in the issue sanofi s largest shareholders include fisher asset management the investment company run by ken fisher a major donor to republicans including mr trump a spokesman for mr fisher declined to comment clare malone it s a good question i m a bit skeptical of the stock interests answer since what trump seems to own is quite negligible but to chad s point trump s personal phone line is always known to be open to friends outside the white house in the initial stages of the crisis there s a sense that he was hesitant to trigger portions of the defense production act because of feedback from the chamber of commerce and private industry maggie and meanwhile his political advocacy has pushed for millions to be spent on it supplies acquired by the va and the strategic national stockpile kaleigh one thing is clear when trump touts a treatment interest goes up not only do google searches soar but at least one online prescription service reported a nearly six fold increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine prescriptions after trump first mentioned the drug maggie we know there were people from the anti vaccine movement promoting the so called miracle mineral solution to him a pseudoscience treatment that basically amounts to industrial bleach before he spent that one press conference talking about treating yourself with disinfectant clare malone and we know trump is susceptible to anti vaxxers from earlier in his time in public life maggie i can see why the open phone line thing would work in real estate hot backdoor tips from buddies but that doesn t really work in science clare malone but isn t it more politics masquerading as science which might be the whole problem cwick right it seems like we re all arriving at the same terminus the president has long demonstrated a contrarian approach to science so his taking hydroxychloroquine despite iffy science is as much about the political as it is about the personal kaleigh what is the political motivation to fixate on one drug and also continue to tout it against all current evidence clare malone momentum you ve already been saying it why stop saying it you ll just look more fallible cwick politicians don t like to be wrong maggie this politician in particular really doesn t like to be wrong maybe even more so than others clare malone it s the spin zone y all hop on in it s dark but that s what it is kaleigh right changing your mind based on new and better information is bad in politics for some reason clare malone flip flopping cwick it s considered bad in broader society too clare malone is it that s actually an interesting question cwick i d say that i m reconsidering but then you d think i was weak maggie koerth is a senior science writer for fivethirtyeight maggiekb1 clare malone is a senior political writer for fivethirtyeight claremalone chadwick matlin is a deputy editor at
