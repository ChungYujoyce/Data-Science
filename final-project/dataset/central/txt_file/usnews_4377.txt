acknowledgesit s possible a vaccine for covid 19 may never come the statement came as the united kingdom s government published a detailed 50 page three stage covid 19 recovery plan that launched on wednesday with a partial relaxation ofthe nation s lockdown restrictions johnson said the only feasible long term solution was in a vaccine or a treatment but while the nation hoped for a breakthrough

the disease as of may 11 according to a paper in the journal science a national infection rate for covid 19 in the united states has not yet been determined the scientists models estimate that 65 of the population would need to be immune to establish herd immunity and stop the spread of the disease the researchers concluded population immunity appears insufficient to avoid a second wave if all
