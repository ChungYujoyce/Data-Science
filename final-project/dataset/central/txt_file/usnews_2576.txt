vice president joe biden former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg minnesota sen amy klobuchar vermont sen bernie sanders billionaire executive tom steyer and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren the stage has also grown remarkably less diverse the january democratic debate will be the first of the cycle without a single person of color on stage new jersey senator cory booker and entrepreneur andrew yang hit the debate s donor requirement but didn t quite make the polling threshold the only latino candidate in the field former secretary of housing and urban development juli n castro dropped out of the race on jan 2 and endorsed warren on jan 6 booker one of the few remaining prominent african americans in the field dropped out on monday meanwhile former new york city mayor michael bloomberg had the needed polling numbers but lacked the donors the billionaire has pledged to self fund his campaign a lot has happened around the world in the few weeks since the last debate bushfires in australia have grown to catastrophic levels and at least 66 people have died from devastating flooding in indonesia both disasters are exacerbated by climate change tensions between the united states and iran spiked on jan 3 when the u s assassinated iranian gen qassem soleimani last but not least house speaker nancy pelosi said just hours before the debate that the house plans to vote on wednesday to send the articles of impeachment to the senate opening the door for a senate trial on president donald trump s removal from office senate majority leader mitch mcconnell later said he expects the senate trial to begin next tuesday the smaller debate size will likely give each candidate more time to speak to these current events other crucial democratic topics like healthcare economic inequality and education will almost definitely come up also likely to come up the recent dispute between warren and sanders two progressive candidates and friends who have so far avoided a major feud warren said in a statement monday evening that sanders told her in 2018 that a woman couldn t win the white house publicly confirming reports about the private meeting that emerged earlier in the day sanders has denied he made the comments we re down to the end here that means there s pressure on everybody to try to show off to be smart to point out their opponents weaknesses stuart rothenberg a political analyst and senior editor of inside elections with nathan gonzales tells time but you don t want to go too nasty right at the end here you don t want to look mean spirited that s not midwestern nice here s what to expect from the january democratic debate the debate will take place tonight on the drake university campus in des moines iowa and run from 9 to

president s impeachment trial pelosi said tuesday the house would vote wednesday on house managers and sending the articles of impeachment to the senate and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said he believes he has the votes to start an impeachment trial which he expects will begin next tuesday were a trial to begin every senator would have to return to congress to act as jurors including the three set to appear on stage dnc chairman tom perez addressed this possibility on jan 7 democrats and our senators can walk and chew gum perez told msnbc obviously if there s a trial on the 14th then we ll move the debate if there s not then we re going to have the debate at the moment all systems are go and so we re going to move forward the dnc raised the debate qualifications once again

law specializing in bankruptcy and proposed the original idea for the consumer financial protection bureau in 2007 while still teaching at harvard law school the candidates will stand on stage based on an average of qualifying polls released in january with the highest polling candidates standing in the middle they ll stand in the following order from left to right steyer warren biden sanders buttigieg and klobuchar biden and sanders will be center stage klobuchar s campaign has made it farther than some other candidates who had buzz at the start of the race but have since dropped out such as california sen kamala harris or former texas rep beto o rourke she s also gaining steam in iowa polling at 7 according to readclearpolitics polling average on jan 9 compared to 2 8 nationally she s always had one advantage over the rest of the field and that was the midwestern moderate progressive a midwestern progressive who can appeal to swing voters women voters maybe blue collar working class voters even rothenberg tells time she s also spent a lot of time campaigning in iowa klobuchar has been touring the state for a long time she also touts herself as a neighbor she says she s the senator from next door and that s sort of like literally true mack shelley the chair of the political science department at iowa state university tells time laughing she speaks fluent midwestern and you know basically if you re in northern iowa southern minnesota you really can t tell the difference cory booker and andrew yang each met the donor requirements but didn t quite hit the polling threshold yang who qualified for every previous debate came within striking distance of the poll requirement but fell short in two polls booker announced that he would drop out of the race on monday former new york city mayor michael bloomberg meanwhile hit the polling requirements but not the fundraising threshold the 77 year old billionaire announced he ll self fund his campaign meaning he won t qualify for any of the official dnc debates but that doesn t mean he s off the airways according to the new york times bloomberg has already spent more than 170 million on television and digital advertising four other democratic candidates met none of the requirements colorado sen michael bennet former maryland rep john delaney hawaii rep tulsi gabbard and former massachusetts governor deval patrick former united states secretary of housing and urban development juli n castro the only latino candidate in the field dropped out of the race on jan 2 but he might not be off the trail for long pundits have floated castro s name as a possible vice presidential pick on jan 6 castro announced his endorsement of warren heightening rumors about a possible ticket on friday self help author marianne williamson also dropped out of the race fourteen other candidates have dropped out montana gov steve bullock new york city mayor bill de blasio new york sen kirsten gillibrand former alaska sen mike gravel california sen kamala harris former colorado gov john hickenlooper washington gov jay inslee miramar fla mayor wayne messam massachusetts rep seth moulton former west virginia state senator richard ojeda former texas rep beto o rourke ohio rep tim ryan former pennsylvania rep joe sestak and california rep eric swalwell cnn and the des moines register have announced three moderators cnn political anchor wolf blitzer cnn political correspondent abby phillip and the register s chief political correspondent brianne pfannenstiel all three moderators covered the previous presidential cycle pfannenstiel covered then candidate donald trump and wisconsin gov scott walker in the 2016 iowa caucuses and phillip covered the clinton campaign blitzer who has worked in political journalism for decades moderated two republican debates and one democratic debate tuesday s debate is the last one before nominating contests begin on feb 3 with the iowa caucuses because it s first the result of the caucuses is usually seen as a crucial indicator of the frontrunners in the race since 2000 every democratic presidential nominee has come in first in the iowa caucuses including former president barack obama in 2008 some critics have argued that iowa a state that is over 85 white is not the best forecaster of which candidates can mobilize the democratic party s racially diverse base regardless the caucuses drive attention from the media and powerful donors while the candidates have been campaigning in the state for quite a while not all iowa caucus goers have made up their minds recent polling suggests a majority of people planning to caucus have indicated they could switch candidates iowa state s shelley explains adding the polls show there s still a lot of volatility in iowa there s a long tradition of candidates surging or declining very quickly in the final weeks before the caucus rachel paine caufield a professor of political science at drake university tells time caufield leads the political visitor team on campus and is helping organize the debate she pointed to the 2004 caucuses as an example when then senator john kerry rapidly skyrocketed in the polls in the last few weeks and ultimately won reviving his campaign in iowa we expect to wait a while before we make our decision she says this debate is the last time they ll see the candidates on a national stage before they walk into the caucuses so i expect there s some room for candidates to make a big final impression that could be positive or negative but as inside election s rothenberg points out the candidates will continue to campaign throughout the state in the following weeks so it s not the last time iowa voters will hear from them given recent tensions with iran foreign policy will almost definitely be discussed i can guarantee you that right now each of the candidates is really honing their message on the middle east and on iran and iraq in particular caufield says jaime dominguez a professor of political science at northwestern predicts that sanders will come out swinging at biden for voting for the iraq war and biden in turn will play up his foreign policy experience as vice president because iowa has a large agricultural industry the topic of trade might get more attention than it has in previous debates but caufield says she thinks the debate s location won t have a major impact on what s discussed i think the candidates are going to be aiming their comments at a national audience as well as an iowa audience she explains adding that national questions are the same as the questions raised in iowa town halls concerns about health care economic inequality energy student loans etc the bushfires in australia and flooding in indonesia could also spark a larger discussion around climate change and steyer may take the chance to highlight his environmental advocacy nonprofit nextgen climate now nextgen america and what about impeachment it could come up again given that three of the candidates may have to stop campaigning to participate in the trial but they probably won t linger on the topic i have not heard a lot of talk about impeachment it s not top of mind for a lot of iowa voters caufield shares given that steyer is in the debate and bloomberg and his million dollar ad buys are something of an elephant in the room rothenberg says he wouldn t be surprised if there s a question about money in politics and warren or sanders takes the chance to call out bloomberg by name the bread and butter issue of healthcare will almost definitely come up warren seems to have dialed back her support for medicare for all after taking some hits on that issue kyle kondik the managing editor of political forecaster sabato s crystal ball at the university of virginia center for politics writes in an email warren might try to clarify her stance sanders will likely face more heat than he has in previous debates given his recent surge with polls and donations i think there s a lot of nervousness much like in 2016 about the sanders campaign i think a lot of party regulars are just scared to death of sanders maybe getting the nomination shelley says adding that more moderate candidates like klobuchar buttigieg and biden might have decided they have to go after sanders at this point to try and stem his momentum buttigieg could also face attacks like he did in the december debate given he s doing especially well in iowa polls and don t write off klobuchar i think we should expect her to really really be aiming to make a big splash caufield says she s somebody who s invested heavily in iowa over the past month a lot of people have identified her as a potential surge candidate don t underestimate bernie sanders on jan 2 his campaign released massive fundraising numbers raising more than 34 5 million in the last three months of 2019 millions more than any other candidate without taking any high dollar donations he s steadily risen in iowa polls to be neck in neck with buttigieg and biden and demonstrated staying power both in early states and nationally you can t translate money dollar to dollar for votes the important thing is who can expand their appeal rothenberg explains but that expansion doesn t always happen along ideological lines in the national narrative this is a battle between the progressive wing and the moderate wing and i think on a macro level that is absolutely true caufield says having said that on an individual level i don t think voters are thinking in those terms for example we see a lot of cross over with people who are considering warren and buttigieg or biden and sanders and a lot of could change in the few weeks leading up to the caucuses here s how the candidates in the debate stand in both iowa and national polls according to realclearpolitics polling averages on jan 10 iowa democratic presidential caucus 2020 democratic presidential nomination
