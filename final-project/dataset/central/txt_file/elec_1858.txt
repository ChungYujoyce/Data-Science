coronavirus relief standoff more dampened voter turnout in the fall i hear comments all the time that after what s happened in the first two primaries we only have a 50 50 chance it s not looking good said a democratic senator who requested anonymity to talk about the private concerns of colleagues one of the biggest surprises to lawmakers is the poor performance of biden who has performed well against trump in hypothetical match ups though biden led his democratic rivals in national polls over the past several months he finished in fourth place in the iowa caucuses with 15 percent of the vote and dropped to fifth place in the new hampshire primary with a paltry 8 percent other red flags are trump s resilient approval rating despite months of an impeachment inquiry followed by a weeks long trial and the amount of money his campaign is raising and spending the democratic senator said mounting anxieties are reflective of not just the candidacies but of how trump is raising all this money and how he s really focused they re targeting their people they re going to get their people out the lawmaker added an analysis by the guardian newspaper found that trump spent nearly 20 million on 218 000 facebook ads in 2019 far surpassing the leading democratic candidates that dynamic has only begun to shift recently as former new york city mayor michael bloombergmichael bloombergit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process liberals embrace super pacs they once shunned 7 billion expected to be spent in 2020 campaign despite coronavirus report more has spent more than trump on facebook and instagram ads since jan 1 but bloomberg a billionaire who is self financing his campaign didn t compete in iowa and new hampshire and it remains to be seen if the onetime republican can energize democratic voters bloomberg has only recently emerged as a viable candidate and some democratic senators wonder how well a businessman who amassed tens of billions of dollars through a publishing company catering to wall street clients will play with the base trump has also reported impressive fundraising numbers the republican national committee and the trump campaign said they raised 60 6 million in january and 525 million since january of last year the democratic presidential field and the democratic national committee raised a combined 580 million in 2019 but much of what the candidates have raised has been quickly spent in the battle for the nomination democratic candidates have also had to weather attacks from each other sanders and sen

trump head to head in recent national polls but the president had a small lead over every potential rival except biden in wisconsin a key battleground state according to a marquette poll in december the chief worry among congressional democrats is that if the party doesn t settle on a nominee until the convention in mid july trump will have a substantial organizing advantage you hear everybody talk if we take all that time how are they going to be able to get organized to combat what the president is doing the senator said a second democratic senator confirmed there is broad concern among colleagues over what they see as a difficult path to beating trump and stressed that is why it will be extremely important for everyone to embrace the eventual nominee even if that candidate is viewed by some as too liberal or too moderate it is a concern because we had such a bitter divide four years ago the senator said referring to the misgivings sanders supporters had over clinton winning the nomination the lawmaker noted that the public has gotten used to what democrats and many republicans see as trump s outrageous behavior while the president has racked up a string of recent accomplishments such as the united states mexico canada agreement a truce in the trade war with china and strong employment numbers it s given him a lot to talk about and people have kind of become used to his misbehavior the second senator said i think everyone s very nervous right now and that nervousness is contributing to this sense of whoever wins the nomination we ve got to be there together publicly some democratic lawmakers insist they re feeling optimistic after iowa and new hampshire where sanders a candidate many of them view as less electable than biden tied for first and won outright respectively i love the fact that we had the highest voter turnout i think above 2008 that s very exciting sen debbie stabenowdeborah debbie ann stabenowthe 10 senate seats most likely to

muddled heading into super tuesday on march 3 asked to name the front runner at this point she responded i don t think there is one but she argued that fellow democrats need to calm down as usual we as democrats are always panicked and it s too early to panic she said democratic lawmakers however were dismayed by signs that trump s approval ratings got stronger over the course of the impeachment process which fired up the gop base and failed to register as a priority among independents and swing voters even though a large majority of them agreed with democrats that new witnesses and subpoenas should have been considered at trump s trial the president s approval rating has been trending up since the end of october when democrats had the most political momentum behind their impeachment
