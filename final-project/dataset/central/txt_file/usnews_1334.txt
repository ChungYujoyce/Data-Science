investigate a political rival and his recent attacks on the former vice president every democratic presidential primary candidate has said they support the impeachment inquiry sanders s heart attack on oct 1 could also impact the debate while he ll take the stage in ohio sanders s aides have declined to say when he will be back on the campaign trail full time his recent health issues could make other candidates hesitant to attack him directly american university professor of government james thurber tells time these factors definitely make for abnormal debate conditions thurber adds it s not a regular cycle where you re talking about the economy the economy the economy and then a little bit about healthcare related to the economy he laughs however thurber says the economy will still likely come up for discussion as will the usual democratic issues of health care and immigration the september debate featured a lengthy back and forth on medicare for all and similar arguments could well come up again following the trump administration s recent announcement that it would pull u s troops from northeastern syria which critics argue effectively abandons kurdish allies foreign policy could receive greater air time climate change was also notably absent from the september debate and moderators or candidates might attempt to address the omission by highlighting the topic tuesday

sanctioned debate cnn has hosted this election cycle the network also hosted the second presidential primary debate in july in detroit only cooper has moderated a presidential debate in the past it s been over a decade since the new york times has hosted a debate political analysts tell time that the issue of impeachment will likely come up during the evening at least 225 members of the house of representatives have said they support the impeachment inquiry all democrats except one and all 19 democratic presidential primary candidates have said they support the inquiry trump is only the fourth president in u s history to face impeachment and the moderators will likely feel the need to acknowledge the historic circumstances viewers might also be interested hans noel an associate professor at georgetown university s department of government tells time that anyone who s engaged enough in politics to watch the debates likely has paid attention to what s going on in washington we ll almost certainly hear more about president trump in this debate than we did in the previous debates jennifer victor an associate professor of political science at george mason university s schar school policy and government writes in an email while every candidate supports the impeachment inquiry they vary on the degree to which they ve openly called for the president s impeachment itself let alone removing trump from office gabbard was one of the lone democratic holdouts in congress to oppose the inquiry until she switched her position on sept 27 warren has called for trump s impeachment since april but biden called for trump s impeachment for the first time on wednesday the issue could particularly help steyer who s called for trump s impeachment for years and has poured millions of his own money into a campaign to accomplish just that he might even be the one to bring it up says noel but noel points out that other candidates have also taken strong stances on impeachment including more moderate candidates like amy klobuchar and he suspects viewers will hear a chorus of agreement on the issue kyle kondik the managing editor of political forecaster sabato s crystal ball at the university of virginia center for politics writes in an email that one wild card is whether any of the democrats attempt to attack biden along the same broad lines as president trump has done in recent weeks not trump s specific attacks about connections to ukraine but arguing more broadly about members of biden s family seeming to profit on the former vice president and senator s name there has been no evidence of wrongdoing by biden or his son this is a dangerous path because it could be taken by trump as validation kondik writes b ut biden is also still the leading candidate in the field and all the other candidates have an interest in him falling off martha kropf a professor of political and public administration at university of north carolina charlotte tells time to also watch for how candidates specifically handle the topic of hunter biden who served on the board of ukrainian natural gas company burisma while his father was involved in the obama administration s ukraine policy some candidates have already addressed the issue o rourke told reporters last week i would not allow a family member anyone in my cabinet to have a family member to work in a position like that on sept 29 booker told cnn s jake tapper i just do not think that children of presidents of vice presidents during an administration should be out there doing that although he added that he would be standing firmly in defense of joe biden political analyst stuart rothenberg senior editor of inside elections with nathan gonzales writes in an email that taxes and spending seem to come up in every debate and he d predict at least a foreign policy question or two especially given the trump administration s recent announcement to withdraw troops from northern syria kropf also time in an email that she suspects foreign policy to be huge on top of foreign policy thurber of american university predicts the economy specifically the suppression of wages and quality of life for workers will also likely come up again we ve got an interesting situation where biden s being attacked by the president and bernie has had a serious heart attack thurber says that might affect the dynamics of how other candidates criticize the former vice president and senator because warren has steadily climbed in national and state wide polls noel says there s potential for a direct clash between warren and biden and that sanders might want to reclaim his position as a possible alternative to biden by going after warren rothenberg suggests watching biden since his previous debate performances have been less than ideal adding that buttigieg harris klobuchar and possibly booker could benefit if biden stumbles badly rothenberg also predicts that s omeone and possibly more than one may go after warren now that she is at or near the top of the pack thurber predicts that buttigieg who s polling in the top five with an ideological bent similar to biden s might have conflict with warren or sanders in an attempt to garner more support harris who had an initial spike after she sparred with biden in the first debate has since decreased to fifth in real clear politics national polling average she ll likely attempt to inject another burst of life into her campaign using the october debate this is maybe her last chance to really claw her way into that top group she s right on the edge of it she s been slipping out noel says she probably has the biggest incentive to do something bold noel says that booker and o rourke also need to do something to draw attention to their candidacy anything that they can do to get air time is the goal he explains candidates who have consistently been on the edge of qualifying need to do something to break out he adds or they re going to have a hard time raising money and most of the attention is going to turn to the front runners he said that while it s still very early in the campaign in terms of the invisible primary in terms of the donors and organizing of campaigns and resources it s really quite late he also said some of the lower polling candidates may start thinking of dropping out the two new additions since september gabbard and steyer could also affect the dynamic onstage gabbard criticized harris for her record as a prosecutor in the second debate and may go on the attack once more in an attempt to draw attention to herself she also could highlight her experience as an iraq war veteran during questions on foreign policy while steyer has qualified for the november debate he s relatively new to democratic viewers and will be looking to make a name for himself don t expect this debate to be too different from the last one however when asked about the addition of the two new candidates noel says my guess is while it might be entertaining it probably won t affect things too much the race hasn t changed fundamentally since the september debate rothenberg writes nobody outside the top three has taken off noel tells time that the only real trend he s seen has been the continued rise of warren from a more second tier candidate to neck in neck with biden since the summer she s risen in polls both nationally and in early primary states noel adds that warren s rise has been at the expense of sanders and a little bit of expense of harris thurber also explains that it s way too early for polls to be particularly meaningful at this stage of the election much of what they re measuring is name recognition caveats aside according to realclearpolitics s national polling average on oct 10 the candidates in the debate have the following polling averages write to madeleine carlisle at madeleine carlisle time com
