stacey abrams gave the democrats response to president donald trump s state of the union speech on tuesday night becoming the first african american woman to deliver the speech in her address abrams called the partial government shutdown a stunt engineered by the president of the united states one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values abrams who was featured on the cover of time in july shot to prominence this fall when she narrowly lost the gubernatorial race in georgia a state that has not elected a democrat as governor in 20 years abrams gained national recognition for her talents as a public speaker as a symbol of the democrats push to elect more women and minority candidates in 2018 and for the allegations of minority voter suppression during the close run race while the state of the union rebuttal is sometimes called a curse because the careers of some up and coming politicians have fizzled after delivering it the speech is also a major opportunity for a rising politician to address a massive national audience here is the full transcript of her tuesday night speech good evening my fellow americans i m stacey abrams and i am honored to join the conversation about the state of our union growing up my family went back and forth between lower middle class and working poor yet even when they came home weary and bone tired my parents found a way to show us all who we could be my librarian mother taught us to love learning my father a shipyard worker put in overtime and extra shifts and they made sure we volunteered to help others later they both became united methodist ministers an expression of the faith that guides us these were our family values faith service education and responsibility now we only had one car so sometimes my dad had to hitchhike and walk long stretches during the 30 mile trip home from the shipyards one rainy night mom got worried we piled in the car and went out looking for him and eventually found dad making his way along the road soaked and shivering in his shirtsleeves when he got in the car mom asked if he d left his coat at work he explained he d given it to a homeless man he d met on the highway when we asked why he d given away his only jacket dad turned to us and said i knew when i left that man he d still be alone but i could give him my coat because i knew you were coming for me our power and strength as americans lives in our hard work and our belief in more my family understood firsthand that while success is not guaranteed we live in a nation where opportunity is possible but we do not succeed alone in these united states when times are tough we can persevere because our friends and neighbors will come for us our first responders will come for us it is this mantra this uncommon grace of community that has driven me to become an attorney a small business owner a writer and most recently the democratic nominee for governor of georgia my reason for running for governor was simple i love our country and its promise of opportunity for all and i stand here tonight because i hold fast to my father s credo together we are coming for america for a better america just a few weeks ago i joined volunteers to distribute meals to furloughed federal workers they waited in line for a box of food and a sliver of hope since they hadn t received a paycheck in weeks making their livelihoods a pawn for political games is a disgrace the shutdown was a stunt engineered by the president of the united states one that defied every tenet of fairness and abandoned not just our people but our values for seven years i led the democratic party in the georgia house of representatives i didn t always agree with the republican speaker or governor but i understood that our constituents didn t care about our political parties they cared about their lives so when we had to negotiate criminal justice reform or transportation or foster care improvements the leaders of our state didn t shut down we came together and we kept our word it should be no different in our nation s capital we may come from different sides of the political aisle but our joint commitment to the ideals of this nation cannot be negotiable our most urgent work is to realize americans dreams of today and tomorrow to carve a path to independence and prosperity that can last a lifetime children deserve an excellent education from cradle to career we owe them safe schools and the highest standards regardless of zip code yet this white house responds timidly while first graders practice active shooter drills and the price of higher education grows ever steeper from now on our leaders must be willing to tackle gun safety measures and the crippling effect of educational loans to support educators and invest what is necessary to unleash the power of america s greatest minds in georgia and around the country people are striving for a middle class where a salary truly equals economic security but instead families hopes are being crushed by republican leadership that ignores real life or just doesn t understand it under the current administration far too many hard working americans are falling behind living paycheck to paycheck most without labor unions to protect them from even worse harm the republican tax bill rigged the system against working people rather than bringing back jobs plants are closing layoffs are looming and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living we owe more to the millions of everyday folks who keep our economy running like truck drivers forced to buy their own rigs farmers caught in a trade war small business owners in search of capital and domestic workers serving without labor protections women and men who could thrive if only they had the support and freedom to do so we know bipartisanship could craft a 21st century immigration plan but this administration chooses to cage children and tear families apart compassionate treatment at the border is not the same as open borders president reagan understood this president obama understood this americans understand this and democrats stand ready to effectively secure our ports and borders but we must all embrace that from agriculture to healthcare to entrepreneurship america is made stronger by the presence of immigrants not walls rather than suing to dismantle the affordable care act as republican attorneys general have our leaders must protect the progress we ve made and commit to expanding health care and lowering costs for everyone my father has battled prostate cancer for years to help cover the costs i found myself sinking deeper into debt because while you can defer some payments you can t defer cancer treatment in this great nation americans are skipping blood pressure pills forced to choose between buying medicine or paying rent maternal mortality rates show that mothers especially black mothers risk death to give birth and in 14 states including my home state where a majority want it our leaders refuse to expand medicaid which could save rural hospitals economies and lives we can do so much more take action on climate change defend individual liberties with fair minded judges but none of these ambitions are possible without the bedrock guarantee of our right to vote let s be clear voter suppression is real from making it harder to register and stay on the rolls to moving and closing polling places to rejecting lawful ballots we can no longer ignore these threats to democracy while i acknowledged the results of the 2018 election here in georgia i did not and we cannot accept efforts to undermine our right to vote that s why i started a nonpartisan organization called fair fight to advocate for voting rights this is the next battle for our democracy one where all eligible citizens can have their say about the vision we want for our country we must reject the cynicism that says allowing every eligible vote to be cast and counted is a power grab americans understand that these are the values our brave men and women in uniform and our veterans risk their lives to defend the foundation of our moral leadership around the globe is free and fair elections where voters pick their leaders not where politicians pick their voters in this time of division and crisis we must come together and stand for and with one another america has stumbled time and again on its quest towards justice and equality but with each generation we have revisited our fundamental truths and where we falter we make amends we fought jim crow with the civil rights act and the voting rights act yet we continue to confront racism from our past and in our present which is why we must hold everyone from the very highest offices to our own families accountable for racist words and deeds and call racism what it is wrong america achieved a measure of reproductive justice in roe v wade but we must never forget it is immoral to allow politicians to harm women and families to advance a political agenda we affirmed marriage equality and yet the lgbtq community remains under attack so even as i am very disappointed by the president s approach to our problems i still don t want him to fail but we need him to tell the truth and to respect his duties and the extraordinary diversity that defines america our progress has always found refuge in the basic instinct of the american experiment to do right by our people and with a renewed commitment to social and economic justice we will create a stronger america together because america wins by fighting for our shared values against all enemies foreign and domestic that is who we are and when we do so never wavering the state of our union will always be strong thank you and may god bless the united states of america write to tara law at tara law time com
