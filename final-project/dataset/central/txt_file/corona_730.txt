 mar 20 2020 at 5 01 pm by jay boice filed under coronavirus graphics by anna wiederkehr one of the most pernicious parts of the covid 19 crisis is how uncertain everything is researchers and officials cite statistical models that estimate infection rates death counts and when things will go back to normal but those estimates are changing rapidly and as the forecasts bounce around so do the rest of us living through the crisis how can one feel settled when the future feels so volatile still there s a way to at least get a sense for what the experts are thinking for the past five weeks infectious disease researchers from institutions around the united states have been taking a survey that gathers their thoughts on the trajectory of the covid 19 virus the researchers come from academia government and industry and are experts in modeling the spread of viruses like this one the survey asks about things like how many people will eventually get covid 19 and how many americans will die the top line numbers are sobering the most recent survey taken on march 16 and 17 found that as a group the experts think that as of march 15 only 12 percent of infections in the u s had been reported by the centers for disease control and prevention they think there s a 73 percent chance of a second wave of hospitalizations this fall and they expect approximately 200 000 deaths in the u s by the end of the year but averages can only tell you so much when forecasting the future it also matters what a person or model thinks the range of possibilities could be how uncertain the forecast is in other words in this survey the experts gave three answers to most questions representing the most likely future scenario and the best case and worst case scenarios collecting responses in this form captures both the best guess estimate from each respondent and the uncertainty surrounding it it also lets the people in charge of the survey thomas mcandrew and nicholas reich both biostatisticians at the university of massachusetts amherst convert the responses to a probabilistic consensus forecast 1 something that can answer questions like according to these researchers what is the probability that we will have 50 000 reported cases by march 29 expert consensus forecasts give you what a model does a forecast that gives a measure of its uncertainty without being overly reliant on just one way of thinking about a problem in this instance each expert has their own assumptions about how likely the virus is to spread or to be fatal as well as assumptions about the ways humans might try to mitigate its damage here s what the researchers collectively had to say in the march 16 17 survey at the time the survey was in the field about 3 500 cases had been reported but the experts estimated that by sunday march 29 a little under two weeks after they took the survey the country would have seen anywhere from 10 000 to 75 000 cases the current count is 15 219 the experts confidence in those estimates however varied greatly andrew lover an epidemiologist from the university of massachusetts who took the survey said his estimates were semi quantitative and based on the virus s progression in other countries the doubling times have been 5 8 days most places so it s a matter of applying that with some sliding scale adjustments testing rates population density etc based on the feel of the epidemic curves the consensus forecast generated by the individual responses indicates that we should expect roughly 19 000 reported cases by march 29 with an 80 percent chance of seeing between 10 500 and 81 500 cases experts estimated that on march 15 when the cdc had publicly identified about 3 500 cases only between 5 percent and 40 percent of actual covid 19 cases had been reported but experts confidence in those numbers was shaky the consensus model indicates that only 12 percent of cases had been reported at that time in other words the researchers think there were actually about 29 000 infections in the u s as of march 15 more than eight times the known tally just as flu season can have two peaks the surveyed experts think there s a good chance there will be a second wave of coronavirus related hospitalizations sometime between august and december individual estimates for the likelihood of that second round of cases ranged from 40 percent to 96 percent with an expert consensus of a 73 percent chance experts estimates of the number of covid 19 deaths in the u s in 2020 ranged from 4 000 all the way to 1 million a huge range that highlights how much we still don t know about this disease the expert consensus is to expect about 200 000 deaths in the u s from covid 19 this year but the uncertainty around that number is also huge there s an 80 percent chance the final number will be between 19 000 and 1 2 million according to these estimates the researchers plan to continue conducting these weekly surveys as some elements of the pandemic become clearer such as the virus s incubation period and fatality rate and how far the u s is willing to go to slow the spread of the virus these ranges will presumably narrow but for now there s a lot the experts still aren t certain of just like the rest of us for the stats savvy among us each response triplet is converted to a triangular distribution and the consensus forecast is an equally weighted average of these triangular distributions jay boice is a computational journalist for fivethirtyeight jayboice filed under coronavirus 174 posts covid 19 149 expert forecasts 8 see all
