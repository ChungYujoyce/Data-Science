president donald trump delivered a speech to the united nations general assembly on tuesday in which he touted his administration s accomplishments spoke about the importance of american sovereignty and patriotism and criticized the ideology of globalism among many other things america is governed by americans we reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism trump said around the world responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance but also from other new forms of coercion and domination here are the countries institutions and concepts that trump criticized during his speech each of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture a rich history and a people bound together by ties of memory tradition and the values that make our homelands like nowhere else on earth that is why america will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance control and domination america is governed by americans we reject the ideology of globalism and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism around the world responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty not just from global governance but also from other new forms of coercion and domination thanks to the united states military and our partnership with many of your nations i am pleased to report that the bloodthirsty killers known as isis have been driven out from the territory they once held in iraq and syria we will continue to work with friends and allies to deny radical islamic terrorists any funding territory or support or any means of infiltrating our borders the ongoing tragedy in syria is heartbreaking our shared goals must be the de escalation of military conflict along with a political solution that honors the will of the syrian people in this vein we urge the united nations led peace process be reinvigorated but rest assured the united states will respond if chemical weapons are deployed by the assad regime i commend the people of jordan and other neighboring countries for hosting refugees from this very brutal civil war every solution to the humanitarian crisis in syria must also include a strategy to address the brutal regime that has fueled and financed it the corrupt dictatorship in iran iran s leaders sow chaos death and destruction they do not respect their neighbors or borders or the sovereign rights of nations instead iran s leaders plunder the nation s resources to enrich themselves and to spread mayhem across the middle east and far beyond the iranian people are rightly outraged that their leaders have embezzled billions of dollars from iran s treasury seized valuable portions of the economy and looted the people s religious endowments all to line their own pockets and send their proxies to wage war not good the iran deal was a windfall for iran s leaders in the years since the deal was reached iran s military budget grew nearly 40 percent the dictatorship used the funds to build nuclear capable missiles increase internal repression finance terrorism and fund havoc and slaughter in syria and yemen the united states has launched a campaign of economic pressure to deny the regime the funds it needs to advance its bloody agenda last month we began re imposing hard hitting nuclear sanctions that had been lifted under the iran deal additional sanctions will resume november 5th and more will follow and we re working with countries that import iranian crude oil to cut their purchases substantially we cannot allow the world s leading sponsor of terrorism to possess the planet s most dangerous weapons we cannot allow a regime that chants death to america and that threatens israel with annihilation to possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead to any city on earth just can t do it america s policy of principled realism means we will not be held hostage to old dogmas discredited ideologies and so called experts who have been proven wrong over the years time and time again this is true not only in matters of peace but in matters of prosperity we believe that trade must be fair and reciprocal the united states will not be taken advantage of any longer for decades the united states opened its economy the largest by far on earth with few conditions we allowed foreign goods from all over the world to flow freely across our borders yet other countries did not grant us fair and reciprocal access to their markets in return even worse some countries abused their openness to dump their products subsidize their goods target our industries and manipulate their currencies to gain unfair advantage over our country as a result our trade deficit ballooned to nearly 800 billion a year for this reason we are systematically renegotiating broken and bad trade deals the united states lost over 3 million manufacturing jobs nearly a quarter of all steel jobs and 60 000 factories after china joined the wto and we have racked up 13 trillion in trade deficits over the last two decades but those days are over we will no longer tolerate such abuse we will not allow our workers to be victimized our companies to be cheated and our wealth to be plundered and transferred america will never apologize for protecting its citizens the united states has just announced tariffs on another 200 billion in chinese made goods for a total so far of 250 billion i have great respect and affection for my friend president xi but i have made clear our trade imbalance is just not acceptable china s market distortions and the way they deal cannot be tolerated i spoke before this body last year and warned that the u n human rights council had become a grave embarrassment to this institution shielding egregious human rights abusers while bashing america and its many friends our ambassador to the united nations nikki haley laid out a clear agenda for reform but despite reported and repeated warnings no action at all was taken so the united states took the only responsible course we withdrew from the human rights council and we will not return until real reform is enacted the united states will provide no support in recognition to the international criminal court as far as america is concerned the icc has no jurisdiction no legitimacy and no authority the icc claims near universal jurisdiction over the citizens of every country violating all principles of justice fairness and due process we will never surrender america s sovereignty to an unelected unaccountable global bureaucracy opec and opec nations are as usual ripping off the rest of the world and i don t like it nobody should like it we defend many of these nations for nothing and then they take advantage of us by giving us high oil prices not good we want them to stop raising prices we want them to start lowering prices and they must contribute substantially to military protection from now on we are not going to put up with it these horrible prices much longer the united states is also working with partners in latin america to confront threats to sovereignty from uncontrolled migration tolerance for human struggling and human smuggling and trafficking is not humane it s a horrible thing that s going on at levels that nobody has ever seen before it s very very cruel illegal immigration funds criminal networks ruthless gangs and the flow of deadly drugs illegal immigration exploits vulnerable populations hurts hardworking citizens and has produced a vicious cycle of crime violence and poverty only by upholding national borders destroying criminal gangs can we break this cycle and establish a real foundation for prosperity we recognize the right of every nation in this room to set its own immigration policy in accordance with its national interests just as we ask other countries to respect our own right to do the same which we are doing that is one reason the united states will not participate in the new global compact on migration migration should not be governed by an international body unaccountable to our own citizens currently we are witnessing a human tragedy as an example in venezuela more than 2 million people have fled the anguish inflicted by the socialist maduro regime and its cuban sponsors not long ago venezuela was one of the richest countries on earth today socialism has bankrupted the oil rich nation and driven its people into abject poverty we ask the nations gathered here to join us in calling for the restoration of democracy in venezuela today we are announcing additional sanctions against the repressive regime targeting maduro s inner circle and close advisors virtually everywhere socialism or communism has been tried it has produced suffering corruption and decay socialism s thirst for power leads to expansion incursion and oppression all nations of the world should resist socialism and the misery that it brings to everyone write to katie reilly at katie
