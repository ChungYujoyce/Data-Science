to interfere in a number of elections in democracies mike pompeo now secretary of state asserted there is agreement among intelligence officials that russian meddling took place during remarks he made while he was still cia director in june of 2017 i am confident that the russians meddled in this election as is the entire intelligence community pompeo said this threat is real bolton trump s national security adviser has also indicated he believes russians interfered in the election and said putin probably knew about it bolton told abc s jonathan karl that he found it hard to believe putin didn t know about russian military intelligence officials efforts to interfere in the elections bolton said putin made it plain that he said the russian state was not involved when the pair met in moscow ahead of the trump putin summit putin was very clear with his translator that state was the word that he wanted bolton said during a press conference in february of this year press secretary sarah sanders acknowledged russian involvement but denied it had any impact on election results it s very clear that russia meddled in the election it s also very clear russia didn t have an impact on the election sanders said at the briefing and it s also very clear that the trump campaign didn t collude with the russians in any way for this process to take place write to abby vesoulis at abby
