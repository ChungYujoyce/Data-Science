terry mcauliffe d in what has become the only competitive statewide race of the year northam s win gives democrats their first major victory since president trump took office after a string of high profile special election defeats in gop districts earlier this year it was said that the eyes of the nation are now on the commonwealth today virginia has told us to end the divisiveness that we will not condone hatred and bigotry and to end the politics that have torn this country apart northam said during his victory speech to a packed room of supporters at george mason university in fairfax northam exceeded expectations in the race building up huge vote leads in democratic areas while competing well against gillespie in republican ones the resounding victory could help smooth over disputes within the party as well as concerns about whether democratic national committee chairman tom perezthomas edward perezclinton s top five vice presidential picks government social programs triumph of hope over evidence labor s wasteful spending and mismanagement at workers comp more is preparing the party for the 2018 midterms and capitalizing on anti trump sentiment as democrats celebrated trump rushed to distance himself from gillespie writing from south korea trump blasted gillespie in a tweet shortly after the race was called ed gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what i stand for don t forget republicans won 4 out of 4 house seats and with the economy doing record numbers we will continue to win even bigger than before trump wrote gillespie sought to strike a unifying tone in his concession speech offering his services in making our commonwealth better and congratulating thevictoriousdemocratic statewide ticket northam a former army physician and pediatric neurologist went into the general election with a consistent single digit lead in a state that has been shifting more to the left democrats have won every statewide race in virginia since 2009 including the 2016 presidential race in which trump lost the state by 5 points trump s underwater approval rating in virginia also added to the better political environment for democrats but northam s lead started to deteriorate in the final month of the race when the tone started to shift gillespie kept his distance from trump but adopted his campaign playbook and focused on identity politics and hot button issues like immigration that helped tighten the race gillespie a former chairman of the republican national committee ran ads about his support for protecting confederate monuments in the wake of violent clashes over a white nationalist rally in charlottesville he also knocked northam over so called sanctuary cities arguing that his position helped pave the way for violence by the ms 13 gang northam called gillespie s campaign divisive and fear mongering and countered with ads seeking to link him to trump particularly in northern virginia but the virginia democrat also had his own stumbles in the closing week of the campaign northam took heat after an outside democratic group latino victory fund ran an ad that featured a truck sporting a confederate flag and gillespie bumper sticker chasing minority children down the street northam also faced backlash within his own party after he said that he d sign a bill to ban sanctuary cities if one came to his desk northam s victory helps democrats avoid an embarrassing blow going into the pivotal 2018 midterms they ll point to the governor s race as evidence that they can win elections in the trump era as well as effectively campaign against the president in blue leaning states it also shows republicans are still figuring out how much distance they need to keep from trump gillespie never asked trump to come down to virginia to campaign with him and only got several tweets and a last minute robocall from the president the decision to never fully embrace trump or denounce him likely hurt gillespie with conservative base voters as well as more moderate voters who remain opposed to the president northam s large margin of victory about 9 points by late tuesday night also calls into question the roadmap for future republican campaigns running in blue or swing areas rep scott taylor the virginia republican who represents the military heavy area around norfolk argued that the race was a clear referendum on the administration and divisive rhetoric by the president if we lose the house of delegates as republicans we really lose a firewall against democrat governing taylor told a small group of reporters at the gillespie election night party if that happens tonight then again this is where my profound disagreement comes in with the president s tweet there has to be some self reflection at the top and how that s spilling over in the down ballot view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the contents of this site
