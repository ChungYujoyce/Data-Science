the alarm urging americans to heed what federal state and local officials are asking of them in order to curtail the spread and dampen the impact of the virus on the u s population although it s too early to draw definitive conclusions about which countries will ultimately weather thecovid 19storm best public health data shows that nations that are so far faring wellat suppressing the outbreak s spread have done so through this combination easy access to testing rigorous contact tracing clear and consistent science based messaging and a commitment to studiously abideby quarantines

behind new york when you re on an exponential curve every moment is dangerous said francis collins the director of the national institutes of health in an interview this is a particularly critical moment for us totry to bring all the resources and determination of government and the american people to try to get off of it outside of china territories city states and countriesin asia such as taiwan singapore hong kong and japan appear to be making the most progress but experts saythat u s comparisons to theexperiences of other countries are not clear cut for a variety of reasons including population size differentmedical systems america s geographicexpanse and hard to account for cultural reasons coronavirus these countries are doing the best and worst jobs fighting it u s officials are monitoring what is playing out in other countries particularly italy where rates of transmission and deaths in its northern regions have been so catastrophicthat theitalian college of anesthesia analgesia resuscitation and intensive care recentlydrewup guidelines for doctors about how to manage the crisis if the outbreak intensifies among the considerations discussed prioritizing treatment

deborah birx the white housecoronavirus task force response coordinator during abriefing wednesday for most people the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough but for older adults especially thosewith pre existing health conditions it can cause much more severe illness including pneumonia the centers for disease control and prevention sworst case scenariois that about 160 million to 210 million americans will be infected by december under this forecast 21 million people would need hospitalization and 200 000 to 1 7 millioncould die by the end of the year the extent to which we can prevent direct and excess deaths depends on how quickly we can flatten the outbreak mobilize health services and for how long we can prevent a relapse said robert muggah founder and director of the brazil based security think tank igarape institute and a leading expert on risk who studies pandemics coronavirus crisis trump invokes wartime authority of defense production act estimates vary but most public health experts believe that the u s is between one and two weeks behind what has befallen italy where a near total lockdown has been imposed on 60 million citizens with only supermarkets and drug stores open to the public as of wednesday there have been more than 31 500cases and 2 500 deaths italian authorities began enforcing their lockdown on march 12 some 18 days after the point where community transmission defined as more than 100 cases had taken hold according to world health organization data analyzed by usa today it s too early to say whether restrictions in italy and similar ones in spain areworking collins said that if the u s takes measures that many americans might find overly drastic we should certainly be able to blunt the u s curve but let s be clear there s going to be a very rough road ahead of us over the next weeks and months in the u s 115people have died amidmore than 7 300confirmed cases as of wednesday according to johns hopkins university sdata dashboard there has been no federally mandated lockdown in the u s and access to testing has been sporadic although president donald trump has urged americans to refrain from gathering in groups of more than 10 people san francisco on monday became the first u s city to order its residents to stay home over the coronavirus outbreak in china where covid 19 originated the outbreak followed a pattern similar to italy s the country initially saw an exponential rise in infections beijing ordered a complete lockdown in wuhan and other cities in hubei province on jan 23 about halfway into the first 25 days of reported community transmission yet after authoritiesembarked on one of the largest mass mobilization efforts in history closing all schools forcing millions of people inside quickly building more than a dozen vast temporary hospitals and meticulously testing and tracing anyone who may have encountered the virus beijing has appeared to all but eradicate new cases wednesday china s national health commission reportedjust one new case in wuhan for a second consecutive day and the country has slowly started to re open schools and workplaces in some areas its death toll stands at 3 200 with over 81 000 infections no one knows whethera second wave of infections will occur amid the easingrestrictions in south korea which has arobustscreening program with more than 200 000 people tested about one in every 250 people testing is fast about 10 minutes and free the government pays and the results are usually sent by text within 24 hours it was the first countryto roll out a drive through testing center and has a well functioning virus contact tracing system it hit 100 cases on feb 20 but unlike china italy and other european countries itmanaged early on to flattenthe curve or spreadout the number of its coronavirus cases over a longer period so that its health systemcan have time to mitigate the outbreak s impact according to the world health organization data as of wednesday south korea had 8 413 coronavirus cases including 84 deaths with the exception of japan no other country has been able to so successfully flatten a large number of cases so quickly according to usa today s analysis it s not immediately clear why but michael merson director of the singhealth duke nus global health instituteand the wolfgang joklik professor of global health at duke university said that places in asia such as south korea taiwan hong kong japan and singapore which has seen about 315 cases but no deaths as of wednesday enjoy public health factorsthat are difficult for countries like the u s with its fractured system to replicate there s strong government leadership but also trust in the government merson said every time a case is identified there is a very strong action plan to identify contacts it s also very good at promoting hand washing and keeping people at a safe distance from one another he said adding that singaporehas allowed businesses anduniversities to stay open but with strict guidelines about the size of gatherings 25 or under they take prudent steps at prevention but they haven t entirely shut the country
