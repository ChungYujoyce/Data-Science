a month after senator kamala harris caught former vice president joe biden flat flooted with her criticism of his record on racial issues the two will share the stage again wednesday night in detroit but the dynamic for the re match may be very different at the first democratic debate in miami biden was leery of swiping back at harris lest he come off as condescending sexist or racist according to four advisers this time those advisers say biden has personally signed off on a more aggressive posture biden has has been studying dossiers about harris record as a prosecutor and california attorney general an area that went largely untouched during their first debate advisers tell time then senator biden passed the crime bill in 1994 then a g harris used the crime bill as recently as two years ago one biden adviser said telegraphing a line of attack already he has criticized harris health care plan as well as the criminal justice record of senator cory booker of new jersey another african american candidate who will be itching to land a punch at biden wednesday night in detroit the setting raises the stakes detroit is a majority black city and the largest in a state president trump won by a little over 10 000 votes which helped him cinch the 2016 election the debate comes as trump continues his feuds with a clique of congresswomen of color the powerful point man on oversight rep elijiah cummings of maryland and baltimore another majority black city when biden harris and booker spar over issues like forced busing sentencing policy and school integration trump s racist tweets will be the backdrop biden has appeared to find his footing after a rocky first debate heading into miami he was the top pick for 30 of likely democratic voters according to quinnipiac university polling coming out he slipped to 22 as harris bounced from 7 to 20 the harris surge though seems to have slowed biden is up to 34 and harris has settled back to 12 clustered with senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders the first debate set biden s campaign back on its heels forcing him to fend off an onslaught of criticism over his policies on race and women harris attacks in particular left him personally wounded advisers say she was friends with beau biden told friends invoking his late son and former delaware attorney general to friends after harris barbs she knows i m not a racist as biden marshals his arguments harris is taking the stage in a defensive crouch earlier this week she released a plan that attempts to address the liberal base s clamor for medicare for all without the vast restructuring of sanders or warren s plans her medicare for all plan would provide a 10 year phase in period for medicare and lets private insurers offer plans that follow certain requirements the plan drew attacks from both moderates and progressives biden s campaign pointed out harris past support of sanders original medicare for all legislation and called it a bernie sanders lite medicare for all plan meanwhile sanders campaign manager faiz shakir argued that you can call it anything you want but you can t call this plan medicare for all health care has been an issue harris has stumbled over from the offset after publicly announcing support for eliminating private insurance then walking back from that position meanwhile booker who missed the harris biden showdown in the last debate has signaled that he s prepared to fight too first he called biden out for comments about his past work with segregationist lawmakers and other language around race then last week he called biden the architect of mass incarceration for supporting the 1994 crime bill that implemented mandatory minimums that disproportionally affected the black community you created this system he tweeted in what was clearly a swipe at biden we ll dismantle it booker has made criminal justice reform his signature issue his bipartisan first steps act was signed into law in december and his campaign s criminal justice platform is among the most far reaching in the field with plans to decriminalize marijuana grant clemency to nonviolent drug offenders and help people incarcerated in the war on drugs re enter society the debate will unfold against a backdrop of a democratic primary in which anti racism has become a top tier political issue the democratic candidates are jostling to position themselves as the antidote to trump s racist tweets meanwhile the party itself is working to address racial inclusion within its ranks criticism from some democrats about insufficient diversity at house democrats campaign arm forced a staff shake up this week and its chief rep cheri bustos into sensitivity training according to one aide 48 of the committee s senior staffers were racial minorities before this week while 42 of all staffers were racial minorities and 55 of all staffers were female critics said those figures were insufficient write to charlotte alter at charlotte
