available we ll essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner he said anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases also spoke at the news conference and offered a more specific time frame for efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine he said it will take about two months to determine whether a vaccine is safe through a small study in humans that would be followed another sixto eightmonths to conduct a larger comprehensive medical study to gauge whether the vaccine works during a feb 17 meeting with usa today s editorial board meeting fauci said it would take at least one year to 18 months to make a vaccine that is safe and effective and ready to distribute the solution to the containment of this current outbreak will not be a vaccine fauci said still fauci said the vaccine will be important and would be useful if covid 19 returns next year as a seasonal respiratory virus several drugmakers are working to develop

experimental drug was also used on a suburban seattle man who became the nation s first coronavirus patient johns hopkins they did a study a comprehensive the countries best and worst prepared for an

initiative with research by the economist intelligence unit the report evaluated the health security capabilities of 195 countries while the u s ranked no 1 overall the report found that not a single country in the world is fully prepared to handle an epidemic or pandemic the united states scored in the bottom tier of countries for access to health care owing to lack of governmentally guaranteed access to healthcare plus high out of pocket expenditures per capita the report said the latest first coronavirus patient with unknown origin in the us wasn t tested for days vice president mike pence

look at indiana he said they ve established a great health care in indiana a lot of other states have looked to they wanted to change their health care systems in 2015 indiana implemented sweeping changes to the state s medicaid insurance program requiring low income adults to pay monthly premiums to maintain their health insurance coverage the reforms were spearheaded by pence and then health policy consultant seema verma who now oversees the centers for medicare and medicaid services republican governors in states including kentucky and arizona also sought federal approval for similar restrictions arguing such incentives encouraged able bodied adults to seek employment and helped curb unnecessary health spending but critics said such restrictions were unnecessarily punitive and put vulnerable people at risk of losing their health coverage in october facing a federal lawsuit challenging the state s work requirement indiana said it would postpone eliminating medicaid benefits for those who failed to meet the work requirement also during pence s tenure a small town in indiana became the center of an hiv epidemic tied to people injecting drugs in all 235 people became infected
