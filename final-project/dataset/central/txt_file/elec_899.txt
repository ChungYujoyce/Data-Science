 barbara bradley hagerty as americans go to the polls one of the closest presidential races in years may be determined by a state in the midwest and a hurricane named sandy after a campaign that has cost some 6 billion the two candidates are in the same place they started with president obama a smidgen ahead of challenger mitt romney so close that differences are in most cases statistically insignificant obama seems to have regained his footing after his sleepy performance in the first debate last month according to a pew research center poll over the weekend obama is leading romney 48 percent to 45 percent among likely voters thanks in part to how he handled the aftermath of hurricane sandy in battleground states too the president appears to have the momentum supporters attend a mitt romney rally monday in columbus ohio emmanuel dunand afp getty images hide caption supporters attend a mitt romney rally monday in columbus ohio and yet pew research center president andrew kohut is bracing for a surprise people are conflicted especially swing voters and moderate voters kohut says they look at obama and say he s underperformed and they look at romney and say we don t trust him and we don t know if he s for us in one way the conflict is refreshing says larry sabato director of the university of virginia s center for politics the two candidates are presenting diametrically opposed visions and that is interesting because often it isn t the case you have two very different visions on the economy on social issues on some aspects of foreign policy one thing everyone agrees on the fate of the presidency will be determined by a handful of battleground states and perhaps only one ohio the president has the advantage because there are several routes that would lead him to the 270 electoral college votes he needs to win says lee miringoff director of the marist college institute for public opinion which conducts polls for nbc and the wall street journal romney the former massachusetts governor starts from a weaker position in the projected electoral vote count and must win more battleground states so in a sense romney is playing more for an inside straight miringoff says the battleground states florida 29 electoral votes real clear politics average romney up 1 5 percentage points florida is a must win for romney the state has three political identities the south including miami is diverse and with the exception of an aging and shrinking cuban population leans heavily democratic the north including the panhandle is socially and religiously conservative with a strong military presence people in the central part of the state the tampa orlando daytona beach i 4 corridor are the definition of swing voters ohio 18 electoral votes real clear politics average obama up by 2 9 percentage points ohio may be in 2012 what florida was in 2000 the most contested of the states here we have two strains of working class voters with opposite motivations in the north the auto industry bailout has driven the unemployment rate below the national average and voters are rewarding the president the southern part of the state is more socially and religiously conservative it has been hard hit economically particularly the coal industry and workers lean republican watch for a fight over ballots in this state ohio law requires a recount if one candidate wins by a quarter of 1 percent or less which is a possibility moreover more than 200 000 voters are expected to cast provisional ballots because they don t have a photo id or for other reasons and those votes would not be counted until nov 16 virginia 13 electoral votes real clear politics average obama up by 0 3 percentage points the fight here is between fast growing northern virginia a suburb of washington d c with its young urbanites who vote democratic versus the rest of the state rural pro gun conservatives obama won this historically republican state in 2008 but republicans came roaring back in subsequent races virginia is critical to a romney win wisconsin 10 electoral votes real clear politics average obama up by 4 2 percentage points romney wants to make this a battleground state but it is an uphill fight wisconsin has not voted for a republican presidential candidate since 1984 romney briefly had some traction when he selected a favorite son paul ryan to be his running mate however that enthusiasm has ebbed and wisconsin was one of the few states that did not give romney a bump after the first presidential debate in october colorado 9 electoral votes real clear politics average obama up by 1 5 percentage points obama carried colorado by 9 percentage points in 2008 but in the preceding three elections the state went red three ingredients make colorado a swing state the urban areas of denver and boulder are typically democratic the growing latino population favors obama but the colorado springs area is considered the mecca for conservative evangelicals iowa 6 electoral votes real clear politics average obama up by 2 4 percentage points since 1998 iowa has voted for the democrat with the exception of george w bush in 2004 obama can count on its growing latino vote and strong unions for support but iowa has turned more conservative of late and elected republican terry branstad as governor in 2010 new hampshire 4 electoral votes real clear politics average obama up by 2 percentage points ages ago new hampshire was a reliably red state but it has turned decidedly purple in recent years the white house has paid close attention to the state sending vice president joe biden there several times but romney has a foothold there as well as a vacation house the voters have an independent streak and generally dislike government intrusion a sentiment that romney has capitalized on ups and downs if the presidential race has people on pins and needles it wasn t that way six months ago democrats said they were disappointed with obama s performance smarting from the desultory economy and frustrated that he seemed to have forgotten the poor in favor of the middle class republicans too were tepid about their candidate in fact until springtime evangelicals who make up a large part of the republican base flirted with a number of candidates whose chief characteristic seemed to be that they were not mitt romney but the past two months have turned into a roller coaster ride sabato says each candidate made strategic errors supporters listen to president obama at a campaign rally monday in columbus ohio jewel samad afp getty images hide caption supporters listen to president obama at a campaign rally monday in columbus ohio the first bit of excitement arrived in mid september in the form of a leaked tape of romney saying that 47 percent of americans will vote for the president no matter what are dependent upon government who believe they are victims and do not pay taxes but then two weeks later obama stumbled throughout the first debate the president looked like a boxer on the ropes taking blows from an aggressive romney he even failed to land a punch on romney with an attack on romney s 47 percent comment this erased the president s yawning lead in the polls and we had a horse race before the first debate president obama was on his way to a landslide re election victory says thomas riehl a senior vice president of yougov an online polling firm but after the debate not only were obama supporters deflated but independents and undecided voters took a hard look at romney and liked what they saw what romney accomplished in the first debate was that he stood up on a stage with president obama and made it clear he was at least his equal riehl says you could imagine a romney presidency and there wasn t much that was very threatening about that for the first time more people told pollsters they would vote for romney and not just against obama according to polls by pew research 36 percent of likely voters said they had a better opinion of romney after the debate and his favorability rating shot up to 50 percent about the same as the president but romney s good fortunes were arrested by the weather hurricane sandy served as a circuit breaker that cut into whatever momentum romney had generated this was kind of an october surprise says alan abramowitz a political scientist at emory university it gave the president an opportunity to act presidential to act like a commander in chief as obama visited devastated parts of new jersey and new york as he received glowing praise from new jersey republican gov chris christie and then an endorsement from new york mayor michael bloomberg romney was forced to the sidelines at least temporarily those television shots of the president impressed voters the pew poll found that nearly seven in 10 likely voters and 63 percent of swing voters approved of the way the president handled the disaster how the vote falls in the final moments of the race each candidate has advantages and disadvantages that could tip the scale romney has a clear edge among men especially white working class men who make up much of the vote in battleground states such as ohio and wisconsin he s leading among older voters who are bigger in number and more reliable than the young people who overwhelmingly support the president independents are expected to break republican as they have in every presidential race since 1952 with the exception of 1964 and 2008 when obama swept them in a wave of hope and change finally romney has generated great enthusiasm among republicans romney supporters are more engaged in the contest and say they are more likely to vote than obama supporters this could mean a larger turnout for romney on tuesday night the president however has plenty of arrows in his quiver as to enthusiasm many more voters strongly support obama than romney an indicator that has predicted the popular vote winner in nine of the past 12 elections says kohut moreover after cooling to the president last month female voters have come roaring back to the president s side minorities and especially latinos who factor large in swing states such as florida colorado and nevada are firmly in the president s camp as are young people undecided voters remain a big question mark republicans hope that 2012 will look like 1980 when undecideds moved en masse in ronald reagan s direction but from what we ve seen this time around there isn t that big chunk of undecided voters almost anywhere to be able to make that massive move at the end says dennis goldford a political scientist at drake university on the other hand if the election is really close even a feather on the scale can make a difference close elections the new normal abramowitz at emory university has developed a model for predicting elections which he calls the time for change model he looks at presidential approval ratings and gdp in june as well as incumbency typically he says voters are reluctant to change parties after only one term when you get to second term or later they re more willing to make that change using this model obama should be poised to win the popular vote by 1 percent abramowitz says but abramowitz has noticed another development of late partisanship the advantage of incumbency has gotten smaller because voters are less willing to cross party lines now he says so when there s a democratic president like now republicans are less willing to cross party lines to vote for him as a result the advantage is about half what it used to be abramowitz and others are bracing for a nightmare scenario similar to 2000 when george w bush won the electoral vote and al gore won the popular vote that s a real possibility says goldford at drake particularly since hurricane sandy could suppress the popular vote in new york and new jersey even as these states go blue if that happens goldford says this past four years will seem like a picnic compared to the next four years he pauses remembering the chaos of 2000 the hanging chads and supreme court decision one thing i hope more than anything else he says is that this is actually over on tuesday night it may be a vain hope lawyers representing both sides are in place ready to litigate and demand recounts in every close state npr
