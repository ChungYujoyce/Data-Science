racethree man racetwo man race first place42 of the vote43 52 second place31 32 48 third place15 25 fourth place10 the simulation accounts for state by state rules as well for example candidates with less than a state s required minimum share of the vote receive no delegates in that state in a winner take all state the winner gets all the delegates regardless of vote share in states with delegates awarded by congressional district the simulation allocates delegates in the following ranges lowhigh first place50 of the delegates100 second place0 50 third place0 33 fourth place0 0 due to rounding
