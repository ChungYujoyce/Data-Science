newt gingrich lasting longer than most any pundit imagined he would as 2016 approaches that evidence maybe coming in the form of sen rand paul announcing his bid for the presidencytuesday or sen ted cruz doing it last month or sen marco rubio apparently doing it next week or even in jeb bush taking his own sweet time the gop field is starting to crowd up and to grow flush with cash despite the eagerness of many republican party insiders to avoid the kind of bumptious free for all that left mitt romney battered andlooking like he won the gop nomination by default this time around the party is angling to create a shortened primary season calendar it is scheduling fewer debates don t count on a smooth path to the republican nomination though like mr gingrich who was a thorn in mr romney s side for longer than the republican establishment might have wished this year s crop of would be republican presidents are filling up on fundraising making them relatively immune to what the party wants senator paul has been cultivating millionaire donors including the silicon valley crowd senator rubio has been chatting up the billionaire koch brothers senator cruz boldly announced that his goal is to raise as much as 50 million amidwhispers that jeb bush could pull in upwards of 100 million by the summer reporting deadline what s new isn t that lots of candidates are running it s that the fund raising climate can give them higher visibility and potential staying power with 50 million cruz could raise no small ruckus as big money rushes into politics in unprecedented sums the battle lines in the debate over big money seem to be becoming familiar by now liberals express outrage over supreme court rulings that have opened the door to unlimited sums being spent on politics by groups that can stay virtually anonymous conservatives counter that the court merely vindicated free speech rights sacred since the nation s founding including that government can t tell individuals or groups how much they can spend on speech but those interpretations while important don t tell the whole story they don t tell of how the gop can t get the hoped for coronation ofanestablishment candidate if rogue donors don t play along billionaire casino magnate sheldon adelsonsinglehandedlykept gingrich in the game in 2012 with a timely 5 million check on the eve of the south carolina primary a similar script could play out again in 2016 nor do those interpretations hint at the role big money might be playing in the republican party s rightward shift indeed while all seems comparatively in order on the democratic front the 2016 election is offering a glimpse at how washington s new era of megamoney is in some ways complicating republican efforts to retake the white house it s much more of the wild west out there university of connecticut political scientist paul herrson says of the climate for the nascent 2016 campaign the numbers are staggering by some measures 2 3 billion was spent on the 2012 presidential race relatively evenly split between republicans and democrats in 2016 that appears set to surge again with some speculating the total could evendouble and a rising share of the total comes from outside from groups are keen to influence the race but pledge not to coordinate with a specific candidate or party republicans dominated on this front in the 2012 cycle 720 million to 293 million for democrats according to the center for responsive politics which tracks political spending but the center ssheila krumholzsaid in an appearance on c span s washington journal this week that liberal groups have stepped up their outside game too this is a phenomenon across the political spectrum she said it was this spending that was unleashed bylandmark supreme court rulings including citizens unitedin 2010 the ability to raise huge sums of money has for years been a prerequisite of any serious presidential contender now candidates can get more and from more places mr bush appears to be putting off a presidential announcement as long as possible preciselyso that he can legally participate in raisingmassive amountsof outside cash that has to stop once a candidate formally announces some legal experts say it should have already stopped based on bush s all in behavior sizing up such competition cruz told the washington post that jeb bush will shatter every fundraising record ever set but cruz vows to keep up as several bush groups under the name right to rise rake in money the other contendersaren t walking off the field theyhave formed their own super political action committees or similaroutside money groups and are busy turning to big donors themselves when candidates create their own fundraising committees separate from party they are no longer accountable to the diverse elements of a party coalition but instead directly to donors julia azari a marquette university political scientist wrote recently in a blog post focused on a group allied with gov scott walker one of the presumed 2016 republican candidates is that a problem maybe not some say outside money could actually be a positive giving rise to a broader array of candidates but other analysts disagree like them or not the two parties are the nation s main institutions for distilling competing interests and voices into ideas and candidates that voters can respond to with simple up or down choices on election day while moneyed interests like business groups andlabor unionshave always exerted power alongside other activists within the parties it s not clear what layering extra money from the outside accomplishes congress s latestanswer has been to add yet more money to the inside now a wealthy couple can give 3 million directly to party committees in a two year period a big boost from limits that had been set in the 2002 mccain feingold act says robert maguire of the center for responsive politics to be sure the republican party is not being pushed out of the picture money in american politics has always been necessary but not sufficient to win the nomination says martin cohen a political scientist at james madison university in harrisonburg va after all when bush made an exploratory visit to new hampshire his stops included a meet and greet hosted by fergus cullen a former chairman of the state s republican party while it s unlikely any candidate will get the nod without succeeding on the fundraising trail the parties still hold huge sway on the path to winning their own nominations romney s eventual triumph in 2012 showed that but big money might be making the gop s life more difficult in other ways too though the influences that lead to partisanship are varied a 2013 study by the sunlight foundation a group that researches money in politics concluded that the wealthiest donors may be pulling republicans to the political right acting as a force for a more polarized congress the foundation matched rankings of lawmaker partisanship with data on the share of campaign funding that each lawmaker gets from the largest 31 385 political donors that number of donors represents an elite 1 percent of the 1 percent of the overall us population whether that is a good thing is largely in the eye of the beholder back in the 1950s the two parties drew scholarly criticism for being too ideologically similar public opinion polls now find americans generally worried about the shortage of compromise in washington get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox but as the republican party faces a robust crop of candidates courting the right in 2016 the role of big money in fueling the rightward shift of the party and financing the candidates who seek to capitalize from it appears to be
