morality of supporting him loading may 12 2016 donald trump is making the rounds on capitol hillthursday searching for unity with republican leaders including reluctant house speaker paul ryan but for some gop lawmakers backing the brash billionaire or rather not backing him is more than a matter of agreeing on tax cuts or trade immigration or national security i will not support mr trump rep carlos curbelo r of florida has told the cbs affiliate in miami that is not a political decision that is a moral decision it s hard to know how many of his colleagues share this view congressman curbelo who caucuses with the pragmatic wing of the conference says a lot of republicans have such concerns some expressing it publicly and others privately on tuesday washington post columnist michael gerson former speechwriter to president george w bush articulated the moral dimension in a commentary those who support trump no matter how reluctantly have crossed a moral boundary they are standing with a leader who encourages prejudice and despises the weak they are aiding the transformation of a party formed by lincoln s blazing vision of equality into a party of white resentment those who find this one of the normal everyday compromises of politics have truly lost their way those are stiff words and interviews with several republican lawmakers in advance of trump s visit found that some did not agree with them some say hillary clinton is also an immoral choice and for that reason they re reluctantly backing trump others feel uncomfortable making a moral judgment at all or don t see this as a moral choice but personal and policy morality are always involved in the selection of our leaders says therev james weiss aprofessor of ethics at boston college personal morality affects public behavior and public policy always has a moral dimension whether lawmakers are dealing with abortion criminal justice welfare medical care or even trade and taxes he adds the question is never whether morality plays a role it s to what extent it does reverend weiss says voters and politicians will differ on that judgment rep tim huelskamp r of kansas also has moral issues with trump the kansan a member of the hard right freedom caucus questions trump s positions on life family and marriage and so do a lot of other republicans he says as a parent he also worries about trump s language i can t get comfortable with a candidate if i m worried about what he ll say on tv in front of my 9 year old that s vulgar and crass he says he s still sticking with sen ted cruz even though the texas republican dropped out of the race last week after trump took must win indiana in a last ditch effort to rescue his campaign in the hoosier state mr cruz lashed into trump calling him a serial philanderer among other things trump has been open even bragging about his sexual exploits he told reporters back in december that his indiscretions would be fair gamefor reporters even as he s made much of bill clinton s womanizing but other republicans see things differently rep trent franks of arizona one of the most conservative members in the house says he understands curbelo s perspective curbelo says he views both trump and mrs clinton as dishonest and will vote for neither he points out that there are typically 10 candidates for president on a florida ballot but congressman franks argues that the choice is binary and when the antiabortion lawmaker compares trump with clinton on moral principles on respect for fellow human beings on protecting the constitution and protecting the republic to keep it intact for future generations on all those fronts there is no contest clinton will bring destruction to us in all of those areas whereas mr trump might franks was one of trump s most vociferous opponents in the primary as a conservative he says he cannot trust him to do the right thing but he knows he said wednesday that i can deeply trust hillary clinton to do the wrong thing every time and so if it comes down to a vote between trump and clinton he will choose trump and urge others to do the same on the senate side another deep skeptic of trump moderate republican susan collins of maine says she wouldn t sit in judgment of the presumed nominee she has repeatedly called on him to stop insulting people to make amends with the muslim community and others whom he has alienated but i m not going to judge him as a human being indeed she has not foreclosed the possibility of eventually supporting him sen orrin hatch r of utah ducking into an elevator explained that i m a great believer in redemption and people being able to change their lives and hopefully he ll fit that category but that s a na ve approach when it comes to selecting a political leader reverend weiss suggests we don t vote for people hoping they ll change any more than we should marry them thinking they should change much more on target weiss says is the view of sen james lankford r of oklahoma who says that politicians reflect the values of the country before senator lankford came to congress he was the director of student ministry at the baptist convention of oklahoma and of the falls creek youth camp the largest youth camp in the country the moral dimension is obviously extremely important to me personally he said in a brief interview on wednesday but he said that people mistakenly want to denote and say that political leaders carry all the moral baggage and all the moral weight of the country it s the opposite he says leaders such as clinton and trump are a barometer for where we are as a country and what we value washington can t fix wayward values in the nation he says the nation fixes washington for some democrats trump is just a reflection of republican values in recent years some republicans including members of their leadership have said they cannot support the vile rhetoric and radical proposals of the republican front runner said house minority leader nancy pelosi d of california in a press conference wednesday but year after year republicans have enthusiastically turned their intolerance and their discrimination into legislation whether it s insulting president obama women immigrants muslims lgbt americans there s not a dime s worth of difference between what donald trump says and what the house republicans have been saying all along lankford naturally sees the issue differently get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox like other republicans lankford does a side by side with clinton
