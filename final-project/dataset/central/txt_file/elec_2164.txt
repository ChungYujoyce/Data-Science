 jan 14 2020 at 6 00 am a fivethirtyeight chat filed under 2020 election welcome to fivethirtyeight s weekly politics chat the transcript below has been lightly edited sarahf sarah frostenson politics editor this is the first debate of 2020 and the last debate before the voting starts in iowa in less than three weeks there are six candidates the smallest debate stage yet and we ve finally published our primary forecast which shows the field especially in iowa is pretty wide open so how are you thinking about tonight s debate do you think it has the potential to really shake things up clare malone clare malone senior political writer i think the big story on monday and potentially the big story of the debate is what s going on with the rivalry between sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders first there is the sanders campaign s talking points that reportedly had volunteers paint warren as the candidate of the elite and then a story leaked on monday that s pretty damn unflattering to sanders claiming he told warren he didn t think a woman could win the presidency so i would say there s some jostling on the progressive end of the spectrum that could play out tonight ameliatd amelia thomson deveaux senior writer definitely one thing i ll be watching for is whether some of the tacit alliances we ve seen between the candidates start to break down that story really did not reflect well on sanders on the other hand it s generally risky for women to go on the offensive in debates like these so it might be a little tricky for warren to turn that to her advantage natesilver nate silver editor in chief yeah it seems like the theme of this debate is somewhat inevitably going to be sanders warren battle unless they really do decide to turn the other cheek clare malone i mean i do think the warren people have been savvier about dropping opposition research like this natesilver that s a pretty serious oppo drop clare malone sanders s defense is generally the mainstream media is stirring up conflict which is true partially in the sense that the media is the one publishing this stuff but there are indeed real tensions between those two campaigns natesilver like 95 percent of these oppo drops are dumb as fuck concerning things that ordinarily voters couldn t possibly care about but this would be a big deal if it s somehow confirmed or if warren repeats the accusation herself sarahf yeah it s amazing how fast the news cycle moves i had thought the situation with iran would be the dominant thread of conversation tonight but agree that between the selzer co iowa poll that put sanders in first in iowa and now the breakdown of warren and sanders s truce to not attack each other that will be a big part of tonight s debate and going in it doesn t seem great for sanders ameliatd warren could really benefit from getting some more support from lefty democrats who might be undecided or mostly seem to be sticking with sanders but if this accusation comes off as a cheap shot from warren i think that could hurt her or at least not endear her further to those on the left clare malone sanders s support is pretty sticky though so it s hard for me to see her winning over any of his supporters honestly at this point i think she has to worry about losing her supporters to sanders or pete buttigieg or even joe biden natesilver part of the dynamic is that sanders hasn t really been considered a front runner but now the media is covering him like one even though it s not really clear how much has actually changed in his candidacy if you look at the odds in our primary model where we ran older forecasts retroactively before we launched sanders s chances of winning the majority of pledged delegates have been pretty steady since november sarahf so let s say tonight is the sanders wine cave edition where he s at the center of attacks like buttigieg was in the december debate that debate seemed to have actually dampened some enthusiasm for buttigieg for instance he fell pretty substantially in that selzer poll from where he was in november do we see sanders as the candidate tonight who has the most at stake what about biden he is after all the front runner in our model even if he s not the clear favorite to win i e he s still an underdog relative to the rest of the field natesilver so on the one hand i agree that sanders s support is likely to be pretty sticky as clare puts it there s evidence from polls that his supporters are the most firmly committed to any one candidate but on the other hand he hasn t really gotten the same front runner type scrutiny that warren did get at some points this fall so whether he holds up once that level of scrutiny is applied is very much up in the air ameliatd and it s not a low stakes debate for warren either because she s been actively trying to revitalize her campaign when i was in iowa on a reporting trip a few weeks ago she was kind of trying to hit the reset button by hammering her core message on corruption and the economy and of course she s now campaigning with juli n castro clare malone i mean we ll just have to wait and see what the attacks are i m not entirely sure warren for instance would go for bernie is sexist on stage that just doesn t seem like her temperament i would expect more of an attack on sanders from warren to be like his plans are implausible and therefore bad for the general election but then again he could also push back as he s been doing on the campaign trail saying that he is actually the most electable in a general and there s some truth to it especially in comparison to warren our polling with ipsos shows the same thing voters generally rate sanders next after biden in terms of his ability to defeat trump also sanders benefits from everyone kinda knowing what his thing is socialism baby which takes some of the sting out of he s too far out there attacks the brand is strong as the kids say sarahf right but to amelia s point tonight could be a big night for warren she was only 3 points behind sanders in that selzer poll which is a good sign for her considering her national numbers had dipped in late november and through december and you can already see the slightest of upticks already in our national polling average geoffrey skelley geoffrey skelley elections analyst yeah that selzer poll had sanders in the lead in iowa as we ve discussed but then that monmouth poll out on monday showed biden in the lead with 24 percent in iowa and sanders in second at 18 percent suggesting that iowa is very wide open and very difficult to predict clare malone like the state itself sarahf right biden is either in first or fourth depending on which poll you look at geoffrey skelley so far the debates haven t seemed to have affected the polls all that much at least not since sen kamala harris s surge after the june debate average change in national polls and the candidates who moved the most after the first four democratic primary debates average change in national polls evaluates the average absolute change in polling averages before and after each debate across the 10 candidates with the highest post debate polling average polling averages were calculated using national polls conducted during the two weeks before and two weeks after each debate source polls although i haven t run the numbers the same way for the november and december debates one look at the polls suggests there wasn t a dramatic shakeup after those events either now tonight s debate could be different since there are fewer candidates and voting is right around the corner but then again maybe not clare malone my spidey sense is that this debate will matter especially to iowans these people are tuned in to a deranged degree natesilver and polls also find that a high proportion of iowans haven t yet made their final decision clare malone right sarahf so if many iowans haven t made their final decision how many do you think are actively considering amy klobuchar or tom steyer klobuchar didn t do as well in that selzer poll as i thought she might given how respondents in our poll with ipsos rated her december debate performance granted a lot of time has passed since dec 19 but there also haven t been that many polls and then steyer had a kind of weird surge in south carolina and nevada it s too soon to really make sense of what s happening there although he has spent a ton of money on tv ads natesilver klobuchar is actually in a pretty weird place she s at 6 6 percent in our iowa polling average but usually candidates either rise up to at least 15 percent in iowa which matters given how the caucus process itself works or fall back into the low single digits clare malone the steyer stuff is interesting in the sense that yes he s doing well in polls probably because of advertising in those two states that have fewer ads in general than say iowa or new hampshire but other candidates are going to start to get into that media market scrum let s see how much those numbers stick for him what i will say though is that the ads themselves cannily talk about the economy not impeachment or climate change subjects with which steyer is more closely associated ameliatd steyer has been kind of defensive too about the fact that he made the debate at all the implication being that he s only there because he spent a ton of money on ads that makes him a potential target particularly for someone like sanders or warren but attacking him also runs the risk of making him look like a more serious threat so it s somewhat complicated clare malone i think he won t really be a big factor tbh natesilver i just don t think steyer is very interesting ameliatd right maybe the other candidates won t think it s worth their time to question why he s even there natesilver so long as he s at 3 percent in iowa and new hampshire i don t really care where he is in nevada and south carolina clare malone i mean i don t think he s half bad in debates i just think the scrum will go a little more the sanders warren and the buttigieg klobuchar perry perry bacon jr senior writer we touched on this a bit earlier but biden is currently winning the race for the nomination and i think as a result you are seeing blunter criticism of him buttigieg and sanders have both taken biden to task for his vote for the iraq war and sanders has also criticized biden s record on issues of racial justice i m not sure his rivals will attack biden on tuesday but that s the thing i m watching most closely does anyone decide this is the last real chance to take on the person mostly likely to win i have been confused by how much warren s allies are attacking buttigieg and now it seems like warren is attacking sanders but biden is winning it feels like 2016 a bit christie attacking rubio instead of trump what is the point natesilver if somehow biden gets through the debate and all the focus is on sanders vs warren buttigieg etc that seems like a very fortunate outcome for the former vice president ameliatd yes biden clearly benefited from being able to float above the fray in the december debate and the other candidates mostly let him do that which was a little weird natesilver biden does have a tendency to cause trouble for himself of course it s also probably worth noting that his relatively smooth debate in december has been followed up by quite a few endorsements etc party elites seem to have fewer concerns than they once did about his steadiness as a candidate perry harris was kind of limited in taking on biden in my view since she will be high on the vp list but i don t think biden is going to pick buttigieg warren or sanders for vp so they have very little incentive to hold back buttigieg in particular has been very good at attacking people it would be interesting to see if one was the one to push the iraq issue because biden seems at times unwilling to concede he voted for the war clare malone yeah i gotta say that whole thing is really weird john kerry a biden surrogate was trying to say that other candidates were misrepresenting his record but it s clear as day that biden voted for the iraq war if you want to complicate the narrative and say it was a mistake and you were misled fine but that whole talking point is weak sauce in my opinion sarahf ok this is our last debate before the voting starts in iowa and as i said at the outset of the chat it s pretty much a four way race with biden sanders warren and buttigieg all projected to get some delegates biden is in the lead in our forecast but as we ve said in our chat a lot of iowans are still on the fence what will you be keeping a close eye on tonight to see if it moves the needle at all perry biden seems poised to win the nomination perhaps even iowa i ll be watching to see whether any of the other top three really take him on and if they do on what issues ameliatd i will be interested to see as perry mentioned if biden s iraq war vote and his strange unwillingness to admit to it gets turned against him or if he can turn the general foreign policy conversation discussion of what s happening with iran in his favor because in general that s an issue where he has a clear advantage over the other candidates clare malone i mean it s trite but i ll be curious to see what warren and sanders do on stage given the conflict they ve had and i ll be curious to see if sanders in particular challenges biden on a general election electability front natesilver repeating myself a bit but it feels to me like sanders is liable to play a central role in this debate with perceptions that he s now a front runner and those sorts of debates tend to be pretty high stakes ameliatd
