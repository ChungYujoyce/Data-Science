iran shooting down a u s surveillance drone in the politically sensitive strait of hormuz has created a dangerous new level of tension between the two countries president donald trump said iran made a big mistake and later added that it was a new wrinkle for iran and the u s days after saying that iran attacked two oil tankers in the persian gulf the united states is now accusing the country of shooting down an unmanned surveillance aircraft in international airspace the iranian revolutionary guard corps declared that it had stuck down the rq 4 global hawk over iranian airspace but the united states countered that the incident was an unprovoked attack and that the aircraft had been traveling in international airspace a few days ago the u s officials also accused iran of firing missile at a different drone that had been responding to the attack on the tankers but what exactly is an rq 4a drone and why does this attack matter time spoke to drone aircraft experts to find out what you need to know in technical terms the drone that iran shot down was a u s navy broad area maritime surveillance bams d aircraft which is a navy version of the air force s high flying rq 4a global hawk in simple terms it is an unmanned aircraft that is intended for surveillance at sea unlike the missile launching mq 1 predator and mq 9 reaper drones that are used to conduct airstrikes global hawk drones are unarmed are used only to collect information to do this they fly at altitudes of up to 60 000 feet almost twice as high as a commercial airliner at that height the drone can see beyond the curvature of the earth this drone typically has as its most important defense altitude says amy zegart a senior fellow at the hoover institution and stanford university s freeman spogli institute of international studies it flies at a very high altitude so the fact that the iranians were able to shoot it down shows that they have some pretty significant capabilities in some ways the shoot down is a signaling mechanism to the united states that iran is more capable than we might have assumed global hawks are also expensive says zegart the cost of a single drone was more than 176 million in 2011 according to the military more than 10 times the price of drones like the predator and reaper global hawks may be used for surveillance but they re not considered to be stealth aircraft the drone has a 130 ft wingspan similar to a boeing 737 passenger jet it is large heavy and slow compared to combat aircraft dan gettinger the co director of the center for the study of the drone at bard college tells time they re not fast they have a high profile they re easily observable on radar they re purposely designed to fly slowly at high altitudes they re able to essentially loiter over an area and collect as much data as possible gettinger says such an aircraft would be carrying advanced technology such as high definition and infra red cameras as well as sensors that can intercept telephone and radio chatter douglas barrie a senior fellow for military aerospace at the international institute for strategic studies tells time that this kind of aircraft would be sent on missions to conduct maritime surveillance or to peer inside a country from outside its borders the range of the sensors onboard would allow you to see certainly areas of iran of interest while you re still in international airspace barrie says the u s and iran are telling conflicting stories the iranian revolutionary guard said that it shot down the aircraft over iranian airspace revolutionary guard s commander and chief hossein salami said on iranian tv that the u s aircraft crossed a red line and that iran sent a message that it will respond to aggression according to reuters iran is not seeking war with any country but we are fully prepared to defend iran salami said the u s central command which is in charge of military operations in the middle east says the drone was attacked in international airspace at the strait of hormuz which connects the persian gulf to the gulf of oman the strait is especially significant because much of the world s oil supply flows through it iranian reports that the aircraft was over iran are false this was an unprovoked attack on a u s surveillance asset in international airspace navy capt bill urban a spokesperson for u s central command said in statement thursday the u s has resoundingly denied that the drone entered iranian airspace the head of the u s air forces central command for the region lt general joseph guastella said thursday that iranian claims that the drone entered iranian airspace were categorically false the u s military claims that the drone was never closer to iran than 21 miles and released a map which allegedly showed the drone s launch site and the location where it was shot down the u s military also released a grainy video which it said showed smoke from the drone the u s made plans to conduct a military strike against iran but the mission was called off at the last minute a u s official told the ap that the targets would have included radars and missile batteries in a series of tweets on friday morning trump explained that he had decided to call off the attack after learning that it would kill about 150 people he wrote that he felt that it was not a proportionate response for an attack on an unmanned drone we were cocked loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sites when i asked how many will die trump wrote 150 people sir was the answer from a general 10 minutes before the strike i stopped it not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone i am in no hurry our military is rebuilt new and ready to go by far the best in the world sanctions are biting more added last night iran can never have nuclear weapons not against the usa and not against the world on thursday trump declined to comment about the u s response to the attack but said that you ll soon find out the federal aviation administration issued an emergency order on thursday which prohibited pilots from entering iranian airspace due to heightened military activities and increased political tensions international airlines including british airways emirates and lufthansa also announced that they would avoid the area iran has insisted that the drone entered iranian airspace iranian foreign minister javad zarif tweeted a hand drawn map of the drone s alleged flight path through the strait of hormuz at 00 14 us drone took off from uae in stealth mode violated iranian airspace zarif wrote it was targeted at 04 05 at the coordinates 25 59 43 n 57 02 25 e near kouh e mobarak we ve retrieved sections of the us military drone in our territorial waters where it was shot down zarif also tweeted that the u s is lying about international waters the us wages economicterrorism on iran has conducted covert action against us now encroaches on our territory he wrote we don t seek war but will zealously defend our skies land waters iranian brigadier general rahimzadeh said that iran had sent the u s several warning before downing the drone according to iran s semi official news agency tasnim amirali hajizadeh head of the revolutionary guards aerospace division said that a american boeing p 8 poseidon surveillance plane was in iranian airspace at the same time as the drone but iran had decided not to shoot it down because iran authorities did not want casualties tasnim reported according to reuters iran said the p 8 was carrying 35 americans but the u s navy says the crew compliment of the plane is nine tasnim also released photos that it said were of the drone as well as video that it said showed iran firing a surface to air missile at the drone although it s not unusual for smaller drones to face attacks attacks on drones that are as large and sophisticated as the rq 4 are rarer barrie says such aircraft fly at high altitudes and are hard to hit with short range missiles americans may remember that iran allegedly captured a smaller drone the rq 170 sentinel in 2011 gettinger argues that what s happening now is a very different and that now there s a higher risk of escalation in 2011 the united states declined to claim the aircraft it was a very secret drone on a secret mission gettinger says here it s a much more public event zegart warns that while the diplomatic situation isn t as dire as it would be if an aircraft with american pilots had been shot down she considers iran s attack to be an aggressive move for iran especially since the drone wasn t carrying weapons it s a signaling device that iran has capabilities that we might not have anticipated before but it s certainly less aggressive than shooting at something that would risk human lives said zegart u s efforts to collect surveillance don t mean that the drone was being used in an aggressive way she says regardless of where you come down on is this international airspace or iranian airspace this was not an escalatory move by the united states it was an escalatory move by iran zegart says you can imagine in some circumstances gathering intelligence can be deescalating because everyone has a better picture of what s going on on the ground so the simple fact of sending a surveillance drone over a conflict area does not in itself lead to escalation necessarily zegart warns that the situation is very dangerous and that the trump administration should take the potential for escalating tensions seriously the president s use of twitter is perhaps the biggest wildcard here says zegart there are a lot of mixed messages coming out of the administration whether you re listening to the national security adviser or the president or the secretary of state so messaging discipline which has never been a hallmark of this administration is all the more important with this particular adversary i think we can t assume that an adversary like iran is going to discount what the president says on twitter is just trump being trump beyond the current situation gettinger of the center for the study of the drone argues that the u s is likely to see more incidents like this drones are becoming increasingly popular in regions with high political and military tensions because of this proliferation of drones and because of the perceived low risk of deploying them in these situations there is a potential that we could see more of these incidents in the future gettinger says correction june 21 an earlier version of this story misstated the location where the united states military says the drone was shot down it says it was shot down near iran not the u s write to tara law at tara law time com
