 deb tekippe spent much of this year convinced she would support joe biden in his 2020 bid for president but the more she has seen of him on the stump in iowa and in debates on television the less confident she has become so on a recent rainy evening she found herself crammed up against the bleachers in decorah s high school gymnasium to see south bend mayor pete buttigieg she came away intrigued i was all in for joe biden but now i m wondering what happened with him you know it s obvious that he s fading said tekippe 63 a retired nurse who now says she won t caucus for biden and is strongly considering buttigieg pete is on his way up there is a lot of enthusiasm for him and there are so many people who really want to believe in their candidate and you have to see him in person to see how impressive he is tekippe s experience reflects the new reality in iowa buttigieg has emerged as the major alternative to biden among moderate voters the former vice president has counted on as the bedrock of his campaign in the first in the nation caucus state a new quinnipiac university poll released wednesday found buttigieg in second place in iowa a single percentage point behind sen elizabeth warren and ahead of sen bernie sanders in third and biden in fourth that followed a recent new york times siena college poll that had buttigieg with slightly more support than biden in the state placing him third behind the more liberal warren and sanders the midwestern mayor not only has caught biden in the polls but his campaign is better funded has drawn larger and louder crowds at events and has shown signs of a more effective ground operation in a state where the former vice president is making his third bid for the white house the question remains whether buttigieg can turn that momentum into permanent support ahead of the first in the nation iowa caucuses on feb 3 his advantages were on full display in recent days as the top 13 candidates in the field flocked to des moines for the state democratic party s annual fall fundraising dinner an event so large this year that it drew more than 13 000 people to the downtown sports arena there buttigieg s supporters made up about one quarter of the crowd giving their candidate the loudest applause of the night biden had the smallest group of supporters among the major candidates with the exception of sanders who drew around 1 000 people to a rally outside but didn t buy tickets for supporters inside the enthusiasm gap between biden and buttigieg was even more evident in the hours before the main event more than 2 300 people stood in a steady rain for a buttigieg rally in a downtown plaza where grammy award winning singer songwriter ben harper performed and the candidate gave a speech and thanked the barnstormers for pete a group of die hard supporters that travels the country to boost the mayor s candidacy well friends this is what it feels like when you realize you are definitely going to be the next president of the united states buttigieg said to a loud roar from the poncho clad crowd moments before he led them in a march through downtown to the arena this is what it feels like to build a movement this is what it feels like to insist on change a block away and a few minutes later biden welcomed his supporters in a convention center ballroom that remained a quarter empty about one third of the crowd sat on folding chairs in an accessibility seating section filled with seniors as the local cover band pork tornadoes played to little applause harold schaitberger the longtime president of the international association of fire fighters and former second lady jill biden talked longer than the candidate who gave an unusually short five minute speech biden spent most of it telling the story of how he asked his wife to marry him five times before she said yes and thanking the firefighters union which has endorsed his campaign this is all about you all about you getting people involved in the caucuses it s hand to hand biden said from the stage get involved directly in the campaign become precinct captains if you re not volunteer to make phone calls knock on doors ladies and gentleman it all starts in iowa on feb 3 and we re going to win iowa as the crowd filed out campaign aides held fists full of tickets for the big dinner many of them presumably for the six upper deck sections of the arena that biden s campaign had purchased tickets for but ended up empty giant stacks of free white t shirts that read ridin with biden also went unclaimed while in the room next door buttigieg supporters who couldn t score tickets filed into an overflow watch party am i disappointed there were shirts left on a table no because i don t think that reflects the actual operation schaitberger said as he came to biden s defense the next day at a fish fry in cedar rapids enthusiasm is important but so is commitment so far both campaigns have more than 20 offices and in excess of 100 paid staffers in the state but schaitberger predicts that biden s ground game will turn out loyal iowans likely to attend caucuses while implying buttigieg s newfound support is more fickle he dismissed the south bend mayor as the flavor of the moment and accused him of busing in hundreds of people from indiana in the 2008 presidential race biden made a similar accusation when then sen barack obama gave a soaring speech at the des moines dinner and flexed his campaign s organizational muscle by drawing the largest and loudest crowd to the event biden needled obama by welcoming that section of the hall with a hello chicago in the end though it turned out the junior senator from illinois did in fact have the strongest grassroots operation in iowa one that launched him toward the presidency yes schaitberger grudgingly agreed with a smile yes he did with less than three months until the caucuses the state of play in iowa remains fluid the times siena poll found 65 of iowa voters who picked a top candidate still could be convinced to caucus for someone else the quinnipiac poll taken in the days before and after the democratic dinner placed that number at 52 both polls concluded the race is a wide open four candidate contest with the front running quartet in a statistical dead heat the times siena poll found warren leading with 22 of the vote followed by sanders with 19 buttigieg with 18 and biden with 17 quinnipiac had warren leading with 20 followed by buttigieg with 19 sanders with 17 and biden with 15 the next closest candidate in both polls was minnesota sen amy klobuchar collecting around 5 polls are little more than a snapshot in time but this latest one reinforced a trend of biden falling back to the pack after months of being considered the front runner they also emphasized the showdown between biden and buttigieg for the party s more centrist voters for example the quinnipiac poll found that voters who identify as moderates and conservatives made up 50 of likely caucusgoers and among them buttigieg received 19 support and biden 18 among the 24 of voters identifying as somewhat liberal warren led with 29 followed by buttigieg with 24 of the voters who consider themselves very liberal sanders finished with 32 to warren s 30 according to the poll results so far biden has remained the leader in more widespread national polls where voters are familiar with his history as vice president but perhaps are not tuning in as closely to the race as voters in early states he trails however in fundraising ending the last quarter with about 9 million in cash on hand compared with 34 million for sanders 26 million for warren and 23 million for buttigieg during a recent stop in maquoketa biden stood in front of bales of hay and a few pumpkins and read off a pair of teleprompters as he gave a speech to a small group of about 100 caucusgoers gathered in a metal barn at the jackson county fairgrounds using teleprompters for such an intimate setting is unusual particularly in iowa where voters welcome spontaneous interactions with candidates but it reflected efforts from biden s staff to keep him from wandering off message his speech included some not so subtle jabs at buttigieg the next president is going to inherit a divided nation and a world in disarray it s going to require someone who can truly unite this nation at home and someone who can command the respect of world leaders on day one biden said there s not going to be a whole lot of time for on the job training after the speech biden took questions including one on health care from susan reighard who said she owes thousands of dollars in medical bills after undergoing a surgery biden must have had buttigieg on the brain because in his response he used the mayor s catchphrase of medicare for all who want it to describe his own plan reighard however didn t notice and said afterward she never was on buttigieg s bandwagon she arrived to the event undecided but left backing biden after hearing him explain his plan would add a so called public option to offer coverage to more people while competing with private insurance i like his character i ve always respected him said reighard 58 a substitute teacher and former nurse and him being able to beat trump is a big part of it we can t have another four years like this it s just crazy patrick johnson and cheri canier left the maquoketa event ready to caucus for biden too citing his ability to pull midwest voters away from president donald trump i know a lot of people who are either independent or republicans who can t stomach what s going on now they would have a really hard time with sanders or warren but they will vote for joe biden said johnson 60 a retired locomotive engineer that s why it s so important that joe be our candidate the couple from nearby clinton said they liked buttigieg but favored biden as a known commodity i think he s got a really bright future but the thing about pete is this isn t a time for that right now said canier 64 the time right now is to do what we need to do to get moderates and independents to vote for the democrats farther north in dubuque dan corken cited similar reasoning for why he s spent the last several weeks knocking on doors for biden in the northeast corner of the state corken who attended a biden rally at loras college and once coached the women s basketball team there called biden the one candidate who can unite this country and said buttigieg needs more seasoning in explaining why he supported biden he noted how he has a vacation home in wisconsin near lake geneva and described working a democratic booth at the county fair there this summer all the farmers there just kept walking by us like we had the plague it scares me said corken 69 biden is the right person at this time that we need to bring people together whatever his limitations are with his style biden has been gaffe prone on the campaign trail has given uneven performances in the televised debates and has had trouble staying focused on his campaign message at times corken recalled seeing biden in dubuque right after he announced his campaign and said he was all over the place you could barely track what he was saying 2020 election voter guide get the latest election news analysis and opinion he s rusty and he s up against some really good debaters he said but it s one thing to be a good debater and another thing to be a good governor in nearly 50 interviews at campaign events in 10 different iowa cities and towns over the course of six days voters repeatedly cited biden s stage presence and debate performances as reasons they were willing to consider other candidates at a warren event in the central iowa town of grinnell mary newton said she had narrowed her choice to the massachusetts senator and buttigieg while she had growing doubts about biden biden has slipped we ve seen him a couple times i think he s a great guy but i think trump would tear him apart said newton 63 who lives in the nearby town of newton he makes a lot of little mistakes and i guess that s ok but trump is going to jump all over those little miscues i like him but there s just too much baggage there i think though few voters brought it up biden and his son hunter biden currently are at the heart of the ongoing u s house impeachment inquiry into trump who has been accused of holding up military aid to ukraine while pressuring its president to launch an investigation aimed at harming the former vice president s political prospects many caucusgoers cited buttigieg s demeanor and background as much as his campaign platform in weighing whether to caucus for him over biden the rising millennial s biography is better known now than when he launched his campaign from near obscurity six months ago in an old studebaker factory in his hometown harvard grad rhodes scholar veteran of the war in afghanistan two term mayor and first openly gay presidential candidate from a major party in contrast to biden buttigieg rarely gives anything but concise targeted answers to questions and frequently lands well rehearsed lines that reemphasize his message of offering generational change while uniting a nation there were no teleprompters on his recent three day bus tour across northern iowa that mostly focused on counties that had been won by obama but then voted for trump that included a stop in the northern iowa town of waverly were jim vowels stood in the back of waverly shell rock high school s cafeteria the room was so packed that the crowd of more than 500 stretched down a pair of hallways where voters craned their necks to get a look at the presidential hopeful vowels said he started out backing biden but now isn t so sure and he s also looking at buttigieg and klobuchar he said the most important factor to him is who can beat trump how would you debate donald trump vowels asked buttigieg during the town hall he s such a mean nonfactual debater who makes a lie sound like a truth if you re on a stage with him how will you combat that buttigieg responded by contending that many of trump s arguments against democrats won t work with him an answer that also included a reference to the president receiving a medical exemption from military service in vietnam after being diagnosed with bone spurs in his feet he s going to say socialism this socialism that but i come from the heartland he s going to say swamp this and swamp that but i don t go to work in washington i m right here in the midwest buttigieg said and of course i m happy to have a debate over the difference between his approach to be called to serve in the military and mine the crowd roared with approval and vowels said he loved the answer would keep reading buttigieg s autobiography and continue to do his homework but he made it clear he s worried about biden in a matchup with the president trump lives by the motto that if you don t have the facts and you don t have the truth you just speak louder and beat your fists on the table vowels said i want someone who is so sure that they don t fold or let trump get to them and i m not sure joe can handle that can he stand there and not get mad not make a mistake and say something he won t regret later i don t know in decorah retired minister wayne ellingson said he was surprised when he arrived early at the high school to find a line of people three blocks long waiting in the rain to get good spots near the stage for buttigieg s rally afterward he said he was taken aback by the raw enthusiasm and energy of the event which drew more than 1 000 people to a town of less than 8 000 ellingson too is trying to decide among biden buttigieg and klobuchar all three he said hold similar views on health care and other important issues and for him the decision will come down to who has the most momentum for now he said buttigieg is in the lead biden was my guy at the very beginning but he s faded in the background a little bit said ellingson 71 i ve been out to see a number of rallies for the other candidates but they don t have anywhere near the enthusiasm that pete has after attending a buttigieg rally in a middle school cafeteria in mason city misty gomez cited buttigieg s ability to connect with a new generation of voters as the reason she ll caucus for him in february with pete he just has this hope in him this freshness this excitement that is hitting us said gomez 42 who works in a dental office and lives in the small town of kensett he s got youth on his side in dozens of interviews with voters considering caucusing for buttigieg gomez was the exception not the rule most said they had been eager to hear buttigieg speak had him on their short list of candidates but were unwilling to fully commit ted crawford personifies this careful approach he listened intently as buttigieg spoke in the mason city cafeteria it was not the first time he d heard the mayor deliver a speech in august crawford and friends attended the democratic wing ding dinner in clear lake and he told the tribune then that he was tentatively supporting biden but had taken notice of rousing speeches by buttigieg and new jersey sen cory booker if tonight were the caucus i d probably support biden but i m very very impressed and it s moving more to a toss up for me pete is tremendously intelligent he s focused he s educated he s got great charisma and great leadership said crawford 69 a retired teacher who lives in mason city and although i have growing concerns about joe biden i m still not sure about pete s electability but this guy is definitely surging so we ll see bruthhart chicagotribune com twitter billruthhart
