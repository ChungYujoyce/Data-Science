in mid november u s military and intelligence analysts began to suspect that something might be wrong in the central chinese city of wuhan the cia was getting reports from the city that there was an outbreak of pneumonia high resolution spy satellite photographs showed activity around medical centers and diminishing traffic in the streets national security agency eavesdropping detected an increase in what appeared to be medical calls within the city in the surrounding hubei province and between wuhan and government offices in beijing for about a month there was no way to assemble the scattered bits of intelligence into any confident assessment of what was happening say four u s intelligence and defense officials all of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the raw reports but as the activity increased and the reports from the city continued some officials at the cia and the national center for medical intelligence began musing about whether something more serious than pneumonia or a seasonal flu might be spreading maybe something worse something even more contagious more than five months and 225 000 deaths later the u s intelligence community s efforts to piece together the early spread of covid 19 has been clouded by politics and self interest in both china and the u s two of the countries that have suffered the most from the pandemic rather than doing all they could to share information to minimize the virus spread both china and the u s have all too often focused on blaming the other for starting it early in january the office of the director of national intelligence odni started including a warning in many of president trump s daily intelligence briefs say two of the officials who helped compile it the president they say was uninterested so were secretary of state mike pompeo defense secretary mark esper and other senior officials the officials say who routinely receive copies of the pdb and generally avoid confronting the president what the intelligence officials and health experts could not tell the president and still cannot today is where the virus came from keep up to date on the growing threat to global health

a globalist bioweapon china s ambassador to the u s has called the theory harmful and dangerous and on march 13 chinese foreign ministry spokesman zhao lijian escalated the conspiracy theory war with a series of tweets charging that the disease actually had first traveled to wuhan with american soldiers who had participated in the october military world games there that too took on a life of its own the army times reported powered in part by russian and chinese websites and social media the u s china feud briefly subsided for a few weeks in late march and early april as both sides appeared to recognize the danger of escalation during a pandemic that was claiming thousands of lives trump stopped referring to the disease as the china virus and the wuhan virus high ranking chinese officials distanced themselves from lijian s accusation and he eventually retreated but as the pandemic further accelerated and the economy sharply contracted in the u s trump s administration has returned to blaming china during the last two months he and other top officials have pressed intelligence and medical officials to press their investigations into whether the covid 19 virus escaped from the wuhan institute of virology a laboratory in wuhan where chinese virologists study diseases carried by bats and other animals according to u s officials reports of that pressure first appeared in the new york times on thursday secretary of state mike pompeo has charged that by concealing what it knew about covid 19 s origins china poses a threat to the entire world the chinese communist party now has

found sufficient evidence to support some u s officials public suggestions that the virus escaped from a chinese government laboratory details of the intelligence community s early investigations appeared first in the washington post and new york times intelligence officials say satellites human sources communications intercepts and other tools have not detected unusual activity at or around the wuhan institute of virology or the wuhan center for disease control and prevention that would suggest a cleanup a lockdown an official investigation or a purge the chinese are adept at concealment so we haven t ruled anything out but we don t have an indictment either said one of the officials it also may be impossible to prove that the virus did not escape from a lab in wuhan even the most secure labs called biosafety level 4 are not immune to leaks in 2019 the u s army medical research institute at ft detrick maryland stopped doing high level research after the cdc found security lapses there the frederick news post reported after obtaining the cdc reports under a freedom of information act request two u s intelligence officials said the administration s persistent efforts to pin the blame on a chinese government lab remind them of the bush administration s demands for intelligence that iraq had weapons of mass destruction it was a mistake to bow to political pressure then
