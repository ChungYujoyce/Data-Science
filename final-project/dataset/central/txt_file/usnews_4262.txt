president donald trump s friday night dismissal of the state department inspector general provoked objections from some republican lawmakers who said the president did not present sufficient grounds for the move in a letter to house speaker nancy pelosi trump said he was removing inspector general steve linick from his position because helonger held his fullest confidence sen chuck grassley r iowa said in a statement responding to linick s firing that congress requires written reasons justifying an ig s removal inspectors general are crucial in correcting government failures and promoting the accountability that the american people deserve he said grassley did not feel linick had done enough to investigate the origins of the allegations the trump campaign colluded with russian election interference efforts in 2016 but he said thoseshortcomings do not waive the president s responsibility to provide details to congress when removing an ig a general lack of confidence simply is not sufficient detail to satisfy congress grassley said republican sen susan collins of maine also said trump had failed to adequately explain the reasons for linick s removal i have long been a strong advocate for the inspectors general they are vital partners in congress s effort to identify inefficient or ineffective government programs and to root out fraud and other wrongdoing collins said in a tweet collins pointed to her role in drafting the 2008inspector general reform act which requires the president to submit a written explanation for an inspector general s removal 30 days before it takes effect the president has not provided the kind of justification for the removal of ig linick required by this law collins said removed the trump administration has recently moved to oust 4 government watchdogs sen mitt romney of utah a trump critic and the only republican senator to vote to convict the presidenton one of the articles of impeachment went further in decrying the firing which marked the fourth government watchdog trump has removed in the last three months the firings of multiple inspectors general is unprecedented doing so without good cause chills the independence essential to their purpose it is a threat to accountable democracy and a fissure in the constitutional balance of power romney tweeted romney s reaction echoed that of congressional democrats who immediately said they plan to investigate the reasons for linick s ouster president trump s unprecedented removal of inspector general linick is only his latest sacking of an inspector general our government s key independent watchdogs from a federal agency we unalterably oppose the politically motivated firing of inspectors general and the president s gutting of these critical positions wroterep eliot engel d n y chairman of the house foreign affairs committee and sen bob menendez of new jersey the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee engel and menedez cited reports that secretary of state mike pompeo who linick wasallegedly investigating foruse of state department staff to run personal errands for himself and his wife had personally recommended the inspector general s removal a state department officialwho spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution confirmed to usa today that linick had been investigating pompeo the official said if pompeo was involved in linick s ouster it was definitely retaliatory pelosi said in a statement on friday that the firing was part of a dangerous pattern of retaliation against the patriotic public servants charged with conducting oversight on behalf of the american people on sunday pelosi said on cbs s news face the nation that it was typical of the white house to announce something that is very unsavory so late on a friday night when less of the public was likely to hear the news the president has the right to fire any federal employee pelosi said but the fact is if it looks like it s in retaliation for something that the inspector general is doing that could be unlawful they re supposed to show cause she added even republicans in congress are concerned but not all republican lawmakers shared the concerns expressed by grassley collins and romney i m not crying big crocodile tears over this termination let s put it that way said sen ron johnson r wis johnson said he is an advocate for inspector generals but in the end they serve at the pleasure of the president and he s got the authority to hire and terminate johnson said that both he and grassley have had had a real problem with linick s responsiveness in an apparent reference to the russian investigation information cited by grassley i spoke with senior officials both in the white house and the state department i understand their reasoning i don t know whether they re going to provide a more robust rationale for why they do it but i understand it and i don t disagree with it johnson said trump s trade adviser peter navarro said sunday on abc news this week that trump clearly has the legal authority to fire linick and said the president had a tremendous problem with government officials opposed to trump s agenda some people call it the deep state i think that s apt navarro said so i don t mourn the loss of people when they leave this bureaucracy he continued there s always going to be somebody better to replace them somebody more loyal not to president necessarily but to the trump agenda contributing deirdre shesgreen
