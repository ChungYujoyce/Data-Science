 in what turned out to be the final rally of her presidential campaign elizabeth warren had some advice for more than 2 000 voters jammed into a giant shed at detroit s famed eastern market instead of tracking the horse race talk and pundit predictions warren said they should cast a vote that will make you proud cast a vote from the heart her plea may still apply but another candidate will become the beneficiary after warren announced thursday she is ending her campaign following a series of stinging defeats on super tuesday highlighted by a disastrous third place finish in her home state massachusetts so who will pick up support from the folks who have proclaimed i m a warren democrat that is as they say a bit complicated on the surface vermont sen bernie sanders would stand to gain the most after all he and warren largely agree on many of the issues medicare for all free college tuition wiping out college debt and the green new deal and the two long have considered each other friends but warren s supporters moving to sanders is far from a foregone conclusion for one warren has yet to say whom she ll endorse during a news conference outside of her home in cambridge massachusetts she said she would not make a decision thursday asked what advice she d give to her supporters on whether to support sanders or biden warren replied let s take a deep breath and think about this for a little bit longer before we all settle in while throwing her endorsement behind a candidate could prove to be a major influence on who her supporters end up backing many of them have been split between biden and sanders so far morning consult s regular polling bears this out as it asks voters for their no 2 choice the most recent survey released thursday found that 43 of warren supporters favored sanders as their next best candidate while 36 said biden was their second choice the poll was conducted on monday and tuesday before former new york mayor mike bloomberg left the race overall the survey found that the migration of warren supporters would give biden a 4 percentage point boost overall and a sanders a 5 point increase warren s own analysis of why her campaign fell short illustrated this near even split in ideology among her supporters i was told at the beginning of this whole undertaking that there are two lanes a progressive lane that bernie sanders is the incumbent for and a moderate lane that joe biden is incumbent for and there s no room for anyone else in this warren said i thought that wasn t right but evidently it was another key consideration is the type of voters from whom warren draws the most support perhaps best illustrated in the super tuesday exit polls in massachusetts where voters know her best biden won the state and sanders finished second as a result warren did not lead in virtually any polling categories with voters the one exception white college educated women warren won 40 of that vote followed by biden with 26 and sanders with 21 and while she lost that demographic in many other states it consistently proved to be the area where she received the most support i m the stereotypical white college educated suburbanite that she gets marianne rzepka joked after watching warren s speech in detroit i like her because she s passionate she s smart she s been through a lot so she actually believes it she used to be a republican then she realized hey something s wrong i like that michigan is the largest prize on the primary calendar tuesday with 125 delegates at stake while warren drew a large crowd to her detroit rally she took the stage there on super tuesday before most of the results had come in including from massachusetts rzepka said she liked warren s speech and is a committed supporter with a yard sign and bumper sticker but was surprised she didn t hit trump and bernie more asked whether she d support biden or sanders if warren ended her campaign she didn t hesitate saying i m biden bernie is inflexible grumpy and scary in his own way said rzepka 68 a retired newspaper reporter who lives in ann arbor you know what you would get with biden toss in some tough feelings between warren and sanders in recent months and an increased level of vitriol between their supporters online and the decision for some warren voters may get more convoluted plus in the hours after super tuesday some top sanders surrogates tried to ratchet up the heat on warren to get out as part of a perceived effort to have progressives rally around sanders in the way moderates have united behind biden imagine if the progressives consolidated last night like the moderates consolidated who would have won tweeted a top sanders ally u s rep ilhan omar after biden won her home state of minnesota that s what we should be analyzing i feel confident a united progressive movement would have allowed for us to buildtogether and win mn and other states we narrowly lost by omar s definition of course warren was the only progressive other than sanders left in the race sanders sought to allay the tensions noting that he had called warren on wednesday morning and thought she deserved the time and space to make a decision on how to move forward a phrase that was identical to a statement released by warren s campaign manager among voters who described themselves as liberal warren lost to sanders in all of the states that voted tuesday including massachusetts in some states she also trailed biden among liberals according to the exit polls in massachusetts she got 28 of the liberal vote compared with 27 for biden and 33 for sanders warren got just 9 support from voters who described themselves as moderate compared with 47 for biden and 21 for sanders retirees diane collins and ed menta fall into the unabashedly liberal category after most of the room at warren s detroit rally had emptied out the two warren campaign volunteers waited to meet up with their caravan and make the two hour drive west back to kalamazoo collins 80 said the event marked the first time she d seen warren in person calling it goose bumpy she just seems so genuine to me she s a real person collins said i really do believe she d look out for the working person and not just get to the white house and play golf she s just fabulous menta said he s been a longtime warren supporter because she consistently highlights the tremendous economic inequality in the usa though he was disappointed she didn t mention the flint water crisis during her speech asked whom they would support if warren dropped out the two immediately said bernie in unison warren and sanders represent systemic change not just going back to the way things were before trump that s not the problem menta said the problem is the massive economic inequality in the united states which affects everything i think the democratic party establishment is terrified of bernie sanders while collins lamented that sanders is constantly grouchy she said she wouldn t hesitate to vote for him bernie stands for the same values that elizabeth does she said plus i cannot see biden on a stage debating with trump face to face are you kidding me he doesn t think on his feet he has to be coached you can tell i just think trump would eat him up while collins menta and many other warren supporters cite her emphasis on economic inequality many top sanders supporters have tried to draw the distinction that warren isn t the true candidate of the working class ald carlos ramirez rosa a democratic socialist on the chicago city council put it this way bernie sanders has the most diverse and working class base if you look at who is supporting elizabeth warren it s overwhelmingly upper income white folks older folks if you look at who is supporting bernie it s low income walmart workers it s black folks it s latino folks it s young folks susan carney arrived to warren s detroit rally undecided but left leaning toward voting for the massachusetts senator afterward carney said she liked what she heard but ignored warren s advice to discount the predictions pundits and delegate math it doesn t look like she s going to make it to a place where she s going to be on the ballot against trump unless she somehow gets a lot of delegates but i came here because i wanted to hear more from her said carney 59 who lives in ann arbor and works in communications of the progressive part of the democratic party if you can include bernie in that she s the more reasonable one asked what she s looking for in a candidate carney replied i hate to say this but i m looking for somebody who can beat donald trump she said she usually votes with her heart and liked warren minnesota sen amy klobuchar and former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg asked what she d do if warren exits the race carney said she d pick bloomberg over biden because of his experience running new york city and the many improvements he made there what if bloomberg dropped out which by the way he did if it s between biden and sanders i have to go with biden she said i think bernie is making promises i don t see how he could keep and in some ways i think if trump is over here on this side and sanders is way over here on this side i don t know if that s better it s just different i d be comfortable with biden if he were president carney concluded but i m not sure very much would change bruthhart chicagotribune com twitter billruthhart
