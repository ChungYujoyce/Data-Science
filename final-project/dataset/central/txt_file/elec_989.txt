influential figures close to president trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more want to make the midterm elections a referendum on his performance and on his possible impeachment the people advancing this view are mostly veterans of the 2016 campaign including trump s first campaign manager corey lewandowskicorey r lewandowskihouse panel releases long awaited

strategist stephen bannon the hill has learned democratic enthusiasm in the elections is likely to be sky high given the broad liberal antipathy to the president the best way to counteract that the cadre of loyalists believe is to make the stakes high enough to draw hordes of conservative voters to the polls if those voters believe democrats want to throw trump out of office the most dramatic negation of the 2016 result imaginable they might rally to his side lewandowskiand bossietraveled with trump to michigan for a rallyon saturdayevening lewandowski declared that michigan was trump country trump paid tribute to lewandowski s strategic abilities from the stage he only ran one campaign and he won so he s one for one before going on to make a version of the argument that his former campaign manager and others are said to be urging on him we have to keep the house because if we listen tomaxine waters she s going around saying we will impeach him trump said referring to the california democratic congresswoman who has frequently promised to try to remove him from office at first glance it might seem odd that a figure so exuberantly confident as trump is raising the specter of his own impeachment but some of his most fervent backers insist that it makes perfect electoral sense the greatest driver in politics is the fear of a loss said andy surabian a former special assistant to the president and deputy white house strategist and there is no bigger potential loss for republican voters to be fearful of than the loss of trump as president that s what a democrat controlled house could bring about through impeachment another gop operative added the old campaign hands all agree that the gop must put trump on the ballot but establishment republicans are in full panic the reasons for their anxiety are clear enough they fear that trump whose approval ratings remain low will be a millstone around the necks of republican candidates they worry about his propensity to create media firestorms on a near daily basis and they think that both those factor will combine to nationalize the election to the detriment of gop lawmakers who might otherwise be able to run on their records of delivering on local priorities doug heye a former communications director for the republican national committee rnc drew attention to the high number of gop retirements this year a phenomenon he compared with people evacuating in advance of a hurricane heye added that when he was fighting the 2010 campaign within the rnc he and his colleagues thought the magic number that would allow them to win the house back would be an approval rating for then president obama of 46 percent or lower on mondayafternoon trump s job approval in the realclearpolitics polling average stood at 42 9 percent if trump won a district or state handily that is obviously a different calculus heye said but in the purple states or swing districts it is very hard to be successful conversely however there are some democrats who seem to share the basic analysis of the lewandowski bossie bannon camp especially when it comes to threats of impeachment former senatedemocratic leader harry

impeachment effort democratic strategist hank sheinkopf told the hill that they were right the thing that democrats have going for them right now is that the republican electorate is not excited but the best way to excite them is to go after them impeachment they will see as really going after them sheinkopf said the whole trick for democrats is to avoid exciting republicans he added excite them at your own risk it is precisely that sense of excitement that some in trump s orbit are trying to create a full bore position of support for the president was the only real way forward surabian argued the idea that republicans in d c could or should try to separate president trump from the midterms that s happy talk it s not reality he said in a lot of ways 2018 is going to be a referendum on the president he added you can either run away from that and split the party in half or embrace it and use it to energize the party the memo is a reported column by niall stanage primarily focused
