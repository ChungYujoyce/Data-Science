washington bernie sanders won new hampshire s democrat primary with slightly more than one quarter of the vote he has fewer delegates than pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana so why are many center left democrats worried that the self described democratic socialist is the favorite to win the nomination because there are too many candidates in the party s center lane dividing up the rest of the vote every time a moderate alternative fades another emerges dan pfeiffer who worked on barack obama s 2008 campaign said on his podcast the day after the new hampshire primary in terms of delegate allocation he s in a very very strong position other candidates have accelerated attacks on sanders he could end up a main target in wednesday night s debate in nevada where voting has begun for the caucuses that wrap up saturday a poll taken this month by the las vegas review journal shows sanders leading the field in nevada thatcausesconsternation among some democrats who saysanders wouldn t be as strong a general election candidate against president donald trump there are also fearsthat a sanders nomination could make it harder for the democrats defending the swing congressional districts that won the party the house majorityin 2018 i know that there s a panic among some quarters of the democratic party about bernie sanders because he has a base and he has the resources to go on veteran democratic strategist david axelrod said on hispodcastwednesday axelrod added that sanders should be worriedthat he hasn t shown he can grow his base it s hard to 25 your

first brokered convention in 68 years more bloomberg once blamed end of redlining for 2008 housing collapse in the past 20 years the share of democratic and democratic leaning registered voters who describe themselves as liberal or very liberal has increased from 27 in 2000 to 47 in 2019 according to the pew research center a slightly larger share of democratic voters view themselves as moderate 38 or conservative 14 i m a centrist democrat i m not a progressive i think some of the stuff he talks about is just financially unrealistic steve nadeau a biden fan from massachusetts said about sanders it s too radical democrats and democratic leaning voters share similar attitudes on a wide range of values and some specific issues but there s a difference ofintensity for example most democrats support making tuition free at public universities and building a government run health insurance program backers of sanders and warren feel most strongly about those proposals according to a survey in january by the pew research center at the start of the year biden had the advantage among conservative and moderate democrats liberal democrats were divided among multiple candidates very liberal democrats narrowly preferred sanders over warren pew surveys show but biden and warren failed to win much support when voting began a plan to fight back how elizabeth warren stumbled in new hampshire and her plan for the long haul exit polls in new hampshire show sanders won 46 of very liberal voters he and buttigieg competed heavily for somewhat liberal voters buttigieg and klobuchar tied among moderates that left sanders atop the field with 26 despite the fact that 53 of new hampshire democrats backed either buttigieg klobuchar or biden it says a lot about the current dem state of affairs that bernie sanders has a much better chance of winning the nomination after winning 26 of the vote in nh than he did after winning 60 of it four years ago tweeted david wasserman a political analyst at the nonpartisan cook political report democrats face a somewhat similar situation to what republicans went through in 2016 with their crowded field of candidates trump became the gop nominee despite the fact that only 23 of republican voters consistently supported him from the start of the nominating process through april 2016 according to pew surveys trump was helped by the fact that unlike in the democrats nominating contest many states awarded all delegates to the top vote getter trump for example won all of south carolina s delegates despite getting less than a third of the primary vote in new hampshire sanders and buttigieg each won nine delegates despite sanders 1 3 percentage point victory overbuttigieg if sanders gets a delegate lead democrats proportional allotment of delegates couldmake it difficult for others to catch him that could happen on super tuesday when one third of delegates are at stake according to pfeiffer if sanders wins california by 8 to 10percentage points he could net 100 more delegates than others get overcoming such an advantage would require another candidate not just beating him in other states but doing so with a large majority if warren biden klobuchar buttigieg and bloomberg are all still competing on super tuesday sanders could effectively wrap up the nomination by april 1 pfeiffer predicted defied expectations amy klobuchar s new hampshire surprise means a new battle for money and attention sanders has not been subject to a sustained attack warren hasn t gone after him in their competition for the party s most liberal voters criticism from the center left may increase particularly over sanders championing of medicare for all others say it s medicare for all or nothing buttigieg says in a nevada ad i approved this message to say the choice should be yours nevada s most politically powerful union the casino workers culinary union declined to endorse a candidate butit warned membersthat the insurance theywould get under medicare for all might not be as good as their union negotiated plans staying neutral nevada s powerful culinary union won t endorse in democratic presidential primary sanders narrowly lost nevada to hillary clinton in 2016 he s made extensive outreach to latino voters since sanders was crushed by clinton in south carolina the first state with a significant african american population to vote his prospects are threatened by the possibility of a single candidate winning a large share of the black vote according to analysts at the university of virginia s center for politics that threat has greatly diminished as bidenstruggles what state is next when are the 2020 presidential election primaries even before iowa and new hampshire failed to winnow the field of center left candidates to one obvious challenger to sanders democrat mike rosler worried about whether the party could overcome internal divisions it s the democrats to lose as long as there s no infighting rosler 44 aresearch scientist from massachusetts said at anevent for biden last month in new hampshire if the vote is not splintered it s unwinnable for trump and it s unlosable for democrats i think it can only be self defeated contributing joey garrison
