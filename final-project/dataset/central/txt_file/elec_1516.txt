we think we know trump nation perhaps from polls that show it is older and whiter less affluent and less educated its denizens are not as conservative as most republicans and not as politically involved and they are famously angry with washington barack obama and political correctness we re gonna be the smart people donald trump told his supporters after winning the nevada presidential caucus we re not gonna be the people that get pushed around but trump nation is more than a demographic or an attitude to get beyond the clich s the usa today network interviewed scores of trump supporters some in every state for a more nuanced understanding of who they are and why they support such an unconventional and often contradictory candidate it s as much because of who they are as who he is for many of these americans voting this november will be deeply personal trump has aroused something inside them often anger frustration and fear but also hope two words that recurred in interviews with his supporters were country and jobs in trump some see themselves donald trump is not politically correct and i am not politically correct said bill miller 59 of dover n j others see themselves as they wish they were trump said aaron wilson a 34 year old new harmony ind real estate agent and auctioneer is saying the things that a lot of people want to say but they can t the people of trump nation are ones who fly the flag say the pledge wish you merry christmas maybe even if they don t know whether you observe christmas they drive the trucks man the sales counters fix the plumbing manage billions they re a small town jeweler who on his own initiative opened a local trump headquarters a florida woman who admires trump for complaining about a mexican american judge because she d be reluctant to a baseball umpire who doesn t believe a woman should be president a 73 year old tennessee woman who finds nothing more upsetting than men in women s restrooms except men in women s locker rooms and many are like miller who complains about political correctness but has a more concrete motivation he hopes that trump will bring back jobs and that he ll get one generalizing about trump nation which accounts for at least 40 of the electorate is perilous as trump himself said after winning the south carolina primary his voters were short people tall people i won fat people skinny people i won highly educated ok educated and practically not educated at all i won the evangelicals big and i won the military a pew survey also shows that the majority of trump voters as well as clinton voters view their choice as a vote against the other candidate rather than for their own clintonnation this is why americans are voting for hillary clinton in these interviews trump supporters used the same talking points and buzz words heard repeatedly on cable television and talk radio but deeper themes emerged a feeling of being stifled unable to speak frankly about issues like welfare race or immigration and thus an admiration for trump who does a nostalgia for america as it was and a yearning for its restoration an aversion to the usual political cant and hypocrisy that makes trump s apparent candor seem a tonic a disdain for hillary clinton that makes trump however divisive insulting or crude the lesser evil trump is not an evangelical christian but he appeals to those who have repeatedly been disappointed by candidates promising crackdowns on abortion and same sex marriage he may not be a real conservative but he appeals to those who have seen government grow under conservatives about three quarters of trump supporters believe life in america has gotten worse compared to a fifth of clinton voters according to a pew survey trump nation reveres the past in usa today network interviews the word again was used far more frequently by trump s voters than clinton s we are going to become just another country where our government is basically the babysitter or we re going to become a country that shows self sufficiency again like it did when i was a young man said pat acciavatti 77 of st clair township mich the country i grew up in is definitely not the country i live in trump has converted white evangelical protestants 72 of whom say the american way of life has changed for the worse since the 50s and conservative catholics into what robert jones ceo of the public religion research institute calls nostalgia voters evangelicals admit that a twice divorced former casino operator who says he s never sought god s forgiveness is not one of them but they re attracted by his promise to deliver what other presidents like george w bush did not and to win where other candidates like mitt romney lost i m a born again christian and a conservative and that s kind of how i vote said lora hubbel 58 of vermillion s d trump she conceded doesn t necessarily fit that bill but the last one who did was jimmy carter so him being the second worst president behind our current one maybe you don t always want what you think you want she ll vote for trump many trump supporters said they feel their religious beliefs are not respected and in fact violated by government decrees and court decisions and that their right to free speech is being restricted by an excess of political correctness as elizabeth lynch an 18 year old college student from centennial colo put it simply i m extremely pro life so i liked what he said about protecting religious freedom and liberty those feelings intersect with those who feel betrayed by politicians and are therefore attracted by what they see as trump s candor he doesn t have the political jargon said sharon heard 59 of mansfield ohio if you ask him a question he ll answer it straight on and even if someone is trying to dig him about something he ll face it yeah you re right i did do that next question not dance around the answer trump voters used the term political in interviews twice as often as clinton supporters and almost never positively if we continue to vote for the same old governors the same old senators the same old politicians we re going to get the same old government said roz lesser 71 of cape coral fla a retired accountant since it hasn t worked with the career politicians she wants to give trump a chance government bureaucrats also draw the ire of trump supporters so many people in washington in government gosh you name a department in d c education or whatever they have no life experience other than being on a faculty or teaching or in an academic world that s not real said wayne ryan 68 of alexandria la more than half of trump supporters 55 view their vote primarily as one against clinton 41 view it more as a vote for trump trump supporters are so hungry for change and so eager to stop clinton that they re willing to overlook what they admit is bad behavior do i wish there were other choices involved asked longtime republican bob langevin 72 of tequesta fla i do but i am honestly voting more against hillary than i am for donald trump erwin jackson 65 a tallahassee fla real estate investor feels the same way when you are looking at someone who i believe is a crook he said referring to clinton vs someone who sometimes has a bad attitude i will go with the guy who has a bad attitude any day of the week voters are always willing to explain away the faults of candidates who touch them trump is no exception he s had a few bankruptcies in his past but what successful businessman hasn t asked dan koehler a 42 year old forklift driver who lives in petal miss you get an idea and you go with it so hey you made money and if it doesn t work that s what bankruptcy is for to the true believers of trump nation the republican nominee is the best since ronald reagan stephanie silva 39 of warwick r i heard all the candidates during the primaries when she heard trump she recalled it was almost as if he was speaking to me it was almost as if he knew my family s problems armed with white paper and sharpies journalists from across the usa today networkspoke with residents in every stateto better understand who will
