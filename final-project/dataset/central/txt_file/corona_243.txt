washington ap the trump administration is sticking with its crowd friendly waiver of entrance fees at national parks during the coronavirus pandemic as managers at some parks try and fail to keep visitors a safe distance apart and communities appeal for a shutdown at other parks that are still open while the interior department agreed this week to requests from local managers of yellowstone and some other iconic national parks to close others remained open and newly free of charge in arizona local governments and the navajo nation were waiting for an answer thursday on their request earlier this week for federal officials to shut down grand canyon national park as cases of the coronavirus grow in surrounding areas we think it s just in the best interest of the community the visitors and the staff said lena fowler a supervisor in coconino county which includes the grand canyon what we re really concerned about is making sure everyone is safe park officials announced thursday evening that three of the canyon s most popular trails bright angel south kaibab and north kaibab were being temporarily closed as of noon friday with some other operations being modified the national parks conservation association a nonprofit group that advocates on park policy issues called the administration s decision to keep the grand canyon open beyond reckless the trump administration has issued guidelines to americans urging them to stay at home whenever necessary skip discretionary travel and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people but critics see the move to keep the parks open as a mixed message with potentially dangerous consequences for virus spread as jobless rates explode and the death toll surges in the country the republican president also is increasingly pushing to convey a rapid return to normalcy the national park service is deciding whether to shut down individual sites on a park by park basis in consultation with state and local health officials nicholas goodwin a spokesman for interior secretary david bernhardt said thursday goodwin said a decision by bernhardt earlier this month to waive entrance fees during the pandemic was meant to give a financial break to those visitors who had decided they wanted to go not to draw people outdoors and together on vistas and trails as coranavirus deaths and illnesses grow it was not meant to create a flood of people to national parks goodwin said great smoky mountains national park was one of those whose request to close was granted by the interior department earlier this week there the number of visitors last week surged over the previous year s figures despite infection risks with about 30 000 people entering the park each day despite efforts at smoky mountains park to protect staff and visitors from covid 19 including closing restrooms and visitor centers the park found it impossible to keep people from crowding together in popular spots spokeswoman dana soehn said the day after the closure announcement park officials learned that an employee had tested positive for covid 19 we looked at different models including closing just the highly congested trails but in the end we decided to support the local community efforts to decrease unnecessary travel she said in the southwest local health officials for arches and canyonlands national parks also urged the park service thursday to shut down those sites despite orders barring out of town residents from staying overnight hundreds of visitors are still coming to the parks said bradon bradford with the southeast utah health department that puts park staff at risk of infection especially when shortages have left them unable to get items they need to keep the restrooms sanitized he said the small rural hospital could still be overwhelmed if people get seriously ill officials said across the united states deaths from covid 19 topped 1 200 on thursday and there were more than 80 000 confirmed coronavirus cases for most people the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks for some especially older adults and people with existing
