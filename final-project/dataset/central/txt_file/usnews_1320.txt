president donald trump s longtime fixer revealed damaging information about everything from his business practices to his campaign in testimony before congress wednesday speaking under oath before the house oversight committee michael cohen claimed that trump routinely lied about the values of his business properties knew ahead of time that hillary clinton s emails would be leaked and spoke with cohen in the oval office about a hush money payment to a porn star among other things mr trump is an enigma cohen testified he is complicated as am i he has both good and bad as do we all but the bad far outweighs the good and since taking office he has become the worst version of himself cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison in december after pleading guilty to tax evasion campaign finance violations and making false financial statements separately he also pleaded guilty to lying to congress in 2017 about the timing of a trump tower project in russia republicans used cohen s missteps to question the credibility his testimony wednesday here s a look at some of the biggest claims from cohen s testimony claim federal prosecutors in the southern district of new york are looking into an unnamed criminal matter involving trump or one of his associates quote cohen asked about the last time he talked to someone working for trump unfortunately this topic is actually something that s being investigated right now by the southern district of new york and i ve been asked by them not to discuss it not to give these issues evidence he did not provide further evidence bottom line it s unlikely that cohen would make up something like this but without knowing more it s hard to say how important this investigation might be or whether it may even end with any charges claim cohen said that trump talked with him during a meeting in the oval office about reimbursement checks for hush money he paid to keep porn star stormy daniels from talking about their affair quote in february of 2017 one month into his presidency i visited president trump in the oval office for the first time and it s truly awe inspiring he s showing me all around and pointing to different paintings and he says to me something to the effect of don t worry michael your january and february reimbursement checks are coming evidence cohen submitted to congress two 35 000 checks he said were given to him to reimburse him for the payments one signed by trump from his personal account and another signed by donald trump jr from the revocable trust that owns trump s business bottom line trump is already essentially an unindicted co conspirator in a federal case regarding the hush money and campaign finance laws and could be in legal jeopardy after he leaves office the checks and the oval office conversation are very damaging claim cohen said that trump indirectly told him to lie about the trump tower moscow project in personal conversations and by saying publicly that he had no business in russia quote mr trump did not directly tell me to lie to congress that s not how he operates in conversations we had during the campaign at the same time i was actively negotiating in russia for him he would look me in the eye and tell me there s no russian business and then go on to lie to the american people by saying the same thing in his way he was telling me to lie evidence he did not provide further evidence trump signed a letter of intent in october of 2015 on the project and his lawyer rudy giuliani acknowledged in january that negotiations on the project may have gone all the way up until election day bottom line trump regularly claimed during the campaign and the early part of his administration that he did not have any business with russia cohen s testimony underscores that trump s claims were not true claim cohen said that trump s personal lawyers reviewed and edited his untruthful statement to congress about the timing of the moscow tower project ahead of time and that he met with trump and attorney jay sekulow in the white house to discuss his testimony quote you need to know that mr trump s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to congress about the timing of the moscow tower negotiations before i gave it about the oval office meeting he wanted me to cooperate he also wanted just to ensure by making the statement and i said in my testimony there is no russia there is no collusion there is no there was no deal he goes it s all a witch hunt and its he goes this this stuff has to end evidence he did not provide further evidence bottom line cohen pleaded guilty in federal court to a charge of lying to congress about the project it s unlikely that his claim would get trump in any trouble however claim cohen said that he briefed donald trump jr and ivanka trump about the trump tower moscow project approximately 10 times during the course of business quote asked if ivanka trump jared kushner and donald trump jr knew about the moscow tower project the company was involved in the deal which meant that the family was involved in the deal asked how many times he briefed them approximately 10 in total evidence he did not provide further evidence bottom line ivanka trump told cnn she knew literally almost nothing about the moscow tower project donald trump jr testified under oath before congress that he was only peripherally aware of it cohen s testimony directly contradicts those claims claim cohen said roger stone a longtime informal adviser to trump told trump in advance about a wikileaks release of hillary clinton emails in 2016 quote mr trump knew from roger stone in advance about the wikileaks drop of emails in july of 2016 days before the democratic convention i was in mr trump s office when his secretary announced that roger stone was on the phone mr trump put mr stone on the speakerphone mr stone told mr trump that he had just gotten off the phone with julian assange and that mr assange told mr stone that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage hillary clinton s campaign mr trump responded by stating to the effect wouldn t that be great evidence he did not provide further evidence bottom line in an indictment special counsel robert mueller charged that stone gave information about wikileaks to senior trump campaign officials cohen s testimony suggests that could mean trump himself as well claim cohen said trump inflated his business property values to appear wealthy and secure loans but deflated his assets in order to reduce his real estate taxes quote it was my experience that mr trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes such as trying to be listed amongst the wealthiest people in forbes and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes i am sharing with you two newspaper articles side by side that are examples of mr trump inflating and deflating his assets as i said to suit his financial interest evidence cohen submitted statements of financial condition from 2011 2012 and 2013 with figures that cohen believes were inflated in part because they show sudden and unexplained fluctuations in trump s net worth bottom line while trump often boasts about how wealthy he is he has consistently refused to release his tax returns raising questions about whether he has been as successful as he claims and whether he has skirted tax laws to increase his fortune claim cohen claimed that trump ran for president in order to get publicity for his business efforts and never expected to win quote mr trump would often say this campaign was going to be the greatest infomercial and political history he never expected to win the primary he never expected to win the general election the campaign for him was always a marketing opportunity evidence he did not provide further evidence bottom line michael wolff s fire and fury about the white house made a similar claim which the white house and members of the campaign have long disputed claim cohen said that trump asked him to threaten his alma maters to prevent them from releasing his personal school records quote when i say con man i m talking about a man who declares himself brilliant but directed me to threaten his high school his colleges and the college board to never release his grades or sat scores evidence cohen gave congress a letter to fordham university threatening them with legal action if his grades were released a representative of fordham confirmed that they received a phone call and a letter about trump s grades bottom line though it s not as important as some of cohen s other revelations the threats are interesting because trump regularly questioned president barack obama s grades claim cohen said that trump asked him to threaten or intimidate people who had potentially damaging information about trump 500 times quote asked how many times trump requested that cohen threaten an individual or entity on his behalf cohen initially responded quite a few times when pushed further he said that trump probably asked him to threaten people with litigation or intimidation 500 times in the 10 years he worked for trump evidence in addition to the letter threatening fordham that cohen gave congress as part of the exhibits for his testimony he also acknowledged a tape recording of him threatening a daily beast reporter bottom line the claim rings true with other accounts of how cohen operated while working for trump claim cohen said donald trump jr told his father and got his approval before a 2016 meeting at trump tower with a russian attorney offering to assist the trump campaign with dirt on hillary clinton quote i remembered being in a room with mr trump probably in early june 2016 when something peculiar happened don trump jr came into the room and walked behind his father s desk which in and of itself was unusual people didn t just walk behind mr trump s desk to talk to him and i recalled don jr leaning over to his father and speaking in a low voice which i could clearly hear and saying the meeting is all set i remember mr trump saying ok good let me know what struck me as i looked back and thought about the exchange between don jr and his father was first that mr trump had frequently told me and others that his son don jr had the worst judgment of anyone in the world and also that don jr would never set up any meeting of significance alone and certainly not without checking with his father i also knew that nothing went on in trump world especially the campaign without mr trump s knowledge and approval so i concluded that don jr was referring to that june 2016 trump tower meeting about dirt on hillary with the russian representatives when he walked behind his dad s desk that day and that mr trump knew that was the meeting don jr was talking about when he said that s good let me know evidence he did not provide further evidence bottom line trump has long denied that he knew anything about the meeting between donald trump jr his son in law jared kushner campaign chairman paul manafort and a kremlin connected lawyer cohen s testimony contradicts that claim but it is circumstantial evidence at best claim trump directed cohen to pay someone to purchase a portrait of himself at an auction spending 60 000 so his portrait would be the highest priced item sold at the event trump paid the fake bidder using money from the charitable trump foundation and kept the portrait for himself quote mr trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an art hamptons event the objective was to ensure that his portrait which was going to be auctioned last would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon the portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for 60 000 mr trump directed the trump foundation which is supposed to be a charitable organization to repay the fake bidder despite keeping the art for himself evidence cohen submitted a copy of an article about the auction with trump s handwriting on it along with a tweet from july 16 2013 in which trump boasted about his portrait selling for 60 000 bottom line this would be the third known instance of trump using money from his charity to purchase a portrait of himself at an auction according to cohen s testimony and reporting by washington post reporter david fahrenthold trump has faced scrutiny for allegedly using the charitable trump foundation for his own benefit and agreed last year to shut down the organization new york attorney general letitia james is still pursuing a lawsuit against the foundation accusing it of persistently illegal conduct claim cohen said that trump regularly makes racist comments when he is in private quote mr trump is a racist the country has seen mr trump court white supremacists and bigots you have heard him call poorer countries shitholes in private he is even worse cohen said during his opening statement he once asked me if i can name a country run by a black person that wasn t a shithole this was when barack obama was president of the united states and while we were once driving through a struggling neighborhood in chicago he commented that only black people could live that way and he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid and yet i continued to work for him evidence he did not provide further evidence bottom line the remarks are in line with a report that trump called haiti el salvador and parts of africa shithole countries in a meeting with lawmakers trump has countered that he is the least racist person on multiple occasions correction feb 28 the original version of this story misidentified the new york attorney general pursuing a lawsuit against the trump foundation in june then new york attorney general barbara underwood announced the lawsuit but it continues today under attorney general letitia james who took office in january write to katie reilly at katie reilly time com and abigail abrams at abigail abrams time com
