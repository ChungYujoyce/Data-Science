a vocal advocate for blasey ford in 2018 our representation of tarareade has nothing to do with politics we at wigdor llp firmly believe that every survivor of sexual assault has the right to competent legal counsel and we will represent ms reade zealously just as we would any other victim of sexual violence the firm said on twitter on thursday this never happened joe biden denies sexual assault allegation calls on national archives to release records what we know former staffer tara reade says joe biden sexually assaulted her in 1993 reade accused biden of sexually assaulting her when she worked in his senate office in 1993 biden denied the allegationin an msnbc morning joe interview last week this never ever happened he said i don t know what is motivating her but it s irrelevant it never happened it never happened period reade saidshe complained about sexual harassment to her supervisors at the time but they denied having such conversations in interviews with the new york times reade has also said she filed a report with a senate personnel office but does not have a copy of it the senate secretary has said any such report could not be disclosed to the public the biden campaign didn t respond directly to reade s comments in the kelly interview but sent a statement to usa today that referred to inconsistencies in reade s story kate bedingfield deputy campaign manager cited reports from the associated press and vox that include resurfaced interview comments from 2019 when reade came forward as part of a group of women who said biden inappropriately touched them vox reported that an anonymous friend now recounts reade s assault story but in 2019 said biden never tried to kiss her directly he never went for one of those touches ap published her older quote which she said before she had come forward with her assault claim i wasn t scared of him that he was going to take me in a room or anything it wasn t that kind of vibe reade has said she didn t mention assault last year because she feared the potential backlash every day more and more inconsistencies arise women must receive the benefitof the doubt they must be able to come forward and share their stories without fear of retribution or harm and we all have a responsibility to ensure that bedingfield said at the same time we can never sacrifice the truth and the truth is that these allegations are false and that the material that has been presented to back them up under scrutiny keeps proving their falsity wigdor llp said on twitter it would be inevitable that people will attack the firm noting douglas wigdor supported president donald trump in 2016 but that the firm s mission is to provide counsel to all legitimate victims her harrowing account is credible and supported by numerous outcry witnesses from decades ago wigdor llp said
