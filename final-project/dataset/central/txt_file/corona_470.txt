required to file federal tax returns for 2018 or 2019 will receive 1 200 stimulus payments automatically based on information contained in their 1099 benefit statements no additional paperwork is required per the latest guidance from the irs the irs reversed an earlier decision and now says it will look at 1099 benefit statements form ssa 1099 and form rrb 1099 to get the information it needs to send out the 1 200 payments automatically in the same manner monthly benefits are received the vast majority of social security recipients receive monthly benefits by direct deposit aarp fought hard to ensure these payments would go to people who rely on social security and aren t required to file taxes said bill sweeney aarp s senior vice president for government affairs it was just wrong to ask them to fill out extra paperwork especially in the middle of this crisis to get the benefits they need we are very thankful the irs reversed course and agreed to work with social security to get these checks out automatically without extra paperwork or red tape stimulus payments will also go out automatically to social security disability insurance ssdi recipients who were not required to file tax returns for 2018 or 2019 like social security beneficiaries ssdi beneficiaries also receive ssa 1099 benefits statements every january which the irs will use to send the payments on april 15

payments for ssi recipients to go out no later than early may the irs also has announced that people who receive compensation and pensions c p benefits from the department of veterans affairs will receive their stimulus payments automatically even if they have not filed tax returns for 2018 or 2019 the irs which made the announcement on april 17 did not say when the stimulus payments would be sent to va beneficiaries people who receive va benefits social security retirement ssdi or ssi benefits and railroad retirement benefits who also have dependent children under the age of 17 who qualify for stimulus money should complete theirs online form for non filers in order to get the additional 500 per child payments for these dependents beneficiaries in these group who do not provide
