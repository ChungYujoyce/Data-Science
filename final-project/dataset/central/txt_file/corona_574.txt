dr anthony fauci the nation apos s top expert on infectious disease on friday rejected a conspiracy theory that the novel coronavirus was created in and escaped a chinese lab at the daily white house press briefing a reporter asked mr president i wanted to ask dr fauci could you address these suggestions or concerns that this virus was somehow manmade possibly came out of a laboratory in china there was a study recently that we can make available to you where a group of highly qualified evolutionary virologists looked at the sequences there and the sequences in bats as they evolve and the mutations that it took to get to the point where it is now is totally consistent with a jump of a species from an animal to a human fauci replied he underscored in his remarks that studies of the virus apos genome have strongly indicated that it was transmitted from an animal to a human rather than created or enhanced in a laboratory setting as a review in a scientific journal found we do not believe that any type of laboratory based scenario is plausible an analysis published in nature medicine in mid march said the study led by computational biologist kristian andersen of the scripps research institute in california compared covid 19 to the six other coronaviruses known to infect humans the analysis explicitly states that the evidence shows sars cov 2 is not a purposefully manipulated virus the us intelligence community has also been investigating whether the virus was collected by researchers and then accidentally leaked from a chinese lab but has found no evidence to date backing it up according to politico which cited multiple sources familiar with the matter us officials reportedly raised issues about a wuhan based lab apos s security procedures in 2018 according to the washington post the centers for disease control and prevention has also said that the origins of the virus appear to be linked to a large seafood and live animal market suggesting animal to person spread but the president and his allies in the right wing media continue promoting the theory that the virus escaped from a chinese lab more and more we apos re hearing the story and we apos ll see trump said on wednesday scientists and authorities have not come to a firm conclusion about where the animal to human transmission first occurred and what role the wet market may have played on friday when asked how active the investigation was into whether the virus escaped a lab in wuhan china trump said we are looking at it a lot of people are looking at it it seems to make sense a lot of strange things are happening but there is a lot of investigation going on and we apos re going to find out trump added meanwhile fox news the president apos s preferred tv network has been pushing the lab narrative hard over the past week sources believe coronavirus outbreak originated in wuhan lab as part of china apos s efforts to compete with us a report published on wednesday and co authored by fox news anchor bret baier said along these lines trump apos s advisers and congressional allies have been hammering china in recent days excoriating the chinese government over its lack of transparency about coronavirus gop sen tom cotton of arkansas who has suggested the virus was developed in a chinese super lab on wednesday told sean hannity of fox news that china must be made to pay the price if it apos s determined the virus came out of a wuhan lab similarly secretary of state mike pompeo on wednesday told fox news we really need the chinese government to open up they say they want to cooperate one of the best ways they could find to cooperate would be to let the world in to let the world apos s scientists know exactly how this came to be exactly how this virus began to spread trump on friday also expressed skepticism over the chinese government apos s official death toll from the novel coronavirus which originated in wuhan china based on the available data the us is the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic with the highest number of reported cases and confirmed deaths but trump dismissed those numbers we don apos t have the most in the world deaths the most in the world has to be china it is a massive country they must have the most trump said during friday apos s press briefing as of friday evening there were nearly 700 000 reported cases of coronavirus in the us and over 36 000 confirmed deaths according to data from johns hopkins university comparatively the data said china has seen nearly 84 000 cases and over 4 600 deaths beyond trump there apos s been widespread skepticism across the international community over china apos s official numbers but the chinese government has rejected allegations of a cover up amid the increased focus on china the trump administration continues to face strong criticism from democratic lawmakers and public health experts over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic trump spent weeks downplaying the threat of the virus on top of early stumbles at the federal level that left the us behind much of the world on testing for the virus the lack of widespread testing is one of the biggest hurdles to the future returning to work places of non essential employees some democrats and former us officials have accused trump of using china and more recently the world health organization who as a scapegoat to deflect from his own failures in handling coronavirus the president earlier this week announced a plan to cut funding to the who criticizing the agency for praising china apos s transparency in the early days of the outbreak but trump was also praising china around the same time and continued to applaud its handling of the crisis well into february as the virus was spreading in the us trump has pushed back hard on any criticism of his response and berated reporters who apos ve questioned him about the testing shortages in the us vice president mike pence and other officials on the coronavirus task force on friday said that the capacity of testing for coronavirus in the us has increased to a point where governors can initiate the first of three phases that are part of the administration apos s guidelines on easing social distancing and reopening the economy but earlier on friday new york gov andrew cuomo emphasized that his state which has been hit the hardest by the novel coronavirus still needs help from the federal government with testing on monday trump falsely claimed he had total authority to force governors to end coronavirus restrictions in order to restart the economy but he backtracked by thursday and said he would leave such decisions up to the states by friday however trump was on twitter encouraging residents of virginia and michigan to liberate their states which came as some states have seen protests against stay at home orders when asked about this at friday apos s press briefing trump said he did not think his tweets were at odds with the administration apos s measured guidance for easing restrictions that leaves the timeline up to governors do you have a personal experience with the coronavirus you d like to
