said young people should not use the disruptions associated with the pandemic as a vacation or an opening to socialize we cannot have these large gatherings that continue to occur she warned birx said the roughly 110 deaths reported from the coronavirus as of wednesday represent cases of infections that took place two to three weeks ago many americans could yet begin to show symptoms and many others may be unknowingly carrying the virus and transmitting it without themselves becoming sick that s why birx and other officials have stressed the need to limit travel and sharply revised their warnings about precautionary measures she said researchers are still attempting to learn how much transmission comes from human to human contact and how much comes from interacting with contaminated surfaces birx and other authorities also have stressed the importance of proper hand washing trump urged americans to accept the disruptions and isolation that the pandemic has wrought likening the

the coronavirus he rejected questions about the effect of his words on asian americans as the president and other allies escalate the focus they ve placed on the chinese origins of the pathogen trump said he didn t agree with some critics of china who said that it had inflicted the virus on the u s and the world but the president said he did think chinese officials could have given the world an earlier warning about the severity of the disease disruptions to airlines separately trump talked to airline ceos on wednesday the second time this month he has talked to an industry that has seen its business grind to a halt as people stay home the airline industry says the pandemic has had a more deleterious effect on business than the attacks of sept 11 2001 and has sought a government bailout
