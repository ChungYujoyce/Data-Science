washington by way of london and estimates the whole experience will have cost her around 10 000 out of pocket by law the state department charges a median full fare price for the planes it charters

to stay in the country the goal is to finally get them to a point where they re going to be happy with their decision she says we can t make it for them the state department also offers short term loans for travelers who don t have the funds to get home phaneuf and her team in ecuador have helped evacuate 3 400 people giving them letters of safe passage to get them through curfew closed streets

million americans the state department estimates live overseas brownlee is blunt with his advice to those who have decided to stay think about where you are and if you have the funds to last if the country shuts down travel and your paycheck stops think about whether you could get medical treatment if you contract the virus or if you could get treatment if you have another illness do you have a home in the continental united states where you could ride out the coming storm or as he likens it the tsunami that s roaring toward the beach following the earthquake that is covid 19 don t expect the u s embassy or consulate near you to tell you what to do we generally don t tell people now is the time to get out of that country we encourage people to assess their own situation brownlee says but he says if you choose to remain overseas you should be prepared to remain where you are for the foreseeable future please send tips leads and stories from the frontlines to virus time com contact
