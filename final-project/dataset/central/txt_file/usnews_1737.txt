in the first one on one democratic primary debate sunday former vice president joe biden vowed to pick a woman vice president and promised to appoint a black woman to the supreme court when asked about his plans for a running mate vermont senator bernie sanders said that in all likelihood he would also pick a woman but that his running mate would be a progressive i commit that if i m elected president and i have an opportunity to appoint someone to the courts i ll appoint the first black woman to the court said vice president biden meaning the supreme court if i m elected president my cabinet and my administration will look like the country and i commit that i will in fact pick a woman to be vice president there are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow i would pick a woman to be my vice president this was the first time that biden who became the democratic frontrunner after victories in michigan and washington last week has definitively promised to pick a woman running mate the promise rules out the possibility of a ticket that includes recent male endorsers like senator cory booker or south bend mayor pete buttigieg former presidential candidate andrew yang joked on twitter that biden didn t mention that to me when we spoke and added a smiley emoji for several minutes moderator dana bash attempted to ask senator sanders whether he too would promise to select a woman vice president at first sanders tried to confront biden about his previous support for the hyde amendment which blocks federal funding for abortion and touted his voting record from naral finally bash was able to directly ask him whether he would pick a woman running mate in all likelihood i will sanders said for me it s not just nominating a woman it s making sure that we have a progressive woman and there are progressive women out there so my very strong tendency is to move in that direction this essentially ruled out the possibility that if nominated sanders would pick a moderate running mate who might appeal to biden voters and unite the party write to charlotte alter at charlotte alter time com
