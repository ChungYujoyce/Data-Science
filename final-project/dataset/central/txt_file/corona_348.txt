in a march 10 episode of the podcast the nutrimedical report commentator josh bernstein claimed the spread of covid 19 in the united states was the result of a conspiracy between the democratic party and chinese government i believe that because russia didn t work and ukraine didn t work and impeachment didn t work they are so hell bent on destroying this country and this president to gain back power that they probably worked with the chinese government and they devised this plan bernstein said the nutrimedical report is an alternative health podcast hosted by dr bill deagle a former medical practitioner who promotes health products he frequently hosts commentators on the podcast to discuss a range of issues including health politics and current events during the episode bernstein also claimed democrats and the chinese governmentused the medical deep state to spread the virus among the american publicto scare the living daylights out of everybody to shut down the economy to shut down the markets and to stop the trump rallies the viewthat political opponents of trump are using the coronavirus pandemic for partisan ends has been echoed elsewhere in the media as well as by the president and his allies the explicit claim that democratic party officials conspired with a foreign government specifically beijing to engineer a pandemic for political gain is however not supported by any available facts usa today reached out to bernstein and deagle for comment but did not receive a response from either scientists broadly agree that covid 19 began in or near wuhan china in late 2019 the centers for disease control and prevention confirmed the first case of coronavirus in the united states on jan 20 in washington state fact check coronavirus originated in china not elsewhere researchers and studies say according to the cdc covid 19 spreads like other respiratory viruses through person to person contactas well as when a person coughs or sneezes those infected can carry the virus without showing symptoms which makesthem more likely to spread the disease without being diagnosed on march 16 english actor idris elba posted a video to social media saying he hadtested positive for covid 19 though he hadn t shown any symptoms the actor got tested because i realized i was exposed to someone who also tested positive look this is serious now is the time to really think about social distancing and washing your hands elba said beyond that there are people out there who aren t showing symptoms who can easily spread it tested positive idris elba game of thrones star kristofer hivju nba player donovan mitchell of the utah jazz likewise said recently that he is positive but not experiencing any symptoms when cases of covid 19 were discovered in the u s widespread testing was not yet available to most americans as a result it is difficult to map what areas are affected most by the virus as well as what path covid 19 has taken throughout the nation while the cdc saystransmission from people showing no signs of disease is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads early studies of covid 19 outbreaks in other countries point to the possibility that silent transmission is underrated without any intervention viruses such as covid 19 would be expected to spread exponentially early reported numbers of cases in china italy japan south korea the united states and elsewhere reflect this exponential trend that otherwise healthy people may unknowingly transfer the disease further explains how covid 19 reached pandemic levels the worst case scenario is either you do nothing or your mitigation and containments don t succeed said dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious disease who is helping spearhead the federal government s response to the coronavirus though the cdc projects that 40 60 of the country could be infected by the virus fauci cautioned that although that s possible it is unlikely if we do the kinds of things that we re essentially outlining right now public health officials around the world are urging similar prevention measures these includesocial distancing methods being urged or ordered throughoutthe united states like shutting down bars restaurants and gyms as well as canceling any other mass gatherings of people on march 16 the white house issued additionalsocial distancing recommendations that included avoiding groups of more than 10 people cutting out nonessential travel and urging the closing of schools the administration has recommended these measures for at least the next 15days but it s possible americans could beadvised to engage in social distancing well into the summer more social distancing through august trump suggests it may be needed without evidence to the contrary there is no reason to concludethat the virus has spread with the assistance of government political or corporate actors virologists and epidemiologists are confident viruses like covid 19 can spread at an alarming rate without outside assistance we rate the claims on the podcast falsebecause they lack any evidence and are not supported by our research the consensus among experts points to the contagion theory of disease as the reason for covid 19 s spread in the u s including the possibility that infected people without symptoms are spreading the virus to others
