last friday the democratic candidates debated in new hampshire the left is critical of buttigieg and biden and praises klobuchar and sanders at some point soon establishment democrats will have to face the reality that biden for all his personal virtues probably doesn t have what it takes to win the nomination in 2020 sure this dire verdict may be premature for the moment biden is holding onto his african american support in the february 29 south carolina primary and leading in most national polls but those numbers may look different next week if biden limps home in fourth or even fifth in new hampshire in politics universally known and liked former vice presidents don t win by losing badly in both iowa and new hampshire walter shapiro new republic while buttigieg bernie sanders joe biden and elizabeth warren all had good moments this debate belonged to klobuchar for once she hit all her marks whether attacking one of the others joking with bernie sanders about a bill they had co sponsored or again and again turning each answer into an attack on trump will it matter unlikely jonathan bernstein bloomberg despite questions about socialism and the viability of medicare for all sanders was steady and commanding while candidates talked about uniting the party no other frontrunner can claim to have the economic ethnic and ideological diversity of sanders who has the most people of color and lowest median neighborhood income in his donor base and success attracting independents contrasting buttigieg who seems to believe billionaires are mere constituents and not a part of a power structure that siphons wealth from everyday americans sanders staked his allegiance assertively with the working class he warned that none of the progressive policies being promoted can pass if corporate and billionaire donors have undue influence on candidates and he is the only candidate who doesn t have billionaire financing in his campaign coffers talk is cheap and few but sanders seem like they will prioritize people over billionaire patrons when it s time to deliver malaika jabali the guardian buttigieg dodged questions on his healthcare plan and he dodged a question on a troubling history of police racism during his tenure as the mayor of south bend he was heavy on niceties light on specifics he made lots of calls for unity specifically in his attacks on the senators to his left but he did not have much to say about what americans should unify around or how to persuade them to do so his answers sounded more like marketing copy for a nefarious tech start up than like statements of political principle he looked more than anything like a man who has not relaxed since he was a child moira donegan the guardian regarding the healthcare debate it s not just that the canadian and british governments finance health care that s free at point of service for all citizens they do it while spending less than our government does even if you completely ignore america s enormous private sector health spending warren who had a brand as the woman with a thousand plans was expected to draw up a specific plan to make her health care vision work sanders is free of a wonk reputation or a need to worry about his left flank so he doesn t try to offer a specific health care financing vision which if he did it would inevitably end up featuring some unpleasant tradeoffs instead he just makes the basic compelling point that america s health care system is bizarrely terrible providing less coverage at greater cost than what we see in comparable countries this is not an adequate basis for actually enacting medicare for all but it s a good political answer that explains his big picture view of health care without falling into nasty political traps matthew yglesias vox the right thinks klobuchar had a successful debate and criticizes the candidates positions on the issues the right thinks klobuchar had a successful debate and criticizes the candidates positions on the issues the new hampshire contest was klobuchar s best debate overall she was poised and collected and it was smart from her perspective to hit buttigieg whose supporters overlap the most with hers her attacks on buttigieg certainly didn t seem to be powerful enough to send buttigieg tumbling downward the way chris christie s attack on marco rubio did at the 2016 gop debate but was it a strong enough debate performance for klobuchar to leapfrog buttigieg in new hampshire and become a real contender for the nomination we ll know soon enough john mccormack national review but klobuchar is jon huntsman circa 2012 she s the candidate who naturally appeals in demeanor and policy by being slightly less objectionable to the other side the problem for klobuchar is that the other side is irrelevant she finished 5th in iowa and is currently polling around 5 in new hampshire klobuchar seemed the most well spoken last night jeb bush was also a lot more well spoken than donald trump in 2016 it doesn t matter what matters is who actually aligns with the voting base of their party klobuchar simply doesn t do that in comparison to the field bonchie redstate one by one the candidates echoed the message that systemic racism characterizes america it s one thing to trash trump which they did as they always do it s one thing to blame him for all kinds of stuff it s another to spend an evening trashing the united states of america as a systematically unjust and even evil place whose rot reaches its very foundations you don t win the presidency by telling a majority of voters some of whom are the very voters you need to flip to win that the system is unfairly rigged in their favor john podhoretz new york post does the public still make at least some assumptions based on race of course some of those assumptions are far less malignant than others and they aren t merely the province of whites against blacks does some of the public discriminate based on racial prejudice yes should such attitudes be anathema absolutely but the public is sick and tired of being hectored of being told they are racist and evil without any acknowledgment of how far this nation has come in combating racism both public and private the more democrats go down this path for the sake of primary votes the more they will hurt themselves for the fall general election quin hillyer washington examiner furthermore not one of the candidates would have made the call to help soleimani shuffle off this mortal coil mayor pete at least went so far as to say that soleimani was a bad guy but he then claimed that taking out a bad guy is a bad idea if you do not know what you re doing oh really seems to me that our military knew precisely what they were doing they knew where soleimani was where he was heading and took him out with a single drone shot and the collateral damage was minimal you ll also recall that joe biden disagreed with barack obama about the raid to take out osama bin laden sounds like bad guys around the world should sleep well at night if joe biden is elected jazz shaw hot air effective counterterrorism and the broader stability of international order do not rest on the back of nice rules and polite discussions at the united nations they rest on the balancing beam of deterrence and destruction on nations knowing that they will be held to account for what they do to america our allies or to innocent peoples absent our ability to position a credible threat at the heart of their calculation our enemies will try to get away with as much mayhem as possible
