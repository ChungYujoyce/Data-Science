 mar 4 2020 at 6 49 am by nathaniel rakich filed under 2020 election mike blake reuters super tuesday was very good to joe biden roughly one third of democrats nationwide cast their ballots for president in the first big primary election of the year although not all of those ballots have yet been counted accordingly we won t be unfreezing our primary forecast until we have a clearer picture of the exact results but we can confidently say that whenever it bleeps and bloops back to life the forecast will show biden on the rise not only did he win the states he was expected to win on tuesday but he proved his cross sectional appeal by notching a few wins on what was supposed to be sen bernie sanders s turf heading into yesterday it looked like super tuesday was going to break down along regional lines with biden winning the southern states and sanders winning those in the north and west biden certainly held up his end of the bargain our model gave biden a 2 in 3 chance or better of winning the six southern states of alabama arkansas north carolina oklahoma tennessee and virginia and he carried all six by double digits in fact he exceeded our already lofty expectations in these states for example our average forecast in virginia put biden at 43 percent of the vote and sanders at 23 percent biden got 53 percent in real life and sanders 23 percent and in alabama we forecasted that biden would beat sanders 44 percent to 21 percent on average the final results were biden 63 percent sanders 17 percent crucially biden also won texas in a close race abc news finally called the state at 2 a m eastern as biden held a 33 percent to 29 percent lead over sanders texas was the most up in the air state in our forecast so it was always going to be a bellwether for who was having a good night on tuesday of course the fact that it is worth the second most delegates of any state doesn t hurt either but biden s most impressive wins came in massachusetts and minnesota where sanders entered super tuesday as a slight favorite and biden wasn t even the most likely candidate to upset him per our forecast biden had only a 1 in 5 chance of carrying each state and yet he won massachusetts by 7 points and minnesota by a daunting 9 both wins showed biden s ability to expand his coalition outside his usual comfort zone minnesota is a state that has relatively few voters of color a key part of biden s base and that sanders won by 23 points in 2016 but the last minute endorsement of minnesota sen amy klobuchar who dropped out of the race to support biden was apparently very influential and in massachusetts biden effectively kneecapped home state sen elizabeth warren by usurping her former base of college educated whites biden carried the upper class suburbs that ring boston so far the only states that sanders is projected or likely to win are three western states california colorado and utah plus vermont sanders was never in danger of losing his home state he had a greater than 99 percent chance to win vermont according to our forecast and he may have been saved in the west by the fact that all three states vote primarily by mail and therefore cast many of their ballots before this week when biden experienced a surge of endorsements and popular support according to exit polls voters who made up their mind on whom to vote for within the last few days broke heavily for biden and even in states like north carolina biden did merely ok among early voters but cleaned up among election day voters finally there are a couple states where we still don t have conclusive results as of wednesday morning maine was still too close to call although that in and of itself is a win for biden we gave him only a 1 in 4 chance of carrying the state entering the night and although some outlets though not our colleagues at abc news have called california for sanders the results there are still very preliminary since mail in ballots can arrive as late as friday and still be counted given that california is worth 415 pledged delegates the exact final results there could make a big difference to each candidate s delegate math indeed with plenty of votes still to be counted in colorado maine and utah as well the final national delegate totals probably won t be clear for several days nathaniel rakich is fivethirtyeight s elections analyst baseballot filed under 2020 election 756 posts 2020 democratic primary 692 super tuesday 51 see all newsletters 2020 abc news internet ventures all rights reserved
