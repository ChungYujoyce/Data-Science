 by rem rieder posted on april 14 2020 the democratic super pac priorities usa action has been running an ad falsely suggesting president donald trump called the coronavirus outbreak a hoax at the beginning the ad splices together two quotes to have trump saying the coronavirus this is their new hoax it is obvious in listening to the ad that he said the coronavirus and this is their new hoax at different times his voice sounds quite different in the two segments but on the screen the coronavirus this is their new hoax appears as a single sentence trump did use the word hoax but his full comments and subsequent explanation make clear he was talking about democratic attacks on his administration s handling of the outbreak not the virus itself on april 13 the trump campaign sued wjfw nbc of rhinelander wisconsin for defamation for running the ad which has been running in some version in swing states almost continually since march 24 according to advertising analytics at a cost so far of about 2 5 million a 15 second version of the ad also appears online as part of a digital ad campaign after priorities usa action launched its 6 million ad campaign on television stations in the swing states of florida michigan minnesota pennsylvania and wisconsin in late march the trump campaign warned the stations not to run the ads to avoid costly and time consuming litigation in addition to the misleading hoax segment the ad features a series of statements in which trump downplayed the risk of the coronavirus outbreak these quotes are accurate as we have reported the hoax kerfuffle began at a trump rally in south carolina on feb 28 at one point trump said and this is their new hoax but he did so in the context of assailing democrats for trying to politicize what the democrats saw as his administration s shortcomings in combating the crisis trump feb 28 now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus you know that right coronavirus they re politicizing it we did one of the great jobs you say how s president trump doing they go oh not good not good they have no clue they don t have any clue they can t even count their votes in iowa they can t even count no they can t they can t count their votes one of my people came up to me and said mr president they tried to beat you on russia russia russia that didn t work out too well they couldn t do it they tried the impeachment hoax that was on a perfect conversation they tried anything they tried it over and over they d been doing it since you got in it s all turning they lost it s all turning think of it think of it and this is their new hoax the president who oftendismissedspecial counsel robert mueller s russia investigation and his impeachment as hoaxes portrayed the democrats criticism of his coronavirus policy as a continuation of a campaign to bring him down later in the rally he referred to the coronavirus criticism as the democrats single talking point a virus starts in china bleeds its way into various countries all around the world doesn t spread widely at all in the united states because of the early actions that myself and my administration took against a lot of other wishes and the democrats single talking point and you see it is that it s donald trump s fault right it s donald trump s fault he said no just things that happened democratic presidential candidates were quick to pounce on trump s hoax remark former vice president joe biden described the president s comments as absolutely bizarre the following day at a press conference trump reiterated that he used the term hoax in connection to the democrats attacks reporter feb 29 you were down in charleston last night using the word hoax when talking about democrats somebody now is dead from this do you regret that kind of talk trump no no no hoax referring to the action that they take to try and pin this on somebody because we ve done such a good job the hoax is on them not i m not talking about what s happening here i m talking what they re doing that s the hoax that s just a continuation of the hoax whether it s the impeachment hoax or the russia russia russia hoax this is what i m talking about certainly not referring to this how could anybody refer to this this is very serious stuff but the way they refer to it because these people have done such an incredible job and i don t like it when they are criticizing these people and that s the hoax that s what i m talking about the rest of the priorities usa action ad consists of statements by trump dismissing the threat of the novel coronavirus as we have written trump made a series of such statements from jan 22 to march 10 and as recently as march 24 likened the disease s impact to that of the flu or automobile accidents the ad has trump saying we have it totally under control it s one person coming in from china that s what trump told cnbc in an interview from the world economic forum in davos switzerland on jan 22 the ad continues with trump saying one day it s like a miracle it will disappear that s what trump told a gathering of african american leaders at a meeting on feb 27 the next quote is when you have 15 people and within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero trump said this at a press conference on feb 26 we really think we ve done a great job in keeping it down to a minimum trump said that at the same press conference the ad also quotes trump i like this stuff i really get it people are surprised that i understand it trump said this referring to medical issues during a visit to the centers for disease control and prevention on march 6 and finally the ad quotes trump saying no i don t take responsibility at all that s what the president said at a press conference on march 13 when asked if he took responsibility for the federal government s lag in testing for the coronavirus so the overwhelming bulk of the ad is on target but the beginning is deceptive q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
