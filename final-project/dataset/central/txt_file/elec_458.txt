fundamentally reshape the race warren was the clear winner of the first night of debates in miami late last month even though her performance was overshadowed by a more controversial clash the following evening she continues to blast out policy proposals at a rate that outpaces her rivals on friday she outlined a plan to boost pay for non white women warren is making serious efforts to court black support an effort that suggests she hopes to create a coalition broadly similar to the one that propelled then sen barack obamabarack hussein obamathe 10 senate seats most likely to flip

issues more d calif at the top of this list warren is third in national polling averages behind biden and sanders and harrishad an even better night at the miami debates but like a runner who sits comfortably at the shoulder of the leaders warren is perfectly positioned at this stage of the race previous ranking may 28 3 2 former vice president joe biden biden can t credibly be placed lower than second given that he is the leader in national polls and that his fundraising prowess isprodigious he raised 21 5 million in the second quarter but biden has problems his subpar performance at the first debate hurt him in lotsof ways it eroded his support among black voters at a stroke it raised grave questions about whether he would after all be the strongest candidate against president trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more the central rationale of his candidacy and it also stoked concerns on the sensitive issue of his age biden is 76 the former vice president took a long timeto clean up the mess as well in a cnn interview broadcast friday he said he wasn t prepared for harris to attack him as aggressively as she did only on saturday did he finally apologize for in previous remarks having given the impression to people that i was praising two deceased southern segregationist senators there is an enormous amount of general goodwill toward biden among democrats but will that translate to votes when the crunch comes hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more an ideologically similar figure had much bigger polling leads than biden does now in the early stages of both the 2008 and 2016 cycles only to lose one battle to obama and be pushed to the brink by sanders in the other that s one of many factors that augurs badly for biden previous ranking 1 3 sen kamala harris d calif harris had the biggest moment of any candidate in the debate when she took on biden over school busing in starkly personal terms the exchange replayed frequently on cable news and on social media was rocket fuel for harris s poll standings she vaulted to second place in two national polls in the immediate aftermath rising 13 points in one from quinnipiac university and 9 points in another from cnn ssrs the debate has also boosted her profile and popularity with black voters whose support will be vital if she is to prevail harris s performance in the debate was just the kind of breakout moment that she needed after an initially vibrant campaign has begun to stagnate in the polls still thecaliforniandoes face questions her new prominence invites investigation of her own record as california attorney general and as district attorney in san francisco this history includes elements that unsettle progressives notably a harsh approach to truancy and a resistance to appointing independent investigators to look into shootings by the police harris has also been unsteady on some elements of policy her own view of school busing is not entirely clear and she has given confusing answers on whether or not she favors the elimination of private health insurance harris has a real shot she also has some real weaknesses previous ranking 3 4 sen bernie sanders i vt sanders s first run for the presidency in 2016 far surpassed expectations this time around the expectations were much higher and he has failed to meet them so far sanders has made the case that he was the first to espouse the kinds of views that have grown more popular among democrats particularly regarding income inequality and the imperative to make college more affordable this is true but it does not appear to be expanding his support in the realclearpolitics rcp national polling average he is stuck around 14 percent and has recently been pushed into third place by a surging harris his partisans believe his message resonates and that he has real strength on the ground in early states particularly iowa sanders has already won a moral victory the democratic party has moved in his direction whether he can win an actual victory in the battle for the nomination seems a lot more questionable previous ranking 2 5 south bend ind mayor pete buttigiegpete buttigiegit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process here s how biden can win over the minority vote and the rust belt the hill s campaign report democrat concedes in california house race more buttigieg just 37 years old was the media flavor of the month when he launched his campaign he has parlayed that attention into startling fundraising strength he raised 24 8 million during the second quarter a bigger total than higher polling candidates including biden harris and sanders warren has not yet declared her second quarter fundraising total buttigieg s appeal is his youth his articulacy and a sense that he can appeal to voters beyond the democratic base but he has an obvious shortcoming too his support among black voters is strikingly low that weakness has likely been exacerbated by the controversy that followedthe recent police shooting of a black man eric logan in his home city buttigieg has his niche but unless his support among black voters ramps up it is hard to see how he breaks out of it previous ranking 5 6 former housing and urban development secretary juli n castro castro had the best debate of any of the second tier candidates with his impassioned and knowledgeable responses on immigration propelling him to the fore castro also very clearly got the better of his fellow texan former rep beto o rourke d in exchanges on that topic it is very hard to see castro making a serious charge for the nomination he polls at under2 percent in the rcp national average but he is burnishing his reputation and would make an attractive vice presidential choice previous ranking 9 7 sen cory bookercory anthony bookerstakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff it s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process booker introduces bill to create democracycorps for elections more d n j booker has always struggled to break out in such a large field and that problem has not been resolved he had a solid performance in the debate but was overshadowed by harris he has been able to get media attention for some of his endeavors last week he went to mexico to meet people who were attempting to seek asylum in the united states but that has not translated into significant support the bottom line is there is some x factor that booker seems to lack he has done nothing embarrassing during his campaign but he just hasn t caught fire either previous ranking 7 8 former rep beto o rourke d texas o rourke has been the single most disappointing candidate of this cycle so far a much hyped launch fizzled dogged from the start by o rourke s ill advised comment to vanity fair that he was born to run for the presidency he has signally failed to create the kind of excitement that he sparked during a close race against sen ted cruzrafael ted edward cruzstate department scrutiny threatens pompeo s political ambitions 125 lawmakers urge trump administration to support national guard troops amid pandemic parties gear up for battle over texas state house more r texas last year an attempted reboot of the o rourke campaign has not worked debating has never been his strongest suit and he suffered when castro accused him of not having done his homework on immigration in miami o rourke s campaign to date has been a slow fade he needs something truly exceptional if he is to climb back into contention previous ranking 6 9 sen amy klobucharamy klobucharpoll biden leads trump by 5 points in minnesota the hill s morning report presented by facebook us death toll nears 100 000 as country grapples with reopening it s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process more d minn klobuchar has a niche in the race butthe problem is that biden already occupies it the minnesota senator is overtly skeptical of the leftward tilt of the party hesitant about the electoral appeal of proposals like the green new deal and medicare for all she acquitted herself capably at the debate and had a particularly effective moment when she emphasized her commitment and that of other female candidates to the cause of reproductive rights it s just not clear however that today s democratic electorate is buying what klobuchar is selling previous ranking 8 10 rep tulsi gabbardtulsi gabbardit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process 125 lawmakers urge trump administration to support

congresswoman an army veteran is more vigorously critical of regime change wars and military adventuring in general than some of her rivals she is likely too idiosyncratic a figure to make it very far
