president trump gave an 81 minute wide ranging press conference wednesday in it he addressed the mounting sexual misconduct allegations against supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh discussed his highly anticipated meeting with embattled deputy attorney general rod rosenstein and explained away the laughter of world leaders during his united nations speech read trump s full remarks from his press conference in new york city trump thank you very much everybody we ve had a great three days at the united nations in new york and this is quite a gathering wow that s a lot of people a lot of media laughter we ve we ve covered a great deal of territory just left as you know prime minister of abe of japan we re starting trade talks with japan they were not willing for years to talk trade and now they re willing to talk trade and i m sure we ll make a very good deal just concluded as you know two days ago signed a deal with south korea a trade deal a tremendous deal with south korea it means a lot of business for our farmers we re opening up for farmers we re opening up for a lot of different groups we re going to be able to sell much more than double the number of automobiles that we were allowed under a deal that was totally defective that was there before and so we re very happy with that that deal has actually concluded we re very well along the way with mexico the relationship is very good and with canada we ll see what happens they re charging us 300 percent tariffs on dairy products we can t have that we can t have that trump with china as you know we put out an announcement today they would like to see me lose an election because they ve never been challenged like this but i want to open up china to our farmers and to our industrialists and our companies and china is not open but we re open to them they charge us 25 35 55 percent for things and we charge them nothing in terms of coming in to the country cars they re at 25 percent and we re at 2 percent and 2 5 percent and don t even collect it but we collect it now so we re doing very well in our situation with china on trade i have a great relationship with the president of china president xi but it s got to be a two way street and for 25 years or longer was not and trillions and trillions of dollars was taken out of the united states for the benefit of china and we just can t have that we have to make it fair so we re at 250 billion now at 25 percent interest and a lot of money is coming into our coffers and it s had no impact on our absolutely by the way no impact on our economy which i said it wouldn t in fact steel is like the hottest industry there is if you look at what happened with steel we re charging a 25 percent tariff for the dumpers they dump massive amounts of steel they want to put the steel companies out of business and after they re out of business they re come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible and we need steel and we need aluminum and those industries are doing well but steel is incredible u s steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants nucor is opening up plants and these are big plants 750 million and 1 billion plants in some cases so what s happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me it s being rebuilt over night if you look at the miners and coal if you look at energy lng japan just gave us some numbers that are incredible they re doubling the amount that they are going to be buying for japan they re taking the lng and they re doubling it up i said you have to do me a favor we don t want these big deficits you re going to have to buy more they re buying massive amounts of equipment military equipment and other countries are doing the same thing because we have trade imbalances with almost everybody it s a rare exception that we don t so we are doing great as a country unfortunately they just raised interest rates a little bit because we are doing so well i m not happy about that because i know it s going to be a question i am not happy about it i d rather pay down debt or do other things create more jobs so i m worried about the fact that they seem to like raising interest rates we can do other things with the money and but they raised them and they re raising them because we re doing so well you know we re doing much better than i had projected in terms of when i was campaigning i said we were going to do this and we re doing much better than than anybody ever thought possible and i will say if others got in it would ve been just the opposite because they were going to put restrictions on they were going to put regulations on they were going to choke the economy as it was already choking but it would ve been worse and they were going to raise your taxes that s what they want to do now if they ever got control which i don t think they ll have control for a long time so with that being said we ll take some questions and yes please john go ahead we have plenty of time question mr president thank you very much but of course what you re looking forward to tomorrow is the hearings with judge kavanaugh trump yes question before the judiciary committee trump yes question in 1991 when joe biden passed along to the bush 41 white house the allegations that anita hill had raised against clarence thomas the bush white house asked the fbi to look into it as part of judge thomas background investigation not a criminal investigation trump right right question but a background investigation when these allegations were raised why didn t this white house do the same thing and with all of the allegations that are coming out now about judge kavanaugh was there an opportunity missed here to have investigators look in to this and get some sort of clarity one way or the other trump well the fbi told us they ve investigated judge kavanaugh six times five times many times over the years they know him very well but here there was nothing to investigate from at least one standpoint they didn t know the location they didn t know the time they didn t know the year they didn t know anything and it s like where do you go also it s not for the fbi if you look at what joe biden said he said they don t do this and he said it very clearly so i think when you really look at it all it s not going to change any of the democrats minds their obstructionists they re actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they ve destroyed a man s reputation and they want to destroy it even more and i think people are going to see that in the midterms what they ve done to this family what they ve done to these children these beautiful children of his and what they ve done to his wife and they know it s a big fat con job and they go in to a room and i guarantee you they laugh like hell on what they pulled off on you and on the public they laugh like hell so it wouldn t have mattered if the fbi came back with the cleanest score and you understand that very well john if they would have come back with a most perfect we found everything and he s perfectly innocent of everything it wouldn t have made a difference you wouldn t have gotten one vote now we will get votes from the democrats if we win you ll have three four or five democrats giving us votes because they re in states that i won by 30 and 40 points and they re going to give us votes but other than that you probably won t get any john yes go ahead please question mr president there are now three women accusing judge kavanaugh of sexual misconduct are you saying that all three of those women are liars is there anything that could be said trump yeah question tomorrow that could cause you to withdraw the nomination anything at all that trump i won t get in to that game i only tell you this this is one of the highest quality people that i ve ever met and everybody that knows him says the same thing and these are all false to me these are false accusations in certain cases and certain cases even the media agrees with that i can only say that what they ve done to this man is incredible you know it s very interesting i pick a lot of judges i have a 145 judges i will be picking by the end of a fairly short period of time because president obama wasn t big on picking judges when i got there i said how is this possible i have 145 including court of appeals judges and they just didn t do it you know why they got tired they got complacent something happened i have 145 judges everybody wants to be a federal judge not just a supreme court judge i m talking about court of appeals i m talking about district court i don t think they re going to want to so much i ll be calling people and we ll have people calling people that do this corrected copy corrects paragraph 8 below trump and people are going to be scared because we could say it about you thirty five years ago you and you might not know what s going on what is going on why did they wait so long why did senator feinstein wait until the hearings were over and make this case why didn t she bring it right at the beginning when you ask about as an example the fbi why didn t they bring this right at the beginning during the hearing you would have had all the time in the world for the fbi it would have been fine now the fbi as you know did investigate this time as they have five or six other times and they did a very thorough investigation but this is a big con job and i would love to be in the room with the democrats close the door you guys are all away outside waiting and schumer and his buddies are in there laughing how they fooled you all let s just stop them a big fat con yes go ahead question but but mr president if i could follow up you have daughters can you understand why a victim of sexual assault would not report it at the time don t you understand trump by the way i only say this 36 years no charge no nothing everybody question but but that that happens often i mean corrected copy adds missing word trump people are going to have to make a decision thirty six years there s no charge all of a sudden the hearings are over and the rumors start coming out and then you have this other con artist avenatti coming out with another beauty today i only say that you have to look at the facts the senators are very capable people they re very good people i know many of them they re friends of mine these are very talented very good people and they re going to vote they re going to have to believe what they believe i can when i look at what s happened to the reputation of a great gentleman a great intellect a brilliant man somebody that has a chance to be one of our great supreme court justices in history intellectually i think it s a shame yes please question yes mr president my name is tomas regalado ph from radio and tv marti trump ok question mr president yesterday at the speech at the u n you spoke about how venezuela s problem was because of cuba and the castros how they went in there and they brought socialism and communism to venezuela and now to nicaragua as well mr president are you going to be more proactive now against cuba as well and trump i ve been very proactive against cuba i don t like what s happening in cuba as you know president obama gave them a pass and i didn t like it neither do cuban people based in miami and based in our country that came from cuba and suffered in cuba i don t like what he did i ve ended much of it most of it i don t like what s happening in cuba and i certainly don t like what s happening in venezuela question mr president trump yes please go ahead question mr president just to finish really fast you said also that you had a call to action to ask the leaders around the world to also end socialism would you like to be recognized as a inaudible trump well i wouldn t say that socialism has been working really well around the world ok you can take a look at venezuela as your number one your number one i guess the one that s most obvious but you take a look around the world socialism is not exactly riding high please question thank you mr president trump go ahead question thank you very much if you don t mind after i m finished if wegener ph or halley ph or or vivian ph or one of our female colleagues could go after me that would be great mr president just to follow up on these allegations against brett kavanaugh trump what what does he mean by that explain what what does what does that mean question i think it would be i think it would be great if a if a female reporter got trump what does it mean no what does it mean question i think it d be great if a female reporter would ask you a question about the this issue so if you don t mind i d like to pass trump i wouldn t mind that at all no question all right trump wouldn t mind it at all question all right well let me if i could trump wouldn t make any difference to me question all right trump go ahead question if i could follow up on john ph and john s ph question why is it mr president that you always seem to side with the accused and not the not the accuser you have three women here who are all making allegations who are all asking that their stories be heard question and you know if you look at the case of roy moore if you look at the case of one of your staffers you seem to time and again side with the accused and not the accuser is that because of the many allegations that you ve had made against you over the years trump well first of all i wasn t happy with roy moore let s get that straight but roy moore was in a republican candidate and i would ve rather had a republican candidate win i was very happy with luther strange who was a terrific man from alabama but luther strange had a lot of things going against him as far as women whether it s a man or a woman these are you know it can happen the other way allegations can go the other way also you understand that and whether it was a man or woman 30 years ago 36 years ago in fact i don t even know how many years ago because nobody knows what the time is that s a long time and i could pick as an example hopefully i won t have to do it as a replacement because hopefully this is going to go very well on thursday it s going to go very well on monday or saturday or sunday or whenever they vote but i could pick a woman and she could have charges made from many years ago also question because trump and i would look at the character no what i have to do question or reluctant to come forward you ve raised doubts about these accusers many of them trump i don t think people are reluctant to come forward they re going to have a chance to speak they have a major chance excuse me excuse me they have major chance to speak and it will be tomorrow i assume we ve delayed this meaning the republican senators not me the republican senators have delayed this for weeks now they re giving the women a major chance to speak now it s possible i ll hear that and i ll say hey i m changing my mind that is possible we want to give them a chance to speak and they re given question giving all three a chance all three should have a chance trump well whoever is given a chance we ve delayed it a long time but they re going to have a big shot at speaking and making their case and you know what i can be persuaded also ok yes please please go ahead go ahead i d like to go yes go ahead please question thank you mr president and a couple of questions for you to follow up on some answers that i didn t quite hear from you if you would allow me a couple of questions first of all do you think these women all three of them are liars yes or no trump have they been what question are they liars trump i can t tell you i have to watch tomorrow i have to read i just heard about one a little while ago i can tell you her lawyer is a low life ok so i can t tell you whether or not they re liars until i hear them i don t know what happened today because i ve been very busy with japan with south korea with china and about seven other countries as you know and i chaired the security council so i don t know about today s person that came forward i do know about the lawyer and and you don t get much worse bad reputation to take a look at his past so as far as the other women are concerned i m going to see what happens tomorrow i m going to be watching you know believe it or not i m going to see what s said it s possible that they will be convincing now with all of that being said judge brett kavanaugh has been for many years one of the most respected people in washington he s been on i guess you d call it the second highest court and every single person knows him a lot of people know him well and those people don t believe what s going on i can always be convinced i have to hear it corrected copy corrects paragraph 9 below question it sounds like what you re saying is there is a situation there is a scenario under which you would withdraw brett kavanaugh s nomination is that correct crosstalk trump if i thought he was if i thought he was guilty of something like this yes sure question and you will wait until tomorrow to make up your mind trump i want to watch i want to see i hope i can watch i m meeting with a lot of countries tomorrow but i will certain in some form be able to watch and i ll also rely on some very fair and talented republican senators who look if we brought george washington here and we said we have george washington the democrats would vote against him just so you understand and he may have had a bad past who knows you know laughter corrected copy corrects word he may have had some i think accusations made didn t he have a couple things in his past george washington would be voted against 100 percent by schumer and the con artists i mean 100 percent 100 percent so it really doesn t matter from their stand point that s when john asked about the fbi if the fbi did the most thorough investigation of the history of the fbi and they found him to be 100 percent perfect he would lose every single vote now if the republicans win tomorrow i think you re going to get some votes from the democrats you know why because we all know why because it s called politics then you ll probably get some votes crosstalk trump ok let s go one more question yes she stands up i d like to ask about three questions it s not really fair to everyone else should i let her ask another question question to follow up on trump go ahead see question to follow up on a question that a colleague asked as well about the benefit of the doubt that you have given to people like roy moore to roger ailes to bill o reilly to brett kavanaugh they re all men why is that crosstalk trump it s not a benefit of the doubt i crosstalk question has there ever been an instance when you ve given the benefit of the doubt to a woman trump i ve known them hallie ph i ve known them for a long time and a lot of these people a lot of people and some i ve been disappointed with i have been disappointed with some others like you know there are charges that are pretty weak but i ve known people for a long time i never saw them do anything wrong i never saw them do anything wrong and there s some that probably i agree i can tell you there s some that i i ve been watching for a long time and in a couple of cases they weren t republicans and a lot of cases they were not they were exactly the opposite but i ve been watching them for a long time and i knew for a long time these were not good people and they were never brought up ok yes ma am go ahead thank you very much by the way thank you question thank you very much crosstalk trump thank you question mr president when the allegations first surfaced you initially said how important it was for dr ford to testify and that you wanted to hear from her trump i do question but trump i wish it could have gone quicker question well you also said that if what she said was bad as she claims surely her or her parents would have reported it and just today you said you crosstalk trump well there is a truth i mean there is a chance that her parents could have reported 36 years ago question so so my question is trump it doesn t mean they had to report it because in some instances people keep it quiet it s a very tough situation for a woman there s no question about it and in some cases they do report it frankly had they reported it it would have been pretty amazing wouldn t it but i guess they didn t and that s ok i m not saying they had to report it because it s a very personal thing it s a very big problem there s no question about it go ahead question do you want to hear her story before crosstalk trump i d like to hear her story yes well we re giving her time crosstalk question have you already made up your mind trump they would have given her time last week this is the united state senate this is the most important position that a president can give out i think we can say by far i ve actually heard it s the most important decision a president can make i disagree with that war and peace i always say war and peace and after that supreme court justice right i look forward to hearing from her we could have heard from her last week we could have heard from her for a long time it ll be interesting to hear what she has to say ok question let me follow up on jim s question mr president let me follow up on jim s question that i don t think we got an answer to trump which one which question who question how have your personal experiences being accused by more than trump i ve been accused i ve been accused question a dozen women of sexual trump false accusations question misconduct right trump excuse me question how have those trump i ve been accused and i was accused by i believe it was four women you can check with sean hannity you can check with fox because they covered it very strongly question and how have trump who got paid excuse me excuse me i was accused by four or five women who got paid a lot of money to make up stories about me we caught them and the mainstream media refused to put it on television they refused to even write about it there were four women and maybe more i think the number s four or five but one had her mortgage paid off her house 52 000 another one had other things happen and the one that reported it i believe was offered 750 000 to say bad things about me and she s the one that reported it this woman is incredible she reported instead of taking the money so i ve had numerous accusations about me question right trump i mean they made false statements about me knowing they were false i never met them i never met these people and what did they do what did they do they took money in order to say bad things i ve had stories written in the new york times front page about four women the whole top center front page of the new york times i think it was four big pictures i said wow that s a big thing what s that these were women that were quoted saying bad things about me not the worst things about me but bad things and i said gee that s too bad i knew them a long time ago 15 years ago 20 years ago i said that s too bad i m surprised at them and then all of a sudden i see them on television nothing to do with me the next day or day later they were incensed they said donald trump is a nice guy we never said this the new york times did false reporting they re fake news and you know what the new york times would not report that their story was fake these women said great things not only did they not say the bad stuff they said great things about me front page and those woman they re incredible women they went on television and they didn t want to and i didn t ask them and they said the new york times made it up they gave false quotes and they went on a lot of shows they were really incensed and they couldn t believe it that s why people know that a lot of the news is fake and a lot of the people sitting here are fake but 20 percent of them are wonderful ok question if i could just actually ask trump go ahead please question my question mr trump you didn t let me ask my question trump you ve been asking a question for 10 minutes question no you interrupted my question trump please sit down please question i m asking how did those impact your opinions on the allegations trump well it does impact my opinion and question against judge kavanaugh trump you know why because i ve had a lot of false charges made against me i m a very famous person unfortunately i ve been a famous person for a long time but i ve had a lot of false charges made against me really false charges i know friends that have had false charges people want fame they want money they want whatever so when i see it i view it differently than somebody sitting home watching television where they say oh judge kavanaugh this or that it s happened to me many times i ve had many false charges i had a woman sitting in an airplane and i attacked her while people were coming onto the plane and i have a number one best seller out i mean it was a total phony story there are many of them so when you say does it effect me in terms of my thinking with respect to judge kavanaugh absolutely because i ve had it many times trump and if the news would have reported these four people i couldn t believe it when i heard that they caught these four people i said wow that s a big story and it was for fox ok question thank you mr president earlier today and just now you made a significant allegation against the chinese government you suggested that trump i did question the chinese had meddled in or are meddling in trump that s right that s what i hear question the 2018 mid term election trump that s what i hear question what evidence do you have of that sir is there analysis inaudible trump we have evidence we have evidence it ll come out yeah i can t tell you now but it came it didn t come out of nowhere that i can tell you now they ve actually admitted that they re going after farmers i mean i think most of you can cover that i like that you re shaking your head yes i m going to ask you the next question because of that ok it s probably going to be the killer of all questions but let me just explain let me question if you re not going to come forward with the evidence sir trump china now put on 250 billion and they re paying 25 percent on that they re paying billions and billions this has never happened to china and i like china and i like president xi a lot i think he s a friend of mine he may not be a friend of mine anymore but i think he probably respects from what i hear if you look at mr pillsbury the leading authority on china he was on a good show i won t mention the name of the show recently and he was saying that china has total respect for donald trump and for donald trump s very very large brain he said donald trump they don t know what to do never happened well one thing they are trying to do is they re trying to convince people to go against donald trump because a normal regular political person that has no concept of what the hell he s doing would let china continue to take 500 billion a year out of our country and rebuild their country i mean they were building 29 massive bridges like the george washington bridge they re building things that we don t build anymore but we re starting to build them again and our economy now is hotter than it s ever been i don t know if you saw the confidence levels this morning that just came in fantastic and in all fairness to the fed raising rates they re raising rates because we ve never done like we re doing now and one of the things that is nice about their rates the people that were hurt the worst by these zero interest rates and when president obama had an economy that was it was the worst comeback since the great depression and all that you ve all heard that but remember he was playing with zero interest money he was playing with funny money that s easy i m playing with fairly expensive money so when he does that the people that benefit are people that actually in their whole life they would save 10 15 20 percent of their salary those people got killed because they put their money in the bank they re going to live off the interest and there was no interest now those people are starting to get interest and those are the people frankly that deserve you know they did a great job the people that did it right the people that did the best job got hurt the most so in one sense i like it but basically i m low interest rate person i hate to tell you yes ma am yes go ahead question mr president trump yes question you have another meeting tomorrow with rod rosenstein trump yes question are you planning to fire rod rosenstein trump i m talking to him we ve had a good talk he said he never said it he said he doesn t believe it he said he has a lot of respect for me and he was very nice and we ll see and he s a member of the trump administration in that sense it s the justice department i would certainly prefer not doing that there was no collusion there was no obstruction i mean unless you call obstruction the fact that i fight back i do fight back i really fight back i mean if you call that obstruction that s fine but there s no obstruction there s no collusion i m going to meet with him tomorrow i may call rod tonight or tomorrow and ask for a little bit of a delay to the meeting because i don t want to do anything that gets in the way of this very important supreme court pick so i don t want it competing and hurting the decision one way or the other decision again i want to hear what she has to say but i don t want to do so i may delay that i m going to see i don t want to do anything that s going to conflict with that but my preference would be to keep them and to let him finish up you know i call it a witch hunt and it is a witch hunt if you look at the fbi statements with strzok and his lover lisa page if you look at all of the things that have gone on in the fbi if you look at mccabe taking 700 000 from a hillary clinton pac essentially run by terry mcauliffe who s our best friend in the world and he gives them hundreds of thousands of dollars and he s in charge of her campaign and his wife is getting all of this money to run she lost to run i mean what s going on if you look at the horrible statements like way to go page great story you put into a newspaper essentially now we ll go and investigate that group it s terrible we have caught people doing things that are terrible i would much prefer keeping rod rosenstein much prefer many people say i have the right to absolutely fire him he said he did not say it he said he does not believe and nobody in this room believes it by the way i deal with the people in this room i was with mike pompeo before we were dealing at a very high level with japan and i was saying things that nobody in the room even understood and i said them a long time ago and i was right he said that s not the 25th amendment that i m looking at i think i can say that from mike question so you don t think anyone in your administration has ever discussed the using the 25th amendment against you trump i don t think so well yes enemies sure you use anything you can crosstalk question in your administration or your cabinet trump hey you use anything they can they re not in love with me they re not going to beat me in the election they know that they re not going to beat me the people that i m looking at are total lightweights i i dream of running against those people maybe i ll come up with somebody question but with your administration trump that s not they re not going to beat me i m against what they want to do i m in favor of law enforcement i m in favor of safety and security and low taxes i want low taxes i want borders we re getting another 1 6 billion in borders i want borders we ve spent 3 2 billion and we re getting another 1 6 billion and then eventually we re getting the whole thing and we ll complete the wall they don t want that they don t want that they don t want the things that i have now i must say i know many of the democrats they ll say things and then wink at me and again it s the same old story they ll say things they don t mean it it s politics the reason they don t want me is because they want to run the show they want it it s power it s whatever you want to call it but what they ve done here is a disgrace a total disgrace and what they do i know it s sort of interesting in one case they say he s a fascist he s taking over the government he s the most powerful president ever he s a horrible human being he wants to take over the entire government and he s going to do it we can t stop him that didn t work the next week he said he s incompetent i said well wait a minute in one case i m taking over the world and the other case he s incompetent they tried that for a week that didn t work look these are very dishonest people these are con artists and the press now said but the press doesn t write it wow that s a lot of hands that s a lot steve go ahead he is a very high quality person this man but he ll probably question thank you mr president trump hit me with a bad one laughter question why why trump go ahead question you re trump give to me laughter question you re getting you re getting trump give it to me steve question you re getting trump reuters question you re getting letters from chairman kim why do you need a second summit so soon and what do trump because he d like it question what would it be for trump so i ve received two letters from chairman kim at some point i ll you know give these letters they re incredible letters they re they re letters that are magnificent in the sense of his feeling for wanting to get this done i really believe he wants to get it done i may be wrong i heard somebody on a certain network last night i won t mention which one say why has president trump given so much to north korea i said wait a minute i asked sarah huckabee please call this person i gave him nothing other than i met what did i give him i didn t do what obama did give him 1 8 billion in cash to get back four hostages i got back our hostages i never paid them anything i haven t paid him 0 10 but he wants to make a deal and i d like to make a deal we actually have a very good relationship together a lot different than the last time i was at the united nations that was a little bit rough don t forget that time they said oh trump is saying these horrible things he s going to get us into a war you were going to have a war if i wasn t elected you d be in a war and president obama essentially said the same thing he was ready to go to war you would have had a war and you would have lost millions not thousands you would have lost millions of people seoul has millions of people 40 miles and 30 miles from this very dangerous border if i wasn t elected you would have had a war president obama thought you had to go to war you know how close he was to pressing the trigger for war millions of people with me nobody s talking about that nobody s talking about that we have a very good relationship he likes me i like him we get along he wrote me two of the most beautiful letters when i showed one of the letters just one to prime minister abe he said this is actually a groundbreaking letter this is an incredible this is a historic letter and it is a historic letter it s a beautiful it s a beautiful piece of art and i think we re going to make a deal will we make a deal steve i don t really know but i think we re going to in the meantime and i ve said a i don t want to bore you no rockets no missiles no nuclear tests you know for over a year we you haven t seen before i got here everybody in this room thought you were going to war and then what happened it was funny they said he was terrible he was so rough with chairman kim kim jong un he was so rough it s terrible he s going to cause well i had a great meeting with president putin and on that one they said he was too soft with president putin i had a great meeting with it lasted for two hours we discussed everything ukraine syria israel and israel s protection we had a great meeting they wanted me to end up in a boxing match and you know what if i was killer tough with president putin they would have said he was too tough you can t win with these people but you just keep going in the meantime we re doing well go ahead question so how do you how long how long do you trump wait one second question how long do you think it should take north korea to denuclearize trump i don t know i don t want to get into question we ve seen estimates of one year two year trump steve i don t want to get into the time game you know why i told mike pompeo i said mike don t get into the time game we stopped them they re taking down plants they re taking down a lot of different testing areas they re going to take down some more you ll be hearing about that very soon i don t want to go ahead of myself but you ll be hearing about it soon they have no interest right now in testing nuclear you know we had a case just about when i was coming into office you ll ph remember it where there was a massive they thought it was an earthquake a mountain moved over an inch and a half we re talking about mountains you know north korea s very mountainous beautiful land beautiful this mountain actually shifted it shifted and somebody thought it was an earthquake and then they found out no this was nuclear testing shifted a mountain i m talking about serious stuff serious size when i came in and certainly before i came in and even at the beginning of mine because when i was having rhetorical you know contests really i guess you could call it with chairman kim which we both smile at now and we laugh at but everybody thought that was a horrible thing we ve had many presidents were unable to do anything anything at all with north korea we now have a good relationship we have a good relationship and most importantly all of the things that you ve been hearing about the horror stories in my opinion they re gone now could they start up again yes i m a deal guy could they start yes could be that we don t work it out i think i have it right here i think that what we ve done behind the scenes which nobody really knows about and i don t blame you for not knowing about you know personal letters private letters but saying they want to get it done we know much more than the media for a change much more but if you saw what s going on behind the scenes i think you d be very impressed we were a country going to war i really believe that president obama would admit that he said it s by far his biggest problem when i sat with him prior to going to office going into office he said to me that s by far the biggest problem and he said to me that he was very close to going into war and millions of people not you know i i they say oh thousands of people no no not thousands millions of people would have been killed and that could have left you re right next to china you re right that could have been a world war very easily right now we re in a great position i don t want to play the time game i told mike pompeo don t let them do that to you i haven t given anything and all of a sudden we got back it was a few weeks ago i think we were back like two and a half months from the summit which was a great success and people are screaming what s taking so long i said oh i get it you got to understand the media i ve been dealing with the media all my life too much too much they re screaming and i saw that and our guys were and not mike but our guys were being oh well we re working as fast i said i got all the time in the world i don t have to rush it there s no you know cessation ph of sanctions we got the sanctions on i didn t take any sanctions off i did see a reporter last night a guy i like personally a lot and he asked a question to president moon of south korea he said why did the president give so much i didn t give anything i gave nothing what have i given other than some time yes i flew to singapore we had a meeting now giving would be if i took the sanctions off i didn t want to do if you ask general mattis for a year and a half i said why don t we stop these ridiculous in my opinion the military games i call them the military games if i told you how much those games cost and frankly i told south korea you should be paying for these games we pay for them they say well we fly the planes in from a short distance away i said where is that guam oh huh how long a trip is that seven hours oh great we re flying these massive bombers and inaudible i ve wanted to stop this for a long time i consider that an asset but we ve done we re saving by the way just for the taxpayer ph we re saving a fortune and if we need them we can start them up immediately if i think we need them i ll start them before the generals will start them the fact is this reporter said that i said what have we done i haven t given anything and we re really onto the cusp i think we re really going to do something that s going to be very important but we re not playing the time game if it takes two years three years or five months it doesn t matter there s no nuclear testing and there s not testing of rockets yes ma am go ahead go ahead please this is the one that was nodding with every nice thing i said so watch this question question it s a habit of mine inaudible crosstalk trump you re with who question hannah thomas peter ph from sky news trump ok good sky news congratulations on the purchase laughter question nothing to do with me trump i hope you benefited go ahead question are you at all concerned at the message that has been sending being sent to the women who are watching this when you use language like con job in relation to allegations to sexual assault trump i ve used much worse language in my life than con job that s like probably the nicest phrase i ve ever used i mean con job it is it s a con job you know confidence it s a confidence job but they it s a con job by the democrats they know it question what about the message that s being sent to women who are watching crosstalk trump they did the same thing with the russia investigation they tried to convince people that i had something to do with russia there was no collusion think of it i m in wisconsin i m in michigan i say gee we re not doing well i won both those states we re not doing well ah let me call the russians to help does anybody really believe that it s a con job and i watch these guys little adam schiff and all of the guys he takes a call from a russian who turned out to be a faker you know he was a comedian or something this is so and so calling for he took the call why is he taking a call from a russian senator warner took a call from a russian he was a comedian or something but he said we have pictures of president trump whoa where can i get them if we ever did that it would be like a big deal yes it s a con job and it s not a bad term it s not a bad term at all crosstalk trump i ll tell you one thing i can say i ve had a lot of people talking about this to me with respect to what s happening because it s a horrible precedent i m going to have to get other judges and other supreme court judges possibly i could have a lot of supreme court judges more than two and when i called up brett kavanaugh spoke to him and his family and told them that i chose them they were so happy and so honored it was as though i mean the biggest thing that s ever happened and i understand that u s supreme court i don t want to be in a position where people say no thanks no thanks i don t want it you know i spoke to somebody 38 years ago and it may not be good we have a country to run we want the best talent in the world but i ll tell you this the people that have complained to me about it the most about what s happening are women women are very angry you know i got 52 percent with women everyone said this couldn t happen 52 percent women are so angry and i frankly think that i think they like what the republicans are doing but i think they would have like to have seen it go a lot faster trump but give them their day in court let her have her day in court let somebody else have a day in court but the ones that i find i mean i have men that don t like it but i have women that are incensed at what s going on i ve always said women are smarter than men i ve said that a lot and i mean it but women women are incensed at what s going on yes go ahead go ahead go ahead go ahead in the back who are you or where you re from yeah you guy looks like he s shocked this is going to be not good guy looks totally like stunned that i ve have you ever been picked before for a question question yes sir but not from president of united states trump go ahead go ahead and give me a question question thank you very much my name s magid galee ph from inaudible network ph i want to sir ask you you always talk about trump excuse me you said where from where question hudami direct network from kudasa region northern iraq ph trump ok question i m a kurd trump good good great people question sir thank you sir trump great people question mr president unidentified you are trump thank you are you a kurd question mr president trump good question mr president trump they re great people they re great fighters i like them a lot let s go i like this question so far question mr president mr president you always say you support your allies kurds right now after the defeat of isis are under a lot of pressure in syria and in iraq by many adversaries trump it s true question what will do to alleviate their position to support them after they helped the united states to defeat isis trump well we are helping them a lot and we ve been very friendly with them and as you know we ve fought side by side and we have defeated isis essentially very short while ago in the middle east and we did it with a lot of help from the kurds and they are they re great fighters you know some people are great fighters and some people aren t the kurds are great fighters and they re great great people and we re going to be we re discussing that situation exactly right now question what will you do to support them sir trump well i m just telling you we re going to be discussing that situation we have already started discussing that situation but we have had tremendous support from the kurds in supporting isis ok question what about syria sir in your speech you did not mention trump yes go you don t need it question mr president susan lee from fox business did you reject a one on one meeting with the canadian prime minister justin trudeau trump yes i did question why trump because his tariffs are too high he doesn t seem to want to move and i ve told him forget about it and frankly we re thinking about just taxing cars coming in from canada that s the mother load that s the big one we re very unhappy with the negotiations and the negotiating style of canada we don t like their representative very much they re taken i love canada by the way i have so many friends i have everybody so many friends but that has nothing to do with this i m representing the united states mexico was totally i mean they were great by the way the new president has been great the deal is done now it has to go through congress and you know a lot of things have to happen but we ve done bob lighthizer whose here someplace where s bob bob lighthizer s done a great job of negotiating as they have but the deal is done except for congress question mr president trump but canada has treated us very badly they ve treated our farmers in wisconsin and new york state and a lot of other states very badly dairy products 300 percent 300 percent how do you sell a dairy product at 300 percent the answer is you don t what it is is a barrier it s basically they re saying we don t have any barriers by the way it s 300 percent so you don t send any because you can t compete so canada has a long way to go i must be honest with you we re not getting along at all with their negotiators we think they re negotiators have taken advantage of our country for a long time we had people that didn t know what they were doing and that s why we had over the last five or six years if you average it out we had 800 billion a year in trade losses it s ridiculous it s not going to happen question what after nafta sir mr president nafta trump go ahead question what does that mean for nafta will you be pulling out of nafta trump i don t like nafta i never liked it it s been very bad for the united states it s been great for canada it s been great for mexico very bad for us question will you pull out of the trump i m not going to use the name nafta i refuse to use it i ve seen thousands of plants and factories close i ve seen millions of jobs lost to auto companies that moved remember mexico has 25 percent of our auto business now because of nafta under our deal not going to happen anymore hate to tell you it s not we re going to keep companies and i we i told the mexicans i said we have to keep companies but they re getting a lot also they re getting other things they re getting a lot of good things mexico made a very good deal but with canada it s very tough what we re doing is if we made a deal with canada which is a you know good chance still but i m not making anything near what they want to do wouldn t be fair question but you re going to are you going to notify congress of pulling out of nafta trump what we re probably going to do is go with the usmc like the united states marine corps which i love general kelly likes it even more where s general kelly he likes that usmc which would be u s mexico canada but it ll probably or possibly be just usm it ll be united states and mexico question yes or no are you going to trump canada will come along now if canada doesn t make a deal with us we re going to make a much better deal we re going to tax the cars that come in we will put billions and billions of dollars into our treasury and frankly we ll be very happy because it s actually more money than you can make under any circumstance with making a deal ok good job too you do a you do a very good job really yes please mr kurd ph go ahead question thank you very much for your time mr president two quickly questions what will be the usa relations with the kurds trump oh i thought crosstalk question post isis post isis and trump ok we re trying to get along very well we do get along great with the kurds we re trying to help them a lot don t forget that s their territory we have to help them i want to help them go ahead what s next they fought with us they fought with us they died with us they died we lost tens of thousands of kurds died fighting isis they died for us and with us and for themselves they died for themselves but they re great people and we have not forget we don t forget i don t forget what happens someday later but i can tell you that i don t forget these are great people ok yes ma am please question about mr president about iran one question what is your clear plan to stop iranian influence in iraq in syria and especially in crosstalk trump well i think you ve seen that i must tell you it s a i don t mind your question crosstalk question thank you trump i think there s been no greater change other than maybe china because china unfortunately their markets have dropped would you say 30 percent in the last four months right i think i watched you recently when you said that i said i think she s wrong i think it s actually 32 but that s ok but a lot there s been no other than maybe that but even that because china is a very special place and iran is a very special place but i think there s been no country that s changed so much as iran in the last six months since i took off the horrible horrible iran nuclear deal as they called one of the dumbest deals ever made as an example why didn t they take care of yemen in the deal why didn t they take care of syria in the deal you know what kerry said the reason it was too complicated we re giving 150 billion we paid 1 8 billion in cash cash this whole room would be filled up with hundred dollar bills trump and you d need probably five rooms like this we gave 1 8 billion in cash why didn t we take care of yemen why didn t we take care of syria and other and he said because it was too complicated well you just gave all your cards you gave them 150 billion and now yemen s a mess but it s getting better and syria s a mess and i was responsible and i hope it stays that way when i put out on social media a few weeks ago about idlib province i said don t do it and i ll tell you it happened where i was at a meeting with a lot of supporters and a woman stood up and she said there s a province in syria with 3 million people right now the iranians the russians and the syrians are surrounding their province and they re going to kill my sister and they re going to kill millions of people in order to get rid of 25 000 or 35 000 terrorists or enemies of theirs but i think we can call them terrorists and i said that s not going to happen i didn t hear of idlib province and i came back to new york and i picked up the failing new york times i hate to admit it was the new york but it was the failing new york times and opened it up not on the front page but there was a very big story i said wow that s the same story that the woman told me that i found hard to believe because why would how would anyone do that with 3 million people and it said that they were being surrounded and they were going in and starting literally the next day they were going to drop bombs all over the place and perhaps kill millions of people in order to get 35 000 terrorists and i put out on social media and elsewhere i gave mike pompeo john bolton everybody these orders don t let it happen i said don t let it happen that doesn t mean they can t be selective they can t be you know go in and they ve got to do what they ve got to do with terrorists i assume the terrorist but don t kill millions of people and it stopped you saw that no one s going to give me credit but that s ok that s ok because the people know i have had more syrians thank me for that this was about four weeks ago i put that out i said they re surrounding a city of 3 million people they re going to start bombing the city don t let it happen and i meant it too i meant it and millions of people have been saved and i i gave today great credit to iran i don t know if you heard that i gave great credit to iran to russia and to syria for not doing it now i hope it s going to be surgical meaning go in and do it s lengthy and everything else and they possibly have to do it but i think millions of people would ve been killed and that would ve been a shame and hopefully and i have to tell you turkey has been big help turkey has been great turkey s helped us very much with that whole situation question mr president trump yes yes question thank you mr president trump good thank you very much question touching back on iran of course this week you ve put out a call to action to other countries to rally with america to put pressure on iran rouhani s still calling for the u s to come back into the old deal but after meeting with world leaders this week did you make any progress towards a potential new deal trump it doesn t matter what world leaders think on iran iran s going to come back to me and they re going to make a good deal i think maybe not deals you never know but they re suffering greatly they re having riots in every city far greater than they were during the green period with president obama far greater when president obama stuck up for government not the people he probably would ve had a much different iran had he not done that but i m sticking up for the people i am with the people of iran but here s the thing they have rampant inflation their money is worthless everything is going wrong they have riots in the street you can t buy bread you can t do anything it s a disaster at some point i think they re going to want to come back and they re going to say hey can we do something and i very simple i i just don t want them to have nuclear weapons that s all is that too much to ask i don t want them to have nuclear weapons i want them to have a great economy i want them to sell so much oil so that the oil prices i m not happy with opec i told them i m not happy with opec we take care of all these people we defend them they wouldn t be there for two weeks if it wasn t for me and the united states and our much stronger armed forces than it was because our armed forces was depleted we had old equipment now we have hey you know better than anybody 700 billion and 716 billion we have the most incredible new jets and everything we need it not that i want to spend it although it is jobs it s all made in the united states but iran has to come back and they have to talk and i m not doing this from strength or weakness i m just saying at some point they re going to have to have to come back if you look at what s going on companies are leaving left and right mercedes benz just left they re all leaving they don t want to be in iran because they have a choice do they want to be with iran or do they want to be with us and we have we picked up 10 trillion since my election we were being caught by china now it s going the other way people can t believe it people have never seen this situation with china everything s always been for 20 years oh china s so great china s so great you don t hear that so much anymore i love china i think they re great but you don t hear that so much anymore you know who s great now we re great now ok how about just a couple more now i could be doing i could be doing this all day long i could be doing this all day long should we continue for a little while it doesn t matter to me a couple more i don t care new york times come on new york times the failing new york times stand up go ahead question inaudible trump no i m talking about the times is failing you are far from failing go ahead question ok but you re not you were pointing to me so you meant me but i trump the times are very interesting though the times i think they re going to endorse me question yes trump i think that abc i well fox i like fox i really do question just to be sure trump but i think abc cbs nbc the times the they re all going to endorse me because if they don t they re going out of business can you imagine if you didn t have me go ahead what would you like to say question just to be sure i know you were pointing to me but i work for pbs newshour right now trump i know that no i know that question ok so i want to ask you yesterday you were talking about your administration s accomplishments at the united nations and a lot of the leaders laughed why do you think they were laughing trump well that s fake news question and what was that experience like trump yes it s fake news and it was covered that way ok so i said that since my election our economy has become the hottest in the world tax reductions regulations confidence levels are the highest in 18 years really soon to be historic unemployment is the lowest in the history of our country you look at black unemployment you look at asian unemployment you look at women 65 years the unemployment numbers are the best we ve ever had ever the numbers pouring into our country which nobody thought was possible and i said this and i was in front of a large group of highly professional people most of whom are from either other countries or the united nations people that aren t big into clapping applauding smiling and i heard a little rustle as i said our country is now stronger than ever before it s true i mean it is true and i heard a little rustle and i said it s true and i heard smiles and i said oh i didn t know that s be like a they weren t laughing at me they were laughing with me we had fun that was not laughing at me so the fake news said people laughed at president trump they didn t laugh at me people had a good time with me we were doing it together we had a good time they respect what i ve done the united states is respected again the united states was not respected everybody was taking advantage of us from jobs and taking our companies and not paying the price to so many other things even military protection i told a number of countries over the last few days i said listen you re a very rich country we protect you without our protection you would have real problems you would have real problems question i want to trump i said you should reimburse us for this protection why are we protecting you and you want to know what they said after about two minutes of talking they agreed with me and you can ask this group of very talented people they agreed with me but they said one of them said but mr president nobody ever asked us for that they never asked us for that nobody s ever said you should pay these are really wealthy countries i mean i ll be honest i just asked japan i said we re defending you you re a very wealthy country you re sending us millions of cars you re making a fortune we have a tremendous trade deficit with you and we re defending you and we re subsidizing your military with a massive amount of money i said it to south korea we have 32 000 soldiers in south korea they are very wealthy these are great countries these are very wealth countries i said why aren t you reimbursing us for our cause and you know what they look at me and they can t even answer because there s no answer if they re a poor country and they needed protection and people were going to die i m all for protecting them i don t want 10 cents but when wealthy countries that have massive trade surpluses with us massive and then on top of that we re paying for their military or we re paying for a lot of their military that doesn t work how about two more and we ll call it question mr president really quickly mr president you said you feel a kinship you said you feel a kinship with brett kavanaugh and you mr president really quickly you said you felt a kinship with brett kavanaugh you said that you also your false allegations that you feel like were made against you make you feel like you don t want to believe these women what message do you think crosstalk trump no i didn t say that why do you say that fake news why did i say that question well can you please explain then what you talking about in your own false allegations crosstalk trump excuse me by the way i think you do a very good job but i didn t say that i do watch you and i think you do a very good job but i didn t say that question so could you explain what you meant trump i said exactly i look forward to watching her i do want to hear what she says and maybe she ll say i could be convinced of anything maybe she ll say something but in the meantime i have to tell you he s one of the highest quality human beings he s a tremendous man he s a tremendous genius he s a great intellect he was i believe number one at yale is that a correct statement number one in his class at yale he was a great student in law he was you know i ve heard his name i didn t know him didn t know him until this whole thing i didn t know him but i heard his name for 10 years and you know how i heard his name everybody was saying he should be on the supreme court i said who is he his name is brett kavanaugh and he should be he s the most brilliant person he s the most brilliant lawyer they were talking about him on the supreme court 10 years ago with all of that i want to hear what she has to say ok question but you said that you don t feel but you said that you feel like other ph of the numerous false allegations against you and that crosstalk trump i ve had many false i ve had many false statements against me and if the press would have reported i would have been very happy i think john roberts would tell you that you covered the story where the women were paid to say bad things about me sean hannity covered it i will tell you when i saw that on sean hannity i actually called him believe it or not i don t speak to him very much but i respect him i called him i said this is the biggest story this is a big big story he agreed with me the next day i picked up the papers there wasn t one word about it the next day i watched abc news john ph i watched nbc i watched cbs i didn t watch cnn but next time i ll do it ph question and are you ok with trump i watched everything there wasn t one story other than fox and it s a big story it s a shame ok enough thank you crosstalk question is it ok if i give it to the new york times mr president trump go ahead that s enough please good job good job question mr president could i ask a question since i am from the new york times before this gentleman crosstalk trump since you re where since you re where question i m actually from the new york times yamiche is my former colleague and we miss her but i was hoping crosstalk trump i ll let you do it after he does is that ok question that s perfectly well trump i will do that in honor of a paper i once loved thank you laughter go ahead question mr president my name is inaudible with trunews today you met with bibi netanyahu from israel and you brought up actually that you support a two state solution for the palestinian israeli crisis there can you give us any more preview of what the this great deal the peace deal crosstalk trump well i d love to be able to make a deal with the israelis and the palestinians you know my whole life i was told that s the toughest deal and i disagree i think health care is probably tougher ok you want to know the truth but it is tough but we re going to take care of that too that s going to get taken care of we ve already taken care of a lot of it but the whole my life i ve always heard the deal between as you know israel and the palestinians that s like the toughest deal every possible thing is tough about that i think we re going to make a deal i think we re going to make a deal so at one of our many meetings today i was with bibi netanyahu a man who i have a lot of respect for a man who s been extremely nice to me very happy that i did the whole thing with jerusalem and the embassy which by the way we got open in four months for less than 500 000 and the budget was over a billion dollars so we saved let s say a billion dollars that s not so bad and it s open and it s beautiful by the way jerusalem stone one of my favorite stones i will tell you the question somebody said today well this is the first news conference in a long time i said what do you mean i did like five today every time i sit i take a lot of questions from people that are screaming like maniacs in the back of the room meaning reporters and one of the reporters i won t say that it was john roberts that said that our issues ph but one of the it was but that s ok don t feel guilty john but one of the reporters that was screaming asked about the one state two state and i said i think the two state will happen i think it s one way more difficult because it s a real estate deal because you need meets and bounds and you need lots of carve outs and lots of everything it s actually a little tougher deal but another way it works better because you have people governing themselves and so they asked me about that i said well i think the two state will happen i think we re going to go down the two state road and i m glad i got it out and jared who s so involved he loves israel he loves israel but he s also going to be very fair with the palestinians he understands it takes two people to be happy two groups of people to be happy everybody s got to be happy and that s why it s so tough because there s been so much hatred and anger for so many years that s what probably the number one ingredient of toughness is trump but they asked me i said i think it s going to be a two state and you know what i did today by saying that i put it out there and if you ask most of the people in israel they agree with that but nobody wanted to say it it s a big thing to put it out it s a very big thing to put it out now bottom line if the israelis and the palestinians want one state that s ok with me if they want two states that s ok with me i m happy if they re happy i m a facilitator i want to see if i can get a deal done so that people don t get killed anymore when we had in saudi arabia we had one of the great conferences in history many of you were there probably all of you were there it s one of the most beautiful two days that and china two of the most incredible events i ve ever seen saw yet i ve never seen anything like it and we had i believe 58 muslim countries their leaders the kings the emirs the absolute leaders from every there was nobody in second place they were the leaders of the whole thing and unbeknownst to anybody else people would come up to me individual it wasn t a set up they d come up to me and say sir you can t have peace in the middle east without peace between the israelis and the palestinians i said why what difference why does that matter so much they said it just is impossible to make peace in the middle east unless you have between the israelis so i heard that from one the king of saudi arabia whose a great guy king salman and then somebody else came up and he wasn t told oh go up and say it i know where they re coming from and i must have had 12 leaders say it and they just said it and i started to realize that peace between israel and the palestinians for the middle east is a very important thing and we re trying very hard to get it i think probably two state is more likely but you know if they do a single if they do a double i m ok with it if they re both happy if they re both happy i m ok with either i think the two state is more likely ok question new york times new york times trump ok question thank you sir trump i would have gotten a bad story in the new york times but i will anyways so i guess it doesn t matter ok we ll do you after then we ll call it quits question we re kind of thriving not failing these days trump you re doing very well say thank you mr trump question i think i ll stop short of that trump i wonder how you do you know all my life i ve had very few stories but i ve had some on the front page of the new york times now i think i average about three or four a day right and of the three or four they re all negative no matter what i do they re negative but you know what that s ok i still love the paper go ahead question i wanted to come back to china because i think what you announced today was really important trump i agree question you talk about this friendship you have with xi jinping and yet essentially what you did today is accused his government of interfering in our internal affairs trump that s right question averting our democratic process and doing it to hurt you the republican party trump doing it to help them question and your backers trump yeah doing it to help them question so how can a guy who does that be your friend trump i think that we are able to and maybe he s not anymore i ll be honest with you i think we had a very good friendship i think we had a very good relationship we understand each other they are doing studies on donald trump they re trying to figure it all out because this has never happened to them before it s never happened think of it you ve never seen you ve covered very well you ve never seen this happen they re having big problems i don t want them to have problems but they ve got to make a fair deal just like canada s got to make a fair deal i believe that he and i have a very good chemistry together and i can tell you that about many leaders i can also tell you a few where i don t feel i ll ever have a chemistry with them i don t want to have a chemistry with them and for those people i ll have pompeo nikki bolton jared i can go our general i ll have our general or if they can t do it i ll have sarah huckabee do it right but but for the most part i have very a very good with prime minister abe very good with president moon by the way what president moon said last night i know you won t report it but bret baier interview him last night and he asked him about me i can t say because you would say i m too braggadocious but what he said about me last night was an unbelievable thing it couldn t have happened without president trump and it never would happen without president trump and nobody else could do it you know i mean you ll take a look but i will tell you china is very special very special they re incredible people it s an incredible country what they ve done is unbelievable question how would trump and it all started with the wto it was defective deal and it all started without the wto china is not china as we know it today and then it started also by our people that are standing right on this position that are in the oval office another way of saying it allowed them to get away with murder allowed a lot of countries to get away with murder i think we still probably have a very good relationship but you know what in honor of you i will tomorrow make a call to him and say hey how you doing ok you don t mind paying billions of dollars a month on tariffs question i just have two two small follow ups one is how would you compare the level of interference you see today from the chinese to what russia did in 2016 trump well i think it s different if you look at the des monies register i mean they have ads that are made to look like editorials saying about oh you got to stop trump you got to stop him you got to vote against him my farmers are these are patriots you know on a network that doesn t like me very much which is most of them but a network that didn t doesn t really treat me very good they interviewed farmers and they got hurt because you know all of a sudden china s stops buying by the way they ve started buying again i don t know if you ve noticed and soybeans are going up and things are going up and we ve had very little hurt from what i ve done in fact the markets have gone up and the farmers are going to do great but ultimately but they had farmers and these guys are amazing i love them and they voted for me and they love me and they said we don t care if we get hurt he s doing the right thing and you know a lot of people it s a complex game a lot of people don t know exactly what it is they don t know how to define tariffs they don t know it is really different than a tax although it s getting close but they know that for the time in many many years they have a president that s fighting for them that s not letting their jobs be taken to other countries that s not allowing the kind of abuse that we i mean when you look at what happened as an example with nafta and for years because it was never changed nafta was a defective deal the day it was signed you know why because they had a vat tax of 17 percent and nobody from this country knew that and by the time they found out which was about a week later nobody went and changed it so you went many years and they never changed it there was a vat tax that mexico got so we were 17 or 16 points behind before we even started nafta was a horrible thing so the farmers and by the way the steel workers you know i stopped the dumping the dumping was horrible and now if they want to dump that s ok but they ve got pay the united states of america 25 percent on everything they dump that s ok but as i told you before steel is doing phenomenally well but the farmers say this man s fighting for us no president has ever fought for us before and you really have to study what s happened over the 15 years with our the farmers have been decimated over a 15 year period they ve been decimated the farmers are going to come out great these are great people they re great great patriots i think we should finish with that one is that ok question ok trump go ahead let s go fast question sure what trump i always like i always like to finish with a good one elton john said when you hit that last tune and it s good don t go back question well let me ask you trump i ve seen have you ever seen they do great they re great they hit the last tune and everyone goes crazy then they go back for an encore right and they don t hit it and they leave everyone leaves and they say that wasn t a very good concert was it let s go question well i ll ask you one one final question trump you don t make me wrong go ahead question ahead of tomorrow s hearing because you were asked earlier in the news conference about trump say it again say it again question about the hearing tomorrow trump yes question you were asked earlier in the news conference by my friend from sky news about the message that you are sending to trump yes question the women of the country trump right question what about the message that you may be sending to young men you re a father what does this moment that we re in the cultural moment trump it s a very big cultural moment question right so what what messages do you have trump it s a very big it s also question for the young men of america trump you re right i i think it s a great question this is a very big moment for our country because you have a man who s very outstanding but he s got very strong charges against him probably charges that nobody s going to be able to be to prove so i could have you chosen for a position i could have you or you or you anybody and somebody could say thing ph and it s happened to me many times where false statements are made and honestly nobody knows who to believe i could pick another supreme court judge justice i could pick another one another one another one this could go on forever somebody could come and say 30 years ago 25 years ago 10 years ago 5 years ago he did a horrible thing to me he did this he did that he did that and honestly it s a very dangerous period in our country and it s being perpetuated by some very evil people some of them are democrats i must say because some of them know that this is just a game that they re playing it s a con game it s at the highest level we re talking about the united states supreme court this can go on forever i can pick five other people at a certain point the people are going to say no thank you this is the most coveted job probably in the world and you know what i would honestly say because i interviewed great people for this job he s great but i interviewed other great people for this job i could conceivably imagine going to one of them and saying it s too bad what happened to this wonderful man but i m going to choose you number two i want you to go and i could conceivably be turned down by somebody that desperately wanted this job two months ago so this is question with respect sir trump this is this is beyond supreme court question right trump there s nothing beyond supreme court this is beyond supreme court this is everything to do with our country when you are guilty until proven innocent it s just not supposed to be that way always i heard you re innocent until proven guilty i ve heard this for so long and it s such a beautiful phrase in this case you re guilty until proven innocent i think that is a very very dangerous standard for our country with that being said i look forward to what she has to say i also look very forward to what judge kavanaugh has to say i think it s going to be a very very important day in the history of our country i want to thank you all question and sir trump we ll do it again question the message to young men trump thank you question sir that young men trump thank you very much question young teenage men trump thank you very much question nothing to say sir staff please ladies and gentlemen remain seated as our delegation departs end write to katie reilly at katie reilly time com
