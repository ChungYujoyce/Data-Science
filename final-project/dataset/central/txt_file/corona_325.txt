more lenient order on monday we will consider what standards should be used with regard to masks he told an interviewer on kamc tv right now i probably will not be ordering a statewide usage of masks obviously they are encouraged to be done but i don t think a mandate would be necessary previewing what he has said could be a lifting of his stay at home order on monday abbott told radio talk show hosts in two markets that he was determined texas should keep its ranking by some publications as the nation s most business friendly state we re going to be making an announcement opening so many different types of businesses where you re going to be able to go to a hair salon go to any type of retail establishment you want to go to different things like that with a structure in place that will ensure that we slow the spread of the coronavirus he told a lubbock interviewer abbott told wbap in dallas fort worth that he and his advisers have been talking to businesses in detail about safe ways to reopen they re saying they need about a week to go back in and clean up their facilities and whether it be a movie theater or a restaurant to get everything organized to make sure they have all the supplies they need he said but this is going to be happening in the first couple of days in may where you re going to be able to go back and go dining under safe standards you re going to be able to get a haircut you re going to be able to go to a hair salon you re going to be able to start doing some things that people have been been long wanting to do abbott also told wbap morning news that either friday or monday he ll greatly revise his stay at home order that expires april 30 we ll put a new order in place that begins to open up a lot of businesses and so we re running pretty much every different type of business that exists in the state of texas including churches he said and he said counties such as parker county which have had few covid 19 cases will get more freedom to reopen business than let s say the dallas counties of the world abbott also said he is talking with officials of professional sports and the ncaa about games starting again without fans they are ready to get going and they likely will be getting going with doing so without crowds at first he said in his appearance on the chad hasty show on lubbock s 95 1 fm and kfyo am the republican governor said life is not going to be like it was before and texas won t be fully opened but restrictions he ordered last month will be significantly eased counties with high rates of coronavirus infection won t be permitted as much leeway he cited moore county in the panhandle which has 7 43 cases per 1 000 residents and nearby potter and randall counties which include amarillo as having too high of a growth rate right now when commerce starts to widen there will be some level of expansion of the spread of the coronavirus but he said we can handle that as long as the expansion is very minimal businesses that reopen will have to follow the safest practices though he mentioned distancing practices he didn t explain how safety would be maintained in hair salons and other personal care businesses currently abbott has the entire state under an executive order requiring people to stay home unless they are participating in activities deemed essential on tuesday dallas county extended its stay at home order through may 15 also tuesday at a capitol news briefing in austin abbott said his revised plan would overrule orders by local government officials as he has said before abbott told hasty he was not reviving economic activity in a way that amounts to rushing the gates and having everybody get sick and having to close businesses down again he noted that he has four physicians as medical advisers on his new strike force to open texas because we have this team of doctors working with us advising us on the safest way to do this without spreading the coronavirus there will be standards

asked about a move by colleyville to let restaurants resume dining service on outdoor patios with spacing between patrons on friday abbott acknowledged that there might be some tension between what the tarrant county city is doing and his orders but he stressed that any differences could be resolved in a phone call asked about criticism that he was moving too fast to reopen businesses or not fast enough abbott said it could be done in a safe way that doesn t lead to a retrenchment without mentioning lt gov dan patrick who on fox news on monday suggested he d prefer a faster reopening abbott told hasty he was looking at the long game on recovery from covid 19 and the economic hardship that social isolation has caused there s some people who want to be real impulsive and think about let s just focus on tomorrow abbott said i m focusing on the next year the virus is still here he cautioned in typical texas fashion we are going to continue to lead america for doing business by
