during a raucous vaping debate in the white house on nov 22 president donald trump said his administration will raise the legal age for buying e cigarettes to 21 vaping executives public health experts and lawmakers sparred at the round table which trump convened in order to weigh his options on policies that would ideally simultaneously limit youth use of e cigarettes while preserving vaping industry jobs and adult access to these products which proponents say serve as smoking cessation tools when groups like the trade group vapor technology association suggested raising the legal age of purchase to 21 trump indicated that his administration had already decided to do so twenty one we re going to be doing he said at one point that solution appears to be a substitute for trump s sept 11 proposal of a plan to remove from the market all youth friendly flavored vaping products including mint and menthol mint and menthol have often been exempted from regulations because they are used in traditional tobacco products raising concerns that a ban on them would make users revert to combustible products trump s announcement in september drew praise from public health groups who lauded the administration s efforts to curb a youth vaping epidemic and an outbreak of vaping related lung illnesses it also triggered protest from vapers and industry organizations who argued that such a policy would force vaping shops to close and potentially push e cig users back to tobacco who should be time s person of the year for 2019 cast your vote in the reader poll in the following weeks the protestors seemed to win out no finalized policy was ever released and media reports suggested trump had cooled on the plan fearing backlash from key voters trump tweeted on nov 11 that he would soon be meeting with lawmakers doctors and vaping industry officials to talk about children s health safety together with jobs this week the white house protested reports that the plan had been abandoned maintaining that the policy making process is not stalled that meeting finally came together on nov 22 among the many attendees were the meeting frequently grew heated with public health advocates and vaping executives going head to head on questions like whether e cigarettes work for smoking cessation and if adults use flavored products to quit smoking even rival e cigarette makers juul and njoy took shots at one another with njoy ceo ryan nivakoff noting that even after juul has made moves to stop selling flavored pods it still has far higher levels of youth use than njoy competitors like njoy and vuse also argued that juul decided to stop selling flavors as a long game move to wait out smaller competitors who may be driven out of business if a flavor ban goes through juul ceo crosthwaite maintained that ceasing flavored sales was the responsible thing to do as the market leader numerous public health experts in the room said they supported a national ban on flavored e cigs all of the public health and medical organizations were united on this request american lung association ceo harold wimmer who attended the meeting tells time we are certainly hoping that trump will listen to the public health and medical organizations trump raised a number of concerns about a flavor ban at the meeting primarily that a ban would push sales of flavored vaping products into the black market if you don t give it to em it s going to come here illegally he said instead of reynolds or juul or legitimate companies they re going to be selling stuff on the street corner that could be horrible trump did not definitively say whether a flavor ban will be enacted we re going to be announcing the administration s decision very soon he said as members of the press were ushered out of the room goza of the american academy of pediatrics says it would be a mistake to abandon a plan to stop selling flavored products i have no problem with raising the age of purchase to 21 she tells time but we know children as young as 8 and 9 are juuling and vaping the flavors are what draw them in we have to get the flavors off the market abboud of the vapor technology association says raising the age of purchase will have a far greater impact than a full ban bans don t work he says it is somewhat fanciful to suggest they re going to implement a flavor ban and there will not be flavored products sold on the black market so called tobacco 21 or t21 laws have been shown to cut down on teenagers ability to buy and share tobacco products and have traditionally been supported by public health organizations but in recent years some groups have been uneasy that many t21 laws are backed and in some cases even drafted by vaping and tobacco companies and some of these efforts have led to legislation light on enforcement and heavy on loopholes and perhaps more to the point written in ways that prevent governments from implementing stricter laws in the future a 2019 report from the american cancer society action network concluded that 51 of 88 age of sale bills introduced this year benefitted tobacco industry interests still goza says she s optimistic about the trump administration s intentions the president opened up the meeting saying we have to do what s right for children and he ended the meeting saying the same thing she says to me that s a good sign i
