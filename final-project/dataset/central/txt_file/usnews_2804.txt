special counsel robert mueller spoke out publicly for the first and possibly only time since his 2017 appointment wednesday morning to make a statement on his findings in the investigation into 2016 presidential election interference i am speaking today because our investigation is complete mueller said in the live streamed conference at the justice department before announcing that he would resign to return to private life he took no questions from reporters following his comments his statement comes as house democrats continue to seek his testimony on the investigation rep jerrold nadler wrote a letter to mueller on april 18 asking that the special counsel testify publicly before may 23 it is clear congress and the american people must hear from special counsel robert mueller in person to better understand his findings nadler said on twitter at the time attorney general william barr told the wall street journal on may 16 that he was not preventing mueller from giving congressional testimony in the wake of his own refusal to present the house with an unredacted version of the mueller report mueller made it clear wednesday that he would prefer not to testify before congress the report is my testimony he said here s the full transcript of mueller s statement on the investigation two years ago the acting attorney general asked me to serve as special counsel and he created the special counsel s office the appointment order directed the office to investigate russian interference in the 2016 presidential election this included investigating any links or coordination between the russian government and individuals associated with the trump campaign i have not spoken publicly during our investigation i am speaking today because our investigation is complete the attorney general has made the report on our investigation largely public and we are formally closing the special counsel s office as well i am resigning from the department of justice and returning to private life i ll make a few remarks about the results of our work but beyond these few remarks it is important that the office s written work speak for itself let me begin where the appointment order begins and that is interference in the 2016 presidential election as alleged by the grand jury in an indictment russian intelligence officers who were part of the russian military launched a concerted attack on our political system the indictment alleges that they used sophisticated cyber techniques to hack into computers and networks used by the clinton campaign they stole private information and then released that information through fake online identities and through the organization wikileaks the releases were designed and timed to interfere with our election and to damage a presidential candidate and at the same time as the grand jury alleged in a separate indictment a private russian entity engaged in a social media operation where russian citizens posed as americans in order to interfere in the election these indictments contain allegations and we are not commenting on the guilt or innocence of any specific defendant every defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in court the indictments allege and the other activities in our report describe efforts to interfere in our political system they needed to be investigated and understood that is among the reasons why the department of justice established our office that is also a reason we investigated efforts to obstruct the investigation the matters we investigated were of paramount importance it was critical for us to obtain full and accurate information from every person we questioned when a subject of an investigation obstructs that investigation or lies to investigators it strikes at the core of the government s effort to find the truth and hold wrongdoers accountable let me say a word about the report the report has two parts addressing the two main issues we were asked to investigate the first volume of the report details numerous efforts emanating from russia to influence the election this volume includes a discussion of the trump campaign s response to this activity as well as our conclusion that there was insufficient evidence to charge a broader conspiracy and in the second volume the report describes the results and analysis of our obstruction of justice investigation involving the president the order appointing me special counsel authorized us to investigate actions that could obstruct the investigation we conducted that investigation and we kept the office of the acting attorney general apprised of the progress of our work as set forth in our report after that investigation if we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime we would have said that we did not however make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime the introduction to volume two of our report explains that decision it explains that under long standing department policy a president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office that is unconstitutional even if the charge is kept under seal and hidden from public view that too is prohibited the special counsel s office is part of the department of justice and by regulation it was bound by that department policy charging the president with a crime was therefore not an option we could consider the department s written opinion explaining the policy against charging a president makes several important points that further informed our handling of the obstruction investigation those points are summarized in our report and i will describe two of them first the opinion explicitly permits the investigation of a sitting president because it is important to preserve evidence while memories are fresh and documents are available among other things that evidence could be used if there were co conspirators who could now be charged and second the opinion says that the constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing and beyond department policy we were guided by principles of fairness it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge so that was the justice department policy and those were the principles under which we operated from them we concluded that we would not reach a determination one way or the other about whether the president committed a crime that is the office s final position and we will not comment on any other conclusions or hypotheticals about the president we conducted an independent criminal investigation and reported the results to the attorney general as required by department regulations the attorney general then concluded that it was appropriate to provide our report to congress and the american people at one point in time i requested that certain portions of the report be released the attorney general preferred to make the entire report public all at once we appreciate that the attorney general made the report largely public i do not question the attorney general s good faith in that decision i hope and expect this to be the only time that i will speak about this matter i am making that decision myself no one has told me whether i can or should testify or speak further about this matter there has been discussion about an appearance before congress any testimony from this office would not go beyond our report it contains our findings and analysis and the reasons for the decisions we made we chose those words carefully and the work speaks for itself the report is my testimony i would not provide information beyond that which is already public in any appearance before congress in addition access to our underlying work product is being decided in a process that does not involve our office so beyond what i have said here today and what is contained in our written work i do not believe it is appropriate for me to speak further about the investigation or to comment on the actions of the justice department or congress it is for that reason that i will not take questions here today before i step away i want to thank the attorneys the fbi agents the analysts and the professional staff who helped us conduct this investigation in a fair and independent manner these individuals who spent nearly two years with the special counsel s office were of the highest integrity i will close by reiterating the central allegation of our indictments that there were multiple systematic efforts to interfere in our election that allegation deserves the attention of every american thank you write to rachel e greenspan at
