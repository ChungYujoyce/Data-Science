imagine if it had worked imagine if our president had leveraged his role as commander in chief to persuade a foreign power to open an investigation into his political opponent imagine if the president s rival lost the primary because news broke that he was under investigation imagine if that meant the president faced a weaker candidate in november 2020 and won re election as a result imagine if our president owed his victory to a foreign power and we never found out imagine how much influence the leaders of that country would have on our foreign policy decisions imagine how easily they could blackmail our commander in chief imagine what our president would do next knowing he could subvert our democracy without paying a price now imagine if eventually we did find out but it was too late because he had already won imagine what that would do to our faith in elections to our trust in government to our belief that we live in a democracy if president trump s efforts to coerce ukraine into interfering with american democracy had stayed a secret until the 2020 election if a whistle blower hadn t spoken out we would have fundamentally perhaps irrevocably lost faith in the legitimacy of our republic that is why there is no choice but to impeach and remove trump because he was willing to undermine our democracy to help his prospects of re election because he has stated unapologetically that he would do it again and most important because he wielded the powers of his office for personal benefit instead of for the benefit of the people and a president like that a president who puts himself over his country is exactly the kind of commander in chief our founders included impeachment in our constitution to remove article ii section 4 of our constitution delineates what offenses warrant the removal of a president the president shall be removed from office on impeachment for treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors this raises the question what exactly is a high crime or misdemeanor the answer isn t what you d expect high crimes and misdemeanors are not necessarily crimes as defined by criminal codes after all if the president decided to nuke canada unprovoked that would technically be within his rights as commander in chief but would nonetheless be grounds for impeachment nor do all crimes listed in criminal codes qualify as high crimes and misdemeanors one of the two high crimes enumerated by our founders bribery wasn t even in criminal codes when the constitution was written but while our founders never explicitly defined the term a consensus has emerged as to what a high crime and misdemeanor is as none other than vice president mike pence said in response to witness testimony in 2008 back when he was a member of congress this business of high crimes and misdemeanors goes to the question of whether or not the person serving as president of the united states put their own interests ahead of public service pence s definition echoed alexander hamilton s characterization of an impeachable offense as an abuse or violation of some public trust and in his conduct related to ukraine alone trump is guilty of three such abuses of trust trump s first abuse of trust is the one our founders feared most inviting a foreign power to interfere with our democracy as george washington said in his farewell address foreign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government james madison meanwhile proposed including impeachment in the constitution for the explicit purpose of ensuring that no president could betray his trust to foreign powers so trump isn t only guilty of an impeachable offense his efforts to encourage ukraine to investigate vice president joe biden constitute a paradigmatic impeachable offense one of the very high crimes that impeachment was included in our constitution to protect against he s also guilty of a second paradigmatic impeachable offense bribery and all of the evidence we need to prove trump partook in quid pro quo something for something exchanges is in the edited summary of the phone call released by his own white house in which our commander in chief offers up javelin antitank missiles and a white house meeting in exchange for the favor of ukraine s opening investigations into biden and the 2016 election trump administration officials have testified that the president also held back 391 million in security assistance from ukraine which congress had already appropriated as part of his effort to pressure president volodymyr zelensky into announcing an investigation of biden most strikingly trump ambassador gordon sondland a donor whom the president has referred to as a great american reversed his testimony this month and told congress there was a quid pro quo of course quid pro quo arrangements are aboveboard when the president is asking for a favor on behalf of the people if for instance trump asked england to share intelligence on a terrorist organization with the cia in exchange for u s intelligence that would be allowed the problem arises when the president asks a foreign power for a personal favor one that doesn t align with the interests of those he represents because when a president abdicates his duty witnessed by another country he leaves himself vulnerable to blackmail think about the leverage he gave ukraine if you don t triple our aid or quadruple it zelensky could ve later said then i ll tell the american people you sought to obtain foreign assistance in your election so perhaps it s no surprise trump has done everything he can to cover up these two high crimes which brings us to his third offense obstruction of justice which clearly falls under the category of an impeachable offense after all it s the very high crime that served as the key basis for president richard nixon s impeachment proceedings remember nixon may not have even known about the break in at the watergate congress moved to impeach him solely for covering it up and trump has done the same thing he s refused to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry blocked witnesses from testifying and ignored subpoenas all after trying to hide the whistle blower report and the transcript from congress in the first place all three of these impeachable offenses boil down to one truth with trump it s not ask what you can do for your country it s ask what a foreign country can do for you your own country be damned why some ask shouldn t we let trump s fate be determined on election day because trump has demonstrated over and over again that he is willing to manipulate the results of the election in his favor even if that means working with a foreign power to undermine our democracy asking americans to wait until the election is like asking to resolve a dispute with a game of monopoly when the very thing you ve been accused of is cheating on monopoly this is why congress must remove trump from office but while this is an open and shut case there s also no guarantee he will be impeached because the words in the constitution are as madison said mere parchment which means trump will be removed not by article ii section 4 but by human beings members of congress who are as courageous and as flawed as each and every one of us and they need voters to fill them with the courage they need to do the right thing so remind your representatives that this isn t about impeaching a president it s about coming together around our shared belief that no one is above the law and making sure our democracy is never this vulnerable to attack again it s about putting aside our differences and not only holding out america s motto as a goal to which we aspire but working every day to make it a reality e pluribus unum out of many one
