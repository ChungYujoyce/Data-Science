 by robert farley posted on august 16 2016 despite the fact that hillary clinton got a clean bill of health from her doctor fake medical records for clinton are circulating on some conservative websites purporting to show that shesuffers from seizures and dementia clinton s longtime physician whose name appears atop the alleged leaked documents released a statement to factcheck org calling the documents false and reiterating her diagnosis that clinton is in excellent health and fit to serve as president of the united states the fake records are making the rounds just as some in the conservative media have been baselessly questioning clinton s health among them was fox news sean hannity who played a tape of clinton vigorously shaking her head in a manner he deemed seizure esque although neither of the medical experts on his program agreed the doctored documents play off clinton s very real concussion in december 2012 which caused her to suffer double vision for nearly two months starting in late 2012 but her longtime physician lisa bardack director of internal medicine mount sinai health system at caremount medical says follow up medical exams in 2013 revealed complete resolution of the effects of the concussion the fake documents dated feb 5 2014 which appear to have originated from a since deleted twitter account purport to come from dr bardack but her title is wrong on the letterhead the letter purports to indicate that clinton suffered complications from a 2012 concussion including blacking out uncontrollable twitching and memory loss it says clinton has previously been diagnosed as having complex partial seizures and early onset subcortical vascular dementia the images were shared and discussed on numerous websites and in social media but again we can t stress this enough it s a fake document the same twitter user later posted what was purported to be a magnetic resonance angiogram of clinton s brain showing a significant abnormality in the brain tissue this is also a bogus image in a statement provided to factcheck org by the clinton campaign bardack dismissed the authenticity of these documents saying they are false were not written by me and arenot based on any medical facts bardack aug 16 as secretary clinton s long time physician ireleased a medical statementduringthe campaign indicating thatshe is in excellent health i have recently been made aware ofallegedly leaked medical documentsregardingsecretary clinton with my nameon them these documents arefalse were not written by me and arenot based on any medical facts to reiterate what isaid in my previous statement secretary clinton is in excellenthealth and fit to serve as president of the united states bardack who has served as clinton s personal physician since 2001 did publicly release a summary of clinton s health history and a medical evaluation in a letter dated july 28 2015 it paints a much different picture than the fake documents according to bardack s letter clinton is a healthy 67 year old female whose current medical conditions include hypothyroidism and seasonal pollen allergies the letter discusses clinton s concussion well documented in the media at the time and some of the lingering effects she suffered from it as the new york times noted in december 2012 clinton suffered a concussion after fainting and striking her head bardack s letter said clinton suffered a stomach virus after traveling and became dehydrated which caused her to faint bardack july 28 2015 during follow up evaluations mrs clinton was found to have a transverse sinus venous thrombosis and began anticoagulation therapy to dissolve the clot as a result of the concussion mrs clinton also experienced double vision for a period of time and benefited from wearing glasses with a fresnel prism here s clinton in those much discussed glasses which her aideacknowledged at the time was because of lingering issues stemming from her concussion bardack said clinton s symptoms including the double vision went away within two months bardack july 28 2015 she had follow up testing in 2013 which revealed complete resolution of the effects of the concussion as well as total dissolution of the thrombosis bardack said clinton s most recent physical examination on march 21 2015 revealed a healthy appearing female bardack said clinton has a healthy diet and exercises regularly including yoga swimming walking and weight training bardack july 28 2015 in summary mrs clinton is a healthy female with hypothyroidism and seasonal allergies on long term anticoagulation she participates in a healthy lifestyle and has had a full medical evaluation which reveals no evidence of additional medical issues or cardiovascular disease her cancer screening evaluations are all negative she is in excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the united states despite the public release of bardack s medical evaluation some conservative pundits have questioned clinton s health and ability to serve as president on fox news sean hannity repeatedly speculated about serious health issues for clinton hannity showed clips of clinton in the midst of a coughing fit in february stumbling while boarding a plane in 2011 and dramatically shaking her head during a press scrum in june which hannity said almost looks seizure esque to me never mind that two medical experts on the program said the video did not appear to show seizures though both called for a disclosure of medical records for both presidential candidates hannity aug 10 that last one in particular is so odd to me what was your take dr fiona gupta neurologist north shore brain and spine center you know it s just so hard to speculate based on snippets of the clips that you know what is going on without having a full examination and workup hannity look at this video right here watch her reaction because i m not it almost seemsseizure esqueto me gupta there are different types of seizures local seizures that sometimes can cause just one body part but it would be very rare i mean typically seizures will generalize so i can t say that s a seizure hannity aren t there many seizures like that dr siegel dr marc siegel fox news medical contributor i m not a neurologist and i don t think that necessarily looks like a seizure but i will say this an associated press reporter who was among those shouting questions to clinton during the press scrum inside amuffin shop called it an innocuous exchange that has become the fodder for one of some trump supporters most popular conspiracy theories her failing health perhaps eager to avoid answering or maybe just taken aback by our volume clinton responded with an exaggerated motion shaking her head vigorously for a few seconds ap reporter lisa lerer later wrote video of the moment shows me holding out my recorder in front of her laughing and stepping back in surprise after the exchange she took a few more photos exited the shop and greeted supporters waiting outside an opinion writer for newsweek who has epilepsy wrote that clinton s movements looked nothing like a seizure the writer called hannity s speculation degrading to people with epilepsy and he demanded an apology but hannity isn t the only one questioning clinton s physical fitness to be president though he was vague clinton s republican opponent donald trump said in a speech on foreign policy on aug 15 that clinton lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on isis and all of the many adversaries we face not only in terrorism but in trade and every other challenge we must confront to turn our great country around neither trump nor hannity referenced the fake medical documents purporting to be from dr bardack but their baseless speculation is also refuted by the public statements and medical evaluation released by clinton s longtime doctor https www sharethefacts co share 33293930 545e 423b aaea 0ff46ddad8f7 q
