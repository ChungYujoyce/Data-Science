you re nothing to me nothing she added then he took my shoulders and said you re okay you re fine in a statement to the new york times nyt kate bedingfield a deputy biden campaign manager said the allegations were untrue and absolutely did not happen vice president biden has dedicated his public life to changing the culture and the laws around violence against women he authored and fought for the passage and reauthorization of the landmark violence against women act he firmly believes that women have a right to be heard and heard respectfully such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press what is clear about this claim it is untrue this absolutely did not happen biden s campaign also released a statement from baker biden s executive assistant from 1982 to 2000 and who reade mentioned she notified of the incident in 1993 in all my years working for senator biden i never once witnessed or heard of or received any reports of inappropriate conduct period not from ms reade not from anyone baker said i have absolutely no knowledge or memory of ms reade s accounting of events which would have left a searing impression on me as a woman professional and as a manager these clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our senate office and to the man i know and worked so closely with for almost two decades last year as biden began planning a run for president eight women came forward to allege sexual harassment by the former vice president in the form of unwanted kissing hugging and touching during his decades in government the first lucy flores a former nevada assemblywoman alleged biden had touched and kissed her inappropriately at a 2014 campaign event in an essay in new york magazine biden responded directly to the allegations saying he felt he had never acted inappropriately and that he would listen respectfully to those who felt otherwise but critics later denounced biden for joking about some of the complaints and not apologizing directly the allegations levied against biden emerged amid the backdrop of the metoo era which began in 2017 and has led to countless victims of sexual assault and harrassment coming forward to accuse powerful people of misconduct several high profile politicians have stepped down due to allegations of sexual misconduct since the movement began including former new york attorney general eric schneiderman former senator al franken and president trump s former staff secretary rob porter trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual misconduct including forced kissing groping or assault and the allegations levied against him are far more severe than those directed at biden in a 2005 recording that was unearthed weeks before the 2016 election trump openly bragged about forcing himself onto women and said he would grab them by the pussy in the larry king clip the woman reade identified as her mother jeanette altimus called in

gave her a list of lawyers with expertise in the area time s up does not represent clients as the new york times reported according to the intercept the organization told reade they could not
