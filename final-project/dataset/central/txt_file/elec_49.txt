a few months ago matt schlapp the former white house political director under president george w bush walked into a cocktail party and tried to join a conversation with republican consultants hehas known for years the conversation quickly ended schlapp the chairman of the nation s oldest conservative grassroots organization told the hill in a recent interview everyone looked down at their expensive loafers i hadn t had that happen to me in a professional setting before he added it s one of those moments when you wonder hey do i have something on my face schlapp s decision to support donald trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more for president has cost him friends in washington s elite republican circles invitations he would normally receive no longer arrive the vibe he says he s getting is you re out of the club he s hardly alone old allies in washingtonand across the establishment northeast are no longer on speaking terms because onebacks trump and the other loathes the nominee divisions have run so deepin some casesthat they could take years to heal the fallout mike duhaime has witnessed what schlapp is living through on a larger scale duhaime is the top political adviser to new jersey gov chris christie in late february christie became one of the first republican leaders to endorse trump the fallout was brutal christie got publiclytrashed by the gop establishment his endorsement was called disgusting by former bush aide tony fratto former mitt romney adviser ryan williams accused christie of kissing donald trump s boots the governor wasexcoriated in a public letterby his former finance co chair meg whitman who now supports hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more and ridiculed on twitter foralleged indignitiesincluding fetching trump s mcdonald s order christie disputes the mcdonald s story there aren t a lot of people with the courage to go up to his face duhaime said of the attacks on christie a lot of the vitriol has come from people who are extraordinarily brave on twitter outside the professional political class however christie gets treated warmly according to duhaime that contrastbetween beltway iciness and a warm reception in real america is an experience commonly described by trump backers in the party two worlds sen david perdue among the most full throated trump supporters on capitol hill says the positive reactions he gets in his home state of georgia are unrecognizable from what he hears inside the beltway perdue hasn t lost any washington friendships over trump mainly because he was never close to many of the trump rejecters in the first place he believes many veteran republicans in d c can t relate to political outsiders therefore anybody who s in the republican caucus here that s pulling for trump is a little bit seen as askew perdue said and the reason is he s not of washington well you know what neither am i added perdue who like trump came to politics late in life after running largecompanies and is nowtheonly fortune 500 ceo in congress another trump loyalist to feel that divide is jeffrey lord a veteran of the reagan administration and a trump campaign surrogate on cnn home in pennsylvania people who ve seen lord on tv stop him in the grocery store and say nice things about trump when lord attended the glitzy white house correspondents dinner however he got a different reception a republican from a prominent think tank lord won t saywho attacked lord telling him he d betrayed conservatism and ronald reagan by supporting trump lord said the title of a hollywood tell all book you ll never eat lunch in this town again describes the sensation he now feels when he visits the town he once called home washington s political culture onmay 3 ari fleischer the white house press secretary under bush from 2001 to 2003 tweeted there s a lot about donald trump that i don t like but i ll vote for trump over hillary any day a former colleague of fleischer s fratto the bush aide who criticized christie s support repliedin a tweet then we don t have anything to say to each other fratto told the new york times that fleischer s betrayal was unforgivable you were the white house spokesperson when trump said the president lied the country into the death and maiming of people unnecessarily he told the times of fleischer how can ari be ok with that asked about fratto s reaction fleischer told the hill i ll always have something to say to tony whether tony wants to say anything to me or not fleischer believes these deeply personal reactions are peculiar to washington now he lives in new york and works in sports consulting wherehe doesn t lose friends over political differences one of the most wonderful things about being outside of washington is people differ on politicsbut have a lot more important and other things to talk about fleischer said i just think it s important he added not to let a political difference even over donald trump or hillary clinton rise to the level of personal rancor isn t that what s wrong with the system coping mechanisms so open is the contempt for trump within certain d c republican circles that some have calculated that it s better for their careers if they keep their support for trump a secret a senior house republican staffer who works for a committee chairman doesn t tell his colleagues that he likes trump or that hehasinformally advised the campaign basically nobody knows what i ve done said the staffer who asked for anonymity for fear of the impact his views could have on his career it s not something i talk about openly at work because there are a lot of strong feelings still among the staff people talk openly against the guy he worries it might harm his reputation if colleagues discover he s a major fan of trump i always felt that i would be viewed in a different light he said i think they would have pegged me as being all the things the media has said about trump that he was a racist a misogynist a xenophobe over drinks with colleagues after hours however the staffer is finding a growing number of colleagues who also secretly like trump it s kind of like you re doing this little weird sort of dance around it he said you haven t admitted to them that you re supporting the guy and they haven t admitted to you that they really like the guy and you get to the point where you ll say i kind of like what he says about this and they ll say well i kind of like that too lawmakers immune perhaps the only beltway politicos who aren t losing friendships over trump are lawmakers themselves none of the republican congressmen interviewed for this article said their support for trump had ruined friendships on capitol hill i have good friends of mine in congress that have come out publicly and said no to trump and our discussions are quite frank said rep bill shuster r pa chairman of the powerful house committee on transportation and infrastructure and i keep telling them just think about the supreme court when you go in there and you don t pull that lever for trump rep brian babin r texas has similar experiences i hear some colleagues saying well he s not a true conservative he insults people he said babin responds that trump makes mistakes because he s not a politician and you don t have to be a politician to recognize the problems this country faces one reason these pro trump lawmakers don t get attacked to their faces might be that they re imposing characters themselves i m known to be a little bit of a maverick said rep tom marino r pa an early trump backer marino s response to skeptical colleagues well how s it been going the last 30 years putting the party back together schlapp attributes a lot of the anger to wounded pride within a consultant class that failed to grasp the trump phenomenon if you are someone who spent your whole professional life making predictions selling your reputation for understanding politics he said i think this gets to the core of their pride and ego schlapp bush s former aide said the message voters are sending that washington is broken and that the people running washington are not listening gets to be a very personal message if you re living in those zip codes he hopes when this election is over whether trump wins or loses establishment republicans can reconcile with trump supporters in the meantime schlapp and his wife face an awkward stretch until election day i can t tell you the number of nights that we ve looked at each other and kind of felt a bit lonely he said laughing it s personal it s painful it s people you grew up with he added in politics you make these really great deep friendships because you work long hours and it s about issues that are important when those relationships break it s really heartbreaking but it also motivates you to say there s a lot on the line and a lot of emotion involved he added andscrew it you ve gotta do what s right view
