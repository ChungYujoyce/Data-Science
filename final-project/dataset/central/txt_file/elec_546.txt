wednesday evening in detroit offer a last chance for some candidates to break out of the lower tiers in the field among the top candidates the verbal punches will fly thick and fast as the big names vie for an advantage at the last big event before the campaign quietens down for much of august it s going to be like thunderdome said one democratic strategist unaligned with any presidential

southern segregationist senators of a previous era in the aftermath the california senator rose sharply in the polls and biden drifted down biden has to do much better this time around before anxiety among his supporters becomes a full on panic democratic strategist julie roginsky asked if she still considers the former vice president to be the leading candidate replied today but i don t know how many more debate performances where he is not hitting it out of the park he can absorb biden aides have indicated that they will take a more aggressive line against attacks however the candidate himself seems to understand the stakes i m not going to be as polite this time he told supporters at a fundraiser wednesday biden supporters know he needs to show more fight this time in part to bolster his central argument that he would be the most formidable candidate to face president trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president

sure to seize on any sign of weakness or hesitancy on biden s part this week several sources who spoke to the hill also noted that harris s success after slamming biden in miami is certain to encourage other candidates to take a leaf out of the same book harris scored a lot of plaudits for the way she conducted herself last time which opens the door for others to do the same said roginsky the potential for controversy is especially high because biden will be flanked on wednesday by harris and sen cory bookercory anthony bookerstakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff it s

addition to the lingering biden harris tensions booker and biden have been increasingly willing to hit each other directly booker raised the issue of biden s support for a controversial 1994 crime bill last week after the former vice president released his new plan for criminal justice reform the proud architect of a failed system is not the right person to fix it booker said in a statement the pointed jab drew an acerbic response from team biden biden s deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield accused booker of making specious charges and said that he had some hard questions to answer about his own past positions on policing including a zero tolerance approach bedingfield said booker supported while mayor of newark n j booker is among the candidates who has been struggling to gain traction in the race despite having a high profile at its outset it was only on monday morning that his campaign announced he had reached the criteria to qualifyfor the third round of debates to be

texas the much hyped o rourke has also struggled to live up to expectations so far his quest was further hindered by a mediocre debate performance in miami when he came under attack from former housing and urban development secretary juli n castro booker o rourke or any number of more marginal candidates could come out swinging on tuesday or wednesday but there is also the danger that such attacks could backfire it depends where you re at said joe trippi who was former vermont gov howard dean s presidential campaign manager in 2004 if you are at1 percent in the polls then unless you get attention it s all over on the other hand pouring gasoline around and lighting a match is not likely to work either still this week s debates are a do or die moment for some given the stricter rules that govern admission to the september debates this will be the last time i think we will see a third to a half of this group predicted mitchell mckinney the director of the political communication institute at the university of missouri in detroit candidates will also have to grapple with the dynamics of whether to confine their barbs only to rivals who are on stage alongside them or to take aim at someone who is debating on another night sanders and warren are the two highest polling candidates debating on tuesday raising the possibility that their clash could become a struggle for primacy among left leaning voters but their presence together could also give sen amy klobucharamy klobucharpoll biden leads trump by 5 points in minnesota the hill s morning report presented by

agenda with her own much more centrist platform the importance of the debates in detroit could also be magnified because they come at a time when the flow of other political news is beginning to slow the house of representatives is already in recess the senate has just one more week in session before its members are also expected to leave the capitol that means the battlefield is clear for the democratic presidential candidates to tangle directly with president trump or with each other get your popcorn advised trippi there ll be fireworks from somewhere the memo is a reported column by
