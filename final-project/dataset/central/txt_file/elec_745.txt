 by robert farley posted on october 31 2014 with the midterm elections now just days away many campaigns and outside groups are making their final appeals and as has been the case all election season some of the claims miss the mark and we ve seen repeats of claims we already debunked in new ads in races from north carolina to oregon in this campaign cycle house and senate ads alone ran more than 1 2 million times on local broadcast television through oct 20 according to kantar media intelligence s campaign media analysis group to put that in perspective a bloomberg columnist noted that if one were to watch all those ads back to back it would take more than a year without sleep but you d finish in time for the iowa presidential nomination caucuses political flag waving we hate to sound unpatriotic but an ad from florida rep alan grayson grossly overstates the sweep of his efforts to ensure that american flags be made in the u s a grayson s amendment required the department of homeland security to buy u s made flags but not the entire federal government as he implies in the ad it also created no jobs at the flag manufacturing plant featured in the ad despite his boast about all these jobs he helped to create the ad opens with grayson complaining about american flags being made in china for years our government was buying american flags made in china grayson says when i got to congress i was determined to do something about it grayson says as he strolls around an american plant making american flags last year i wrote and passed the amendment to ensure that american flags are made well and made here in america legislative efforts to ensure that american flags purchased by the federal government are american made have been kicking around the halls of the house and senate since at least 2008 when iowa democratic rep bruce braley first introduced the all american flag act that predates grayson s first stint in the house sen sherrod brown introduced a similar bill in the senate in 2011 and again in 2013 but legislation hasn t passed both chambers in a single session grayson s ad suggests he was able to swoop into congress and nail it down not so fast grayson s office pointed to an amendment proposed in june 2013 to the homeland security appropriations act the amendment prohibited the use of funds to purchase an american flag if the flag was certified as a foreign end product congressional records show the amendment was sponsored and offered by rep cheri bustos but her office says she teamed with grayson on it and grayson s office says he actually wrote the amendment it was agreed to in a voice vote the amendment ensured that all american flags purchased with funds from the fiscal year 2014 homeland security appropriations act would be made in the u s however as bustos made clear in her speech from the floor the day it was introduced the amendment was just the first step in what i hope is a larger effort to require that all american flags purchased by the federal government are actually made in america that legislative effort is still ongoing so how big of an issue is this proponents of such legislation often point to statistics from the u s census that in 2012 the u s imported 3 8 million worth of american flags mostly from china but that s all u s purchases including those by the federal government and it s a fraction of the overall american flag business in the u s dale coots marketing manager for annin flagmakers which bills itself as the oldest and largest flag manufacturer in the u s said retail flag sales were more than 160 million last year so imports make up less than 2 5 percent of sales she said most major retailers require flags to be american made coots said because customers demand it she doubts many of the flags purchased by the federal government are imported either so any impact on jobs would be minimal she said grayson also makes it seem like his amendment at least led to job creation at the factory shown in the ad now look at all these jobs grayson says as the camera shows images of workers making flags we re putting people to work and we re making a flag that we can all be proud of but it turns out not a single worker at goodwill industries of south florida the plant shown in the ad has been added due to grayson s efforts company officials specifically asked that the company not be identified or mentioned by name in the ad because goodwill does not endorse political candidates any suggestion that grayson s amendment increased the workforce there is not true lourdes de la mata little vice president of marketing atgoodwill industries told us by phone about 18 to 20 workers are employed there she said and the number hasn t changed in years goodwill has had a contract for more than 15 years to make interment flags for the department of veterans affairs she said one final note the ad at one point shows a flag waving little girl in a wagon no legislative proposals address the origin of american flags sold to the public so that girl s flag could have been from anywhere including china but based on current market trends the overwhelming odds are that it was american made no attack ads alaska sen mark begich claimed in an oct 30 debate that he didn t run attack ads in 2008 when running against then sen ted stevens yes he did one begich ad referred to stevens indictment on financial ethics charges that year it featured several alaskans making comments about stevens such as he s let us all down stevens was a republican senator for alaska from 1968 until 2009 he was defeated by begich in the 2008 election that was also a year in which stevens was indicted and later convicted on oct 27 2008 on seven felony counts of making false statements on federal financial disclosure forms about 250 000 worth of gifts and services to renovate his alaska home stevens maintained his innocence after the verdict was read saying according to the new york times this verdict is the result of the unconscionable manner in which the justice department lawyers conducted this trial in fact a federal judge set aside the conviction in april 2009 and appointed an independent investigator to look into possible misconduct by lawyers in the trial that investigator s report released in march 2012 after stevens 2010 death in a plane crash found that two justice department prosecutors had hidden documents that would have aided stevens defense at the oct 30 debate begich s republican challenger dan sullivan brought up the 2008 senate race he said begich had run attack ads in both of his races saying his opponents couldn t be trusted sullivan asked knowing what you know now that ted stevens was wrongly convicted by corrupt justice department lawyers and was an honorable man throughout his entire career do you regret the tv ads you ran against sen stevens in 2008 and have you apologized to his family begich replied actually dan i don t know if you saw that campaign but i ran ads about what i wanted to do for alaska i didn t run attack ads that s not accurate in at least one instance one of begich s 2008 ads refers to the indictment of stevens and features longtime ted stevens voters questioning the senator s innocence the ad doesn t spell out exactly what the people in the ad are talking about but the reference is quite clear one man says he s not the same ted stevens he used to be and a woman says the saying goes where there s smoke there s fire that s followed by more alaskans referring to the ethics charges plaguing the longtime senator there s still too many unanswered questions i think he s just you know trying to cover it up he s let us all down and it s time to move on nextgen s banner attack political attacks aren t limited to the tv the group nextgen climate action placed 4 foot banners around iowa this week that say joni ernst the iowa jobs killer with an image of destroyed wind turbines nextgen says the banners highlight ernst s opposition to the renewable fuel standard and wind production tax credit but that s a distortion of ernst s position she has said she s against subsidies in general but supports the rfs the rfs created in 2005 is a government mandate that requires a certain amount of renewable fuels such as ethanol be used in transportation fuel it s a popular issue in iowa and the senate race as the corn based ethanol is made at 42 plants in iowa according to the iowa corn promotion board and iowa corn growers association the state is also the top wind energy producer in terms of the percentage of electricity generated according to the american wind energy association nextgen s press release on the banners said it had distributed hundreds of them in key locations a spokesperson for nextgen the liberal group founded by billionaire climate change activist tom steyer told us ernst has made it clear that she would end the rfs if she could not exactly ernst says she would favor ending all government subsidies but until and unless that day comes she ll passionately defend the rfs she laid out her position in a letter to the iowa renewable fuels association in response to a survey by the group in december 2013 ernst dec 31 2013 while i do not believe the government should pick winners and losers in our economy and from a philosophical standpoint i do not believe in taxpayer subsidies i do believe that if we were to end these subsidies it would have to be done across the board for every sector at the exact same time meaning until and unless that day comes i will passionately stand in defense of the rfs and other related programs so she s against subsidies overall but for the rfs as long as any subsidies exist in january ernst also co sponsored an iowa senate resolution urging the federal government to renew its commitment to the rfs that resolution said an epa proposal to cut the level of renewable fuels required would cause the loss of 37 400 ethanol related jobs and the loss of 7 500 biodiesel related jobs the epa s final rule on the topic has been sent to the office of management and budget for review the executive director of the iowa renewable fuels association monte shaw told the courier of the state s cedar valley in july that there was little difference between ernst and her opponent democratic rep bruce braley on the rfs issue from our perspective she has voted with the renewable fuels industry each time there was a key vote that we targeted as a state senator he told the paper shaw ran unsuccessfully for the republican nomination for iowa s 3rd district this year ernst s position on the rfs has been a sore point between her and nextgen in early august ernst s campaign asked local tv stations to stop airing a nextgen ad that claimed ernst would eliminate support for iowa renewables on the grounds that it was false the letter from ernst s lawyer includes a copy of ernst s july 29 letter to the epa urging the agency to not cut corn ethanol and biodiesel levels in the rfs see page 17 ernst has reiterated that she is opposed to subsidies but will support the rfs her spokeswoman gretchen hamel told the globe gazette in mason city iowa in july in a perfect world in a free market she would support doing away with the rfs but that s not the case at the iowa state fair in early august ernst said lots of jobs in iowa depend on the rfs i will continue to stand for the rfs according to the des moines register she was pressed on her position on tax credits the paper reported and she said i f we could get rid of all tax credits that would be wonderful but what i m looking for is reform in the long term of our tax system which makes the environment fairer flatter and simpler for everyone obamacare job killer or creator in new mexico s 1st congressional district republican mike frese falsely implies the affordable care act has cost the state tens of thousands of jobs frese has called for the repeal of the affordable care act claiming thatthe lawis strangling job growth this ad which began airing oct 30 includes a video clip of his opponent rep michelle lujan grisham saying the affordable care act is a job creator as she speaks viewers are shown these words between april and october new mexico lost more than 20 000 jobs implying the affordable care act was to blame for the job losses it wasn t the job losses were not as large as initially reported by the news report cited in the ad and there is no evidence that the affordable care act has cost the state jobs in fact there is evidence the law is creating jobs in new mexico the ad cites a dec 9 2013 koat tv report which was based on bureau of labor statistics figures contained in a dec 2 2013 report issued by thenew mexico department of workforce solutions that report showed on page 14 that the state s seasonally adjusted employment figure for october 2013 was 860 292 20 382 less than the 880 674 figure in april 2013 but that story made no mention of the affordable care act it quoted suzan reagan a senior program manager at the bureau of business and economic research at the university of new mexico as saying government sequestration and the uncertainty of what s going on at the federal level were the reasons for the decline in employment the government sequestration refers to automatic federal budget cuts totaling 85 billion in fiscal year 2013 that took effect in march 2013 resulting in about 4 6 billion less in federal funding for states that year it was the first part of a scheduled 1 trillion cut in federal spending over 10 years new mexico is particularly vulnerable to federal budget cuts it is dangerously dependent on the federal government according to an october 2013 cover story on the state s economic woes in albuquerque business first the federal government cutting back on spending before and during sequestration and continuing has had a slowing effect on new mexico s economy reagan said in an email to us new mexico is home to three air force installations white sands missile range two national laboratories us forest lands and the bureau of indian affairs which means that the federal spending or lack of it has a big impact more important reagan told us that the large job losses reported by koat turned out to be grossly overstated at the time we felt that the data would see significant revisions and was overstating the weakness in the economy she said the series was benchmarked earlier this year smoothing out the large decline bls annually revises its employment data in a process known as benchmarking to account for survey errors after benchmarking the state s employment figures now show a job loss of less than 3 000 from april 2013 to october 2013 according to the bls data not only that but reagan says the affordable care act this year is adding some jobs in the state s insurance and health care sectors the law didn t take full effect until january from january to september new mexico saw an increase of 1 500 finance jobs which would include insurance and an increase of 3 700 jobs in the education and health care sector reagan said citing bls figures as we ve written before experts have projected that the affordable care act may cause a small loss of low wage jobs but a rise in better paid jobs in the health care and insurance sectors the state s most recent labor report included this example of the health care law s impact new mexico labor market review oct 24 sixteen health centers in new mexico will receive additional funding of more than 4 million to expand their primary care services expansion of services will include the hiring of 52 staff extension of operating hours and the offering of new health care services the funding is available due to the affordable care act with the purpose of reaching an estimated 16 943 new patients on top of the estimated 290 000 currently served by the centers one last thing frese s ad also takes a lujan grisham quote on her insurance premiums out of context it shows lujan grisham at a dec 12 2013 congressional hearing saying i pay more because of the affordable care act but that s not all she said the reason she said is because of a provision of the law that is specific to members of congress i pay more because of the affordable care act but that is because i am required to go to the d c exchange not because i am a consumer left to navigate through the affordable care act rules in my own state so it depends on the real details of those issues she said nunn wants to raise taxes an ad from georgia one pac says democratic senate candidate michelle nunn agrees with obama that we should consider raising taxes we all know what that really means a massive tax increase that claim is thinly based on a comment nunn made to a tv reporter when she announced her candidacy she said in vague terms that in order to reduce the deficit in a responsible way we need to put both spending and revenues on the table but throughout her campaign nunn has not proposed any net tax increase let alone a massive one she argues as many republicans do that a simpler and fairer tax code would fuel economic growth on her web page nunn advocates revenue neutral tax reform nunn talks about a tax reform vision that includes lowering the corporate tax rate but eliminating tax breaks for companies who close factories and ship jobs overseas and simplifying the income tax code by expanding the standard deduction while closing unnecessary loopholes there would be winners and losers in such a scenario of course but nunn claims that one of her guiding principles is that reform shouldn t raise taxes nunn campaign website although individual reforms will effect each family differently i will not support any proposal to overhaul the tax code that increases the overall tax burden on georgia families in fact as we have written in the past support for closing unnecessary loopholes in personal income taxes and eliminating tax breaks for companies who close factories and ship jobs overseas such as nunn has advocated wouldn t necessarily violate the americans for tax reform taxpayer protection pledge not to raise taxes nunn has not signed the pledge though her opponent david perdue has as we wrote back in 2010 the pledge leaves ample room for elimination of any number of special tax breaks so long as the overall level of taxation is not increased atr also addresses the issue on its web page on myths about the pledge atr website every single exclusion adjustment deduction and credit is on the table for tax reform under the pledge no tax break is exempt from elimination under the pledge the only requirement is that the additional tax revenue raised by eliminating or curtailing a tax break get plowed into lower marginal tax rates or other income tax relief that s what nunn is proposing the obama bloomberg agenda an ad from the nra institute for legislative action says north carolina sen kay hagan helped obama and bloomberg push their extreme anti gun agenda but hagan hardly hasbeen in lockstep with the gun control agenda promoted by president obama and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg out of state gun control groups are all in for kay hagan because she helped obama and bloomberg push their extreme anti gun agenda the ad s narrator says hagan voted for gun control so liberal billionaires throw millions at her campaign that s how it works it s true that hagan voted for the bipartisan manchin toomey amendment which would have expanded background checks to private sales by unlicensed individuals at gun shows and over the internet but on the same day she also voted against several other measures supported by obama and bloomberg a multibillionaire who founded bloomberg lp a financial news and information service for example she voted to allow cross state reciprocity for the carrying of certain concealed firearms a measure specifically opposed by bloomberg s group everytown for gun safety hagan also voted against a proposal to ban certain assault weapons a prominent part of obama s gun control plan and hagan voted against an amendment that sought to regulate large capacity ammunition feeding devices something that was part of both obama s and bloomberg s agendas it s a matter of opinion to describe the gun control measures proposed by obama and bloomberg as extreme but one proposal has broad public support even among nra households a pew research center survey released in april found that 74 percent of americans who live in a household with an nra member supported the proposal to expand background checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows as the amendment hagan supported would have done there was far less support among this group for a ban on assault style weapons 33 percent or on high capacity ammunition clips 35 percent two measures that hagan voted against nra part ii standing in front of a garage table display of his guns arkansas house candidate patrick henry hays boasts in an ad that he s a proud member of the nra a mailer from the state democratic party goes even further featuring quotes from nra s executive vice president wayne lapierre praising hays for his leadership hays a democrat is a dues paying member of the nra and hays did get a letter from lapierre in september praising hays for his efforts on behalf of gun owners and nominating hays to receive the nra s prestigious national patriot s medal but as politico points out the quotes from lapierre were part of a fundraising form letter sent out to most nra members the nra political victory fund has graded hays an f and has endorsed his republican opponent french hill according to the nra those graded an f are a true enemy of gun owners rights so where does hays stand on hiscampaign website hays says that he opposes an assault weapons ban but understands that we need background checks on commercial gun sales to help keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill the nra has aggressively targeted candidates who either voted for or expressed support for expanded background checks including for those sold at gun shows or over the internet politico noted that in response to thedemocratic party of arkansas mailer the nra political victory fund sent hays a letter demanding that he or any group supporting him cease using lapierre s image or any quotes from nra communications in campaign material tv reruns the final flurry of ads also included plenty of false or misleading claims that we already have debunked in the north carolina senate race a new ad from the senate majority pac says republican thom tillis cut education to the bone as state house speaker echoing an earlier claim we wrote about that tillis cut education spending by 500 million the fact is that state spending on public schools k 12 has gone up 660 million since tillis was elected house speaker from 7 15 billion in 2010 2011 to 7 81 billion for 2013 2014 it s true that state spending has not kept up with growing enrollment also state spending on benefits has cut into classroom spending yes classrooms have felt the squeeze but he hasn t cut education spending a new ad titled stopwatch from the conservative american future fund reprises the claim that freshman sen jeff merkley of oregon has sponsored only one bill that was signed into law but as we found all 10 senators who came into office in january 2009 have a similar record two senators sponsored two bills each that became law four senators including merkley had one become law and four senators had none it s just how things work in senate where committee chairs and ranking committee members stand the best chance of getting their bills passed into law in florida s 2nd congressional district the house majority pac has a new ad titled dishonest that says rep steve southerland voted to end medicare s guaranteed benefits that is a popular refrain in democratic ads it is a reference to southerland s vote on april 15 2011 for a nonbinding budget resolution authored by gop rep paul ryan ryan s budget called for changes to medicare but his medicare proposal has changed substantially in subsequent budgets it now proposes phasing in a government subsidy program in which future beneficiaries pick from traditional medicare or private plans which must offer the same benefits as traditional medicare likewise the republicans just can t let go of the misleading claim that the affordable care act cuts medicare by 716 billion the national republican senatorial committee trots out the figure in a new ad appropriately titled wrong that attacks democratic rep bruce braley the senate candidate in iowa the fact is that the affordable care act slows the future growth of medicare spending as opposed to cutting current spending to prolong the life of the program the vast majority of the cuts come from future payments to hospitals and insurance carriers the aca says benefits provided in the traditional medicare program can t be cut robert farley eugene kiely and lori robertson q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
