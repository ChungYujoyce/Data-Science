washington president donald trump said thursday he hasseen evidence suggesting thenovel coronavirus originated in a virology lab in wuhan china trump did not provide any evidence to support that assertion and he seemed to hedge a bit by saying there were many theories about the origin of the virus he has repeatedly called for an investigation into the origin of the virus part of what critics say is an effort to shift blame to china amid growing criticism of trump s missteps in response to the crisis the president s comment on thursday came just hours after his director of national intelligence richard grenell issued a statement on behalf of the u s intelligence community stating there was broad agreement the virus was not man made or genetically modified but that statement left open the question of whether the virus was accidentally released by alaboratory in china where the virus first emerged before spreading across the globe or whether it came from animals and then jumped to humans as the chinese government has stated the intelligence community will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in wuhan the office of the director of national intelligence led by richard grenell said in a statement secretary of state mike pompeo has suggested without citing evidence that the virus may have escaped fromthe wuhan institute of virology a theory that many scientists have disputed trump seemed to lend credence to that theory on thursday even thoughthe national intelligence director s statementsaid that question wasunresolved asked if he had seen anything at this point that gives you a high degree of confidence that the wuhan institute of virology was the origin of this virus trump responded yes i have yes i have the president said he could not divulge what gave him that high degree of confidence and he seemed to hedge on his assertion later saying there s a lot of theories about the origin of the virus we re going to see where it is we re going to see where it comes from trump said a near impossibility experts doubt north korea s claim of zero coronavirus cases the new york times reported thursday morning that trump administration officials were pushing us intelligence agencies to search for evidence supporting the theory it escaped the lab in wuhan pompeo has been one of the administration s most public china critics amid the pandemic and he has repeatedly raised questions about the security at chinese labs that study potentially dangerous viruses we don t know precisely where this virus originated from pompeo said wednesday during a state department press briefing he complained that the chinese government had not allowed u s scientists to access the wuhan virology lab a high security biomedical facility pompeosaid it s unclear if the lab has adequate safety precautions in a march 17 paper published by nature medicine five scientists from the u s the united kingdom and australia said the scientificevidence shows the virus was not purposefully manipulated and that it most likely came from an animal we do not believe that any type of laboratory based scenario is plausible they wrote although they also said it is currently impossible to prove or disprove other theories critics say the white house is trying to deflect attention from trump s own missteps in responding to the pandemic and point the finger at at china as he faces a tough reelection campaign this is all about manipulating intelligence for political ends ned price a former cia analyst who worked in the obama administration wrote in a tweet thursday whether the virus originated in a market or accidentally escaped a lab would have had no bearing on the warnings trump received and ignored nor on the preparatory steps he chose not to take who chief public health superstar or pro china propagandist who chief lands in us political crosshairs theories about a possible leak at the wuhan institute of virology have circulated since january largely among right wing bloggers some conservative media pundits and pro trump china hawks the theory that it came from the wuhan lab is based on circumstantial evidence such as thewuhan institute of virology s historyof studying coronaviruses in bats the lab s proximity to where some of the infections were first diagnosed and china s lax safety record in its labs the world health organizationhas concluded that the virus was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory and said it probably came from an animal as chinese officials have asserted it is probable likely that the virus is of animal origin who spokeswoman fadela chaib saidapril 22 contributing kim hjelmgaard david jackson
