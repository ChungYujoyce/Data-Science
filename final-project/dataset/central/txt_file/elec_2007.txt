 by d angelo gore lori robertson eugene kiely and robert farley posted on may 23 2019 democratic presidential candidate beto o rourke twisted the facts on several topics including immigration and gun control during a cnn town hall the town hall aired on may 21 o rourke a former u s representative from texas spoke to a crowd atdrake university in iowa in discussing the current situation at the southwest border o rourke twice said that trump either wants or is proposing to build a 2 000 mile wall o rourke and then let s focus more of our attention on our own hemisphere those people to whom we are connected by land by culture and increasingly by families if we invest in solutions in guatemala el salvador and honduras then fewer people have to flee those countries and come to our border at the united states mexico border where we re proposing to build a 2 000 mile wall right now he later repeated his claim about a 2 000 mile wall o rourke but dana that can t be the solution in and of itself we need to invest in solutions in the northern triangle this president wants to cut 500 million that s all that we give to those three countries and if you put it into perspective he wants to spend 30 billion on a 2 000 mile wall he wants to cut that i would double it we don t know what the president wants but he has not proposed a 2 000 mile wall and in fact he has said that there is no need to erect barriers the entire length of the border because of natural barriers such as rivers and mountains it is true that during the 2016 campaign trumppromisedhe would build a great great wall on our southern border he provided no specific construction plan during the campaign hisimmigration plansimply said there must be a wall across the southern border and of course mexico must pay for the wall once elected trump signed anexecutive orderthat directed the secretary of the department of homeland security to take all appropriate steps to immediately plan design and construct a physical wall along the southern border using appropriate materials and technology to most effectively achieve complete operational control of the southern border theu s customs and border protection an agency within dhs developed a 10 year 18 billion plan which it submitted on jan 5 2018 to the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs the plan identified approximately 18 billion in funding needs over a 10 year period for 722 miles of border wall system including 316 miles of new primary wall and 407 miles of replacement and secondary wall according to acommittee report in ajuly 2018 report the government accountability officesaid it reviewed the cbp s impedance and denial prioritization strategy which the gao said included an overall estimate of the cost to construct barriers at border patrol s top 17 priority locations an estimate of 18 billion for 722 miles of barriers the gao report also said from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2015 cbp increased the total miles of primary barriers on the southwest border from 119 miles to 654 miles including 354 miles of primary pedestrian barriers and 300 miles of primary vehicle barriers if the administration does add 316 miles of new primary barriers to the existing 654 miles of primary barriers then there would be about 970 miles of primary barriers roughly half the 2 000 mile southern border during the partial government shutdown which was spurred by the president s demand for border security funding trumpaddressedthe nation on jan 19 in his remarks trump said he was asking congress for 5 7 billion in fiscal year 2019 toward construction of what he called a strategic deployment of physical barriers or a wall the president said that there was no need to build a 2 000 mile concrete structure from sea to sea he said much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water a year earlier the presidenttoldthewall street journalsomething similar trump jan 11 2018 the other thing so the wall the wall s never meant to be 2 100 miles long we have mountains that are far better than a wall we have violent rivers that nobody goes near we have areas but you don t need a wall where you have a natural barrier that s far greater than any wall you could build ok because somebody said oh he s going to make the wall smaller i m not going to make it smaller the wall was always going to be a wall where we needed it carlos diaz a cbp spokesman provided us with a border wall status fact sheet dated may 23 that said sincejanuary 2017 approximately 205 miles of new and updated border barriers have been funded through the traditional appropriations process and via treasury forfeiture funding of which approximately 42 miles have been completed to date cbp has identified 6 1 billion over the last three fiscal years to fund 336 miles of new and replacement barriers according to the agency s fact sheet we don t know what trump plans to do at the border after fiscal year 2019 and cbp declined to say all that we can discuss at this point is what we ve been funded by congress diaz said but what we do know is that trump has not proposed to build a 2 000 mile wall as o rourke said o rourke claimed that president donald trump had described asylum seekers as animals or an infestation but the president has used those words to describe ms 13 gang members trump has used the word invasion to describe members of thecaravanandall immigrantswho cross the border illegally o rourke this president this administration his policies here at home and abroad have been an absolute disaster describing those immigrants who come to this country as rapists and criminals though they commit crimes at a far lower rate than those who are born in this country describing asylum seekers as animals or an infestation an infestation is how you might describe a termite or a cockroach something that you want to stamp out something less than human you don t get kids in cages at the border until you have dehumanized them in the eyes of your fellow americans trump has a history of using the word animals in reference to ms 13 members at a july 25 2017 rally in ohio trumpsaid ms 13 gang members were animals who slice and dice young girls because they want their victims to go through excruciating pain three days later in new york trumpagain said of the gang members these are animals in may 2018 there was some controversy when the president said at a white house roundtable discussion with california political and law enforcement leaders we have people coming into the country or trying to come in and we re stopping a lot of them but we re taking people out of the country you wouldn t believe how bad these people are these aren t people these are animals somenewscoverage said trump referred to some immigrants as animals while other reports said he was talking about immigrant gang members which had been mentioned by the fresno county sheriff before trump made his comments then house minority leader nancy pelosicriticized trump for saying undocumented immigrants were animals but trump and white house press secretary sarah sanders then clarified his remarks trump said but i m referring and you know i m referring to the ms 13 gangs that are coming in we wrote of the controversy then that we couldn t say whattrump meant when he made his remarks but the president had a history of using the term animals for gang members plus at this point trump has clarified the remark similarly trump s use of the words infest and infestation has been in comments mentioning ms 13 he said in a june 19 2018 tweet that democrats want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our country like ms 13 a few weeks later he tweeted when we have an infestation of ms 13 gangs in certain parts of our country who do we send to get them out ice as we have written before the ms 13 gang formed in los angeles in the 1980s the justice department said there were more than 10 000 members in 2017 but the fbi has been using that 10 000 estimate since at least 2006 o rourke said trump attempted to ban all muslims from entering the united states as a presidential candidate trump proposed such a ban as president he didn t go that far o rourke to try to ban all muslims all people of one religion from the shores of a country that is comprised of people from the world over every tradition of faith every walk of life trump did call for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states during the 2016 presidential campaign that was shortly after a muslim couplekilled 14 peoplein san bernardino california the husband syed farook was born in america but his wife tashfeen malik came to the u s from pakistan in july 2014 on a k 1 fiancee visa trump issued a statement on preventing muslim immigration which hereadat a dec 7 2015 rally trump called for a complete shutdown until our country s representatives can figure out what the hell is going on we have no choice however trump s executive actions as president did not go that far on june 26 2018 the supreme courtruled 5 4that the president had lawfully exercised the broad discretion granted to him under the immigration and nationality act to restrict entry to some foreign nationals in order to protect the interests of the united states that ruling concerned apresidential proclamationthat trump signed in september 2017 the third version of the administration s travel restrictions which denied u s travel visas to certain nationals of iran libya somalia syria yemen north korea and venezuela the first five countries aremajority muslim nations but that s not a ban on all muslims in fact in january 2017 the pew research centerestimatedthat trump s original executive order which also included travel restrictions for iraqi and sudanese nationals would affect only about 12 percent of the world s muslim population o rourke said he was told by an expert that african americans make up 40 percent of the incarcerated population in iowa we didn t find support for a figure that high o rourke i was talking to somebody in iowa tavis hall who is an expert on this he said african americans comprise 3 percent of iowa s population 40 percent of the incarcerated population in this state african americans are just 3 8 percent of iowa s population according tou s census bureau estimates as of july 2018 it s also true that african americans are overrepresented in iowa s prisons and jails although they don t make up two fifths of the state s incarcerated population according to the estimates we reviewed in 2014 the nonprofitprison policy initiative which produces research on mass incarceration reported based on data from the 2010 census thatafrican americans made up 3 percent of iowa s total population and 23 percent of its prison and jail population a senior policy analyst for ppi told us the organization plans to update those figures in 2021 after the 2020 census data becomes available in addition thevera institute of justice a nonprofit that works to improve justice systems estimates that in 2015 african americans made up 25 2 percent of iowa s state prison population and 23 percent of the population in jails statewide the vera institute says its incarceration trends data tool is assembled using information collected by the u s department of justice bureau of justice statistics bjs supplemented with data from state departments of correction when federal data is not available its prison population estimate is very close to amore recent figure from a reportfrom the iowa department of human rights which said the total prison population in iowa was approximately 24 5 african american as of fiscal year 2018 we calledtavis hall executive director ofexperience waterloo which promotes tourism in that iowa city he said he did speak with o rourke about african american incarceration hall initially told us he didn t recall the source of the statistic he mentioned to o rourke but later he emailed us a link to the2017 annual reportfrom the black hawk county sheriff s office in iowa that report said that nearly 40 percent 2 003 of 5 720 of male inmates in black hawk county jail that year were black i likely conflated that number with the overall incarceration rate within the state hall explained o rourke repeated a variation of a claim we have fact checked before saying that states that have adopted universal background checks for gun purchases have seen a reduction in gun violence of up to 50 percent recent academic research does not support that o rourke we know that in this country those states that have adopted universal background checks and close every loophole the charleston loophole the boyfriend loophole the gun show loophole and make sure that everyone who purchases a firearm goes through a background check those states have seen a reduction in gun violence of up to 50 percent o rourke is a proponent of universal background checks which would cover private sales by unlicensed individuals including some sales at gun shows and over the internet but he has repeatedly cited this misleading success rate despite recent academic research that suggests it is wildly inflated when o rourke claimed in a may 7 campaign event that state laws mandating universal checks have been shown to reduce gun violence by 50 percent his campaign pointed to research released by everytown for gun safety in 2015 that found nearly 50 percent fewer police murdered with guns women shot to death by intimate partners in states with background checks this time o rourke added an up to qualifier that states have seen a reduction in gun violence of up to 50 percent but the claim is still misleading boston university community health sciences professor michael siegel told us states that have lower firearm violence rates to begin with are the ones that tend to pass laws requiring universal background checks a study he led looked at the change in gun violence rates after states passed or got rid of universal background checks and foundlower rates of violence associated with states with universal checks but not nearly 50 percent lower that study published in march in the journal of general internal medicine looked at homicide and suicide rates in all 50 states over a 26 year period and found that universal background checks are associated with about a 15 percent reduction in firearm homicide the study stopped short of concluding that the decline was caused by those laws after reviewing the overall literature i would estimate that the association is somewhere between a 10 and 15 reduction siegel told us via email so the 50 claim sounds exaggerated i m not sure what data would support that siegel noted that his research found an association between universal background checks and reduced homicide rates but did not definitively conclude causality a spokesman for everytown for gun safety told us it has updated the data cited by o rourke about universal background checks as a result of new research the rigorous research that s come out since that release has improved our understanding of this and we replaced the statistics from that 2015 release in more recent materials including the background checks page adam sege a spokesman for everytown for gun safety told us the current background checks pagecites a study in 2015 that concluded connecticut s implementation of a handgun permit to purchase law was associated with a 40 reduction in connecticut s firearm homicide rates during the first 10 years that the law was in place but that s a little different from a universal background check law the law required background checks for handgun permits it s just one state and again the researchers found association not causality in 2018 the rand corporation released several reports as part of itsgun policy in america initiative including one on the effects of background checks on violent crime the review identified eight studies since 2003 that examined the relationship between background checks and violent crime and that met its research criteria the report concluded evidence that background checks may reduce violent crime and total homicides is limited and studies provide moderate evidence that dealer background checks reduce firearm homicides evidence of the effect of private seller background checks on firearm homicides is inconclusive q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
