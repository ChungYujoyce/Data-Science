washington anthony fauci the health care policy expert under fire from allies of president donald trump said monday he used a poor choice of words when he suggested lives could have been saved had the trump administration put in placecoronavirus restrictions earlier in the year hypothetical questions sometimes canget you into some difficulty fauci said during aunique statement delivered amid reports that trump was thinking of firing him in an interview sunday on cnn s state of the union fauci was asked if lives could have been saved had social distancing been imposed during the third week of february instead of mid march fauci said it s very difficult to go back and say that i mean obviously you could logically saythat if you had a process that was ongoingand you started mitigation earlier you could have saved lives obviously no one is going to deny that fauci said what goes into those kinds of decisions is is complicated but you re right i mean obviously if we had right from the very beginning shut everything down it may have been a little bit different but there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then trump who on sunday re tweeted a supporters statement that fauci should be fired called the epidemic expert to the podium early in the briefing an unusual move fauci the long time director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases denied that trump forced him to make the statement he told reporters everything i do is voluntary please don t even imply that fauci s latest comments came right before trump again saidhe would not fire his nationally recognized health care policy adviser trump followed up fauci s statement with a lengthy one of his own defending his actions as the virus spread across the country the speech included a white house produced campaign style video that showed governors and other officials praising trump for restrictions that slowed the economy in order to contain the coronavirus in a story on april 11 the new york times suggested that trump missed several opportunities to get contain the coronavirus in the united states the story said that during january february and early march senior advisers identified the threat sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action on coronavirus but the president did not heed the advice until mid march when he issued the administration s social distancing guidelines trump has lashed out at the story calling it fake everything we did was right trump said at one point monday protesting what he claimed were inaccurate news reports on the response trump also made inaccurate claims saying during the briefing that nobody had asked for ventilators even though numerous governors have repeatedly made such requests in recent weeks later when challenged on his assertion that he did everything right trump appeared to blame states for ventilator shortages well look governors should have had ventilators critics called the performance little more than an exercise in propaganda how does fauci feel right now tweeted political analyst stuart rothenberg manipulated used at another point in the briefing trump claimed he has more power than governors when it comes to restricting the economy and opening it back up a view at odds with most legal analysts who saythat authority rests with governors when somebody is the presidentofthe united states theauthority is total and that s the way it s got to be trump said more who decides when and how america reopens from its coronavirus shutdown on sunday trump hadgenerated new questions about the fate of his anti coronavirus policyteam by retweeting a post that called for firing fauci trump did not explicitly endorse the call to remove fauci in his tweet sunday but in recirculating it he defended himself against claims he did not act quickly enough to curb the spread of the virus that has killed almost 23 000 americans and led to a near shutdown of the american economy deanna lorraine a pro trump congressional candidate who polled less than 2 in anopen primary challenge to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif claimed in a tweet fauci is now saying that had

the microphone and push him down fauci addresses trump coronavirus claims toll fauci predicts up to 200 000 u s deaths as trump weighs adjusting coronavirus guidelines in retweeting the criticism of those comments trump did not citefauci at all he focused on his decision to shut down flights in early february fromchina where the coronavirus originated sorry fake news it s all on tape i banned china long before people spoke up the president wrote gidley said trump s retweet clearly exposed media attempts to maliciously push a falsehood about his china decision in an attempt to rewrite history it was democrats and the media who ignored coronavirus choosing to focus on impeachment instead trump and fauci the longtimedirector of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases have disputed each other s statements during the course of the epidemic their disagreements included the amount of time needed to developa coronavirus vaccine and the usefulness of hydroxychloroquine an anti malaria drug that trump championed as a treatment of coronavirus but that fauci questioned during a white house briefing trump prevented fauci from answering a reporter s question on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine he s answered that question 15 times trump said critics of the president said fauci has been indispensableand expressed concern for his future with the administration harvard law professor laurence tribe likened fauci to former special counsel robert mueller who investigated russian interference in elections are you old enough to remember when even gop senators said that firing mueller would end trump s presidency tribe tweeted well firing fauci would be way deadlier only this time we can t even threaten mass street protests
