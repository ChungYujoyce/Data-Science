it was a big night for republicans and a bad one for democrats as georgia s former secretary of state karen handel held off 30 year old democrat jon ossoff by a wider margin than expected in a special election runoff in the state s 6th district democrats poured money into a race that became the most expensive house contest ever but to no avail the result left president trumpdonald john

defeated democrat archie parnell making the gop two for two on the night here are five takeaways from the night deep disappointment for democrats the big prize was in georgia and ossoff s 4 point loss was a bitter pill for democrats to swallow even as they sought comfort in talk of moral victories in the aftermath many democrats had believed that ossoff was on his way to an upset win channeling liberal distaste with trump nationwide to rake in fundraising dollars while making a centrist pitch to voters in the suburban atlanta district the dollars came rolling in but the votes did not handel s win was comparatively comfortable given polls showing a neck and neck race anecdotal accounts of intense democratic enthusiasm and ossoff s success in raising more than 23 million an astronomical sum for a house race questions are already being asked about ossoff s strategy but the bottom line is that democratson tuesdaylost their fourth competitive special election of the trump presidency it remains to be seen whether the defeats sap the spirits of financial donors and grassroots volunteers but they are dispiriting for the party it must come to terms with the fact that the anti trump sentiments its supporters feel so keenly are not a guarantee of electoral success a win for ossoffon tuesdaywould have bolstered democrats confidence that they could retake the house majority in november 2018 instead there are graver doubts than before and a realization that the party faces a steep climb while then rep tom price r won reelection in the district by 23 points last november

republican nerves are soothed for now handel s victory will calm gop angst over trump at least for the moment make no mistake there is massive concern within republican ranks about trump s unpopularity and its potential electoral consequences but handel s win suggests that the gop may not face a midterm apocalypse after all the georgia result will also make it easier for party officials to persuade vulnerable incumbents to run for reelection it will boost fundraising efforts too even more importantly at least from the white house s perspective it might reassure republicans that they should toe the president s line as tough votes loom on the plan to replace the affordable care act as well as other subjects such as tax reform for the white house a win in a trump referendum the dynamics of the georgia race were complicated where trump was concerned handel took care not to tie herself too closely to the president but he tweeted his support for her on the morning of election day anti trump ire among democrats helped fill ossoff s coffers but he largely avoided the kind of vivid campaign rhetoric favored by left wing icons such as sens bernie sandersbernie sandershillicon

liberals began before the final results were in from georgia the debate was conducted in raw terms the central issue was whether ossoff had run too timorous and centrist a campaign to fire up the base
