 mara liasson in presidential elections democrats have been on the winning end of the gender gap but that hasn t been true in midterms renee montagne speaks with npr s mara liasson about women in this election renee montagne byline in this year s midterm elections the women s vote could be decisive in presidential elections democrats have been on the winning end of the gender gap more women turn out than men and they vote more democratic but that hasn t been true in midterms here to talk about the women s vote is npr s national political correspondent mara liasson good morning mara liasson byline good morning montagne so are there signs that democrats are holding onto their traditional advantage among women liasson in many races democrats are still leading with women but their edge is much much smaller than it was during the 2012 elections and the polls look like a lot like 2010 when the gender gap essentially disappeared and the women s vote split 49 to 49 percent and don t forget that in 2012 mitt romney actually won the married women s vote by about seven points barack obama won the single women s vote the unmarried women s vote by 29 points and that s how he won the overall women s vote and the problem for democrats is that single women tend to drop off in midterm elections their participation rate drops by about 20 points montagne ok but what about their efforts to target single women is it working insofar as there would be voting democratic liasson when single women turn out to vote they do vote democratic and democrats have been trying very very hard to increase the participation of single women this year they ve basically dusted off their playbook from 2012 and 2010 they re running what we call a war on women campaign accusing republicans of waging a war on women they ve been attacking republican candidates for supporting personhood amendments which would give constitutional rights to embryos in some states though like colorado democrats have been criticized for running a campaign that s not about much more than women s reproductive rights the denver post criticized a democratic senate candidate there mark udall for running a quote obnoxious one issue campaign one of their report called udall mark uterus so democrats are struggling a bit with this something that s worked for them in the past montagne well what about republicans because in the last midterm election and the last presidential election there were republican candidates who alienated women some pretty famous stories comments about rape and pregnancy liasson well that s one of the biggest changes this year you see republicans acting a lot differently it s not just that republicans are not making mistakes like the ones you mentioned they are affirmatively going after the women s vote this year by changing their positions for instance in colorado cory gardner the republican has disavowed his support for a personhood amendment he s also coming out in favor of over the counter birth control and on that issue he now agrees with planned parenthood so republicans aren t fighting the last war and in some cases they are really cutting into democrats support among women and that s a real problem for democrats they need a big gender gap to win montagne well let s talk about the guys because obviously a big part of the gender gap is the other gender what s happening with the male vote liasson the male vote continues to be a big advantage for republicans the latest washington post poll show that nationally republicans have a double digit advantage with men democrats only have a single digit advantage with women that s a real problem montagne mara thanks very much liasson thank you montagne npr s national political correspondent mara liasson copyright 2014 npr all rights reserved visit our website terms of use and permissions pages at www npr org for further information npr transcripts are created on a rush deadline by verb8tm inc an npr contractor and produced using a proprietary transcription process developed with npr this text may not be in its final form and may be updated or revised in the future accuracy and availability may vary the authoritative record of npr s programming is the audio record npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
