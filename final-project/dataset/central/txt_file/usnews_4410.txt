when the coronavirus pandemic slows and allows us to catch a breath both literally and figuratively there will be an international reckoning that likely will end with china bearing the brunt of the blame in order to force china to implement adequate safety standards we should stop importing essential items especially food medicineand medical equipment until the country proves that it can be a responsible member of the global community we had plenty of advance warning that china was capable of infecting or poisoning the world in 2002 the first terrifying coronavirus pandemic caused by the sars severe acute respiratory syndrome virus erupted in guangdong province it circled the globe killing 774 people in 2007 the united statesissuedrecalls covering dozens of toys made in china some of which were coated in lead paint other toys posed choking hazards one toy a floating eyeball was filled with kerosene and in 2013 achild in spokane washington was injuredwhen that chemical leaked out of a similar toy into his own eye also in 2007 chinese pet food across america was recalled for containing melamine a nitrogenous compound that serves as an adulterant to make food appear as though it contains more protein than it actually does melamine causes kidney failure andadulterated pet foodkilled at least 13cats and a dog in the united states in 2008 the food and drug administration said the crucial lifesaving drug heparin which is used to prevent blood clots and treat patients suffering from a heart attack contained a contaminant that could trigger fatal allergic reactions the contaminated drug was linked toover 100 deathssince early 2007 also according to the u s department of justice china is the primarysource of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl like substances commonly abused opiates in america fentanyl is a synthetic analgesic that is 30 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times stronger than morphine covid 19 what happened when a michigan reporter covering coronavirus became a victim that brings us to today similar to the sars outbreak china has exported another novel coronavirus sars cov 2 which causes the illness called covid 19 this time chinaalso exportedcoronavirus testing kits that don t work moreover given thatmuchof the world s supply of masks and respirators along with other materials essential for health care comes from manufacturers in china or did before thepandemic one has to wonder whether those products meet required performance standards this situation revealsa weak link in the global supply chain that supports everyday health carein hospitals around the world as dr henry millerexplains drugs are the sector of greatest vulnerability because china is the world s largest producer and exporter of the active pharmaceutical ingredients apis used to manufacture drugs areportfrom the u s china economic security review commission concludesthat apis are produced there without sufficient quality control it s not as if we can avoid these faulty drugs when american consumers go to the pharmacy or supermarket they are allowed no choice in the matter because drug companies are not required to list the country of origin for apis on labels thus the report says u s consumers may be unknowingly accepting risks associated with drugs originating from china but surelydrugs produced in china must be well regulated actually no the report also notesthat china s regulatory apparatus is inadequately resourced to oversee thousands of chinese drug manufacturers worse the report says the china fda rejected 80 of drug clinical trial programs in 2016 due to fraud or incomplete data by comparison dr miller writes thatthe percentage would likely be in the single digits in the united statesand europe job loss anxiety isolation coronavirus is a prescription for more opioid use unfortunately the u s fda doesn t help much the commission s report observesthat the agency deploys far too few inspectors to china to provide proper oversight as a result the report s bottom line is that americans are at risk of exposure to contaminated and dangerous medicines paradoxically an outright ban won t work either because that would create a drug shortage the policy implications are clear although it would be economically unfeasible and undesirable to ban all chinese food and drug imports we should begin the process of moving supply chains out of china and into countries perhaps our own that have and enforce appropriate safety and quality standards the covid 19 pandemic has provedthat some goods like medicine and medical devices are too strategically important to outsource to untrustworthy actors in the short term getting u s regulators to do their job at ensuring the integrity of imported drugs would be an essential start alex berezow is a ph d microbiologist vice president at the american council on science and health an analyst with geopolitical futuresand a member of the usa today board of contributors follow him on twitter alexberezow
