after memorial day to consider options we must think big for the people now pelosi said tuesday from the speaker s office at the capitol not acting is the most expensive course she said lines drawn the latest pandemic response from congress will test the house and senate and president donald trump as washington navigates the extraordinary crisis with the nation s health and economic security at stake the democrats heroes act is built around nearly 1 trillion for states cities and tribal governments to avert layoffs focused chiefly on 375 billion for smaller suburban and rural municipalities

in hazard pay for essential workers on the front lines of the crisis pelosi drew on u s history and poetry to suggest no man is an island as she called on americans to respond to the crisis with a strategy of science virus testing and empathy there are those who said let s just pause she said hunger doesn t take a pause rent doesn t take a pause bills don t take a pause but the 1 800 page package is heading straight into a senate roadblock republicans are wary of another round of aid and mcconnell declared the democratic proposal a grab bag of pet priorities he said tuesday it is not something that deals with reality house republicans also took a pass i can t believe that that would be real said rep andy biggs r ariz leader of the hard right house freedom caucus said in an interview this would be the fifth coronavirus package it s a starkly partisan offering with no real input from republicans who prefer to assess the impact of earlier expenditures before approving more but the political peril of doing nothing during an election year could prove challenging for congress and the white house as states experience flareups of virus outbreaks and more than 30 million americans remain unemployed in the shutdown the near term health and economic outlook remains daunting the senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york warned that trump and republicans risk the same path as herbert hoover the former president roundly criticized for failing to act to stem the great depression what is it going to take for mitch mcconnell to wake up and see the american people need help and they need it now schumer said the latest package extends some provisions from previous aid packages and adds new ones there is 25 billion for the u s postal service there is help for the 2020 census including the bureau s request to delay deadlines for turning over apportionment and redistricting data for the november election the bill provides 3 6 billion to help local officials prepare for the challenges of voting during the pandemic the popular payroll protection program which has been boosted in past bills would see another 10 billion to ensure under served businesses and nonprofit organizations have access to grants through a disaster loan program for hospitals and other health care providers there s another 100 billion infusion to help cover costs and additional help for hospitals serving low income communities there s another 600 million in funding to tackle the issue of rapid spread of the virus in state and federal prisons along with 600 million in help to local police departments for salaries and equipment mcconnell said he is working with the white house on next steps his priority is to ensure any new package includes liability protections for health care providers and businesses that are reopening trump is expected to meet tuesday with a group of senate republicans i don t think we have yet felt the urgency of acting immediately mcconnell told reporters earlier this week at the capitol as states weigh the health risks of re opening mcconnell said tuesday the nation needs to find a middle ground between total lockdown and total normalcy top
