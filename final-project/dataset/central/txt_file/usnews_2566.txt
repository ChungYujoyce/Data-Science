loved john mccain the former vice president began summarizing his complicated cross party relationship with his political opponent i always thought of john as a brother we had a hell of a lot of family fights he joked while the two were political opponents over the years and most memorably in the 2008 presidential election their relationship at its core was based in friendship and mutual respect biden reflected on their decades of friendship beginning in the 1970s when mccain served as a liaison between the navy and the senate and joined biden on numerous overseas trips in their travels they would talk about everything biden recalled and developed a friendship that transcended whatever political differences we had when mccan became his senate colleague starting in the 1980s their friendship continued despite working on opposite sides of the aisle it was always about basic values with john biden said fairness honesty dignity respect giving hate no safe harbor leaving no one behind and understanding that as americans we are a part of something much bigger than ourselves mccain s story biden said is the american story that s not hyperbole he continued it s the american story grounded in respect and decency basic fairness the intolerance for the abuse of power character is destiny biden said john had character john mccain s impact on america is not over biden said

over the last week that have honored his emphasis on value and integrity in politics it came from a profoundly personal place too biden knows loss and knows it well mccain and biden first met not long after the former vice president lost his wife and daughter in a tragic traffic accident in 1972 the same cancer that took mccain s life took that of their colleague ted kennedy s nine years ago and in 2015 biden s son beau lost his life due to the same disease there are times when life can be so cruel pain so blinding it s hard to see anything else biden said it s brutal it s relentless it s unforgiving speaking to mccain s family directly biden imparted his wisdom on loss and life after loss six months after mccain s death he says the pain will still rear its head but you know you re going to make it when the image of your dad your husband you friend crosses your mind and a smile comes to your lip before a tear to your eye biden said i promise you he continued i give you my word i promise you this i know that day will come to paraphrase shakespeare biden concluded we shall not see his like again in his tribute fitzgerald highlighted the many differences between he and mccain to make a point about the senator s approach to his life and how he represented his constituents i m black he was white i m young he wasn t so young fitzgerald joked he ran for president i ran out of bounds i have flowing locks and well he didn t how does this unlikely pair become friends that s just who he is fitzgerald and mccain met by chance in 2006 and fitzgerald detailed their years of friendship mccain visited cardinals practices and joked about fitzgerald s performance with him he gave fitzgerald a private tour of the senate in 2013 fitzgerald traveled to vietnam where he visited the lake where mccain s plane was shot down and the prison cell he was kept in while from very different worlds fitzgerald reflected we developed a meaningful friendship and this highlights the very rare and very special qualities of senator mccain former arizona attorney general grant woods a longtime friend of mccain s and chief of staff to him when he was a u s representative honored the late senator with a eulogy that poked fun at his driving skills while also offering a hopeful look at what his legacy could be in this tumultuous time in american politics i hope what he stood for will maybe get a renewed look in our country woods said that s what he would want john mccain believed in our constitution and he stood up for it he fought for it every step of the way woods said he would not stand by as people tried to trample the constitution or the bill of rights including the first amendment and you know what woods continued he believed in the declaration of independence when we proclaimed to the world that every single human being is important every single human being is precious every single person in this world has the right to live free woods who had criticized president donald trump could have been pointing to mccain s resistance to the president in recent months the president was not invited to mccain s services in d c and as mccain s casket arrived at the church in phoenix trump was tweeting about his grievances with cnn but woods s eulogy drew laughs from mccain s family friends and arizonans too he recalled his first two hours as chief of staff for mccain when he was a u s representative describing mccain s poor driving and goofy demeanor it was once a little bit harrowing a little bit wild a little bit crazy woods joked but a lot of fun and the greatest
