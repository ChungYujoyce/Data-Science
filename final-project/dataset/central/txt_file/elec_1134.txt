corrections and clarifications this story has been updated to reflect that biden was referring to the current king of jordan abdullah ii new york his son beau s death after a brutal battle with cancer convinced joe biden not to run for the white house in 2016 a race he now believes he likely would have won before all that though there was a happier reason the then vice president considered staying out of the race to clear the way for what seemed to be beau s limitless possibilities in politics perhaps even the presidency itself for what might have been the threads of fighting cancer weighing ambition and managing foreign policy crises are woven together in biden s new book promise me dad a year of hope hardship and purpose published this week by flatiron books the account of a tumultuous time is crisp and spare but the entries quoted from biden s episodic diary betray his mounting anguish it happened biden wrote at the end 7 51 pm on may 30 2015 my god my boy my beautiful boy a son who had escaped death decades earlier surviving a car crash that killed his mother and sister had been lost at age 46 now feelings of abject grief sweep over him less often biden told usa today as he launched his book s publicity tour replaced by a sense that i can make it through this and we can make beau proud at 74 he stands tall and straight natty in a navy jacket with the easy smile and affable manner that prompted fans on social media to nickname him uncle joe but his eyes swell with tears as he recounts his son s final days and he pauses a beat to regain his composure we kept thinking the science would outrun the cancer he says and we didn t make it in the book biden reveals that he thought hard after he and president obama were re elected in 2012 about whether that election should be his last whether it was time to shift the family s focus to beau s political future the younger biden had been elected to a second term as delaware attorney general two years earlier he would declare his intention to run for governor in 2016 a race political analysts predicted would be his to lose i looked down the road and there would be a time in which if i would continue to run after the vice presidency it would crowd beau out biden said in the interview leaning forward in his chair recalling his private debate i really started to think that i ve had all this time i love what i do but is it just too small a pond for two potentially national figures with the same name it was barack obama who dubbed beau joe biden 2 0 he had all the best of me but with the bugs and flaws engineered out biden wrote in some ways beau resembled obama more than he did his dad he was savvier about new technologies and more disciplined as a speaker beau didn t make many mistakes biden says laughing at the contrast to his own reputation as in his words a gaffe machine beau refused to talk about his long term aspirations biden says but those around him did as the commander of allied forces in iraq gen roy odierno had gotten to know beau during his tour of duty there with the delaware national guard in a eulogy at his funeral odierno by then the army chief of staff said he had fully expected to one day be saluting beau as commander in chief his father had had the same thought i did he says i did after he had been diagnosed in 2013 with glioblastoma the most aggressive form of brain cancer and a near certain death sentence beau urged his father not to be deterred from running for president in 2016 so did the rest of the family but biden says when the time for a decision was pressing his grief was too fresh his family still reeling i didn t have the emotional energy to do it he says if he could have brought himself to run he believes he could have gone the distance in what would have been his third bid for the presidency first would he have defeated hillary clinton for the democratic nomination i think i would have he says i thought i was best qualified to finish the job that barack and i had started second would he have beaten donald trump in the general election he responds with a slow grin the polling data indicated that and i did not take issue with the polling data biden argues that his connection with middle class voters and the authenticity he projects would have been the right fit in the unpredictable presidential election just past and perhaps the one still ahead when it comes to the 2020 contest he says it s not yet time to make a decision about running but he leaves little doubt that he wants to think about it when it is time one factor will be his age and health and the desire by some democrats to turn to a new generation of leaders biden who celebrates his 75th birthday next week would be the nation s oldest president ever if elected in 2020 i really want to spend the next month and a half doing nothing but talking about my son no 1 and no 2 i m working really hard to elect a democratic house in the midterm elections next year biden says i m going to do everything i can to deal with what the democratic party should be running on and i think it gets down to a basic fundamental question how do you re establish the middle class re establish the basic bargain after that s over you know we ll see where i am he says look if my health is good and things are moving i would probably consider it so a third question would he be able to turn back trump s re election bid it s a long way off but if the election were held today yes meanwhile biden worries president trump will undermine the foreign policy initiatives that make up the third strand of his book obama had assigned him to lead the administration s efforts to encourage democracy in iraq in ukraine and in central america once the campaign was over i thought the greatest danger was what donald trump didn t know and it was clear to me that he didn t know much about foreign policy he says i was worried he would say something that was born out of no knowledge out of bravado that risk seemed particularly high in ukraine where biden feared that a provocative trump tweet inadvertently could spark violence and provide an excuse for russian incursion he reached out to his successor vice president pence with memos outlining his concerns now the two men remain in occasional touch there are a number of world leaders who have contacted me biden says i d always call mike and say mike king hussein of jordan wants to meet with me or the prime minister of serbia wants to meet with me is there any message you want me to deliver or anything you want to find out biden was referring to the current king of jordan abdullah ii to be clear biden is no fan of the current white house he calls trump s ideology spurious nationalism and his leadership dangerous as hell it is by comparison thatpence fares better i felt like mike was a much more traditional republican biden says not that that was his expertise but if you did the rorschach test on say moscow he predicts pence s response would meet a minimal threshold russia bad read more biden on 2020 not sure it s the appropriate thing to do biden to launch american possibilities pac poll of possible 2020 contenders biden is viewed most favorably by democrats listen to an excerpt from the audible version of promise me dad narrated by the author
