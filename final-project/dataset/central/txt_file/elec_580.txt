 julie rovner mitt romney s comments on abortion have surprised those on both sides of the issue evan vucci ap hide caption mitt romney s comments on abortion have surprised those on both sides of the issue just how many abortion positions does mitt romney have once again that answer is unclear this time the confusion began tuesday during a meeting with the editorial board of the des moines register there s no legislation with regards to abortion that i m familiar with that would become part of my agenda romney said he went on to add that he would use an executive order to reinstate the mexico city policy which bars u s aid to international groups that lobby or pay for abortions but the comment about not pushing abortion restricting legislation surprised those on both sides of the abortion debate that s quite a shock coming from mitt romney who has consistently called for the overturn of roe v wade who said that he would appoint supreme court justices who would do just that who has an extensive pro life agenda on his website that anybody can access says beth shipp political director of naral pro choice america that agenda includes things like defunding planned parenthood which would require legislation romney has also endorsed legislation to ban abortions at the point fetuses can theoretically feel pain in addition to a terse statement from the campaign vowing that if elected romney would be a pro life president the candidate himself tried to walk back some of his comments when asked by reporters at a campaign stop wednesday i think i ve said time and again i m a pro life candidate i ll be a pro life president he said during a rope line in ohio even before romney s walk back however he was being defended if somewhat weakly by abortion opponents no one likes to be caught flat footed or see your hero flat footed but those moments do come said marjorie dannenfelser president of the susan b anthony list dannenfelser said she thinks romney s comment to the editorial board was nothing more than a slip that he just has too much else on his mind to keep issues like abortion front and center i think the simple truth of the matter is his head is in jobs and the economy almost all day long almost every single day she said and of course we want at least a third of his focus to be on it all the time but you don t always get everything that you want naral s shipp however thinks it s anything but an accident just as it was no accident when romney said in a cbs evening news interview in august that he supported abortions when the pregnant woman s health not just her life was threatened that position was also reversed later quietly by staff i know mitt romney really wants women to vote for him shipp says but the way that he s going about this by lying to people about where he stands on the issues is not going to serve him well come nov 6 still political scientist john green of the university of akron says what romney is doing isn t all that unusual there s a long tradition of candidates adopting one kind of position for a broad audience maybe on television then having a different position in direct mail or in smaller venues he says green says romney is running into trouble because in today s world of twitter and nonstop cable news there s no such thing as being able to deliver different messages to anyone anymore we ve discovered over the last couple of election cycles and we ve seen it in many examples this year is that it s hard to keep those different venues separate because of our communication technology today green says with an issue as touchy as abortion that can become even more hazardous says green the people who really care about something like abortion whether they re in the republican base or the democratic base have very firm convictions on where a candidate should stand he says and variation on those convictions can create very real problems those problems include both alienating one s own voters and mobilizing those on the other side at least for now however romney seems to be making it work there s still nearly a month until election day however and two more debates to go npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
