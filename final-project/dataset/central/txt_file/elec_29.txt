much deeper loading march 6 2016 ron herndon needs more than 10 fingers to count the ways republican presidential candidate donald trump rubs him the wrong way not least the billionaire s quest for personal aggrandizement via the white house so why is the small town barbecue shack owner a registered democrat likely voting for mr trump if he wins the gop nomination america is at the point where she needs someone who speaks the truth to say what we all think but won t say around strangers says mr herndon sometimes the truth makes you smile and sometimes it hurts herndon s view is that america needs a straight talking president to tackle real life problems long ignored by washington it has become a common refrain the views of this african american pit master suggest that many americans are curious about trump not just because he brazenly breaks the rules of political rhetoric but also because the key to tackling america s problems they say requires people to stop taking offense at the drop of a hat in that way trump is the symbol of a broader cultural tension as many millennials in particular become more militant in their desire to make public discourse inclusive they are coming up against those tired of wars against christmas or tentative talk about islamic extremism for millennials who have grown up in the language of political correctness speech is a weapon and curtailing words that can be seen as offensive or hateful is a new civil rights frontier but trump s unfiltered speech encapsulates a potent backlash with many conservative americans trying to draw the line on how cautious and careful public conversation becomes the big difference with trump is his language is not coded says henry giroux a political scientist at mcmaster university in hamilton ontario and author of the upcoming book america at war with itself which largely focuses on the rise of trump trump s words tap into is a nation that really has been suffering particularly since 9 11 from a kind of national insecurity state mobilized by a massive sense of fear he adds but millennials see in such language a darkness lurking beneath the surface on super tuesday trump continued his trend of underperforming among voters age 18 to 29 but he did well among new england suburbanites southern evangelicals small businessmen and blue collar workers among others at least partly behind trump s success is the perception that political correctness has morphed into soft totalitarianism wrote james kalb wrote in chronicles magazine late last year the domination of public life by pc elites has made it impossible for ordinary people to assert their complaints publicly in an acceptable way so their objections can easily be shrugged off as the outbursts of ignorant bigots who will in any event soon become demographically irrelevant antipathy toward political correctness spans a wide spectrum of americans many whom use the phrase as a pejorative seventy one percent of americans say political correctness is a problem in the united states up 10 percentage points from 2014 according to an august 2015 report by rasmussen reports at the pawn depot situated on a lonely stretch of us 278 in lithonia ga that concern is front of mind elizabeth langbecker the owner is a trump fan because he refuses to tip toe around immigration the economy and terrorism we need someone who is not afraid to step up to the plate and say what a lot of us want to say she adds she weighs the obama administration s efforts to downplay the phrase islamic extremism against the san bernardino calif shootings last year where a muslim couple killed 14 people and injured 22 others how can we deal with all these problems if we can t even have an honest conversation about the root cause she says in the 2016 race political correctness has played out in a number of ways on one hand hillary clinton apologized for using the term illegal immigrant as opposed to undocumented migrant but there have been examples on the right too republican orthodoxy has long held that candidates should not criticize past republican presidents trump has torn that to shreds yes it s true that on college campuses there s a lot of silliness about not wanting to offend someone says alan abramowitz a political scientist at emory university in atlanta but it s also on the conservative side which trump has also been violating where you couldn t say the iraq war was a mistake or that romney was going to lose the 2012 election now those things are being said loudly one difference is a sense of desperation in many rural red state areas populism needs to be a loud message and political incorrectness is high volume says dave mudcat saunders of roanoke va the backdrop is not just anger but survival we re in survival mode out here where 93 percent of counties are still in recession a hungry dog will bite your rear i can tell you that that desperation has matched the militancy of millennials looking to reshape the national conversation with the militancy of conservatives pushing back against it the answer says the atlantic s conor friedersdorf is to prune political correctness back to its original essence citizens who oppose trumpism are going to have to take a careful look at everything that falls under the rubric of political correctness study the real harm done by its excesses identify the many parts that are worth defending and persuade more americans to adopt those norms voluntarily for substantive reasons not under duress of social shaming or other coercion he writes working on the set of the vampire series the originals in downtown conyers ga last week 20 something michael sanders says to him political correctness is a force from on high the media government and academia that has pervaded his life me and everyone i grew up with have always used the language of political correctness he says when we talk about phrases like illegal immigrant my dad says that s just the way people used to talk get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox on one hand it enforces common courtesy but there is an appeal he adds to someone who comes out and baldly talks from the standpoint of the worldview that used to be dominant i think many americans like to hear the language of someone not only willing to complain about the end of white dominant culture but someone who says he can do something about it that s when political correctness goes out the window link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your
