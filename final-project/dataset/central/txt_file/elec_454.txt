judging by the collective republican sigh of relief after ted cruz swept the wisconsin primary and put the brakes on the donald trump juggernaut many in the party seem to consider cruz a viable alternative to trump but that view is nothing short of baffling despite his ivy league education pastor like polished oratory andapparentvoter appeal cruz seems to know how to do only one thing in government and that is to say no love him or hate him trump knows how to make a deal sure some ventures were a flop something not uncommon for lifelong entrepreneurs but his net worth to the tune of 4 5 billionaccording to forbes is not exactly indicative of a dummy his blustering speech and non conformist policy proposals make him an unorthodox fit for the gop nomination but that is no reason to gravitate towards cruz in fact it is a sign of shortsightedness and desperation rafael cruz ted s father recentlysaid in an interview we need to get to the point where instead of listening to the rhetoric we look to the record candidates will say what people want to hear we look at what they do and what they have done heeding the elder cruz s call is in no way redeeming for the junior senator from texas he has systematically demonstrated that he lacks the ability to negotiate govern according to the rule of law and navigate amicably through differences of opinion politics should be more like medicine column cruz famously spearheaded the 2013 federal government shutdown thatcost theeconomy 24 billionand taxpayers 2 billion hebrazenlysupported kim davis the kentucky county clerk who was jailed for refusing to issue same sex marriage licenses as required by the supreme court he has also said people would quite rightly revolt if a brokered gop convention in cleveland were to produce a nominee other than him or trump in the senate cruz has personified the word obstructionism since he took office in 2013 his first vote was nay on thedisaster relief appropriations act a bill authorizing 60 billion for relief agencies that would in part provide much needed federal funds for new jersey after hurricane sandy later that year cruz voted against key bills such asthe violence against women reauthorization act theborder security economic opportunity and immigration modernization act theemployment non discrimination act and theagriculture reform foodand jobs act all passed the senate without his vote cruz also voted against renewing the james zadroga 9 11 health and compensation act last december the act which passed and became law finances health care programs through 2090 for more than72 000 first responders and survivors from around the country who went to the three 9 11 crash sites cruz s nay vote on the emotionally charged issue will very likely hurt his chances in the new york primary on april 19 as well as the new jersey primary on june 7 as for reaching across the aisle ananalysis by govtrack usfound that in 2015 only 7 of the bills cruz introduced had co sponsors of both parties that was the lowest of any republican in the senate teavangelical ted takes off with wisconsin win david brody policing the usa alook at race justice media like trump cruz prides himself on his idiosyncrasies and personal brand of political independence but while critics repeatedly lambastetrump for failed ventures such astrump steaks and trump vodka those are just two of countless projectsundertaken by the business mogul cruz s senate record and reputation show he fails at his full time job the dangers of a cruz candidacy haven t exactly been lost on the republican party his cocky personality and inability to play nice in the senate are well known as sen lindsey graham a onetime 2016 candidate himself quipped in february if you killed ted cruz on the floor of the senate and the trial was in the senate nobody would convict you just three weeks later and exhibiting a full blown case of trump derangement syndrome graham announced he d be backingcruz s bid for the nomination sen marco rubio another former contender said shortly before dropping out of the nomination race thattrump is pulling the ultimate con job on the american people but when you look at what cruz would bring to the presidency who is really pulling the ultimate con job on voters armand v cucciniello iiiisa formerseniorpress officerfor thedepartment of state andserved as an adviser to the u s military in iraq and pakistan follow him on twitter armandvc3 in addition to its own editorials usa today publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including ourboard of contributors to read more columns like this go to theopinion front page
