republican presidential candidate to win erie county was ronald reagan in 1984 in 2016 trump beat clinton by a margin of 1 957 votes jim wertz president of the erie democrats said no presidential candidate has won pennsylvania without winning erie looking back wertz recognizes why democrats lost four years earlier obama won the county by about 18 000 votes there wasn t much outreach by the clinton campaign wertz said clinton never visited the area trump on the other hand held an arena rally that drew thousands of people wertz said he s already had conversations with several major presidential campaigns about candidates visiting erie though he declined to say who he noted that there s a faction of very staunch biden supporters in parts of the county but added that there s also been interest in sanders california senator kamala harris and o rourke among voters berniebashes bernie sanders zeros in on joe biden as his favorite foil in campaign for 2020 nomination nancy robertson 82 did not like trump when he was running for president and dislikes him even more now trump overwhelmingly won york county in 2016 garnering more than 60 percent of the vote yet registered republicans like robertson and peggy vernon do not plan to vote for the president in 2020 i don t think we need to put up with this stuff in this day and age vernon said of trump s behavior and i just don t think he s that smart robertson said she thinks she ll vote for biden since he s such a good man vernon isn t sure what democratic candidate she wants to vote for mike vernon peggy s husband is interested inbuttigieg the 63 year old office manager and democrat finds the millennial candidate to be progressive the york resident isn t so sure about biden at this point he would have to prove himself mike vernon said nick tioma 26 and a registered democrat is also unsure about biden as the party s nominee he doesn t support one candidate quite yet he s still waiting for a candidate to emerge i want someone different tioma said in many sections of reading the seat of berks county spanish is more common than english as large communities with origins in puerto rico and south america form its backbone many who spoke with the news journal said they didn t vote in 2016 what good does it do when the political class pays them little attention they said i don t follow politics because all of them it s the same thing said daniel serrano a reading area resident the sentiment likely helped fuel democrats 4 500 vote loss in the county from 2012 to 2016 republicans gained nearly 12 000 voter turnout in the city historically has been low said rick olmos chief operating officer of centro hispano of reading and berks county that trend reversed in a recent citywide electionafter his group held a candidates forum in both english and spanish he said asked if he expects higher turnout to continue into the 2020 general election olmos said it remains to be seen there should be greater number of voters overall in reading and in philadelphia he said because of a recent influx of thousands of people who had fled hurricane ravaged puerto rico twenty miles and a culture away from reading is the village of morgantown also in berks county along the traditional main street is morgantown market a shop with a strict no politics rule whereas reading is a traditional democratic stronghold morgantown is where many have switched party allegiances and consequently it has seen its share of cruel political sniping stacey thompson owner of the market said she just wants to be inclusive to everyone political discussions in recent years have boiled over into name calling and hurt feelings she said civil discussion she said it just can t occur anymore in the big city there seems to be little fear of offending someone politically whether on market street in west philadelphia or the penrose diner in south philly residents enjoy boldly declaring their political allegiances john flocco a retired demolition worker said it s because when philadelphians decide they like you you re good i think this country needs a president that don t take no guff said flocco a trump supporter who says biden is a good guy and is mostly honest the city saw a 17 000 vote swing in favor of republicans in philadelphia between 2012 and 2016 though itremains solidly democratic malyk brice a market researcher from west philadelphia said the next democratic presidential candidate is likely to win back many of those voters clinton lost pennsylvania he said after her debate performance against trump it was like you re being petty like he s being petty and you re kind of turning me off he said brice doesn t believe biden would suffer from a similar slide in popularity because he expects him to campaign on the streets of cities and towns that matter still he isn t certain if biden will be his choice among the more than 20 democrats sanders and harris also are appealing anybody else is better than trump he said contact meredith newman at mnewman delawareonline com or 302 324 2386 follow her on twitter merenewman contactkarl bakerat kbaker delawareonline com
