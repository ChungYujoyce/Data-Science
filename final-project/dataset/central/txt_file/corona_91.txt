government trump said will use data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time coronavirus trump signals growing impatience with coronavirus related economic shutdowns he did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the u s the remarks were a major departure from trump s prediction just days ago that the guidelines could potentially be in place through the summer trump appeared to signal that parts of the country that are less hard hit could be placed under less strict guidelines than states like new york and california at the same time trump admitted the outbreak will only get worse in the u s trump said he agreed with his surgeon general s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump this is going to be bad trump said we re trying to make it so it s much much less bad john fritze and sean rossman president donald trump said monday that first lady

initially declined to be tested noting that they did not have symptoms but pressure grew for both officials amid reports that they had contact with others who tested positive pence s office said last week that one of his aides tested positive for the virus trump said he got the test only after facing questions from reporters john fritze and courtney subramanian president donald trump offered rare words of praise for federal reserve chairman jerome powell on monday trump a frequent critic of the central bank and especially its chairman said powell has done a good job in trying to boost the economy during the coronavirus pandemic trump said he even called powell on monday i called up jerome powell and said jerome you ve done a really good job trump told reporters i was proud of him just a little more than a week ago trump complained that the central bank needed to be more proactive and argued it had not done enough to juice the economy but his criticism has softened since the fed cut short term interest rates to zero on march 15 that took courage trump said adding that powell did the right thing he has really stepped up over the last week trump said asked if he has any regrets about how he has responded to the coronavirus pandemic trump said he had none i think we ve handled it really well he said adding that he looks forward not backward michael collins dr anthony fauci the nation s highly respected infectious disease expert did not attend monday s briefing on coronavirus at the white house an absence that reporters noticed immediately it was particularly noteworthy because fauci gave a remarkably candid interview to science magazine posted sunday evening in which he admitted being at odds with trump over several issues trump said he had just been with fauci and did not express any irritation with the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases he s a good man i like dr fauci trump said he s not here because we weren t discussing issues that he is best at addressing the president said asked iffauci agrees with him on the need to reopen the economy soon trump said he doesn t not agree deirdre shesgreen dr deborah birx leader of the white house coronavirus task force seemed to suggest sen rand paul who has tested positive for covid 19 had not been adhering to the government s social distancing guidelines each person has to be responsible in the way that they decrease their interaction with others she said everyone needs to keep six feet apart and assume that everyone you re interacting with could be positive she added her remarks came in response to a question about contradictory messages birx and others have said that americans should not get tested if they don t have symptoms or exposure to the virus but paul got tested even though he had no symptoms in between taking the test and getting the results paul had lunch with other lawmakers and even went swimming in the senate gym if he had been following these guidelines he wouldn t have been infecting others because of the social distancing washing your hands doing everything that we talked about birx deirdre shesgreen dr deborah birx a member of the white house coronavirus task force said the u s is learning from china and south korea the two areas that have moved through their curve is china and south korea so those are the two countries that we re learning from those were 8 10 week curves each state and each hot spot in the united states is going to be its own curve because the seed came in at different times jeanine santucci president donaldtrump declined to say directly that he would ease social distancing measures in order to restart the economy next week but suggested guidelines could be different based on how hard a state or location has been hit you ll see what happens trump said it s not going to be three or four months before life returns to normal trump said parts of our country are very lightly affected at a certain point we have to get open trump said we have to get moving we don t want to lose these companies we ll be doing something relatively quickly john fritze president donald trump said he agreed with the surgeon general s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump trump said he agreed with the surgeon general s prediction that the number of coronavirus cases would jump this is going to be bad trump said we re trying to make it so it s much much less bad trump said he agreed with public health officials that the death rate from the virus would be bad but he also returned to comparing coronavirus to the seasonal flu it s going to be bad trump said we have a lot of people dying from the flu certainly this is going to be bad and we re trying to make it so that it s much much less bad michael collins and john fritze vice president mike pence said self collected swabs for the coronavirus would soon be available so americans can test themselves for infection this will expedite the testing process pence said andalso reduce the risk to health care providers he said the tests would be available at clinics and drive through testing sites but did not say where or how soon pence said the test is less invasive collected at the end of the nasal passage trump and others have described the test as unpleasant because the swab goes so far up the nose pence said 313 000 coronavirus tests have been completed in the u s a little more than 41 000 americanshave contracted the virus he added michael collins vice president mike pence said facebook donated its reserve of over 700 000 masks which they hadbecause of wildfires in california health workers urgently need more protective gear facebook ceo mark zuckerberg wrote on facebook on sunday to help facebook donated our emergency reserve of 720 000 masks that we had bought in case the wildfires continued we re also working on sourcing millions of more to donate i hope you re all staying healthy and safe jeanine santucci president donald trump abandoned the term chinese virus in his opening remarks at a press conference about the coronavirus monday the first time he has done so in days trump who has drawn criticism for echoing the term generally uses it in his opening remarks instead trump echoed an earlier tweet suggesting that asian americans should be protected and not blamed for a virus that researchers believe began in china the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form trump said trump had frequently referred to coronavirus as the chinese virus despite mounting criticism among asian american advocates health experts and democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location specific name stigmatizes ethnic groups john fritze dr deborah birx a member of the white house coronavirus task force said one child age 14 died of the virus in china but no child under 15 has died of the virus in europe that should be reassuring to the moms and dads out there she said birx also said the new york metro area of new jersey new york city and parts of long island have an attack rate close to one in 1 000 which fives timeswhat other areas are seeing michael collins president donald trump said he signed an executive order to prohibit the hoarding medical equipment and supplies including hand sanitizers and face masks the order designates certain medical supplies as scarce he said which makes it a crime to stockpile these items we will not allow anyone to exploit the suffering of american citizens for their own profit trump said u s attorney general william barr said the justice department plans to identify cases in which hoarding may be interfering with efforts to address large medical supply shortages at hospitals across the country barr said the administration convened their first task force meeting to address issues of price gouging he added the justice department was not seeking out consumers or businesses stockpiling supplies for their own operations but people hoarding on an industrial scale if you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house this is not something you have to worry about he said but if you re hoarding masks in a warehouse then you re going to get a knock on the door courtney subramanian and john fritze president donald trump said monday the federal government will use data to recommend new protocols to allow local economies to cautiously resume their activity at the appropriate time he did not say when those protocols would be rolled out as the coronavirus spreads across the u s america will again and

diagnosis adds to debate he said once the medical community gives the ok certain places will be free to end the social distancing practices and other restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus trump also encouraged congress to pass a stimulus now being negotiated in the senate now congress must demonstrate the same bipartisanship again and join together to pass the senate bill as written and avoid playing any more partisan games he said what else was said at the news conference trump said coronavirus started out as a medical problem and the u s will not allow it to become a financial problem trump announced the postponement for the deadline for compliance with real id requirements trump said the u s brought home 103 american citizens stranded in brazil most of them were senior citizens trump said 148 countries are now affected by coronavirus but we will be back in business as a country pretty soon john fritze and michael collins president donald trump called for protecting the asian american community on monday amid criticism that by using the term chinese virus to describe the coronavirus pandemic he has stigmatized chinese americans it is very important that we totally protect our asian american community in the united states and all around the world trump tweeted monday minutes before a white house briefing on coronavirus they are amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form they are working closely with us to get rid of it we will prevail together coronavirus trump weighs easing of tough coronavirus guidelines amid growing alarm about economy trump reiterated his call to protect the asian american community at a monday evening press conference trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the chinese virus despite mounting criticism among asian american advocates health experts and democratic lawmakers who warn referring to the virus by a location specific name stigmatizes certain ethnic groups the world health organization has urged people to be careful with language used to describe covid 19 insisting that it not be referred to as the chinese or wuhan virus any mention of location could lead to discrimination or stigmatization the group warns researchers say coronavirus originated in china and trump has defended his use of the term as accurate it s not racist at all no
