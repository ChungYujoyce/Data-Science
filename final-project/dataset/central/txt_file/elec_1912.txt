saturday s presidential nominating contests have a sense of day after the big party leftovers there are some broken pretzels that strange jello mold your cousin brought that nobody ate and somehow magically a half rack of ribs that never got out of the fridge the contests are also oddly scattered around while super tuesday had a concentrated swath of contests for both parties across the south that were closely watched spotty saturday has only two states where both parties are in action kansas caucuses and the louisiana primary the rest are one party affairs usa today will have all the results and updated delegate countsas the numbers come in here s what to watch for in each state things in louisiana often run a little behind schedule and their primary is no exception texas arkansas alabama and georgia voted on super tuesday louisiana apparently couldn t get around to it until saturday but that tardiness also makes it the juiciest contest on the day s schedule with 46 republican and 51 democratic delegates up for grabs donald trump and ted cruz are considered the top contenders in the pelican state thought the baton rouge advocate reports that there is no meaningful polling in the state that indicates which way it might lean trump and cruz both had events in the state friday marco rubio had scheduled an event but scratched it earlier in the week the democratic primary is easier to read hillary clinton crushed bernie sanders in the southern states on super tuesday racking up large margins of victory among african american voters and that is likely to be the case again here polls close at 8 p m central time kansas is theother state both parties are contesting saturday but in caucuses not primaries that makes the process and the results more complicated the republicans dividing up 40 delegates start at 10 a m and finish at 2 p m central time and like other gop caucusstates the voting is by secret ballot the democrats with 33 delegates at stake begin gathering at 1 p m and begin caucusing at 3 p m which involves people standing in clusters to show support for the candidates the democratic caucus organizers better count carefully because the biggest clusters of people are likely to be around the television set at 3 p m when the no 1 ranked kansas jayhawks tipoff against the no 20iowa state cyclones the hope is results will come in early because voters want to get home for the second half the kentucky caucuses are a republican onlyaffair on saturday and our colleagues at the louisville courier journal report that there are concerns about low turnout becausethe event has been poorly advertised and it is the first time they have helda caucusinstead of a primary since 1984 polling in this race is pretty suspect but a recent western kentucky university poll had trump up by 13 over marco rubio and rubio canceled a friday event he had scheduled in the state there are 46 delegates at stake here voting closes at4 p m central time democrats hold caucuses in nebraska on saturday which could offer some good news for bernie sanders he has done well in caucus states and states with lower concentrations of minority voters oddly nebraska sets its caucus times by county so voters will be gathering at different times around the state starting at 10 a m and ending at 8 p m central time an alarming detail from the lincoln journal star early returns will be announced beginning shortly after 8 p m saturday when the last caucus sites close but full results and the official delegate count could come late saturday or even sunday morning as party officials gather and process tallies from some of the later caucus sites including lancaster county all this for only 25 delegates by comparison there are 130 democratic delegates on the table in michigan s tuesday primary more than saturday s three democratic contests combined maine republicans gather for caucuses saturday democrats caucus on sunday go figure to distribute 23 delegates caucus times differ by county the latest caucus sites close at 7 p m in the southern part of the northernmost county in the state it s the smallest stack of delegates on the table saturday but donald trump still swung by maine on thursday on his way to detroit for a debate and ted cruz was in maine on friday
