phoenix arizona s top republicans are snubbing donald trump as he prepares to bring his surging gop presidential campaign and brash talk on immigration here neither u s senator nor the state s governor will attend the saturday event hosted by the republican party of maricopa county and featuring controversial county sheriff joe arpaio gop sen jeff flake blasted trump the celebrity real estate mogul who has drawn fire for saying mexican immigrants bring crime and drugs to the u s and contacted the maricopa county gop on thursday to register his disapproval donald trump s views are coarse ill informed and inaccurate and they are not representative of the republican party said flake who with gop sen john mccain was one of the authors of a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform measure that passed the senate in 2013 as an elected republican official i m disappointed the county party would host a speaker that so damages the party s image arizona gov doug ducey won t even be chatting privately with trump mccain already had distanced himself from trump s comments about mexican immigrants but elaborated thursday when he was asked during an msnbc interview about trump s rhetoric and upcoming arizona visit i just think that it is offensive to not only hispanic citizenry but other citizenry but he s entitled to say what he wants to say mccain said but i guarantee you the overwhelming majority in arizona do not agree with his attitude that he has displayed toward our hispanic citizens we love them nationally trump s constant fire breathing on immigration also is making gop leaders uncomfortable the washington post reported that reince priebus the republican national committee chairman had a private 45 minute telephone call wednesday with trump in which he reportedly urged the candidate to tone it down trump described the conversation to cnn as congratulatory although he was told to tone it down a little bit trump s visit comes as some arizona leaders are attempting to counter the state s harsh reputation stemming from state senate bill 1070 a divisive measure passed in 2010 that was intended to crack down on illegal immigrants the state has opposed obama administration policies to shield certain immigrants from deportation and a federal judge found arpaio to have racially profiled latinos during enforcement activities but trump is not getting the cold shoulder from all arizona republicans late thursday the trump campaign announced that the phoenix event was being moved from the arizona biltmore resort to the downtown convention center to accommodate the thousands of people expected to attend responding to flake s criticism the maricopa county gop said in a written statement that it is thrilled to have the opportunity to bring many republican presidential candidates to meet with the voters of arizona and discuss issues important to the security and prosperity of our country in maricopa county we believe deeply in former president ronald reagan s 11th commandment that thou shalt not speak ill of any other republican and it is disappointing when our republican leaders do not share that same commitment to party unity and teamwork the statement said arpaio who like trump is an immigration hard liner said it s too early to consider endorsing trump or any other gop presidential contenders in the 2012 presidential race arpaio backed former texas gov rick perry who again is seeking the republican nomination former gov jan brewer who signed sb 1070 into law told cnn this week that trump is kind of telling it like it really truly is being the governor of the gateway of illegal immigration for six years we had to deal with a lot of things brewer said i think that the people of arizona realize that we pick up the tab of the majority of the violence that comes across our border with regards to the drug cartels the smugglers the drop houses it has been horrendous ducey made illegal immigration a key talking point as he ran in the crowded 2014 gop primary and promised to close the arizona mexico border since taking office in january though he has avoided saying much about illegal immigration instead focusing on efforts to strengthen trade and economic ties with mexico ducey has met several potential presidential candidates during their trips to phoenix in october ducey spent a day with new jersey gov chris christie when christie traveled here to stump for ducey during the general election in march he met with wisconsin gov scott walker who headlined a leadership series event for the arizona chamber of commerce and industry in may ducey spent time with gop sen marco rubio of florida he also has met with former florida gov jeb bush david berman a senior research fellow at arizona state university s morrison institute for public policy said arizona s top gop officials might be avoiding trump because they hope to discourage his hard line tactics which put arizona in a bad light rile the republican party and turn off latino voters there s a feeling among establishment republicans like them that he s just such a loose cannon just an extremist and he would be a disaster on the national ticket berman said but he said the high number of rsvps to the event highlight trump s popularity among the right wing of the party the republicans and the conservatives have really had a rough few weeks with the supreme court s decisions the confederate flags coming down berman said they like someone who s standing up and fighting and not giving in and not being milquetoast on everything and someone who is telling it like they see it they like to have someone up there speaking their language in addition to trump supporters and curious onlookers the rally is expected to attract demonstrators from the immigrant rights community groups such as puente human rights lucha the arizona dream act coalition and mi famila vota have signaled that their members intend to protest however petra falcon director of promise arizona an organization that works to pass reform to give legal status to undocumented immigrants doesn t plan to go to trump s talk quite frankly it s not worth our time she said he is speaking in very divisive and hateful language he really doesn t understand how the economy operates when he is talking about removing immigrants from the economy contributing megan jula the arizona republic
