 apr 9 2020 at 5 11 pm by nate silver filed under 2020 election mike segar reuters the pitch is a mix of idealism and a shouting anger about the system but at its heart is a hard nosed math he s the only candidate with a sizable chunk of the electorate that won t waver no matter what so a field that keeps growing and splitting support keeps making things easier as i m sure you ve probably guessed this passage seems like it could be about donald trump s campaign for the republican nomination in 20161 but it s actually about bernie sanders s quest for the democratic nomination this year it comes from an april 2019 feature by the atlantic s edward isaac dovere that i consider to be a lodestar for sanders s strategy since it contains a lot of on the record reporting from sanders campaign 2 the article also reveals how the conventional wisdom about how primary campaigns have changed in light of trump winning the republican nomination in 2016 and sanders s better than expected performance against hillary clinton that year in particular it reflects several common assumptions in media coverage of the race this year indeed if you d beamed down to planet earth from some alien civilization in january 2016 and only seen that year s primaries those might be the lessons that you d take away about how primaries work they re a reasonably apt description of the gop primary where the republican establishment belly flopped in trying to stop trump the democratic primary was a bit more complicated clinton beat sanders by a rather clear margin in the end 3 still sanders overperformed expectations by enough as to at least not contradict the notion that 2016 was the new normal but focusing on only what happened in the most recent election is a dumb way to do analysis the media and campaign professionals spend endless amounts of time trying to draw lessons from elections because they are so consequential but you can t escape the fact that presidential elections happen only once every four years no matter how many lessons you might try to draw from any one example you re still dealing with a sample size of one rather the history of the primaries both in terms of how the media covers them and how campaigns wage them is often one of fighting the last war and overcompensating for perceived mistakes from four years earlier i m not claiming to be immune from this either one of the reasons that i initially bought so heavily into the party decides hypothesis in 2016 which implied that trump s lack of support from the republican party establishment would eventually doom him was because of the republican primary in 2012 when a series of insurgent candidates newt gingrich herman cain rick santorum briefly surged in the polls only to eventually lose to the slow and steady and establishment backed mitt romney but romney s win in 2012 was in line with the longer history of the primaries which underscores that building coalitions across the different wings of your party romney tried to unite conservatives and moderates for instance is usually a good strategy for winning instead of relying on just one faction and as you can see in the table below the establishment usually does win out in the end endorsement leaders before the iowa caucuses where no incumbent president was running for that party s nomination 1972 to 2020 biden has not been formally nominated but is the presumptive nominee endorsement leaders from 1980 to 2016 are based on fivethirtyeight s 2016 system for calculating endorsement points endorsement leaders in 1972 and 1976 are based on the party decides sources the party decides news accounts of course a result like romney s win in 2012 that confirms your theories and priors can create its own issues it can make you overconfident you may mistakenly assume for instance that something is true 100 percent of the time when it s actually only true say 80 percent of the time but while overconfidence is a serious problem it s probably better than assuming that an abnormal result say something that is true 20 percent of the time is the new normal you can see lots of this upside down thinking in media coverage of elections since 2016 because trump won the general election as a modest underdog in 2016 a lot have inferred that underdogs not only can win but that they usually win before the virginia gubernatorial election in 2017 for instance a lot of pundits predicted republican ed gillespie would win despite being narrowly behind democrat ralph northam in the polls northam won by 9 points instead it s not just the media who makes these mistakes however it s also the campaigns themselves so while i don t intend to do a long post mortem of the sanders campaign instead see my colleague perry bacon jr s comprehensive analysis on what went wrong and why i do want to take a quick inventory of the ways that the 2020 democratic primary was different from the republican primary in 2016 most of these problems were fairly predictable and known in advance to ensure you that i m not engaging in too much hindsight bias because it s always easier to say what went wrong with campaigns once you know who won and who lost i d point you toward this cautiously pessimistic take on sanders from april 2019 and this cautiously optimistic one from just after the new hampshire primary which reflects how my thinking about the sanders s campaign evolved as it was happening in real time i started out thinking that sanders s factional us versus them screw the establishment strategy was a poor one but it seemed to be going about as well as it possibly could after new hampshire with the rest of the field divided so here are some potential flaws in sanders s strategy and reasons why the precedent set by trump s win in 2016 might not have applied to his chances this year first democratic primaries and caucuses do not use winner take all rules while many republican states do that makes it much harder for someone to be in a commanding position by narrowly winning primaries instead in a multi candidate race you have to eventually broaden your coalition to avoid a contested convention in consideration of this some elements of sanders s strategy simply never made a lot of sense here s another key passage from that atlantic article he s counting on winning iowa and new hampshire where he was already surprisingly strong in 2016 and hoping that cory booker and kamala harris will split the black electorate in south carolina and give him a path to slip through there too and then sanders aides believe he ll easily win enough delegates to put him into contention at the convention they say they don t need him to get more than 30 percent to make that happen sanders s campaign was right that it could win around 30 percent of the vote with their base and that they could win early states with that amount but it never really had a plan for what came after that dovere s article makes it sound as though sanders was actually counting on a contested convention an awfully risky approach given that contested conventions are i highly unpredictable and ii not likely to be favorable terrain for sanders given his lack of support from the establishment and that superdelegates would be allowed to vote on the second and subsequent ballots second trump s ideological ambiguity may have helped him in 2016 while sanders got stuck in a lane this year trump may not have done that much traditional outreach to different parts of the gop but republican voters from several wings of the party perhaps not being quite sure what to make of a candidate like trump who was reactionary on some issues say immigration and quite moderate on others say gay marriage were nonetheless trump curious and that range of appeal was reflected in the primary results in the michigan republican primary for instance trump won the support of 35 percent of very conservative voters 37 percent of somewhat conservative voters and 37 percent of moderate voters according to exit polls by contrast sanders ran further to the left in 2020 than he did in 2016 with a message that shifted from economic populism to a broader and more intersectional leftism this shift was reflected at the ballot box too for instance sanders won just 24 percent of moderates in the michigan democratic primary this year but 63 percent of very liberal voters as compared 44 percent of moderates and 59 percent of very liberal voters in 2016 third the importance that democratic voters attached to electability and to beating trump may have made them more willing to take cues from the establishment electability is a whole subject unto itself that i m not going to do justice to here i do think electability may be a teensy tiny bit overrated as a reason for why sanders lost while perceptions of electability probably hurt sanders relative to joe biden it also probably helped him relative to candidates who weren t white men most notably elizabeth warren still electability was important in that michigan exit poll 58 percent of democratic voters said they preferred a candidate that could beat trump to someone who agreed with them on the issues and 62 percent of the beat trump voters went for biden fourth democratic party elites had an opportunity to learn from republicans in 2016 and this may have made them more aggressive in backing biden after south carolina one reason to be careful of declaring a new normal in any trend involving human behavior is that humans have an opportunity to learn from what happened last time and change course the establishment s failures in 2016 may have made partly elites reluctant to weigh in early on in the race this time around but once they perceived sanders as the true front runner after nevada and biden began to gain a little bit of momentum as he surged to a lead in south carolina polls party elites got behind biden at extremely rapid rates it s hard to know if this would have played out the same way if there wasn t 2016 to learn from fifth trump s success in 2016 may have reflected an unusually weak field of alternatives rather than a new paradigm i m not going to spend much time on this one because it s rather subjective were warren biden pete buttigieg kamala harris etc better candidates than ted cruz marco rubio jeb bush john kasich etc i don t know but democratic voters were certainly much happier with their field of candidates in 2020 than republicans were with theirs in 2016 which is some indication that the field might have been stronger sixth democrats are a more racially diverse party which makes coalition building more essential than it is among republicans sanders didn t do badly with nonwhite voters winning nevada largely on the basis of hispanic support while also winning the support of many younger black voters that definitely made him a more plausible nominee than buttigieg whose support was extremely white for example still nonwhite support wasn t a strength for sanders in a head to head race against biden who generally beat sanders by wide margins among black voters and held his own among hispanics in many states and sanders s outreach to african american leaders didn t always go smoothly with many members of the congressional black caucus backing biden instead seventh relying on a fixed base of voters can leave you vulnerable to a turnout surge from other candidates one rather explicit assumption made by the sanders campaign was that it could turn out more voters than its opponents hence the campaign believed there was not much need to widen their circle to include others even their outreach efforts to sanders skeptical party leaders focused on trying to browbeat them into explaining why they didn t support sanders rather than explaining why they should support him again from that atlantic article that s the case sanders and his aides have been making as they ve undertaken an outreach effort unlike anything from the last campaign spending hours on phone calls trying to talk political leaders down from being completely opposed to him they have a basic script start out asking where the support for sanders is among their constituents then ask why they think those people support him and then ask the leaders to explain their own skepticism one problem with this attitude is that turnout in an election isn t fixed especially in primaries and caucuses where participation is low you may turn out a certain number of people but your base will not be constant as a percentage of the electorate if turnout goes up in michigan for example sanders got nearly as many votes in 2020 576 754 as in 2016 599 000 but biden got 838 555 votes in 2020 as compared to just 581 775 for clinton in 2016 part of a general pattern where turnout surged more in biden s best areas so sanders went from narrowly winning michigan to losing it by 17 percentage points perhaps sanders was a victim of his own success in 2016 that is he did such a good job of turning out voters in 2016 that it was hard to improve on his performance in 2020 still there was never really any recognition that his base alone might not be enough to win and there were never many efforts to expand beyond his base indeed it s interesting that sanders doubled down even more on his screw the establishment messaging amidst his success in the first three states rather than trying to pivot to a more inclusive campaign and unify the party behind him i ve got news for the republican establishment i ve got news for the democratic establishment they can t stop us bernie sanders berniesanders february 22 2020 maybe if a few things had gone differently it would have worked sanders did outlast more than two dozen other candidates after all maybe if michael bloomberg hadn t qualified for the nevada debate and stumbled so badly there moderate support would have remained divided between bloomberg and biden and sanders would have had a lot more wins on super tuesday maybe sanders s 60 minutes interview hurt him maybe he could have gotten warren to endorse him who knows but the sanders campaign was always pursuing a strategy that claimed to defy the odds that assumed the old rules no longer applied and that stuck its thumb in the eye of the establishment it would have been remarkable if it had succeeded but it s no surprise that it didn t well maybe apart from the part about idealism without frankly a lot of pushback either from the reporter himself or from rival campaigns even though sanders won a number of states in 2016 that didn t translate into an especially close race for votes or delegates furthermore at least some of sanders s success came from neverhillary voters who weren t necessarily on board with sanders s platform but were just looking for some alternative to clinton nate silver is the founder and editor in chief of fivethirtyeight natesilver538 filed under donald trump 1258 posts 2016
