with four locations in atlanta this week would have been the busiest of the year the business has brought in 577 this month through online retail butterranovaowes 25 000 in expenses for april she doesn t plan to reopen anytime soon it just doesn t make sense to risk dying over a spray tan we re the most nonessential of businesses and the fact that kemp is rolling out this opening so soon it just doesn t make any sense she said we ve kind of taken it for granted that our hospitals aren t overrun at this point terranova started her business 10years ago out of her house she her husband and sister have 13 employees whom they laid off sothe employees could apply for unemployment now that salons are allowed to reopen terranova said she s concerned about remaining eligible for unemployment

22 000people have tested positive for the virus in georgia and more than 80 have died according to the department about 101 000 tests have been conductedin the state of more than 10 million omer was particularly critical of the governor s decision to open salons and gyms it s as if someone took the list of the things that you should be careful about opening and then flipped it around he said it s ironic that georgia has perhaps the highest rate of public health experts per capita because of the cdc and despite that they re implementing polices that are not supported by evidence dr carlos del rio executive associate deanof emory university school of medicine encouraged residents in a video briefing thursday to exercise caution this is not like we re open for business people will make their

mixed support from businesses in savannah johno morisano owner of the grey and the grey market also has no plans to reopen either eatery to dine in guests anytime soon primarily because he said
