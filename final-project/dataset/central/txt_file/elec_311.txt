in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more will square offon mondaynight in the most anticipated and consequential presidential debate in modern times the 90 minute debate at hofstra university in hempstead n y between the celebrity businessman and the first woman nominated by a major party is expected to smash ratings records potentially reaching 100 million viewers the clinton camp is preparing for everything but is undoubtedly unnerved by the prospect of trump conjuring one of the countless real and imagined conspiracies or controversies from clinton s decades in public life trump could make clinton s marriage an issue by bringing up monica lewinsky paula jones juanita broaddrick or kathleen willey or he could bring up clinton s health just weeks after a passerby captured dramatic cellphone video of her appearing to pass out while leaving a 9 11 memorial in new york city he could also veer into conspiracy trump during the gop primary suggested rival ted cruzrafael ted edward cruzstate department scrutiny threatens pompeo s political ambitions 125 lawmakers urge trump administration to support national guard troops amid pandemic parties gear up for battle over texas state house more s father might have been involved in the assassination of president john f kennedy the gop nominee has huddled with controversial anti clinton author ed klein whose work has been dismissed by the mainstream political class as unsubstantiated conspiracy mongering and he has surrounded himself with conservative media giants like former fox news chief roger ailes and breitbart chairman steve bannon both known for gleefully trafficking in the most embarrassing aspects of clinton s private life it all has the potential to blow clinton off course or it could backfire spectacularly on trump and provide an election defining moment of authenticity for clinton the democrat will also have ample opportunities to get under trump s skin a new york times report said clinton wants to show him unhinged which could signal she intends to dig at her rival over his business accomplishments temperament past controversies with women or ties to right wing extremist elements body language every move subconscious twitch and unplanned reaction will be captured in high definition magnified before a super bowl sized audience and endlessly dissected on cable news minor physical faux pas have sunk candidates in the past from al gorealbert al arnold goremelania trump to appear on cnn coronavirus town hall thursday night respect your elders a call to action klobuchar and harris could bolster biden in the midwest more sighing in 2000 to george h w bush checking his watch in 1992 trump has a flashy and over the top style punctuated by unique hand gesticulations and facial expressions he is entertaining to watch and is a ratings juggernaut but is also in the position of having to prove to a skeptical public that he is commander in chief material not just a showman clinton meanwhile is a cool and accomplished debater but can come across as dull or dispassionate the democratic nominee badly needs to energize a liberal base that has shown indifference to her she ll be looking to avoid a performance that appears overly scripted or sterile under the bright lights the moderator lester holt the modest and understated anchor of nbc nightly news need only ask his colleague matt lauer the host of nbc s today how tricky moderating a presidential forum can be lauer has suffered immense blowback from critics who said he was unprepared and allowed trump to walk all over him at a military forum earlier this month holt will face intense scrutiny for the questions he asks how he frames those questions and whether he fact checks and challenges the candidates on their claims in 2012 cnn anchor candy crowley came under fire for correcting mitt romney wrongly according to conservatives at a key moment in a debate against president obama over a question about benghazi there are myriad controversies and scandals involving both candidates that holt could choose to raise partisans will be keeping tally the campaigns and candidates are already busy working the ref trump this week said holt is a democrat and warned the anchor not to fact check his assertions the clinton campaign is publicly fretting that holt has such low expectations for trump that the moderator will take it easy on the gop nominee while holding clinton to a higher standard what voters do trump and clinton speak to both candidates have work to do in shoring up their respective bases but both also need to expand their appeal clinton has big leads over trump among hispanics african americans and young voters but none of these groups that formed the core of the obama coalition are particularly enthused about turning out for her she could lay it on thick with a message that energizes that liberal core which could help her slam the door shut on trump but clinton could also be looking to expand her appeal to republicans who can t bring themselves to vote for trump that would mean casting herself as a centrist and a pragmatist rather than a fierce advocate for the causes important to the left trump meanwhile badly needs to resonate with some constituency outside his core base of white men his efforts to reach african american voters have been mocked as condescending and trafficking in stereotypes many minority voters and young people aren t considering voting for trump but if he can improve even slightly on his dismal numbers there it could be meaningful for him in the long run a focus on minority outreach might also help alleviate the fears of white college educated voters who are steering clear of trump because they don t want to be associated with a candidate who has been accused of racism and bigotry the debate over black and blue a police shooting of a black man under disputed circumstances in north carolina has the nation on edge the fatal shooting of keith lamont scott has sparked protests in charlotte and once again put the spotlight on police practices in black communities potentially furthering the tension monday sdebate is expected to attract upwards of 10 000 protesters and will take place on long island which has a high concentration of cops firefighters and first responders trump has broken recently from his hard line pro police stance saying he was troubled by a different police shooting of a black man in tulsa okla which has led to charges of manslaughter against the officer tensions are running hot on both ends of the debate and how the candidates handle the super charged political minefield will be revealing view the discussion thread
