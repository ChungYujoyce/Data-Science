when donald trump bought 436 acres in upstate new york two decades ago he envisioned adding two new championship golf courses to his collection he bought the wet overgrown tree tangled parcels that sit miles off a state parkway beginning in 1998 for less than the current price of a two bedroom condo in trump tower but local leaders nixed the golf course plans and his subsequent efforts to sell it to a homebuilding company faltered so he gave it away this is my way of trying to give back he said at the time like most deals involving trump there was more to it than goodwill he was unloading what experts say was useless land but not before working local officials to see if they could reappraise it at more than five times the assessed value according to documents seen by bloomberg and interviews with people involved and using a grossly inflated figure on later presidential campaign documents to show falsely the depth of his philanthropy despite the purchase price of 2 75 million and a county assessment of 5 5 million at the time of the donation trump s 2016 campaign said in a list of charitable donations published by the washington post that the land was worth 26 1 million it s impossible to tell if trump did anything improper since he has never released his tax returns and there s no law against inflating the value of property on campaign press releases but the law does require taxpayers to accurately report the value of all charitable donations for deduction purposes and trump could face a penalty or fine from the irs if he exaggerated the value of the land on his tax returns the irs routinely audits all modern u s presidents and vice presidents annually including trump the donation took shape around the same time that trump was struggling ultimately in vain to turn around his three struggling casinos in atlantic city new jersey in march 2006 one month before his gift was announced his casino empire trump entertainment resorts lost 22 1 million in its fourth quarter an hour s drive north of manhattan donald j trump state park is what new york euphemistically calls a passive park meaning it has no trails picnic tables or other amenities the state stopped maintaining it in 2010 and the land lies covered in brambles mud and rocks a bill pending before the state legislature would change the name of the park to honor the folk singer pete seeger instead of the current president trump bought the first parcel 282 acres known as indian hill that straddle westchester and putnam counties from an estate sale for 1 75 million in 1998 he also bought 154 acres in westchester county known as french hill also part of an estate sale for 750 000 in 2000 he bought 58 acres of a nearby surplus stretch of the taconic state parkway from the new york state department of transportation for 250 000 but by 2002 local authorities had rejected his plans for two 18 hole championship golf courses on indian hill and french hill on the grounds that the courses would drain the area s water supply as well as affect the water supply of new york city downstream so in 2003 trump tried to sell u s home corp an option to build houses on the tracts but the giant home builder got cold feet about the costs of environmental and engineering challenges according to a person familiar with the deal the option agreement was terminated in april 2005 according to a memorandum filed in putnam county aaron curtiss a spokesman for lennar corp which bought u s home corp in 2000 declined to comment on the company s dealing with trump tim miller an environmental consultant who worked on the plans said trump made no improvements to the land so the value likely stayed the same what he paid was its value that s what i would expect he said miller added that he billed the trump organization a seven figure sum for his work on the land as well as his work on trump national golf club westchester in briarcliff manor new york trump s company paid him all but 140 000 and after fighting for several months to get the balance miller said he finally accepted trump s personal offer of a discounted membership at the briarcliff manor club in lieu of payment it was either accept it or go to court miller said the trump organization didn t respond to emails and phone calls seeking comments about any aspect of the park deal once trump decided to donate the lands his aides worked hard to maximize their value apparently trump wanted a bigger write off than what the county said the land was worth henry decotis then the assistant state attorney general said trump fixer michael cohen called him in 2005 to inquire about donating lands to the state decotis said the official fair market value of 5 5 million might be in the ballpark a spokeswoman for cohen s lawyer lanny davis declined to comment and declined to arrange an interview with cohen who is serving time in otisville prison in new york for lying to congress about trump s business and campaign dealings by early 2006 hal goldman who until 2011 was a trump organization vice president for development said that he was in talks with the new york state department of parks recreation and historic preservation about donating the land and branding it trump the person familiar with the donation said he received a call from a trump organization employee whose name he couldn t remember asking for a zoning opinion that would justify a 27 5 million value for the land the person said he told the trump organization that that figure could not be justified trump s donation nevertheless was finalized and in april 2006 republican governor george pataki held a ceremony at the park to announce the gift and naming with trump saying in an official statement issued by the governor s office that this is my way of trying to give back and that he hoped the lands will turn into one of the most beautiful parks anywhere in the world the internal revenue service requires filers claiming a charitable deduction worth more than 5 000 to attach to their returns a qualified appraisal of the contribution goldman said he was unaware of trump having conducted any independent appraisal of the parcels of land let me put it this way goldman said would you go out and get an appraisal or would you declare what you wanted it to be worth and then have someone justify it i think that s your answer he said michael grace a former town attorney for yorktown new york where some of the land sits said the tracts might not have been worth even the 2 75 million trump paid for it there s a reason they remained undeveloped grace said noting the land s hills mud and rocks in 2016 the trump campaign released to the associated press and the post a 93 page list of his charitable contributions listing land donated to ny office of parks yorktown n y 436 acres at 26 100 000 00 the only way to know if trump actually claimed a deduction of 26 1 million would be if congressional committees get his federal tax returns they have subpoenaed from the treasury department bernadette castro the former parks commissioner who oversaw the donation and attended the ceremony said through a spokesman john rice that she does not recall the exact appraisal process castro appeared on trump s television show the apprentice in 2005 and was fired by the future president dan keefe a spokesman for the state parks department said the donation happened a long time ago and declined to state whether the agency had done its own appraisal former putnam county clerk dennis sant referred bloomberg to the documents involved in the sale and subsequent donation white house spokesman hogan gidley declined repeated requests for comment fred koelsch the director of realty investments at camarda realty investments said that if trump took a 26 1 million deduction for the donation that s an awfully large number koelsch who did some work for the trump organization while at his former law firm shamberg marwell hollis andreycak laidlaw pc explained that because both trump and u s home had failed to develop the lands they had neither increased in value nor held much extra value on top of their purchase price this is back of the napkin math but the deduction should have been low still koelsch said it s very difficult to put value on undeveloped land as such said we have the seller tell us what they think it s worth contact us at editors time com
