in iraq i learned there are two types of courage physical courage and moral courage moral courage was often the hardest to find the ability for our service members to summon moral courage when it counts is why most of the world sees america as the good guys since taking office president donald trump has pardoned men who have failed to live up to the standards to which we hold our service members he has pardoned men who have been convicted of posing with enemy corpses failing to render aid to injured enemy combatants second degree murder attempted murder wrongfully communicating a threat reckless endangerment soliciting a false statement and obstructing justice he has interfered in another pending court martial murder trial when our president says the laws of war don t matter he is sanctioning war crimes he s telling the people who fight and kill on your behalf that it is ok to torture our enemies mutilate their corpses and kill combatants without due process he s saying he knows better than the honorable people who formed the juries that decided these convictions and he undermines the entire uniformed code of military justice the laws that the people who volunteer to serve in the military agree to follow make no mistake on the battlefield the u s military does not fight fair we have access to tools that are unavailable to the enemy we place these tools and technology into the hands of the world s best trained warfighters they use them to outmaneuver outnumber overwhelm and kill our opponents on the ground but when we place these tools into our service members hands we re not just telling them we trust they will accomplish the mission we re telling them we trust them to do it while upholding our nation s principles when the commander in chief says that any single law of war does not matter what he s really saying is that none do aside from giving the seals and other members of our military a green light to misbehave the president is handing our enemies a propaganda victory one of the reasons we prosecute war crimes is so we can deny our enemy the ability to recruit people to their causes our enemies also use our moral failures to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the world there s a reason for example that isis puts its prisoners in orange jumpsuits it s to remind the people especially people who might join isis that americans abused tortured prisoners at abu ghraib our allies judge our actions too countries around the world host american troops because they know our troops will stick to a strict code of justice when they misbehave there is a chance that america can lose important strategic footholds in the world for example in 1995 after two american marines and a sailor raped a 12 year old girl in okinawa our outraged allies demanded the closure of one of our most strategically important marine bases the relationship today is still fragile the uniformed code of military justice exists to hold accountable the small fraction of service members who failed to find the moral courage to serve honorably the president believes his pardon can buy the votes of millions of veterans who unlike him volunteered to go to war he fails to realize that nothing is more insulting to the american heroes who serve in the military than cheapening their sacrifices by giving war criminals an equal standing by pardoning men who have been convicted of war crimes and those who violated the lawful orders of their officers the commander in chief undermines the chain of command from the very top that s why it is also hypocritical that the secretary of defense mark esper justified the political firing of the secretary of the navy by saying he broke the chain of command it shows that esper and the president are incapable of comprehending the consequences of their own actions and do not understand the foundational principles of the military that allow it to function if president trump truly respected those who serve if he wanted to deny our enemies propaganda victories if he wanted to strengthen our alliances he wouldn t reward the small fraction of service members who misbehave he wouldn t abandon our values or our allies he d lead by the motto that general jim mattis under whom i served instilled within us every day there s no better friend and no worse enemy than the united states of america the president should hold service members to higher standards and demand that they be better than our enemies contact us at editors time com
