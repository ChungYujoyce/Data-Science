in concord n h on tuesday new hampshire has served to reinforce or reset the democratic primary race over the past five decades updated at 12 49 p m et democrats are going to try again after the iowa results meltdown new hampshire takes center stage tuesday night this election is run by the secretary of state s office and not the state party it s also a more straightforward primary with a couple kinks we explain below rather than a complicated math heavy caucus there is lots at stake as new hampshire has served to reinforce or reset the democratic primary race over the past five decades as always be ready for surprises especially because through the years a third to half of voters have made up their minds in the last week here are some key questions things to watch and the stakes for the candidates is new hampshire a swing state first let s set the table yes in a general election new hampshire is very competitive it went democratic in the 2016 election but it was the closest of all states by raw vote just 2 700 votes separated hillary clinton and donald trump and trump s team is closely watching and targeting it in 2020 sen bernie sanders stops by the coffee coffee roasters shop in salem n h on monday joe raedle getty images hide caption sen bernie sanders stops by the coffee coffee roasters shop in salem n h on monday why is new hampshire first this question comes up repeatedly because like iowa new hampshire is not a diverse state it too is more than 90 white in 2016 93 of new hampshire democratic primary voters were white it has been first for a very long time 100 years this year actually then about 50 years ago new hampshire passed a law requiring it be first and gave sole power to the secretary of state to set the primary date bill gardner is that secretary of state he has been in the job about as long as the law has been on the books and has fought against efforts democratic and republican to move it when is the new hampshire primary polls open at 8 a m et and close in most places at 7 p m et but there are 221 towns in new hampshire and they all set their own times some scarcely populated towns famously begin voting at midnight to gain attention but all polls will be closed by 8 p m et when will we see results we will start seeing results after 7 p m et for most places but there will be no calls from the news networks or the associated press which npr relies on for calls until at least 8 p m et at that point expect the republican primary yes there is one to be called for president trump sen elizabeth warren hosts a rally

know who wins this is always tricky because um iowa the state predicts we might know around 9 30 p m et but stay loose on that one check npr s new hampshire live blog throughout the day for updated live results also because this is a delegate race check out our new delegate tracker to see how many delegates are allocated to each candidate and where the race stands now speaking of delegates how many are at stake twenty four pledged delegates there are nine more automatic delegates which used to be superdelegates but they matter less this year because they can t vote on first ballot at the democratic national convention unless there s an overwhelming majority for one candidate sixteen of the delegates are allocated proportionally by congressional district there are two of them another eight are allocated by statewide vote five at large three pledged leaders and elected officials those odd numbers will be important going forward in states to come because the overall winner essentially gets the extra delegate that represents just 1 of the total number of delegates available after new hampshire just 2 of total delegates will be allocated including iowa a candidate needs 1 991 delegates to win the nomination so there s a long way to go are there thresholds for getting delegates like there were in iowa yes like iowa there s a 15 to win any delegates that s true in every democratic primary and caucus the difference in new hampshire is there is no re sorting in a second round you vote it s done you get 15 you get delegates you don t well you don t sen amy klobuchar

h on monday she has been climbing in the polls in the past week how many people actually vote the record for turnout in the democratic presidential primary in new hampshire is about 288 000 that was set in 2008 in the race between barack obama and hillary clinton the second highest turnout was in 2016 between clinton and vermont sen bernie sanders about 251 000 new hampshire is known for high voter participation in the 2016 general election it was actually the third highest turnout state behind minnesota and maine how does voting work it s a primary so voters head to the polls like they would in a general election it s semi open meaning independents can participate about 40 of the state are independents and given that there is no competitive gop primary happening one might expect to see a higher percentage of independents turn out on the democratic side than in 2016 in 2016 independents made up 40 of the electorate according to the exit polls but there were competitive primaries on both sides in 2008 it was 44 but in 2004 the last time there was a competitive democratic primary with an incumbent republican president up for reelection 48 of the electorate was independents don t confuse independents with moderates though sanders who won the 2016 primary by more than 20 points won three quarters of independents he won a slightly lower percentage of self described moderates

former vice president joe biden takes photos with supporters during a campaign event at st george greek orthodox cathedral in manchester n h on monday aside from independents which other voters are important to watch the shape of the electorate is very important and will get more important as the race winnows and support solidifies the more liberal the electorate the better it is for sanders and the democratic electorate in new hampshire has grown increasingly liberal in 2004 just 46 who turned out identified as liberal in 2008 that jumped to 56 as obama turned out lots of young and new voters but in 2016 more than two thirds 68 of the new hampshire democratic electorate was liberal if that trend holds that s good for sanders young voters under 30 made up about a fifth in 2016 and they broke overwhelmingly for sanders the percentage of young voters in 2016 19 was actually higher than in 2008 18 when obama ran sanders needs that trend to continue as he wins big margins with young voters the more white and the more people there are with college degrees voting the better for former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg he finished with the delegate lead over sanders in iowa and he hopes to do well again in new hampshire with it being 93 white in 2016 and 60 with college degrees that lines up for buttigieg older voters were roughly a fifth that number probably needs to be higher to help former vice president joe biden whose support is declining in the state and there s no guarantee he even wins them now he won the highest percentage of voters 65 and older in iowa but minnesota sen amy klobuchar and buttigieg won significant shares too former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg arrives onstage at hampshire hills athletic club on monday in milford n h win mcnamee getty images hide caption former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg arrives onstage at hampshire hills athletic club on monday in milford n h who s ahead in the polls there have been four poll leaders in new hampshire during this race but sanders is now the favorite he leads by 7 points in an average of the polls over buttigieg who has surged since iowa but this is new hampshire where things can change quickly and a third or more tend to say they made up their mind in the last week remember obama had an 8 point lead in the polls over clinton in 2008 and lost the primary by less than 3 points so be prepared for anything to happen what s at stake for the candidates everything here are some things in particular to look for 1 can sanders expand his base sanders was promising high turnout in iowa but it didn t happen turnout was more on pace with 2016 than 2008 that s not exactly a groundswell of support and an overwhelming movement but new hampshire is take 2 for sanders and the rest can they show they have fired up democrats enough to take on trump this year sanders did well in urban areas and college towns he needs to show he can reach beyond that the democratic party doesn t need help winning in those places still a win would be a win and sanders would be in the pole position for the nomination if he takes the state especially considering that moderates and establishment democrats don t appear to be coalescing around anyone any time soon 2 for buttigieg new hampshire is nice but again new hampshire is a very white state and buttigieg has struggled in polling with voters of color he needs to perform well in new hampshire but then the real test comes when the race moves to nevada and south carolina which have much more diverse electorates 3 who finishes third this might be the biggest and most important question of the night biden is fading fast he has been hoping that south carolina and his support with african american voters would be his firewall in fact he s heading to south carolina tuesday night instead of staying in new hampshire but south carolina is weeks away and there may be evidence he s already declining with african americans a quinnipiac poll out monday showed former new york mayor michael bloomberg who has now spent more than 350 million on ads eating into biden s support with black voters can biden really survive a fifth place showing in new hampshire meanwhile massachusetts sen elizabeth warren who finished third in iowa needs to be able show she can beat sanders and buttigieg the two candidates most eating into her support she polls second with progressives to sanders and second with college educated whites to buttigieg new hampshire is an opportunity for her to show she s right in the mix with them and deserves another shot when the electorate gets more diverse but if she doesn t perform well 4 how far can klobuchar go she has seen a sharp spike since coming close to biden in iowa and after her strong debate performance in new hampshire friday she s actually now polling third slightly ahead of warren and biden if she were to take third wow moderates not thrilled how biden has held up and think buttigieg is too young and inexperienced are looking around and klobuchar has a good case to make she s 59 been a productive senator and won reelection by a lot in a midwestern state trump came close in but is it too little too late she needs the donations to pour in if she s going to have a shot and that starts with a surprising finish in new hampshire ahead of some of the field s heavyweights 5 how long do lower performing candidates continue on wealthy venture capitalist tom steyer has the personal resources to go as long as he wants but he has seen little payoff in the results he s making a serious push in south carolina but no polling so far indicates he can win the state that effort might wind up wounding biden more than any other candidate as he s making inroads with black leaders and voters andrew yang has a deep well of support but it s not very wide he wound up with fewer than 2 000 votes in iowa out of 170 000 yang is a serious person with a serious message but if he finishes in single digits again in new hampshire he and his supporters have to ask themselves why he s running is it to make a point or is it to win and if it s to make a point for how long and will his supporters wholeheartedly get behind whoever winds up becoming the democratic nominee a previous version of this story incorrectly said new hampshire had the second highest
