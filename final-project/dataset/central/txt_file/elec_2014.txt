washington as a 2020 presidential candidate jay inslee says he wants tobring hope and confidence to the climate change fight to save a dying planet but on the debate stage next week his aim is a bit more modest get more people to recognize his face in a field of more than 20 candidates the washington governor acknowledges it s been tough to break through noting a third or less of the voters could pick me out of a lineup so as candidates like former vice presidentjoe biden and sen elizabeth warren look to solidify their place among top polling candidates lower polling candidatesfind themselves in search of a signature moment that will lodge their names into voters brains around the country a zinger an out of the box idea a line of attack on a fellow candidate as the clock ticks the pressure to make a splash is intensifying the debates on july 30 and 31 may be the last time several candidates have a chance to make thecase for their presidencybefore higher debate qualifying standards kick in i m hopeful that after this debate a whole bunch of these folks will be forced to see the writing on the wall and end their campaigns said jim manley a democratic strategist who worked for former senate minority leader harry reid he s not alone many experts believe the massive pool of 25 democratic candidates will shrink in the immediate aftermath of the debate but they say there are ways for candidates to try and distinguish themselves during these pivotal events and build off momentum after the eyes of the nation are on them more 5 decades separate 2020 s presidential candidates here s what that looks like on the campaign trail inslee wastes no time bringing up the one issue his campaign has revolved around climate change but he s routinely pollingno higher than 1 and admitshe needs a breakout moment on his signature issue to build momentum i didn t look at this race like playing the odds i want the odds to be 100 percent that humanity is going survive that s the odds i m interested in he said at an event earlier this month in portland it s not daunting to me that there s a bunch of candidates when you re mission driven those odds don t matter to you experts say at the heart of inslee s campaign plan is hope to differentiate himself on a specific issue which can be effective or can backfire democratic debate no 2 what you need to know 2020 presidential election cnn to host climate change town hall with democraticcandidates robert shrum a longtime democratic strategist said in this case itisn t working insleeisrunning solely on climate change but almost every democrat on that stage fundamentally agrees with him shrum said so it s not necessarily a distinguishing argument shrum said new york sen kirsten gillibrand is doing something similar when it comes to addressing women s issues sexual assault and sexual harassment issues gillibrand has been outspoken on throughout her career but haven t stood in opposition to her democratic counterparts i don t think that if you just focus on women s rights or the environment that you re necessarily going to set yourself apart in a way that s really needed at this point he added issueshavebroken through as a success insen elizabeth warren s campaign the massachusetts senator has rolled out policies and plans on a slew of topics giving voters a clear vision of her progressive ideas a large part of this could be due her focus on the middle class and the wealthy which are broad topics and overlapwith most issues she hasn t been pigeonholed into one set issue or category said kelly winfrey a professor at iowa state university who focuses on political campaigns winfrey said warren also came into the race with more name recognition than many candidates and her policies as a whole have given her a persona in the race as the most prepared candidate the plans that she has released which while they all seem to go back to economic equality they cover different issues and have helped her branch out she said i mean climate change doesn t give you the latitude to tie into a lot of issues but if you target equal pay it does but there are other tactics to sticking out in this crowded field attacking another candidate or having that one memorable line that sticks with voters the latter becoming harder on crowded debate stages with 10 candidates fighting for air time going aftera fellow candidate has been markedly helpfulto changing the dynamicof the race for one candidate sen kamala harris in the first debate the california democrat zeroed in onbiden in a now infamous exchange where she challengedhis comments about working with segregationists in the u s senate and his stance on federally mandated busing to desegregate public schools the exchange on busing was particularly powerful with harris noting how the issuepersonally affected her as a child that little girl is me kamala harris attacks biden with personal story about race harris took advantage of the moment as soon as the debate ended selling merchandise with a photo of herself as a child on it she soon after enjoyed a significant bump in several national polls the move didn t target just biden it took on the issue of race a central issue thus far in the 2020 race and illustrated to voters how harris may take on trump which is the primary characteristic voters will be looking for said democratic strategist kristen hawn that s what these debates are really about in a way it s an audition hawn said she looked like a fighter she looked strong which as a woman it s hard for us to come across as strong with also being likable which is a sad truth but she came off very well but attacking a fellow candidate also can fall flat or backfire rep eric swalwell tried to paint biden as too old to be president in the first debate the california democrat quoted biden as saying 32 years ago that it was time to pass the torch to the younger generation related eric swalwell calls on joe biden to pass the torch during democratic debates while the moment gained some social media buzz it didn t substantially help swalwell s already struggling campaign within two weeks he was the first democrat to dropout of the race as the democratic field begins the inevitable shrink this debate takes on a particular sense of urgency for those candidates languishing at the bottom of polls it will be the last time candidates have the attention of the nation until the september debates where it will be harder for candidates to qualify for the stage the dnc doubled the qualifications candidates need to hit for those debates in the first two debates candidates needed to poll at 1 or have 65 000 unique donors in the third debate in september candidates will need to be polling at 2 or have 130 000 unique donors i would expect handful at least to drop out after this winfrey said she said this debate will be an opportunity for those polling low to really try to connect with voters because as the race progresses it becomes only gets more difficult this could likely be their last shot to become competitive this is it she said ifthey don t have a break out moment in this debate it means it will be fairly likely they won t have the momentum to stay in the race but if this round is like the last it could mark another missed opportunity for longshot candidates winfrey added most of those candidates polling toward the bottom of the pool are saying what everyone else is saying she said they simply haven t made the case for the white house manley the democratic strategist saidin realityit will all come down to one thing money and as time goes on fundraising will dry up for some candidates and enthusiasm will be harder to sustain i m sure there will be some who will stay in this hoping for some momentum but they won t be able to without fundraising if there s no more money it s over he said money is the mother of politics more yuge bernie sanders outraised by newcomer pete buttigieg but donald trump crushes
