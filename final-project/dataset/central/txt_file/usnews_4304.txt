congress is in a perilous place with the coronavirus pandemic and appears unable to do anything serious about it to meet in the capitol to debate and vote is dangerous there is a combustible combination of difficulty and risk in traveling long distances especially by air the particular vulnerability of older members who make up a large share of the house and senate andthe reality of members and staff in close quarters the danger is not just to them but to their families and all who come into contact with them the alternative as of now is topull together the constitutionally required quorum of half the members butthat may not be possible which would leaveamerica without a congress just when it is most urgently needed the congressional physician recentlywarned leaders of the danger of meeting house majority leader steny hoyer took his strong advice and kept the house shuttered while senate majority leader mitch mcconnell determined to jam through more right wing judges ignored the physician and brought the senate back physically despite the clear health risksand the objections of many of his colleagues the house earlier seemed ready to allow a form of remote voting by proxy on the floor and remote meetings including oversight by committees but house speaker nancy pelosi delayed the vote in the face ofvehement objections by republican leader kevin mccarthy pelosi then created a bipartisan working group to find consensus which mccarthy quickly demolished he madeclear in a statement and an op ed that he and republican leaders would oppose both any remote voting or meeting of the whole house and any remote formal hearings by committees of course there are legitimate questions that need answers about the best ways to meet and vote securely using the best available hardware and software for members and staff with appropriate transparency and protection of the rights of the minority party and rank and file members and the divisions over remote meeting and voting are not entirely partisan in the senate the prime vehicle to authorizeemergency procedures like remote votingis co sponsored by republican rob portman of ohio and democrat dick durbin of illinois no checks no balances oversight erased supreme court hijacked trump turns the presidency into a dictatorship in the house the bipartisan problem solvers caucus is conducting its own informal floor debate remotely to show it is workable but there is a clear divide at the top democratic leaders in both houses want to find a way to ensure congress can do its job republican leaders do not why nick confessore s stunning story in the new york times about the ineptitude and corruption of the jared kushner task force sheds some light on the motives here it depictsa group of incompetents with no knowledge of viruses or supply chains instructed to give a green light to friends and supporters of the president over credible and reliable sources resulting in disruption of supply of critical protective equipment and at least one state new york bilked out of tens of millions of dollars oversight hearings in the democratic led house would dig more deeply into thisshocking behavior trump himself hasblocked house testimony by coronavirus expert dr anthony fauci and fired inspectors generaland other officials including immunologist rick bright adepartment of health and human services whistleblowerwho had pointed outmisconduct in the hhs responseto covid 19 heisdoing whatever he can to stymie any independent examination of his team s actions with help fromhis allies in congress trump s coronavirus hypocrisy from masks to mail voting he s special and we re not mccarthy and other gop leaders opposed aspecial panel set up by majority democrats to look intothe trump administration response to the pandemic the members finally named to it led by reps steve scalise and jim jordan have made it obvious they will totry to block any real investigation into malfeasance and corruption if the house can t operate remotely trump will havea freer hand to act by fiat if it can house members could have a real debate on the challenges we face andrespond to urgent needs in a meaningful way and not least it could conductrobust oversight of failures in testing vaccine development supplies of protective gear and medical devices and the administration of trillions in relief and in some fashion check a president who believes his powers under article ii of the constitution are absolute but thiswill not serve trump s purposes his see no evil hear no evil speak no evil allies in congress agree no wonder they oppose any means for congress to operate during a pandemic that has killed over 82 000 americans and put 33 million out of work so far god forbid the house investigate what s gone wrong help us get out from under this crisis and put some limits on this administration norman ornstein a resident scholar at the american enterprise institute isco author of one nation after trump and it s even worse than it looks how the american constitutional system collided with the new politics of extremism follow him on twitter normornstein
