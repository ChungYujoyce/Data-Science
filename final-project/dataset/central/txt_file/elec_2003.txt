on thursday former vice president joe biden formally joined the crowded democratic presidential contest realclearpolitics the left is divided with some arguing that biden is the best chance to beat trump and others critical of his messaging strategy biden joins a cast that includes six senators five other past or present members of the house and five people who are or have been mayors or governors plus two folks who have never been elected to anything and are safe to ignore unless one of them saves a drowning puppy no wonder biden is leading in the polls potential campaign theme vote for joe you can already spell his name gail collins new york times as democrats assess the dizzying array of 20 candidates the first question they should ask is whether a nominee could gain a strong majority in the general election and defeat trump biden would be far from an ideal president let alone a democratic candidate maybe in one of those blessed miracles of american democracy that produced our greatest presidents someone else will emerge who s younger smarter more representative of a diverse electorate but right now biden looks most like the person who could beat trump and that s job one david ignatius washington post a lot of the attacks on biden are from an electoral angle silly going after biden for his lack of liberal wokeness for example seems destined to fail given that the polling shows that democrats want the party to move in a more moderate direction biden s age is more likely to derail his candidacy the fact that biden is called sleepy joe by trump and is known to make gaffes may open the age question more than polling indicates right now harry enten cnn meanwhile critics assert that while most democrats like barack obama personally the party has lurched left since he left office and many of its activists now take a dim view of policies that democrats once deemed mainstream thus if biden had entered the presidential race with a standard biographical video describing his many accomplishments in public life he would have immediately prompted a debate about all the positions he once took on crime financial deregulation anita hill and the iraq war that democrats now scorn biden evades that problem in his announcement video but at a cost he bathes the past in a warm glow without defending it substantively and in so doing he offers a deeply unconvincing historical narrative in which trump lands upon the american political scene from outer space peter beinart the atlantic there s plenty of reasonable debate over whether democratic candidates should focus on trump in mounting their arguments or if they should focus on what they want to do for voters i suspect this is a bit of a false choice as what we need is a little bit of both but if we re going to talk about donald trump i think we need to acknowledge that he wasn t created in a vacuum our systemic racism and sexism coupled with our economic insecurities built a world in which trump could come to power biden s announcement seems premised on the idea that we need to revert to the world we had before trump rather than dramatically rethink the world that produced him dara kass slate minority view biden s presidential announcement video did something urgently needed in the 2020 race put president donald trump s history of hate front and center by doing so biden acknowledged the pain the real pain that so many marginalized communities have felt since 2015 we deeply feel the impact of trump s attacks and we want to know that the 2020 democratic candidates understand that and are willing to respond accordingly dean obeidallah cnn the right welcomes biden as a moderate alternative to other democratic candidates but wonders if he is progressive enough for primary voters the right welcomes biden as a moderate alternative to other democratic candidates but wonders if he is progressive enough for primary voters former vice president joe biden s entrance into the 2020 presidential election will provide democrats a choice do they want a reset or do they want a revolution as democrats have spent the past several months outlining the sweeping changes they want to make to the united states more than anything biden s candidacy represents a promise to go back to a pre trump era in american politics biden has consistently led in polls it s of course possible his numbers will collapse as he undergoes more rigorous scrutiny and as his name recognition advantage erodes as voters get to know the other candidates better yet it s also possible that a critical mass of the democratic electorate is more moderate both ideologically and temperamentally than it would seem from the online conversation in that case biden has a good chance of taking the nomination philip klein washington examiner is the democratic party still the party of barack obama a curious thing happens to democrats after they leave the presidency the shine seems to dull from their pennies quite quickly while republicans still revere ronald reagan decades after his administration bill clinton is viewed by many on the left with scorn this is not merely a result of his sexual peccadillos but also a function of how fast the democratic party changes by the standards of his time in office it would be wrong to call obama a moderate he did after all run to the left of hillary clinton in 2008 but by today s standards it would be wrong not to call him a moderate the question is does obama still represent hope and change for the democratic party or like bill clinton will his moderation be held against him for biden that question will determine the success of his campaign for the democratic party that question will determine their very identity david marcus the federalist obama was a history making candidate allowing voters to be aspirational about their country and themselves by voting for him and biden isn t biden is the white guy who got in trouble for calling obama clean and articulate biden s candidacy is an attempt by democrats to bargain with trump s america other candidates are promising to cleanse america from what democrats see as the disgrace or even the sacrilege of trump s presidency democrats don t want to bargain with the devil they want an exorcist michael brendan dougherty national review there are structural elements facing biden on the path to the nomination too particularly the delegates that can be won in caucuses instead of primaries where activists have much greater power it s those caucuses that obama used effectively to defeat hillary clinton in 2008 biden will likely perform well in the big states but he will need an effective caucus organization to have a chance of winning the nomination with so many credible and not so credible candidates we may be headed for a democratic convention with no winner on the first ballot mark penn fox news it is pretty telling that a seventy six year old who d be 78 if elected is going to have to swoop in to save the democrats from themselves and also that he may not be able to do it because he is too moderate for the base biden could give donald trump a real run for his money they both understand and connect with blue collar workers who feel left behind but donald trump can play it right in that these workers fled obama to trump biden wants them to come back
