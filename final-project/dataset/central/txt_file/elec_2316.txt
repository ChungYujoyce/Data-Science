old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more and the gop are playing for high stakes intuesday sspecial election in pennsylvania a loss in a district trump carried by 20 points in 2016 would amplify republican anxiety about november s midterm elections and sharpen questions about the damage the president s low approval ratings are doing to the party the mere fact that the race is close in a district that should be such favorable territory for the gop is an ominous sign according to strategists from both parties for trump this would be bad news if the republican wins a close race and it will be terrible news if the democrat wins said democratic strategist robert shrum gop strategist dan judy said that the closeness of the race underlines the conventional wisdom which is correct that this is a tough environment for republicans and especially when the president is unpopular that gives us significant headwinds money has poured into the race with nbc news

poll put democrat conor lamb up by the same margin seeking to give saccone a boost trump traveled to pennsylvania on saturday and held a campaign rally outside of pittsburgh i came tonight because this guy is special trump told the crowd the president also branded the democrat lamb the sham alleging that he was trying to act like a republican in a race where turnout could prove decisive trump s rally could help energize republican voters but democrats insist his appearance could also drive their voters to the polls trump s visit is a double edged sword in the district because it will fire

had a sexual liaison with the president in 2006 trump s personal lawyer michael cohen made a 130 000 payment to daniels shortly before the 2016 presidential election apparently to keep her quiet though cohen denies trump was involved in negotiating that deal on more sober policy issues the president s taste for unorthodox choices remains intact against the wishes of his own party trump confirmed last week that he would enact tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum that decision could benefit saccone in pennsylvania where the steel industry has deep roots your steel is coming back

of sundayevening that is the context that makes the race in pennsylvania so keenly watched and why democrats are so enthused the most important outcome from this race will be the perception nevins said a perception that democrats can win in districts that are r 20 where trump won by 20 points will further energize democrats for the midterms trump himself seems fully aware of what s at stake the
