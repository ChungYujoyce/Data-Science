surge of kindness among strangers in times of great stress helping others is a powerful way to reassert control in a moment where many of us feel helpless says jamil zaki author of the war for kindness building empathy in a fractured world kindness toward others actually can be a great source of healing this video will warm your heart how one boston housing community is staying connected while practicing socialdistancing 1 24 min for a dancing toddler pic twitter com proyp9t3y5 one of the most common ways that millions of people are being kind to others right now is by practicing the self sacrifice of social distancing for many the key motivation is that they want to protect others there are precedents for that impulse says jill suttie a psychologist at the greater good science center at the university of california berkeley a study demonstrated the most effective way for hospitals to motivate health care professionals to wash their hands isn t by noting the importance of safeguarding oneself from disease it s stressing the impact it has on protecting patients to be sure not everyone is acting altruistically at the moment fights have broken out in supermarkets as people wrestle for the last remaining item on a shelf some are hoarding hand sanitizer face masks and toilet paper many individuals ignored widespread pleas to practice social distancing this weekend by gathering at bars restaurants clubs and music venues in response governors in several states including massachusetts and ohio shut down restaurants and bars except for delivery and takeout and canceled all concerts even so instances of selflessness have become increasingly common in longmont colorado the roost restaurant and pub has offered free meals to families whose children would have relied on the closed schools to provide them with lunches professional basketball players such as giannis antetokounmpo zion williamson and blake griffin have donated money to cover the salaries of arena workers affected by the suspension of the season and when jordana shmidman s bat mitzvah was canceled due to the coronavirus parents volunteered to deliver 150 boxes of the catered food to quarantined families across several boroughs in new york witnessing acts of kindness inspires others to pay it forward says mr zaki a psychologist at stanford university in california in 2016 he published an article in scientific american kindness contagion that included findings of studies about how people catch cooperation and generosity from others this deep seated desire to help and connect with others intensifies during times of crisis and it crosses lanes of class race and other divisions that typically keep people apart case in point when germans began retreating behind closed doors last week molly wilson realized she didn t know any of the elderly people in her berlin neighborhood ms wilson an american who moved to germany in 2016 teamed up with an upstairs neighbor to post flyers on mailboxes and trash cans on their street their notes offered to go shopping on behalf of those who felt unable to go outside my husband and i are both on parental leave so one of us can absolutely go and get some noodles and beans for somebody who lives a couple streets over says ms wilson she also posted her note on twitter to inspire others we need to do something off line in order to let old people know that it s ok to reach out for help when in person interaction is limited technology can temporarily mendrips in the social fabric good samaritans are using social media platforms to post offers to help strangers for example jerry xu a tech professional in san francisco used the app nextdoor to volunteer his services free to join nextdoor connects members to others in their geographic locale we can help people use apps websites to get goods we can help delivery with our vehicles we can even help with medical emergencies mr xu wrote in an email response to the monitor to marc dunkelman author of the vanishing neighbor these neighborly responses to the coronavirus crisis are notable in their contrast to normal times most people s acquaintances resemble a model like the rings of saturn with the innermost bands representing the most intimate connections and each successive loop becoming less intimate over the past 50 years people have invested more time on the innermost ring of friends and family people have also invested more time in the outermost rings with online acquaintances they don t know personally but with whom they share common interests such as sports hobbies or politics people have largely abandoned those rings in the middle says mr dunkelman a research fellow at brown university s a alfred taubman center for public policy and american institutions those are the face to face rings of contacts such as neighbors and once popular associations such as bowling leagues boy scouts or rotary clubs yet the coronavirus striking close to home offers up the opportunity for greater local connection could it be that in the context of this crisis people do break through that initial barrier and say to one another even though they re not supposed to be accosting one another or having real intimacy hello you know i live in apartment 2b you must live above me says mr dunkelman for his part mr dunkelman maintains a listserv of nearby neighbors and they re using it to stay in contact and assist each other some have gone further in massachusetts mutual aid medford and somerville mamas has created a shareable public google document to connect those with specific skill sets to those in need in addition to sharing links to helpful resources during the coronavirus it organizes neighborhood pods of hyperlocal text message groups or phone trees since not everyone has access to online communication other areas have used the document s guide on how to replicate it in the u k the burgeoning covid 19 mutual aid uk network is up to 87 groups and counting the crisis will necessarily alter the way we connect socially during the crisis what matters most is how we interact with others says ms suttie of greater good pointing to two major research papers on how emotions are contagious within social circles including online associations they found that it spreads within three degrees says ms suttie who recommends trying to calm each other to the extent that we can and not raise panic because that helps all of us to be a bit calmer and to see things more clearly at the jamaica plain cohousing neighborhood in boston ms sanchez is going to institute more sing a longs on sunday they reconvened to sing the bill withers song lovely day on monday they sang with a little help from my friends by the beatles and danced to gloria
