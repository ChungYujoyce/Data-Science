one month ago as covid 19 spread across the county and critical personal protective equipment like masks gloves surgical gowns and face shields continued to be in short supply i had hoped the government would do its job and act to meet this demand but when news outlets reported that medical workers were being left vulnerable to infection without ppe it was clear we couldn t wait for the trump administration any longer a small group of volunteers came together to found masks for americaand teamed up with leading health care activist ady barkan s be a hero fund social security works and national nurses unitedto get our front line heroes the equipment they needed to stay safe as they saved lives as the federal government failed to provide essential equipment our small group of volunteers has successfully delivered nearly 200 000 fda certified cdc approved kn95 masks to front line workers in hard hit areas new york city detroit new orleans chicago washington d c and puerto rico in just a matter of weeks but it wasn t easy becausewhen the federal government finally decided to act it wasn t the way we hadexpected instead of helping us they seized some of our ppe shipments without telling us where they were taking them on april 11 during the peak of covid 19 cases and deaths in new york city the federal emergency management agency intervened and demanded orders of medical equipment allocated to our relief efforts be redirected to the federal government fema then seized 50 000 n95 respirators we had ordered without giving us an explanation or telling us where those respirators were going in my 15 years of working in the manufacturing industry with international and domestic supply chains i have never never had the federal government interfere like this it wasn t long before i realized it wasn t only happening in new yorkand new jersey fema confiscated san francisco s ppe order as it went through customs even as the trump administration told states and cities to procure their own equipment rather than rely on the federal government since those reports of fema quietly seizing materials at least six states have lodged similar complaints against the federal government interfering with their supply chains over 100 health leaders to governors require masks to help contain covid 19 it is not illegal for the government to seize and distribute medical shipments through the defense production act yet our government has failed to be transparent with the public about how and why it is redistributing the resources of cities statesand private organizations like ours the struggle to secure ppe and medical supplies isn t just a failure of leadership in our governmentbut also an unsustainable supply chain issue that has been bubbling just under the surface for years over the past two decades i ve fought as our nation offshored millions of american manufacturing jobs overseas most ppe and other medical equipment is now made in china which has led to increased difficulty for the government to produce and distribute crucial resources during a disaster this in addition to fema s track record of inefficiency and failure to provide adequate disaster relief has led to the government s shortage and is likely why officials aretaking equipment from a small volunteer driven coalition that was able to leverage its resources and know how to do the job they couldn t do hotline share your coronavirus story international production lines are taking weeks to deliver the resources we need to keep people alive if we were manufacturing ppe and medical supplies in the united states it would take mere days to deliver protection to front line essential workers where it s needed reshoring the production of ppe and other essential public health resources permanently could also bring millions of good manufacturing jobs home at a time when more than 36 million americans have filed for unemployment as we approach1 5 million confirmed u s casesof covid 19 and 89 000 deaths with thousands more projected daily it s clearer than ever that we as a nation will need to hold our government accountable for the series of systemic failures that led us to the point of fema seizing ppe from nurses state governments and nonprofit relief efforts without explanation or transparency epidemiologist q a we re just in the second inning of a nine inning game while there is much to learn from this ongoing pandemic one thing is clear for our nation s public health and national security congress must take immediate action to reshore ppe and medical supply production lines back into the united states otherwise we ll continue to be vulnerable doomed to repeat the deadly missteps of this pandemic bob bland is a founder of masks for america a leader of the women s march and a manufacturing and supply chain expert as a founder of manufacture new york follow her on twitter bobblanddesign
