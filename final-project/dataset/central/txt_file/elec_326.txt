other and that makes all the difference loading march 15 2016 it s a cold and gray friday at the pioneer restaurant and the utica coffee club is in session every weekday morning for so long no one can remember a group of friends has been meeting in the back of the pioneer here in rural utica ohio a town described by one member of the group as having one doctor no dentist and a ben franklin store that is closing around the table there s a veterinarian a farmer with 450 cows a guy selling cheese and raffle tickets and even a former member of the clinton administration they re mostly retired and in their 70s but perhaps their most remarkable characteristic is their ability to talk about any political topic from hillary clinton s e mails to donald trump s immigration plans and still be willing to buy breakfast for the rest of the table on their birthday sometimes there are disagreements but they re never serious ones says jack raines a former marine who served in vietnam and later worked for the ohio department of transportation it s a small town we can argue and disagree and then move on after two hours of talking we go home the utica coffee club is at once a norman rockwell portrait of small town america and a picture of how politics as it once was is disappearing as ohio voters go to the polls to vote in the state s primary tuesday it is a poignant reminder that the polarization that currently seems to divide america can sometimes be defused by a plate of eggs and bacon and an affection for the person sitting on the other side of the table no matter what his politics in the past these connections were often made in diners elks clubs or even within more ideologically diverse political parties themselves but today voters are withdrawing into partisan bubbles to the point of actively avoiding those who disagree according to a 2014 pew research center study probably the last people to think of the utica coffee club as revolutionary are the members themselves but in the simplicity of their fellowship is a political truth says kathy cramer a political scientist and director of the morgridge center for public service at the university of wisconsin in madison the people in this coffee club have not only figured out how to get along but they enjoy being with people of diverse opinions she says we don t get great guidance from leadership on how to do that we re taught that people who think differently than us are morally wrong face to face conversation is delightful she adds you can read about something in a blog post and learn a lot but there s something about looking a human in the eye that makes that experience more real and others viewpoints harder to dismiss the men of the club look each other in the eye across the sycamore wood table that they paid a local amish carpenter to build for them a tiffany style lamp hangs overhead a photo of otto teele one of the original members hangs on one wall his baseball cap and gray cardigan meticulously clean a perpetual grin on his face as though still listening in on the conversation this morning it s about hillary phil shipley the farmer with all the cows likes her she s the most stable and experienced i like bernie sanders but his rhetoric and age might work against him it might be hard for him work with congress he says mr shipley served as county commissioner for 16 years his mother was a republican his father a democrat the first time he ran for office he faced his uncle a republican around the table some claim to be democrats others republicans others like terry martin say they re swing voters i vote for the candidate mr martin says in some ways it s a classic midwestern scene professor cramer says she researches the role informal discussion groups play in a vibrant democracy and while she says groups like this are on the decline the midwestern versions are remarkably free from strident party ideology of the groups i ve researched in the midwest in general they re not partisan i haven t come across people who are devout partisans who live and die for their party they pride themselves on voting for the person and not the party she says people expect their office holders to be serious about their jobs to have integrity and to be honest there s a lot of interest in people who are real which is why martin likes a lot of what donald trump is saying though he s not sure mr trump would make good decisions on foreign affairs ohio gov john kasich might be the best qualified he says but he hasn t been good for ohio schools i really just don t know yet tellingly the election is not the most important discussion at the table there are more pressing things like the club rules if it s your birthday you buy breakfast for everyone if you have a financial windfall you buy a round of coffee you must support one another s causes by purchasing raffle tickets and attending events and you better enjoy conversation and debate but not take yourself or the debate too seriously even if the topics are serious mr raines the vietnam veteran is worried about the economy and about what his grandchildren will face in my dad s day if you had a job you had it for life we ve lost a lot of jobs for our own citizens at one time we had five gas stations and a barbershop now we have two gas stations and no barbershops i m concerned about drugs adds jim belt who worked in an owens corning factory that affects everyone there s lots of nodding in agreement someone broke into mr belt s car recently others know of friends or family members who have been affected by the opioid epidemic one man has a family member in rehab i think we worry about the economy here belt adds and so trump is hitting a nerve not because he understands everything but because people are dissatisfied with washington trump s just a big spoon stirring stuff up says bill stout a local tree farmer trump says things that make you cringe but you want to look anyway says charlie veach who works in health care people want to hear what he has to say because they want something different they re tired of the establishment wasting things mr veach worries about illegal immigration education but most especially he s concerned about medical care for veterans he points out that there are three disabled vets in the coffee club vets should be able to get free care wherever they go you serve your country that s what you re owed but i don t know where i m at right now i m so frustrated with the republican party a general anxiety about the future might lead some to vote for trump says cramer the professor i see him tapping into the long burning feeling of i m not getting my fair share that works particularly well in the midwest because of changes in global economy that have led to the loss of manufacturing jobs and viable small farms she adds across the table raines shouts to gene branstool the former assistant secretary of agriculture under bill clintonand a licking county democratic stalwart hey gene you ready to run again stick a fork in me mr branstool answers i m done heck i couldn t even get in now costs too much a waitress comes by and branstool asks her i ordered two eggs didn t i oh didn t i take your plate she asks don t think i ever got one they all laugh get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox when the laughter recedes and people start going on about their day branstool adds it s an interesting group isn t it a minimum of 50 laughs per minute look adds belt we gotta stay friends because sooner or later they re going to buy you
