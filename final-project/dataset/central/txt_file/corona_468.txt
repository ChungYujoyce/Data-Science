from germany to new zealand women are stepping up to show the world how to manage a messy patch for our human family add in finland iceland and denmark and this pandemic is revealing that women have what it takes when the heat rises in our houses of state many will say these are small countries or islands or other exceptions but germany is large and leading and the u k is an island with very different outcomes these leaders are gifting us an attractive alternative way of wielding power what are they teaching us angela merkel the chancellor of germany stood up early and calmly told her countrymen that this was a serious bug that would infect up to 70 of the population it s serious she said take it seriously she did so they did too testing began right from the get go germany jumped right over the phases of denial anger and disingenuousness we ve seen elsewhere the country s numbers are far below its european neighbors and there are signs it may be able to start loosening restrictions relatively soon as of april 12 2020 20 first among the first and the fastest responses was from tsai ing wen in taiwan back in january at the first sign of a new illness she introduced 124 measures to block the spread without having to resort to the lockdowns that have become common elsewhere she is now sending 10 million face masks to the u s and europe tsai managed what cnn has called among the world s best responses keeping the epidemic under control still reporting only six deaths jacinda ardern in new zealand was early to lockdown and crystal clear on the maximum level of

danish prime minister mette frederiksen had held a couple of days earlier solberg held a dedicated press conference where no adults were allowed she responded to kids questions from across the country taking time to explain why it was ok to feel scared the originality and obviousness of the idea takes one s breath away how many other simple humane innovations would more female leadership unleash generally the empathy and care which all of these female leaders have communicated seems to come from an alternate universe than the one we have gotten used to it s like their arms are coming out of their videos to hold you close in a heart felt and loving embrace who knew leaders could sound like this now we do now compare these leaders and stories with the strongmen using the crisis to accelerate a terrifying trifecta of authoritarianism blame others capture the judiciary demonize the journalists and blanket their country in i will never retire darkness trump bolsonaro l pez obrador
