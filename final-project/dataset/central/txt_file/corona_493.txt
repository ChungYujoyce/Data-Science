grappling with as they cover the president s daily briefings which tend to mixvaluable information with inaccurate assertions loading april 2 2020 within the media debate is swirling around whether cable networks should televise president donald trump s daily briefings live they are often long well over an hour and contain a mix of valuable information particularly from the scientists on the white house s coronavirus task force as well as misstatements and grandstanding cnn and msnbc which lean liberal have taken to showing only parts of the briefing cutting away when it is deemed to be off topic on wednesday cnn skipped the first portion when mr trump opened by touting an enhanced counternarcotics operation a decision anchor john king called shameless the network did the same the day before declining to show the president s opening remarks which had highlighted in a notably somber tone projections of between 100 000 and 240 000 deaths from the virus in the united states the network s decision that day seemed a little petty says kelly mcbride chair of the center for ethics and leadership at the poynter institute in st petersburg florida but she understands the hesitation over giving the president unlimited airtime one alternative she suggests would be to summarize the entire press conference and edit it down to key points which statement best describes the daily white house briefings in the age of coronavirus a they are fact based and analytical b they convey questionable or even false information c they are vital to the public interest d they are opportunities for grandstanding or e all of the above the answer is e praise and blame for this daily stew of essential public service and political reality tv sit at the feet of both president donald trump and the reporters asking him questions the ethics here are profound lives are on the line and everyone involved plays an important role the president and his team journalists and ultimately the public which must follow safe practices and figure out fact from fiction editor s note as a public service we ve removed the paywallfor all our coronavirus coverage it s free everybody has a responsibility here says kathleen culver director of the center for journalism ethics at the university of wisconsin madison the fact that president trump is up for reelection with election day just seven months away only adds to the drama within the media debate is swirling around whether cable networks should televise mr trump s briefings live these daily sessions are often long well over an hour and contain a mix of valuable information particularly from the scientists on the white house s coronavirus task force and diversions that can include unproductive exchanges between mr trump and antagonists in the press corps the news that anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert and a member of the task force now needs a security detail reinforces the central role of information in this crisis dr fauci known to correct mr trump at times in public has both fervent admirers and critics and there s no doubt that when dr fauci speaks at briefings people pay attention cnn and msnbc which lean liberal have taken to showing only parts of the briefing live cutting away when it is deemed to be off topic on wednesday cnn skipped the first portion when mr trump opened by touting an enhanced counter narcotics operation a phalanx of military advisers flanking him at the podium some would call the decision to highlight a tangential topic shameless cnn anchor john king said this is a coronavirus task force briefing after the narcotics discussion ended and the actual coronavirus briefing started with the usual cast at mr trump s side including drs fauci and deborah birx cnn showed the briefing live the network did the same the day before declining to show the president s opening remarks then going live with the experts on that day mr trump had highlighted with a notably somber tone projections of between 100 000 and 240 000 deaths from the virus in the united states the decision to skip the president s opening remarks on tuesday seemed a little petty says kelly mcbride chair of the center for ethics and leadership at the poynter institute in st petersburg florida but she understands the hesitation over giving the president unlimited air time and suggests an alternative including transparency with viewers you can summarize the entire press conference and edit it down to key points ms mcbride says you certainly have the prerogative to run the whole thing and if you re going to run a portion of it live you have to tell your audience why you think that portion live is more important than any of the other portions live some media critics have pleaded for tv networks to stop running the president s briefings altogether they are in effect a substitute for the campaign rallies he can no longer hold and contain exaggerations and lies writes margaret sullivan of the washington post examples the president argued that tests for the virus were readily available when they weren t ditto a nationwide website that google would roll out very quickly which it hasn t jack shafer politico s senior media writer has a different take the effort to suppress attention to the briefings reflects a paternalistic mindset toward the public he writes and besides it won t work trump friendly fox news will keep showing the briefings as does c span live streams are all over the web the backstory to mr trump s dealings with the media is crucial to understanding the current state of play more than a year ago the trump white house stopped holding daily press briefings disdain for the press corps was palpable mr trump pivoted instead to chopper talk gaggles with reporters as he headed to marine one for trips out of town or visits with the press corps on air force one these regular interactions reinforced the notion that mr trump sees himself as his own best press secretary going back to his days as a real estate developer who would call reporters under an assumed name to advocate for himself mr trump has long had a love hate relationship with the press he hates being confronted but he loves the attention media bring these conflicting impulses have come to the fore amid the covid 19 crisis and are most evident in the daily press conferences you see a little bit of everything in these briefings says william jacobson a law professor at cornell university and conservative blogger you see straightforward information you see the science you see trump as he describes himself as the cheerleader for the nation professor jacobson says you also see his interaction with the media he agrees mr trump loves the attention but he also sees reporters looking for that sound bite that gotcha moment the president is smart enough to sense it and doesn t want to give it to them mr jacobson says one of mr trump s biggest antagonists is cnn s jim acosta whose white house press credential was revoked temporarily in 2018 after he refused to relinquish the microphone at a press conference at monday s press briefing mr trump called on mr acosta with a here we go the cnn reporter read a series of statements by mr trump going back several weeks that seemed to play down the severity of the looming crisis such as just stay calm it will all go away mr trump insisted all the statements were true then attacked cnn the exchange was highly predictable and didn t elicit any new information it also furthered mr trump s longstanding claim that the media are out to get him i m not sure we need members of the media trying to provoke confrontation when the nation needs calm and information says jeffrey mccall a professor of communication at depauw university in greencastle indiana we don t need reporters seeking a moment to stand out still he says journalists at the briefings are doing a fine job and serving effectively as surrogates for the public the problem is that these become rhetorical slash theatrical events professor mccall says we do see some grandstanding from trump but that s his nature he got elected by being outspoken and by being grandiose ultimately says ms culver the media ethicist at the university of wisconsin it s a critically important time for tv networks to be exercising their editorial judgment and it s a time for journalists to show their mettle in serving the public interest are we as citizens getting what we need from these briefings when they re displayed live she asks as opposed to journalists performing the function they re supposed to perform which is to verify and fact check information before it s shared get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox in the end ms culver notes everyone the president the press the public shares the same goal to act individually and collectively to maximize the survival rate amid the biggest viral threat facing the planet in more than a
