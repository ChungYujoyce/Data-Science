after months of preaching the gospel of civility and unity on the campaign trail former vice president joe biden returned to a sharper message on wednesday pitching himself once again as the most qualified warrior for an aggrieved working class we don t deserve a president who goes out of his way to make life in america harder crueler pettier biden said speaking to a crowd in his hometown of scranton pa he said he s working for the forgotten american well he forgot about the forgotten american the shift was perhaps a signal that biden s campaign has been watching a handful of recent polls that show his slipping support among white working class voters a crucial demographic for his bid for the white house a quinnipiac university poll conducted nationally after biden entered the race on april 25 showed him with the support of 47 of voters who earned less than 50 000 a year five months later when quinnipiac asked the question in october biden was down to 26 support among that same demographic biden s top polling rivals senators elizabeth warren and bernie sanders were hot on his heels at 19 support and 18 respectively among the same demographic both polls relied on small sample sizes so the margins of error are high a different pair of quinnipiac surveys of white voters without a college degree show a similar trend in may biden enjoyed 37 support in that demographic by october that number fell to 21 the last survey showed warren overtaking biden with 29 support among this group in the first to vote state of new hampshire biden s support among the white working class appears to be holding although he lacks a monopoly on the group a september poll from the boston herald franklin pierce university found that among voters who earn less than 35 000 a year sanders was on top with 27 and biden trailing with 20 but a month later the same poll in october showed warren rising from 9 to 19 and biden climbing to 34 while sanders slid to 19 most polls in iowa the first to caucus state don t break down candidates support by voters education or income the herald fpu polls track very favorable views of biden among those earning less than 35 000 sinking from 35 to 28 while somewhat favorable views growing from 31 to 41 from september to october taken in aggregate biden s total favorable ratings rose from 66 to 69 to be sure none of these polling results amount to a red alert for biden s prospects the former vice president still has near universal name recognition his schedule is packed with high dollar fundraisers and one national poll this month shows him with his widest lead yet looking past the primary democratic voters say they highly value a candidate s ability to defeat president trump and biden s campaign has long made the case that he has the best prospects in that respect according to a poll taken in ohio at the end of september and early october biden bests trump by six percentage points the same poll showed both sanders and warren prevailing against trump as well more telling in ohio however are the 11 of democrats and the 19 of independents who said they voted for trump to win ohio a democrat needs to win them back in hypothetical head to heads between trump versus biden or warren trump retains 91 of his supporters from 2016 against both democrats the only democrat who makes in roads among those trump voters is sanders in a primary 26 of trump voters from november 2016 say they would vote for sanders if they had to choose biden s team has for months vacillated between the best message for the candidate in april his campaign shelved a launch video filmed in part in scranton that hammered at working class themes choosing instead one focused on trump s response to white nationalism in charlottesville va and the fight for america s soul the retooled pitch helped biden contrast himself with trump but it also buried what many supporters see as his primary appeal his willingness to embrace and advocate for the white working class which may explain why biden spent his wednesday morning in his hometown talking directly to a working class base there used to be a basic bargain in america if you contribute to the well being of the outfit you work with you got to share in the benefits biden told the crowd that bargain s been broken write to philip elliott at philip elliott time com
