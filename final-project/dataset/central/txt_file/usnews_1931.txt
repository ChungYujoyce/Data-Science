confirmed priscilla chan zuckerberg s wife also sent multiple emails to schmuhl with staff recommendations ultimately two of the people recommended were hired the emails between zuckerberg and

testify wednesday before the house financial services committee on facebook s impact on the financial services and housing sectors zuckerberg used to make political contributions more frequently including to former and current house speakers paul ryan and nancy pelosi in 2014 but he hasn t made any political donations or endorsements to specific candidates in the 2020 election cycle in june he gave 5 000 to facebook s pac which contributes to both democratic and republican candidates since the beginning of the campaign we ve built a top tier operation with more than 430 staff in south bend and around the country meagher said the staffers come from all types of background and everyone is working hard every day to elect pete to the white house a spokesman for the zuckerberg chan family told bloomberg news that the employees asked the tech mogul and chan to recommend them having seen mark s visit to south bend in 2017 and facebook live with mayor buttigieg colleagues later

part of his philanthropic work and got a tour from buttigieg that zuckerberg live streamed mark and priscilla have not decided who to support for president he added labolt didn t answer a follow up

good staff hire with a lot of experience and same with nina and priscilla zuckerberg 35 and buttigieg 37 overlapped at harvard and buttigieg was friends with two of zuckerberg s roommates he was also one of facebook s first 300 users but they were only introduced years later by a mutual harvard friend the staff recommendations from zuckerberg are the first evidence of the facebook ceo actively assisting a presidential campaign a number of other high ranking facebook executives including david marcus the executive leading facebook s cryptocurrency efforts naomi gleit one of facebook s longest tenured executives and chris cox former chief product officer who is close friends with zuckerberg have donated to buttigieg in recent weeks democrats have escalated their criticism of facebook for its refusal to moderate political ads elizabeth warren in particular has repeatedly attacked zuckerberg and facebook over its decision not to fact check posts or ads shared by politicians joe biden wrote the company on thursday demanding that an ad paid for by a pro donald trump super pac be pulled down for what he said were lies about his ukrainian related work as vice president buttigieg meanwhile has become somewhat of a darling of silicon valley democrats repeatedly returning to san francisco for high dollar fundraisers he s been more apprehensive about breaking up big tech companies than some of his democratic counterparts saying the issue of monopolies extends beyond tech but he s also raised concerns about tech companies having too much power and has floated regulation including fines and the blocking of new mergers for facebook and other big tech companies republicans have accused zuckerberg and facebook of bias against conservative viewpoints claiming that facebook and other social media platforms unfairly suppress their views zuckerberg reportedly started to hold private meetings last summer with conservative leaders to hear their concerns in the past facebook embedded staffers with political campaigns to give them guidance on how to best use the social media platform the 2016 trump campaign said it greatly benefited from having facebook staffers on hand the company announced in 2018 that it would pull back from offering on site support now zuckerberg needs friends in washington where facebook is under unprecedented attack his company is being investigated for possible antitrust violations by two federal agencies and congress it s also trying to get skeptical regulators and lawmakers on board with its goal of launching a cryptocurrency but this presidential cycle facebook has become one of democrats top punching bags in recent weeks warren s campaign has bought ads on facebook claiming zuckerberg endorsed trump a deliberate falsehood that she used to draw attention to facebook s policies exempting politicians from fact checking ads and corrected later in the advertisement contact us at editors time com
