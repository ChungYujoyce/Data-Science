of the biggest and most important swing states in national elections the quinnipiac university survey puts former secretary of state clinton ahead of former florida gov jeb bush by 48 to 39 percent she leads sen marco rubio of florida by 47 to 40 percent and sen rand paul of kentucky by 49 to 41 percent she s ahead of sen ted cruz of texas by 51 to 37 percent clinton s closest competitor in the buckeye state seems to be ohio s gop gov john kasich who s been mentioned as a dark horse presidential candidate by some party bigwigs clinton leads kasich by five percentage points 47 to 42 gov john kasich runs best against secretary hillary clinton for 2016 among eight republican candidates although her lead over most of them has dropped considerably since quinnipiac university surveyed ohio voters in february says peter a brown assistant director of the quinnipiac university poll on the surface this poll looks ok for clinton but if we were one of her pollsters prepping for the possibility of a presidential bid there s stuff here we d be worried about not that we d be too concerned it s so early there is little connection between such polls and actual electoral results more than two years hence but there are trends we d be keeping an eye on first as mr brown noted this poll shows the state tightening up clinton has lost between three and five points on her various rivals since quinnipiac last surveyed ohio in february look deeper in the data and you see that much of this decline appears to have come from republicans who previously supported clinton drifting back to their preferred party but clinton seems to have lost some support among men too for instance in february 45 percent of male voters said they d vote for clinton in a notional race against mr bush in may that percentage dropped to 40 percent that could just be margin of error stuff but we d be watching that if we were on clinton s payroll second the quinnipiac survey isn t good for president obama it puts his favorable rating in the state underwater with 39 percent of ohio voters saying they approve of the job he s doing and 58 percent saying they disapprove that s about five points worse than he s doing in the nation as a whole according to the realclearpolitics rolling average of major surveys that might indicate democrats are losing ground in a key state such a consistently low rating can t be helpful to the democratic ticket says quinnipiac s brown referring to upcoming midterms in which ohio will elect a governor among other officials get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox hillaryland also might just chew on the fact that they know these numbers are going to get worse and she ll face slipping in ohio headlines they ll slide because almost all her currently high ratings are partly due to her being one of the most well known women in the world polls show that almost every time a very famous person actually declares for president their approval ratings begin to slip wrote aaron blake washington post political expert earlier this week indeed the idea that clinton will continue to post a big lead on whomever the gop puts up is pretty far fetched mr blake writes link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to the christian science monitor has expired you can renew
