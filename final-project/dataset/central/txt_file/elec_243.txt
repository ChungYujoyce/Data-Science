six months ago i wrote a column titled anybody but hillary the case for warren webb in 2016 well that certainly didn t go anywhere elizabeth warren has stayed true to her word and far away from the race while jim webb s campaign has gone absolutely nowhere behold him languishing at under 1 percent in the polls but that doesn t mean my instinct to seek out anybody but clinton was wrong on the contrary between hillary s inept handling of the bottomless email imbroglio bill s predictably defensive and passive aggressive response to her critics and the boatload of potential scandals lurking around in the sleaziest corners of clintonland i ve come to view the democratic frontrunner as a ticking time bomb for her party and the country that leaves bernie sanders as the most viable anybody currently in the race but that doesn t ease my mind don t get me wrong currently clocking in at roughly 28 percent nationally in comparison to hillary clinton s 41 and leading handily in new hampshire sanders is doing remarkably well and in a campaign cycle that s seen the lefty jeremy corbyn wrest control of the british labour party from the centrist blairites it just might be possible for a left leaning candidate to capture the democratic nomination and who knows even win the presidency at least if he s pitted against one of the two guys currently leading the gop race but even then i m afraid i can t quite wrap my head around the possibility of a sanders victory in november 2016 why do i find it implausible oh i don t know maybe it s because if hollywood were looking to cast the role of a 70 something socialist union organizer on the lower east side of manhattan in the early decades of the 20th century sanders would land the part in a heartbeat i just don t buy that a plurality of middle american general election voters will cast a ballot for a guy like that the fact that he s also proposing a few trillion dollars worth of new federal spending without adequately explaining where the money s going to come from doesn t thrill me either as recently as a month ago this combination of options had me feeling a little demoralized but that was before i along with lots of other people began to take a second look at joe biden i ll admit until recently i scoffed at the idea of him jumping into the race biden s been kicking around an awfully long time he first ran for president and lost in the primaries in 1988 when i was a freshman in college he has a history of verbal gaffes that could make a biden presidential campaign a nightmare to run he has his own skeletons in his closet a plagiarism scandal in law school he s not identified with any specific issue agenda or constituency and he s no spring chicken 72 years old to clinton s 67 that makes him sound like a pretty weak candidate but on a second look i like what i m seeing and some of what i m remembering along with many millions of people i was mighty impressed by biden s mid september interview with stephen colbert talking with frankness about his faith and how he s coped with more than his share of loss in his life in addition to the death in may of his 46 year old son beau from brain cancer his first wife and one year old daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972 biden sounded refreshingly unpolitical he came off as charming warm and comfortable speaking without a script someone who unlike some doesn t need to practice his authenticity then there are biden s recent statements staking out a more conflicted position on abortion than one expects to hear from such a prominent democrat this places him far closer to the consensus position on the issue than most leading members of his party and may indicate that he would cultivate more of a working class middle american sensibility than we ve seen from a democratic presidential candidate since well since jim webb announced he was running yet unlike webb biden seems so far to be pulling it off good for him and good for the democratic party if he can run and succeed as that rarest of things a moderate on the most divisive issue in the culture war on foreign policy biden might be even more interesting not many people remember it now but back during george w bush s second term biden proposed that iraq be broken up into three semi autonomous regions one sunni one shiite and one kurdish it was a bold proposal that was quickly forgotten once w s troop surge finally managed to tamp down the insurgency that was tearing the country apart at the time but of course the violence returned and now we re back again to something approaching chaos with the desert west of baghdad serving as a home base for isis the country s sunni and shiite populations nearly at each other s throats and the kurds as always just trying to live their lives without getting sucked into the whirlwind of violence around them if that s not a complete vindication of biden s proposal which would surely have provoked its own forms of instability it s at least refreshing evidence that he was willing to think outside the narrow unimaginative ideological boxes that too often determine foreign policy thinking inside the beltway american politics could use more of such thinking finally there s domestic policy an area where biden has never really stood out or distinguished himself and that s where warren comes in biden should only jump into the race if he can persuade warren to change her mind and take the leap with him forming a complete ticket before the first votes are cast this winter with the senator from massachusetts serving as a running mate and senior domestic policy adviser in waiting take biden s everyman charisma foreign policy chops and extensive experience as a senator and vice president and combine it with warren s firey whip smart left liberal populism on domestic policy and you d have a hell of a ticket it would be one straight out of hillary clinton s nightmares and one perfectly poised to poach support from sanders with the message i get why bernie appeals to you but we will do it better and we can win this thing put sanders support together with what biden currently enjoys and you d have a candidate with nearly 48 percent of the democratic vote nationally to clinton s 41 percent that s the contest that american politics needs and democratic voters deserve the vital mystery of how we think about the world would republicans welcome a democratic authoritarian will the supreme court crown trump king biden suggests many covid 19 deaths were avoidable but for trump s lack of attention and ego america s meat problems are about to get worse trump shares disturbing meme of biden s campaign in a coffin
