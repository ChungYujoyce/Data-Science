president donald trump argued that he has expanded the republican party to be more of a home for the working man and woman in an interview for this week s time cover in a brief call from air force one to discuss his relations with republicans on his way to an oct 10 rally in erie pa trump cited his 2016 win his renegotiation of free trade agreements and his combative foreign policy as reasons that the gop is stronger than before his presidency the party is a much bigger party now and it s like really a party for the working men and women in this country in addition to plenty of others he said in the true sense it has been changed and i think that s why i won an election nobody else would have won if you look at the places i ve won nobody else would have won those places both the democratic and republican parties have seen drop offs in recent years in the number of voters who identify with them and there are fewer self identified republicans now than when trump won the 2016 nomination but among republicans trump has support in the mid 80s in line with ronald reagan s read more how the midterms will test trump s hold on the gop read a lightly edited transcript of trump s interview below hi mr president thank you for talking to me today good i ll try and get a good cover for a change that s nice we ve been talking to a lot of your supporters and we re trying to explain to readers the different reasons people support you and that s what i wanted to talk to you about we are doing a lot of good things i think you know we just had a great judge put on the supreme court and a lot of people would have said that was not going to happen now that s two of them in less than two years substantially less than two years that was my honor but all of the things that are happening have been really great including jobs and regulations everything the market s had a little bit of an off day but i understand why that is that s easy to figure do you think that you ve changed the republican party permanently well i don t think of it that way brian i mean i really like much of what the republicans were doing i think we have brought a lot of people in you know the party is a much bigger party now and it s like really a party for the working men and women in this country in addition to plenty of others i guess in the true sense it has been changed and i think that s why i won an election nobody else would have won if you look at the places i ve won nobody else would have won those places and a lot of that is because of my views which are very strongly held there are hundreds of republican politicians out there what do you think they can learn from you the things you say your policies and the way you say it well i think for one thing we have to fight harder for our country and i think we have to put america first we people have not been doing that they ve been doing these horrible trade deals you know we just renegotiated and there were tough negotiations but nafta was one of the worst deals ever made we lost thousands of factories and plants and jobs millions of jobs millions and millions of jobs and it was a horrible deal that s why i refused to call the new deal anything to do with nafta you know the usmca and you know it s a deal that will make it very hard for people for companies to move out of the united states because if they move out of the united states there s going to be a very big penalty to pay and you know we were losing our companies and therefore we were losing our jobs people were being fired and that was something that i refuse to allow to happen that s a big difference right there i think more than anything else it s putting america first and you know i m proud of our country i want to be proud of our country so many things were happening so bad so foolish that you know it s just unacceptable our trade deals were horrible and frankly our military deals were horrible we re protecting wealthy countries and not being reimbursed for it it s ridiculous you look at our military costs and they re ten times what other large countries are more than ten times and yet because we are protecting half of the world and much of that are wealthy countries and we re not being reimbursed well we are going to start being reimbursed you know why should we be protecting countries of massive wealth and not be reimbursed for this military protection that was not a very republican thing to say but it wasn t a very democrat thing to say either it was neither but i say it and it s happening as you see you see what s happening nafta if you look at what we did with nafta but if you take a look at nato because nafta now is gone you know it has to be approved by the senate but we have to have good bipartisan you see that but if you take a look at nato last year they paid 44 billion more i said you re going to have to pay folks because payments were going down everyday for 10 years you could speak to secretary general jens stoltenberg and last year i went in i said look you re either going to pay or you re going to have a problem and they paid 44 billion more this year it s the same thing they re paying billions more but it s still unfair nato because we re paying for 80 the cost of nato in order to protect europe and on top of everything else europe takes advantage of us on trade that s a mouthful brian but you understand what i m saying i ve had people say to me i ve had generals say to me sir we do this for trade i said really we lost 151 billion with the european nations you know the union but you add those nations together which are largely the same and we lost because they have trade barriers they have tremendous tariffs note in 2017 the european union had a 153 billion trade surplus in goods with the u s when trade in financial tech and legal services are included the total trade surplus is 101 billion and they took advantage of our country and they re not going to be able to do that any more we talked to supporters in missouri in pennsylvania in west virginia we heard from some people who love the way you talk some of your harsh attack lines that you use and we found people who love your policies but are uncomfortable with the harsh ways that you talk how do you thread the line of different types of people that support you well if i don t talk that way i m never going to get the point across and i m never going to be able to make the deal there is nothing nice about telling a country that we aren t going to allow you to make 151 billion against the american taxpayer there is nothing nice in telling china that we are not going to allow you to take 500 billion dollars a year out of the united states note according to figures published by the office of the u s trade representative the u s goods and services trade deficit with china in 2017 was 335 4 billion we just can t do it and i have a great relationship with president xi but we can t allow this to happen there is nothing nice about saying to saudi arabia you have to pay for military protection we re not going to do this unless you know it s ridiculous we re spending money and they re paying for just a fraction of the cost of the military now i can say it nicely or i can say it less than nicely the bottom line is a lot of people agree with me oftentimes you can t be overly nice look our politicians have been nice for many years for decades and look what s happened look what i ve done with north korea when i came in the day before i came in if you look we were going to war with north korea president obama said it was by far his biggest problem of course he gave me a lot of problems with a lot of things including iran look at iran they re a weakened nation now look at them after what i did they are a weakened nation they have riots all over in every city the people are rioting they are pulling back military they have a lot of problems the day before i came in iran was taking over the middle east it was just a question of which week will it be now they have everything they do to save themselves you look at north korea we were going to war with north korea before i came in that was going to be a war president obama said it was by far his biggest problem that was going to be a major war millions of people would have been killed now and the media gives me no credit for it and that s fine because i m used to them obviously they don t mean as much as i used to think i used to think they meant a lot but now my relationships with kim jong un are excellent we are having great dialogue mike pompeo just left yesterday and they had a great conversation a great five hour meeting and conversation setting up another meeting but the bottom line is there s no missiles going off there s no nuclear testing there s no rockets we got our hostages back brian and we re getting our remains back when you leave office what do you think the republican party looks like and then the media and then the media says why aren t you going faster well i left there three months ago and these other presidents have been negotiating 30 years on this stuff and more but 30 years on the dangerous things on the things of danger to put it nicer so i ve done north korea and that s moving along very nicely the only thing they can say is oh why isn t it moving faster it s been three months brian three months why isn t it moving faster that s the only thing they can say or they say something else he met i met obama paid 1 8 billion and he gave 150 billion with me they say he met that was like you know this major concession that s not a concession i met i m glad i met by meeting we now have a civil relationship and even a good relationship so that s just two of many things i ll give you and example idlib i met with a person at a big rally in ohio it was a person backstage where various people were saying hello and a woman came up she was syrian she said sir this is five weeks ago she said sir my sister lives in idlib province and sir she is going to be killed russia iran and syria are surrounding it and they are going in and they are going to kill the 3 million people or a million people but tremendous amounts of people they re going to kill my sister and they re going to kill my family and i said that won t happen but i wasn t that aware of it i got back and i read an article in of all places the new york times the failing new york times and i read an article about idlib being surrounded by russian troops with iranians and with syrians and they were in fact going to go in take a look at the tweet i put out at that time guess what they didn t do it they re still talking i said just you got to be surgical you can t blow up every building and kill millions of people to get 35 000 terrorists and look what happened brian they didn t do it i said you better not do it and i m not saying they shouldn t get the terrorists i m saying you can t kill 3 million people in order to get or a million people in order to get 35 000 terrorists you can t do it so you know that happened i was the one that got it stopped and then turkey also got involved after i stopped it i stopped it they were going to go in the next day and they stopped totally cold now they have the town surrounded and they re doing much more surgical work and that s the way it should be done if you want to get the terrorists you can t kill millions of people you just can t do it it s unacceptable so what i ve done nobody s done what i ve done nobody i say it myself because the media will never say it but the people get it the people understand it and in a way it shocks me cause i always gave too much credit to the media because in theory based on media i shouldn t have gotten 306 electoral college votes i shouldn t have got it because it s really staged for the democrats to win but the people get it it s really amazing to see it s really a beautiful thing to see and one of the advantages i have like i m going to a rally right now you know i would have canceled it because of the hurricane but there are thousands of people lined up yesterday to get to a rally that takes place at 7 o clock tonight in pennsylvania but one of the assets i have is i m able to speak to people in tremendous numbers we have thousands of people lined up outside right now trying to get in but i m able to speak to them and often times it s on live television you understand so i m able to get my word out i wish i could speak to you more often i think i would have gotten instead of having 90 percent bad time covers i would have had 60 percent good time covers let s talk more often i think we should it s always an honor to be in your magazine contact us at editors time com
