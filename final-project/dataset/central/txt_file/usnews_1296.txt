committee would not restrict questions about russia republican rep jim jordan ranking member of the oversight committee spoke after cummings and made the argument that cohen is a fraudster cheat felon

congress about his pursuit of a potential trump tower development in moscow and committing campaign finance violations called trump a cheat in his testimony cohen suggested in his testimony that trump implicitly instructed him to lie about the real estate project in moscow and says trump knew he was lying to congress cohen said that trump knew about and directed negotiations for the moscow development project during the presidential campaign and lied about it he also told the house committee that trump knew in advance about wikileaks release of emails that were damaging to hillary

detailed racist statements from trump including saying that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid cohen provided a check to the committee that trump personally signed while he was in office to reimburse him for a 130 000 payment made to keep stormy daniels a porn star quiet about her affair with trump trump has previously claimed to know nothing about these payments during the hearing cummings asked cohen is there any doubt in your mind that president trump knew exactly what he was paying for there is no doubt in my mind he said committee member debbie wasserman schultz asked cohen if he believed trump had asked for the wikileaks email dump cohen said he was not aware and added mr trump is all about winning asked by wasserman schultz if trump would have the potential to cooperate or collude with a foreign power to win the presidency at all costs cohen answered yes mr trump s desire to win would have him work with anyone he said massachusetts rep stephen lynch a democrat refuted the republicans line of questioning toward cohen after gop committee members repeatedly brought up his crimes in anger throughout the course of the hearing lynch noted that a number of other people associated with trump including michael flynn and paul manafort have emerged as criminals your side ran away from the truth and we re trying to bring it to the american people lynch said lynch then questioned cohen about the trump tower moscow deal cohen said he briefed trump s children donald trump jr and ivanka trump about ten times on the deal in another heated exchange between meadows and cohen the congressman asked how times many cohen had spoken with representatives from the pharmaceutical giant which previously paid him 1 2 million for access to his knowledge of the enigma of donald trump he said cohen said he d talked to novartis about six times cohen and the republican congressman have sparred on and off throughout the hearing jordan at one point accused cohen of wanting a job at the white house and said he s now behaving just like everyone else who got fired or didn t get the job they wanted cohen pushed back at the accusation saying he did not want to go to the white house i was offered jobs trump s sons donald trump jr and eric trump who have been tweeting throughout the hearing disputed cohen s account later jordan asked why cohen didn t deny a buzzfeed report that said trump directed cohen to lie to congress it wasn t our responsibility to be the fact checker cohen said asked by republican jody hice who was paying his attorney lanny davis cohen said the lawyer was working for free so he s doing all this work for nothing hice asked yes sir and i hope so cohen responded hice said i kind of doubt it davis who previously served as special counsel to bill clinton has been accused by republicans of orchestrating the testimony jordan in his opening remarks said they ve got to find somebody somewhere to say something to remove the president from office they didn t find him lanny davis found him so now clinton loyalist clinton operative lanny davis has persuaded the chairman of the oversight committee to give a convicted felon a forum to tell stories and lie about the president of the united states cohen said trump instructed him to lie about the hush payments made to porn star stormy daniels trump told cohen to say the president had no knowledge of the payments made to daniels to buy her silence for an alleged affair with trump congressman raja krishnamoorthi asked cohen about recent interactions between cohen and trump or other people representing the president cohen replied unfortunately this topic is actually something that s being investigated now by the southern district of new york and i ve been asked by them not to discuss and not to talk about these issues krishnamoorthi then asked if cohen was aware of any further wrongdoing or illegal acts by trump yes cohen said and again those are part of the
