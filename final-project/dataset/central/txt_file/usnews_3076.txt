hardly six months into his tenure as the president of ukraine volodymyr zelensky has already learned to temper his expectations he does not expect his first round of peace talks with russia which are scheduled to take place in paris on dec 9 to end the war that has been raging along their border for the past five years nor does he expect too much from his western allies going into these negotiations zelensky said in a wide ranging interview on saturday speaking to reporters from time and three of europe s leading publications the president explained that despite getting caught up in the impeachment inquiry now unfolding in washington d c ukraine still needs the support of the united states otherwise his country does not stand much of a chance zelensky said in its effort to get back the territory russia seized from ukraine in 2014 starting with the crimean peninsula nor can ukraine rely on steady financial support from abroad if president donald trump and his allies continue to signal to the world that ukraine is corrupt zelensky said when america says for instance that ukraine is a corrupt country that is the hardest of signals during the interview in his office in kyiv the comedian turned president denied as he has done in the past that he and trump ever discussed a decision to withhold american aid to ukraine for nearly two months in the context of a quid pro quo involving political favors which are now at the center of the impeachment inquiry in congress but he also pushed back on trump s recent claims about corruption in ukraine and questioned the fairness of trump s decision to freeze american aid if you re our strategic partner then you can t go blocking anything for us he said i think that s just about fairness it s not about a quid pro quo zelensky s focus during the interview as it has been throughout his time in office was on the effort to end ukraine s war against russia and its proxies who still control two separatist strongholds in the region of ukraine known as the donbass more than 13 000 ukrainians have died as a result of that conflict and more are killed or wounded every week yet the european attempts to mediate an end to the fighting have been stalled for over three years for the first time since the fall of 2016 russian president vladimir putin has confirmed that he will attend the talks under what s known as the normandy format with the leaders of france and germany acting as mediators but without consistent pressure from the u s zelensky is hardly sure the europeans will deliver on their promises to defend his country s land its people and its economy what follows is a partial transcript of the hourlong interview which was conducted jointly by time le monde of france der spiegel of germany and gazeta wyborcza of poland it has been condensed and edited for clarity by time zelensky experience shows that these meetings go on for many hours they vary often these meetings go in circles with people repeating the same things to each other here s what i know from studying them people have come to these meetings intending for nothing to happen that is how i felt maybe they came with different goals each country has its position and no doubt germany and france both did a lot to make these upcoming talks happen that s already a victory it s a victory when the weapons fall silent and people speak up that s already the first step first is a prisoner exchange a real exchange within a clear timeframe second is i think very difficult and that s a ceasefire it was laid down in all the previous agreements as the priority as the first point in all the agreements and in all the statements but we have to understand that indeed the shooting slowed down that s true but it did not stop so when we say ceasefire that s what we have to achieve these first two points are related to the lives of people that s why for me those are the two most important points when we talk about elections we have to understand the third point before elections we need a full withdrawal a full disarming of all illegal formations military formations no matter the type no matter the group no matter the uniform no matter what weapons resolving these three points will create an understanding that we want to end the war we definitely want that but that will create an understanding that russia is also very strongly intent on this of course not yes that s the most difficult question the most difficult if we even get to it it will be the most difficult question in these negotiations but i ll confess to you honestly i don t support the way this is spelled out in the previous agreements under those agreements the elections are to happen and then the control of the borders goes to ukraine i don t agree with the sequence of these actions look we are at home here it is a piece of our land that was taken away i will not agree to go to war in the donbass i know there are a lot of hotheads especially those who hold rallies and say let s go fight and win it all back but at what price what is the cost it s another story of lives and land and i won t do it if that doesn t satisfy society then a new leader will come who will satisfy those demands but i will never go for that because my position in life is to be a human being above all and i cannot send them there how how many of them will die hundreds of thousands and then an all out war will start an all out war in ukraine and then across europe we ve had three calls with the president of russia i think they were productive we got our sailors back in a prisoner exchange we got back our guys who wound up behind bars under tragic circumstances our political prisoners that s very important i don t trust anyone at all i ll tell you honestly politics is not an exact science that s why in school i loved mathematics everything in mathematics was clear to me you can solve an equation with a variable with one variable but here it s only variables including the politicians in our country i don t know these people i can t understand what dough they re made of that s why i think nobody can have any trust everybody just has their interests he tried he tried hard that s true and i think he had a lot of success i wasn t a witness to everything he did because i wasn t president at the time but i saw that in those moments when we met he really was active in defending our position first off i would never want ukraine to be a piece on the map on the chess board of big global players so that someone could toss us around use us as cover as part of some bargain as for the united states i would really want and we feel this it s true for them to help us to understand us to see that we are a player in our own right that they cannot make deals about us with anyone behind our backs of course they help us and i m not just talking about technical help military aid financial aid these are important things very important things especially right now when we are in such a difficult position the united states of america is a signal for the world for everyone when america says for instance that ukraine is a corrupt country that is the hardest of signals it might seem like an easy thing to say that combination of words ukraine is a corrupt country just to say it and that s it but it doesn t end there everyone hears that signal investments banks stakeholders companies american european companies that have international capital in ukraine it s a signal to them that says be careful don t invest or get out of there this is a hard signal for me it s very important for the united states with all they can do for us for them really to understand that we are a different country that we are different people it s not that those things don t exist they do all branches of government were corrupted over many years and we are working to clean that up but that signal from them is very important i don t need to change his mind during my meeting with him i said that i don t want our country to have this image for that all he has to do is come and have a look at what s happening how we live what kinds of people we are i had the sense that he heard me i had that sense at least during the meeting he said yes i see you re young you re new and so on america first of all has its direct relations with russia to influence russia to make everyone see that this war is a big tragedy and that it must end i think that mr trump can speak directly and i think they do talk about these things yes i don t like when others talk about us without us there in the sense of some benefits for them but if it s a conversation along the lines of look let s make this stop ukraine is different now ukraine wants to stop it there is no radicalism no one is killing and eating anyone in that country see for yourself come on then the whole world would support ukraine and america is one of the keys to this happening for us look it does sound strange when it comes to russia it seems france has different relations now with russia i think some of these words are linked with the weakening of sanctions policy that s what i have seen more deeply now i understand because economically the sanctions policy doesn t benefit france and germany but when we re talking about human beings we shouldn t consider benefits and on this the european leaders guaranteed to me that the sanctions policy would stay the same until we get all of our territory back that includes crimea i m the type of person who responds to facts i believe that our european partners must support us and if they must then they will but i will see this in the first half hour if i see around the table that this is not the case i will say so straight out i would like to hope that everyone understands the problem is deeper than fixing economic problems within this or that country i want european leaders to settle on a different result when it comes to nord stream and take different steps i don t know what else i can say about north stream 2 we don t have influence over the europeans decision we don t have it and that s it i don t have any leverage i can only count on the strong support that i see on this question from the united states of america is that the only thing that can stop it that s the only thing that can stop it that s it look i never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo that s not my thing i don t want us to look like beggars but you have to understand we re at war if you re our strategic partner then you can t go blocking anything for us i think that s just about fairness it s not about a quid pro quo it just goes without saying contact us at editors time com
