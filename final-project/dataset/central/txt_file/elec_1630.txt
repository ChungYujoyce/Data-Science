 domenico montanaro donald trump flashes a thumbs up after finishing second in the iowa caucuses last week jim watson afp getty images hide caption donald trump flashes a thumbs up after finishing second in the iowa caucuses last week a lot of republicans will head to the polls in new hampshire on tuesday motivated to vote against donald trump but because of a quirk in how the state party allocates delegates and how fractured the establishment field is it could mean that an anti trump vote will actually be a vote for the new york billionaire here s how the state party awards delegates on a proportional basis to presidential candidates based on their vote statewide and by congressional district but it also has a 10 percent threshold what does that mean it means that if a candidate does not get 10 percent of the vote he gets no delegates and this is a hard threshold no rounding what s more not only do those underperforming candidates get no delegates but whatever delegates they could have gotten based on their vote share go to the winner of the primary and right now the favorite is trump trump after all has been leading in the polls in new hampshire by double digits for six straight months meanwhile the so called establishment candidates the kind of mainstream republicans that usually prevail in new hampshire are split and after saturday night s debate with marco rubio s lackluster performance that establishment vote could be fractured even further there are 20 delegates at stake in new hampshire on primary night here s a look at how the candidates are performing in the polls currently what that could translate to delegate wise and how the 10 percent threshold could affect things according to the realclearpolitics polling average here s the order of the candidates with a line inserted to represent the 10 percent cutoff trump 31 percent 6 delegates rubio 16 percent 3 delegates john kasich 12 percent 2 delegates ted cruz 12 percent 2 delegates jeb bush 9 percent chris christie 5 percent carly fiorina 5 percent ben carson 3 percent so let s do some math everyone below the 10 percent threshold bush christie fiorina and carson add up to 22 percent so 22 percent of 20 is 4 4 round down and that means roughly another four delegates would be added to trump s total instead of a 6 3 delegate win trump would get 10 thought about another way some 40 percent of trump s delegates could be coming from people who cast their votes explicitly in opposition to him or at least for candidates running very different campaigns and by the way those delegates are bound to vote for trump at the republican national convention in july because of changes to the republican national committee s rules that all states that hold their nominating contests before march 15 must award their delegates on a proportional basis and they must be bound to the candidates npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
