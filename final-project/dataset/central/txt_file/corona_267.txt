impossible for society s most vulnerable that challenge has played out on a massive scale in india loading april 13 2020 like much of the globe 1 3 billion people in india are under orders to stay inside due to the coronavirus pandemic here as elsewhere officials are wrestling with how to balance public health with the economy s health particularly for society s most vulnerable that question has especially high stakes in india where some 80 to 90 of the workforce are informal workers often left out of safety net schemes and the challenges perhaps have been most dire for 100 million internal migrant workers many of whom attempted to walk hundreds of miles home after losing work and often shelter during the lockdown officials have since set up assistance such as soup kitchens and forbidden migrants landlords from demanding rent for the month but the crisis has shone a spotlight onexistinginequalities and resulting challenges that could endure beyond the lockdown there is no simple answer to this tragic dilemma between two humanitarian crises the spread of the virus and the devastation caused by the lockdown but some basic principles apply says jean dr ze an activist and visiting economics professor at the university of ranchi one of them is that no one should be allowed to starve late last month as india s transport came to a halt and its residents prepared for lockdown prakash meghwal began a long walk home with roughly a dollar and a half in his pocket and three other people for company he traced his way through forested land careful to avoid the main roads whenever possible small roadside shops provided them some food during the day and shelter outside their shuttered fronts at night we were scared mr meghwal says what just happened we wondered we have never experienced anything like this before in our lifetime six days later having covered more than 90 miles on foot he reached his village in rajasthan state for over a decade mr meghwal worked as a waiter in the tourist hill town mount abu and sent money to his family of six back home but suddenly with the new coronavirus shutting down business there was no work or wages and he was forced to return home his household no longer has a source of income in the face of a pandemic a third of the global population is under some form of lockdown and countries are grappling with how to balance health and the economy particularly for society s most vulnerable and on march 24 with only four hours notice india began the world s biggest test yet prime minister narendra modi ordered the entire country of 1 3 billion people to stay indoors for 21 days editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall the announcement did not include any concrete transport safety or economic measures for india s roughly 400 million informal workers who are estimated to make up 80 to 90 of the total workforce and live without a safety net with businesses and establishments shut down they lost their daily wages many of the country s roughly 100 million migrant workers have also lost the roof over their head balancing either the belongings on their heads or young children on their shoulders hundreds of thousands tried to walk back home many have faced hunger and police brutality at least 22 migrants have died on the way some states organized buses to help the migrants but bus stops quickly became overcrowded a few days later fearing a surge in coronavirus cases due to the movement of migrants the central government ordered states to seal their borders it announced food and cash assistance forbade migrants landlords from demanding rent for a month and ordered that businesses must pay wages for the duration of the lockdown but the crisis has shone a spotlight on inequalities that predate covid 19 those disparities are likely to endure beyond this particular crisis india s economic growth model is based on the cheap labour of rural to urban migrants who often work for less than minimum wages in its high growth sectors yet they remain an unenumerated unrecognized presence in cities excluded from many welfare programs says nivedita jayaram of the nonprofit aajeevika bureau which advocates for migrants and laborers there is an absolute gap the inability of the governments to be able to tell how many migrants are in a city let alone reach them the pandemic and lockdown has only exposed this fundamental flaw in india s policy design most migrants are not included in the public distribution system which entitles poor families to subsidized grains owing to the long list of intermediaries involved in employing a migrant worker the order to pay wages is difficult to enforce too some states have tried to boost migrants support kerala for example was one of the first states to enhance social security pensions and set up shelters and new delhi has opened more than 1 000 food centers but more is needed especially in smaller towns and far flung areas where hunger is more stark and fear is more prevalent says suroor mander a lawyer and activist with the nonprofit karwan e mohabbat there is no simple answer to this tragic dilemma between two humanitarian crises the spread of the virus and the devastation caused by the lockdown but some basic principles apply says jean dr ze an activist and visiting economics professor at the university of ranchi one of them is that no one should be allowed to starve living in overcrowded homes or shelters india s workers have been left more vulnerable to the pandemic but with such a large population already struggling with hunger additional measures to address their health and safety have been pushed to the brink in one state returning migrants were asked to squat on the road and sprayed with a bleaching agent according to manisha dutta a public health professional in udaipur there continues to be inconsistent inadequate information about the pandemic which has led to confusion and fear among migrant workers returning migrants are reportedly being screened for the coronavirus in a number of states but she is worried it isn t rigorous enough teachers and health workers have hurriedly been asked to step in and screen returnees most of them are at the front lines without safety gear and have not received proper training ms dutta says in addition there are also a number of horrible rumors doing the rounds some that refer to migrants being disease carriers and taken away by the police so this has all been really intimidating for them at the best of times accessing health care is challenging for many migrants among organization for economic cooperation and development members and partners india has the fewest number of hospital beds per 1 000 people mr meghwal said his young children are frequently ill but he is no longer able to take them to the nearest health center about 15 miles away because of the lockdown health experts are especially concerned about tuberculosis among migrant workers particularly at a time when many will be malnourished india has the highest tb burden in the world according to the world health organization and the disease disproportionately affectspoor and marginalized people once india has provided adequate rations and cash distributions experts warn it needs to confront long term challenges including job creation the migration system is broken now and this means there will be a shortage of labour in many sectors says dipa sinha professor of economics at delhi s ambedkar university for instance this is harvest season in northern india which relies on migrant farm labourers from states like bihar the crops can t be allowed to simply go to waste the mahatma gandhi national employment rural guarantee act which provides at least 100 days of paid employment per year to unskilled laborers has come to a halt under the lockdown in the longer run however workers advocates view it as a crucial system to provide income to migrant workers who ve returned to their villages and officials are asking for the strengthening of the act an ambitious one nation one ration card scheme which aims to make subsidized food available to workers who are currently left out is scheduled to be operational in june on the ground implementation remains a challenge however the lockdown is scheduled to end tuesday but is likely to be extended as the number of cases rises many are calling for continued but more humane social distancing measures but for now many migrant workers main concern is their livelihood with many rural areas economies focused on agriculture returned workers face few job prospects get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox the plan is to go back as soon as i can
