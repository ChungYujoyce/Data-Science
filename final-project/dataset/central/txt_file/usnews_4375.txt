washington in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak the chinese government moved quickly to ban wildlife consumption and crack down on certain wet markets where snakes civets and other exotic animals are soldalongwith more traditional livestock scientists applauded the move as long overdue but some fear itwon t last and they argue much more needs to be done to guard against diseases that can make the animal to human leap experts worry that president donald trump s unsupported suggestion echoed by secretary of state mike pompeo that the virus escaped from a chinese lab rather than emerged in a wet market could undermine efforts to confront a dangerous and recurring source of potential disease outbreaks wildlife trafficking it is deflecting and diverting attention from the real problem said peter li an associate professor of east asian politics at the university of houston downtown and a consultant for animal welfare groups scientists say the novel coronavirus circulating the globe probably came from bats and passed through another mammal perhaps a pangolin one of the most trafficked animals in the world before jumping to humans chinese authorities identified an early cluster of coronavirus infections among individuals who had some connection to a seafood wet market in wuhan where the virus emerged it has not been proved definitively that virus transmission began in that market but scientists say such markets are hotbeds of disease some wet markets in china sell live poultry fish and reptiles as well as arange of exotic andfarm bred wild animals these wet markets are really perfectly conducive to spillover events because you have so many different species coming in you have wild speciesinteracting with domestic species said george wittemyer an associate professor of wildlife and conservation biology at colorado state university you have animals stacked on top of each other and blood feces and other fluids flowfrom their cages he said you are probably having hundreds to thousands of individual animals exposed to other species along with humans actively behaving in a way that s perfect for viral transmission domesticated livestock are also a major source of emerging diseases wittemyer said and you re sort of playing russian roulette without aggressive efforts to tracknew pathogens inanimals scientists estimate that 75 of new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention humans can catch a virus from an infected animal in many ways through their saliva or other bodily fluids through theirhabitat whethera forest or a chicken coop and via consumption of raw or undercooked meat or other contaminated food a slew of deadly diseases from hiv to ebola began in animals and jumped to humans and the likely vectorwas consumption of wildlife meat or other interactions with animals as with covid 19 scientists say the sars epidemic in 2003 began in a wet market in southern chinaafter moving from a bat to a civet cat which are sometimes sold in those markets trump said april 30 that he hadseen evidence suggesting thenovel coronavirus originated in a virology lab in wuhan pompeo said this month there was a significant amount of evidence that the virus emerged from a chinese lab neither has detailed what that evidence is and they have both hedgedwhen pressed by reporters we don t have certainty about whether it began in the lab or whether it began someplace else pompeo said during a media briefing may 6 other officialshave contradicted their assertions anthony fauci the nation s top infectious disease expert said scientific evidence does not support the claim that the virus was man made everything about the stepwise evolution over time strongly indicates that this virus evolved in nature and then jumped species fauci told national geographic in an interview published this month some critics say trump pressed for an investigation into the origin of the virus as a way to deflect blame for his own missteps in responding to the pandemic the u s intelligence community issued a rare statement in april stating there was broad consensus that the virus was not man made or genetically modified thestatementleft open the question of whether the virus was accidentally released by alaboratory in china or whether it came from animals then jumped to humans mybiggest concern with the politicization of itis that it s delaying what we actually need said wittemyer which is a global recognition that human interactions with animals present a major disease risk experts say only a sliver of wet markets sell wildlife and the demand for such exotic food is mostly fueled by the wealthy it s the luxury part of wildlife food trade that creates problems said andrew dobson a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at princeton university fancy restaurants serve them to wealthy customers and some high flying couples like to serve exotic animal dishes at their weddings he said just as some americans buy elephant ivory orsmuggle parrots snakes and other wild animals into the usa to keep as exotic pets really it s devastating the planet for the whims of wealthy people he said dobson said eliminating wildlife trafficking whether for food or other uses would have a dramatic impact on the risk of disease outbreaks it would halve it he said dobson and others said china s decision to ban the consumption of wildlife is a positive step but a baby one for starters china s ban includes loopholes including the use of wild animal parts for medicinal purposes and tax incentivesthat encourage the export of some species that leaves many wild animals vulnerable take for example pangonlins they are small mammals covered in scales that live in asia and africa in some asian countries the meat is considered a delicacy and pangolin scales are used in traditional asian medicine pangolins are protected under international law but they are widely trafficked amid demand from china vietnam and elsewhere wildlife traders promote wild animal meat as something good for your health li said pointing to unsupported claims thatpangolin scales can boost fertility among other promises liridiculed theunproven aphrodisiac and disease fighting properties of exotic meatsand saidwet markets are not only hellholes of cruelty but also of disease dobson said the international body that monitors the global wildlife trade is weak and underfunded with a 25 million annual budget many countries have little to no incentive to crack down on wildlife trafficking the wildlife trade is hugely corruptand massively tied up with the arms trade as well as human smuggling he said illegal wildlife trafficking is the fourth most lucrative global crime according to the world economic forum wildlife advocacy groups estimated that wildlife trade generates 7 billion to 23 billion annually li notedthat after the sars outbreak chinese authoritiesreversed a 2003 ban on wildlife consumption amid pressure from traders and because chinese authorities saw wildlife breeding as a revenue source and job creatorin otherwise poorrural areas of the country the chinese government quickly reopened the trade on august 5 2003 so barely two months after sars was over he said even if china keeps its new ban in place other asian countries have not followed suit despite pressure from animal rights groups and conservation experts who point to the devastating impact of covid 19 last week one advocacy group dedicated to saving dogsbegged indonesian presidentjoko widodoto close markets where live animals are sold and slaughtered it is shocking to see markets selling wildlife and domesticated animals in full operation many of which are in densely populated cities such as jakarta medan and manado providing almost identical environments to those from which covid 19 emerged reads a may 12 letter from a coalition called dog meat free indonesia li and others said they are optimistic that the catastrophic toll of the coronavirus pandemic in terms of worldwide deaths and the global economic contraction will lead to a more aggressivecrackdown on wildlife traffickingin china and elsewhere wittemyer saidthe chinese government will face intense domestic and international pressure to keep its ban in place and other world leaders should be motivated to step up tracking and enforcement but any such effort will run up against strong political and cultural headwinds he added i will be so disappointed in humanity if after putting ourselves through this much pain that we would be that short sighted not to address wildlife trafficking he said it s a loaded gun for us as we see
