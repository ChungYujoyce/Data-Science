how policymakers respond could be critical to the length and depth of such a recession loading march 19 2020 katja sator owns an auto parts plant in germany that is still running despite a sudden halt at many automakers technicians on the production lines work 2 meters 6 1 2 feet apart to reduce the risk from the coronavirus that has begun to decimate the global economy germany the united states and other major economies have begun to inject money into their stricken economies providing credit to companies likems sator s she s hesitant to go into debt given the uncertainty in her industry and others but relieved that policymakers are acting what s not clear is whether fiscal policy will be strong enough to cushion the blow of a health emergency that has idled workers and emptied schools and offices economists predict a severe contraction in economic activity and a surge in unemployment the challenge for policymakers is to keep workers attached to their employers so that businesses can rev up once the worst is over simply bailing out struggling companies may not in itself solve that problem which is why congress may soon be cutting checks to american families so that spending doesn t crash it s like we re firefighting first dropping water on the whole building saysioana marinescu an economist at the university of pennsylvania it s a seemingly intractable dilemma suddenly as salient in berlin or tokyo as it is in washington how do you save people s economic livelihoods while telling those same people to stay home a global recession many forecasters say is already here and is growing more severe by the day as millions of consumers and workers in europe asia and north america have been sidelined as governments take extreme measures to stem the covid 19 pandemic finally though actions by governments and central banks appear to be ramping up not so much in an effort to prevent a recession as simply to weather a storm that could easily become more severe than the global financial crisis a decade ago help can t come soon enough for dominik wilkinson and his co workers at a restaurant in the northern german town of bielefeld the restaurant s 40 staff members are already working sharply reduced hours and there s talk in town of curfews starting friday a prolonged closure would be death in terms of revenue it s basically the same for every small and medium sized company says mr wilkinson a shift manager editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall in the united states the past few days have seen automakers mothball factories hotel chains furlough tens of thousands of workers and major retailers trim store hours or go online only a labor department report today showed claims for unemployment benefits spiking to 281 000 last week every day brings more turmoil in global stock and bond markets as investors seek safe havens even as central banks cough up amounts not seen since the financial meltdown of 2008 yet the situation s very severity is spurring governments into action relief measures range from mortgage or tax holidays to cash infusions for households while also lending or simply giving money to businesses to prevent mass layoffs or permanent closures analysts say these are precisely the kinds of measures that can help but their effectiveness will hinge greatly on their magnitude and speed of delivery and what makes this crisis different they add is that a pandemic must also be tamed because the economic and health crises are intertwined the group of seven international economic organization has already issued a whatever it takes statement of determination the international monetary fund and world bank are mobilizing help for developing nations but so far it s an open question whether global leadership today can match the kind of concerted effort that emerged from the depths of the 2008 crisis a lot of people didn t quite measure the gravity of the situation for a while including myself to be honest says ioana marinescu an economist at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia we have to think about supporting business that s very important because if we allow businesses to fail we are losing jobs we re also losing capital the top priority remains a pandemic that has killed more than 9 000 people and spread to every continent except antarctica yet if the economic side effects are left unaddressed the result would be significant human hardship of another kind it is costly to rehire workers let alone to start new businesses from scratch and the more workers lose jobs and paychecks now the sharper the downward spiral so in the u s members of congress are considering emergency relief for the economy that could surpass 1 trillion in value of which about half may be cash handouts to families that can be spent as quickly as possible but in parallel the trump administration wants to bail out airlines and other hard hit industries and offer loans to help small businesses cope other steps around the world include emergency loans in china and japan unemployment benefits for french workers forced into part time status and emergency legislation in britain to halt evictions by landlords during the pandemic in washington a sense of urgency has blunted partisan edges at least in part on wednesday republican senate majority leader mitch mcconnell successfully urged his colleagues to approve a measure crafted by democrats in the house to expand unemployment benefits and paid sick leave and to make tests for the coronavirus free more than usually this touches many many many actors and not just the most vulnerable so i think that s a reason to go broad with emergency support says dr marinescu it s like we re firefighting first dropping water on the whole building then thinking about more targeted relief going forward last week germany green lit a host of fiscal measures to offset the pandemic crunch companies large and small can access increased credit apply for funds to pay idled workers and seek tax deferrals but katja sator owner of a precision engineering company in the southwest state of baden w rttemberg worries the emergency aid only amounts to a mound of debt whereas grants wouldn t weigh down her balance sheet it s great that we re receiving help with liquidity and that we can get new credit says ms sator whose company frankenstein pr zision gmbh makes precision parts for automakers and other industries but we have to pay everything back that means it s not clear whether we ll be in the red for the year if we have to close down production she hasn t laid anyone off but she s not extending temporary contracts her production lines are still running with technicians spaced 2 meters 6 1 2 feet apart as markets react to the pandemic central banks have in many cases acted faster since they are inherently nimbler than legislatures but unlike in 2008 when the crisis began in an over leveraged financial sector the coronavirus has slammed into the real economy which monetary policy alone is hard pressed to rescue on tuesday the u s federal reserve reopened two programs last used during the global financial crisis a decade ago to keep the flow of short term credit from clogging and on wednesday european central bank president christine lagarde cited no limits to support efforts as the bank launched an 820 billion program to buy government and corporate debt for all the actions underway the question economists raise is what will be enough in these extraordinary times forecasting the depth of the slowdown is challenging recent estimates suggest up to a 14 drop in u s economic output annualized in the second quarter although the term fiscal stimulus often is used for recession fighting programs the goal today is really about helping individuals and businesses survive this economic stallout a rebound will come later the challenge is to contain the current damage by slowing the spread of covid 19 while minimizing job losses and firm closures right now what needs to happen is flattening the curve of the outbreak while still doing whatever it takes to keep the fabric of the economy and of society alive says fabio ghironi an economist at the university of washington in seattle that means economic rescue should include support for stretched health care systems he says something far different from recessions with purely economic causes the u s and other governments are making some big efforts but dr ghironi and others argue much more will be needed many less developed economies face an especially hard time finding the resources for both a public health crisis and an economic one in mexico city julio bisrreal alcantaria stands beneath a lush green tree on the sidewalk beside his fruit truck slicing mangoes and papayas he hasn t seen much of a slowdown in business due to the coronavirus he says but expects nationwide school closures starting this week to hit his business hard i can make it about two weeks with slow sales and then i m in trouble he says if kids aren t in school and people aren t going to their offices i have no one to sell to mr bisrreal is one of the estimated 30 million mexicans working in the informal economy without social security or job protections as with gig economy workers in the u s flexibility becomes moot if a pandemic forces people indoors and consumer spending evaporates mexico s finance ministry has proposed lines of credit debt refinancing and helping small businesses stay afloat but there s no real discussion in the legislature about economic stimulus says valeria moy an economist at mexico como vamos a think tank school closings aside president andr s manuel l pez obrador has resisted an economywide lockdown arguing that it would hurt poor people there are pressures of all types close the airport shut down everything paralyze the economy no he told a press conference worldwide the stakes are high in odemira portugal domingos vicente owns a fruit distribution business with 40 employees mostly migrants if my business shuts down i won t be able to pay them to stay at home not working and they will not stay around which means it will be hard to start over again once it s possible and hire new workers that means trouble for the agricultural supply in portugal in italy the nation hardest hit in europe by the virus the government is helping employers meet their payrolls and freezing loan and mortgage payments for many who are affected by the crisis but as in other nations the emergency programs take time to reach people and may not be enough that s especially true for workers in the gig economy like claudia bellante a freelance journalist in milan her husband a photographer has seen his work dry up he ll be eligible for some emergency grants but she won t i understand these are emergency measures for this time but i worry when the pandemic ends we re going to be in a very difficult place ms bellante says i doubt there will be enough money for everyone dr ghironi the italian born economist at the university of washington says south korea has shown how to fight the pandemic without economy debilitating lockdowns by using prompt testing and infection tracing whatever steps work he says the public health approach and economic rescue go hand in hand we need the resources and the stimulus to be injected while the public health pieces of the mechanism are put in place so the lockdown can be lifted as soon as possible get the monitor stories you care
