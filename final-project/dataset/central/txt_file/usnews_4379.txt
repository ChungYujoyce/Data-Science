were researching covid 19 nor that they were involved in the united nations health agency s decisions fact check president donald trump vs the world health organization oakley objected to the post s claim thatits reporting undercuts president trump s assertion aboutthe who s failure to communicate the extent of the threat just because you have americans embedded in who providing technical assistance does not change the information you are getting from who leadership oakley said we have learned now that who information was incorrect and relied too heavily on china oakley faulted the who for not getting boots on the ground in china until mid february and for blindly accepting the information relayed by chinese officials when asked about the post report monday michael ryan executive director of the who health emergencies program said he was not aware of anyspecific communications between u s government officials who are based here at who with ourselves and the white house he said he was surethere were many warnings because who itself was clearly putting out information on this event since the very beginning ryan said he would be shocked if there had not been some science based discussions going on around the implications of the coronavirus among the researchers working at who when the outbreak began ryan praised the researchers from u s agencies who worked with the who saying that thanks to them he had served in the front lines with some of the finest scientists that i have ever met we are hugely grateful for their contribution and the major contribution that u s embedded government officials have played since the very beginning of this outbreak ryan said last week trump announced he was cuttingoff funding of the who because he felt the organizationdid not respond quickly enough to the outbreak and did not share the information it obtained with the united states the united statesis by far the organization s largest contributor giving about 400 million for 2018 2019 according to the who website so much death has been caused by their mistakes trump said last week he said his administration planned to investigate the organization s severe mismanagement of the response oakley said that even though china stalled for weeks onallowing international health experts into the country the who never criticized them for the delay and even praised china for its transparency she cited ryan who said jan 29 we ve seen no obvious lack of transparency aroundthat time trump also said hethought china was being upfront about the outbreak china has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus the united states greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency trump tweeted jan 24 it will all work out well in particular on behalf of the american people i want to thank president xi analysis trump halts funding to who experts say we need it now more than ever though health experts agree the who has its problems they decried the decision to cut its funding amid a pandemic that has killed more than 168 000 people last week trump repeated his criticism of the who during a call with leaders from the group of seven nations even as trump denounced the who several leaders defended the organization and said its work was critical to the fight against the virus there is a need for international coordination and the who is an important part of that collaboration and coordination canadian prime minister justintrudeau said we recognize that there have been questions asked but at the same time it is really important that we stay coordinated as we move through this french president emmanuel macron expressed his support for the who and said the organization must play a central role as part of an ambitious and coordinated international response to the virus crisis germanforeign minister heiko maas said cutting funding for the who was like throwing the pilot out of the plane maas said the international health agency is the backbone in the battle to stop the coronavirus and that s why it makes no sense at all to question the functioning and significance of the who now on sunday abc news this week host george stephanopoulos asked deborah birx the white house coronavirus response coordinator if she thought it was fair to blame the who for the outbreak if cdc officials were getting the same information as the u n agency birx stressed the need for high levels of transparency during a pandemic saying it was better to over communicate and share even the small nuances she indicated the responsibility was more with china saying it s always the first country that gets exposed to the pandemic that hasa higher moral obligation on communicating on transparency because all the other countries around the world are making decisions on that when we get through this as a global community we can figure out really what has to happen for first alerts and transparency birx said contributing david jackson usa
