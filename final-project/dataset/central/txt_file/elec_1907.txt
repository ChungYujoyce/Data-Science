 by brooks jackson posted on september 12 2012 mitt romney claims the obama administration issued an apology for american values after u s embassies were attacked not true romney refers to a statement issued before mobs attacked either in egypt or libya and faults u s diplomats for failing to condemn actions that hadn t yet happened furthermore the word sorry or apologize doesn t appear in the statement under the headline u s embassy condemns religious incitement the embassy in cairo said respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of american democracy romney has falsely accused obama of apologizing for america many times before the line has been a dependable applause getter with conservative audiences but we found no basis for this claim in obama s previous speeches and remarks and other fact checkers came to similar conclusions getting things backward this time romney has gone beyond putting his own unwarranted spin on the president s statements he has just gotten his basic facts in the wrong order romney appeared on national television the morning of sept 12 and said romney sept 12 i also believe the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in egypt instead of condemning their actions it s never too early for the united states government to condemn attacks on americans and to defend our values in response to reporters questions he added romney the embassy in cairo put out a statement after their grounds had been breached protesters were inside the grounds they reiterated that statement after the breach i think it s a a a terrible course to for america to to stand in apology for our values that instead when our grounds are being attacked and being breached that the first response of the united states must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation an apology for america s values is never the right course the statement that came from the administration was was a statement which is akin to apology and i think was a a severe miscalculation the fact is however that romney got his sequence of events backward a timeline contrary to multiple reports from fox news the u s embassy in cairo not the state department in washington put out the statement on sept 11 several hours before a mob of protesters breached the wall of the embassy took down an american flag and replaced it with a black flag at 6 11 a m eastern time around noon cairo time the u s embassy in cairo tweeted u s embassy condemns religious incitement with a link to its full statement the tweet was later deleted and the link to the statement was taken down a senior administration official who spoke to reporters on a conference call confirmed that the statement was released at about noon cairo time which would have been at about 6 a m edt that places the release of the statement several hours before the protest so romney was wrong about the statement from the embassy coming in response to the protest nor do we see any basis for romney s claim that the embassy statement was apologizing for free speech and appeared to be an apology for american principles here is the statement in its entirety u s embassy condemns religious incitement september 11 2012 the embassy of the united states in cairo condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of muslims as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions today the 11th anniversary of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks on the united states americans are honoring our patriots and those who serve our nation as the fitting response to the enemies of democracy respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of american democracy we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others the incitement to which the statement refers is an obscure u s movie that was getting widespread attention in egypt and the arab world because of a 14 minute trailer posted on youtube in early july according to max fisher an editor at the atlantic the movie accuses the prophet mohammed and other islamic figures of homosexuality and child molestation among other things it so happened that state department spokeswoman victoria nuland was giving a daily press briefing in washington d c at 1 05 p m eastern time shortly after the protest and was asked about it nuland sept 11 1 05 p m edt so obviously one of the things about the new egypt is that protest is possible obviously we all want to see peaceful protest which is not what happened outside the u s mission so we re trying to restore calm now but i think the bigger picture is one of the united states supporting egypt s democratic transition and the egyptian government very much welcoming and working with us on the support that we have to offer no apology there more important the statement from the embassy in cairo was released some 10 hours before another mob attacked the u s consulate in benghazi libya and killed the u s ambassador and three other americans according to senior u s officials the attack in libya began around 4 p m edt and continued for several hours in the late afternoon on sept 11 nuland confirmed that the u s consulate in libya was under attack but she did not say if anyone had been killed in her statement the first official statement we could find from the state department in washington nuland said we condemn in strongest terms this attack on our diplomatic mission there was no sympathizing with the attackers the statement was issued before the deaths were confirmed at 10 08 p m edt secretary of state hillary clinton released a statement on the attack confirming the deaths of three americans clinton sept 11 10 08 p m edt i condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in benghazi today some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the internet the united states deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation but let me be clear there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind at 10 25 p m the romney campaign released a statement saying i m outraged by the attacks on american diplomatic missions in libya and egypt and by the death of an american consulate worker in benghazi it s disgraceful that the obama administration s first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks at 11 04 p m abc s jake tapper reported an administration official tells abc news that no one in washington approved that statement before it was released and it doesn t reflect the views of the u s government on the morning of sept 12 romney doubled down on his attacks claiming that after the grounds in cairo had been breached the embassy released a statement that amounted to an apology for america s values in a statement from the rose garden that same morning obama with clinton at his side also added his voice to the chorus condemning the attacks and called them outrageous and shocking again neither obama clinton nor the state department spokeswoman issued an apology for american values as romney described it all unequivocally condemned the attacks and called them unjustified and the embassy statement upon which romney s claim rests was issued hours before the protest in cairo asked to explain romney s comments spokesman eric fehrnstrom acknowledged that the embassy in cairo released its statement before the protests occurred but he said romney was referring to a deleted tweet from usembassycairo after the protest that reaffirmed the embassy s earlier statement that tweet said this morning s condemnation issued before protests began still stands as does our condemnation of the unjustified breach of the embassy that does not however explain all of romney s comments including the one in which he claims the administration was wrong to stand by a statement sympathizing with those who had breached our embassy in egypt instead of condemning their actions the deleted tweet does not necessarily sympathize with the mob and it does condemn their actions apology tour romney s claims about the administration apologizing for american values fits an ongoing theme of his campaign accusing obama of beginning his presidency on an apology tour in foreign countries in fact that meme informed the title of romney s book no apology we looked into the obama speeches that romney cited as evidence and concluded that nowhere did we see that the president apologized for america in some speeches obama was drawing a distinction between his policies and those of his predecessor george w bush in other instances obama appeared to be employing a bit of diplomacy criticizing past actions of both the u s and the host nation and calling for the two sides to move forward then as now romney s claim of obama apologies falls flat brooks jackson robert farley and eugene kiely q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
