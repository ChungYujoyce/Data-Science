advantage in the november election loading march 1 2016 republicans particularly donald trump are crowing about record turnouts in the first four nominating contests while democratic turnout has slumped compared with 2008 the party s last competitive primary season mr trump s outsize presence in the race is clearly a factor the donald himself was quick to brag about the disparate turnout trends in a tweet sunday morning after democratic frontrunner hillary clinton crushed bernie sanders in the first southern primary while hillary and i both won south carolina by big margins repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles growing party the billionaire showman wrote but don t read too much into the gop s turnout numbers even if they continue to break records in the 12 contests on march 1 aka super tuesday analysts say for starters strong republican turnout now doesn t guarantee victory over the democratic nominee in the general election just because democrats are coming down from their 2008 highs it doesn t necessarily mean that come november their voters aren t going to show up to vote says michael mcdonald a political scientist at the university of florida in gainesville and don t give trump all the credit for the gop s record breaking turnout numbers another factor has been the size of the field turnout rates in presidential nomination contests are highly sensitive to the levels of competition says professor mcdonald an expert on election turnout when the primaries began the republicans had 17 major candidates to the democrats three even now there are still five republican candidates in the race to the democrats two and the competition remains fierce as trump threatens on tuesday to move a big step closer to locking down the nomination in the early states in particular high levels of advertising campaign organization and voter outreach from so many candidates engaged republicans like never before since the advent of the modern nomination system on top of that the trump phenomenon has captured attention in a big way both through his massive rallies and wall to wall tv coverage some of the trump driven turnout is people motivated to vote against the controversial billionaire how the anti trump republican vote plays out in november should he win the nomination is a big question some conservative republicans including nebraska sen ben sasse have pledged not to vote for trump and say they will find a third option trump is a polarizing figure even within the gop says mcdonald there are some people showing up to vote for him and some showing up to vote against him it s not clear how much this enthusiasm will translate into the general election if trump is the nominee mrs clinton the democratic front runner is polarizing too and many anti trump republicans can be expected to hold their noses and vote for the billionaire as a vote against clinton but for now the early turnout numbers tell a story in iowa republicans drew 180 000 people to the caucuses up from 121 000 in 2012 in new hampshire gop primary turnout was 284 000 up from 248 000 in south carolina the party drew 730 000 voters to its primary versus 603 000 in 2012 and in nevada 75 000 people turned out for the caucuses up from 33 000 in 2012 the democrats in fact beat the republicans on caucus turnout in nevada this year with 80 000 but that figure was well below the 2008 democratic turnout of 120 000 a month ago in iowa democrats drew 171 000 to the caucuses compared with 240 000 in 2008 in the feb 9 new hampshire primary democratic turnout was 251 000 versus 289 000 in 2008 and in south carolina last saturday 367 000 democrats voted a 30 percent decline from 2008 in 2008 the democrats fielded a large number of candidates barack obama hillary clinton john edwards joe biden and four others but the race quickly winnowed down to then senator obama and then senator clinton interest was high from the start and remained high as both obama and clinton sought to make history but it s not necessarily fair to compare the 2016 democratic turnout numbers to those of 2008 or suggest that because the republicans are beating democrats in turnout in the early contests that bodes ill for the democratic nominee s chances in november go back to the 2000 elections says mcdonald the republicans had much higher turnout rates in the early contests than the democrats did with much greater differentials than we re seeing now by november the general election was one of the closest in modern history and the democrat won the popular vote amy walter national editor at the cook political report also warns against conflating the republican turnout surge with electability in the general election every action has an equal and opposite reaction ms walter writes getting more white and angry voters to the polls with nativist language also helps to turn out passive democratic voters who might have stayed home but for the threat of trump s candidacy democrats started the 2016 cycle laboring under a huge enthusiasm gap in late december a poll by cnn orc international found that 36 percent of republicans and republican leaning independents were extremely enthusiastic about voting for president in 2016 while just 19 percent of democrats and democratic leaning independents felt that way by the end of february democrats had closed that 17 point gap to 8 points now 31 percent of republicans and republican leaners are extremely enthusiastic versus 23 percent of democrats and democratic leaners according to cnn orc a big factor in that gap no doubt is that republicans are eager to usher out the obama era while democrats are playing defense as they try to hold onto the white house get the monitor stories
