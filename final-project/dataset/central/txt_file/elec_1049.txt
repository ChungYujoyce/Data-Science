the party to unify around a nominee and they re particularly worried that supporters of sanders won t back any nominee who isn t their favored candidate he needs to stop said one democratic strategist who is not affiliated with any of the presidential campaigns it s not helpful and it actually hurts the party it s like he didn t learn his lesson the last time it s incredibly short sighted and terrible this strategist pointed to the senator s recent remarks in a los angelestimes editorial board meeting where he said that trump would eat former vice president joe bidenjoe bidenthe hill s

infiltrated the democratic primary process more d mass the progressive candidate who has been a friendly rival to sanders on sunday criticized her fellow candidate warren said she was disappointed that the sanders campaign had been using a script for its volunteers to tell potential voters that warren was appealing mainly to upper income democrats and would not bring in new supporters to the party i was disappointed to hear that bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me warren said i hope bernie reconsiders and turns his campaign in a different direction veterans of the clinton campaign say it all lookssimilar to 2016 in and of itself it shouldn t take on too much meaning said philippe reines a longtime communications adviser to clinton but if it s a harbinger of tone to come that s not great and i say that as someone who doesn t believe the primaries should be a cotillion or game of paddy cakes sanders allies bristle at the criticism which they see as unfair to their candidate they say sanders isn t doing anything other candidates aren t doing in criticizing a fellow democrat on policy points i don t see it any differently than vice president biden going after medicare for all said larry cohen a longtime sanders allyandchairman of our revolution the organization that originated from sanders s 2016 campaign it should be about the issues and when we have differences and believe if something is better we should say so biden has made electability a core part of his candidacy opening the door for sanders and other candidates to argue that they and not biden are actually the best nominee for the party to draw support in the general election the sanders campaign also takes offense at the notion that sanders didn t help clinton in 2016 in september october and november of 2016 sanders held 39 rallies in 13 states on behalf of clinton s campaign he did 17 events in 11 states during the last week alone they point out reines argues that sanders needs to either accept the plain fact supported both quantitatively and anecdotally that his supporters did not go all in for hillary he said clinton supporters in 2008 offered far more support to

mindful that at some point he might need to rally millions of people to support someone else that s not easy you can t just flip a switch it s a process your supporters have to believe you re being genuine in your endorsement and you have to convince them reines said sanders is rising in polls and increasingly is seen as a real contender in the iowa caucuses and new hampshire primary and for the general election a new poll released friday found sanders with 20 percent support and warren in second with 17 percent just ahead of former south bend ind mayor pete buttigiegpete buttigiegit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process here s how biden can win over the minority vote and the rust belt the hill s campaign report democrat concedes in california house race more d with 16 percent and biden with 15 percent some of the democratic angst about his rhetoric seems linked to the idea that he could actually win bernie sanders is the democratic party s version of donald trump thank god we are smart enough to stop him said democratic strategist michael trujillo who served as an aide to clinton biden s support for the iraq war has come under more scrutiny given the u s airstrike that killed iranian gen qassem soleimani in iraq and it s not just biden who has mentioned it warren has also criticized biden s vote sanders has generally been a bit more pointed in his criticism however in an interview with the washington post last week he said biden s support for the iraq war would make him a weaker general election candidate it s just a lot of baggage that joe takes into a campaign which isn t going to create energy and excitement sanders said he brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat donald trump democratic strategist eddie vale said he s not as worried as everyone else about sanders s rise and rhetoric but vale does worry that the primary may become so contentious that unity will be hard to come by on all sides if someone more on the left wins the nomination it will be equally damaging if all the more moderate folks who complained about bernie supporters last time in the general election do the same thing he said democratic strategist adam parkhomenko who served as an aide to clinton during the 2016 election and an adviser following the election said he worries that sanders s rhetoric will only cause his supporters to stay home again we d all be better served if he focused his disgruntled energy on donald trump he said view the
