opportunity to look into the staying power of mostly positive campaigning loading october 26 2018 early voting in texas began on monday and both republicans and democrats have been buoyed by record turnout for a midterm after polls closed tuesday in san antonio hundreds of beto o rourke supporters flocked to the cowboys dancehall for a rally as the nine piece band shinyribs played they lined up to buy o rourke t shirts took selfies with a neon beto for texas sign and chatted near a mechanical bull with a few notable exceptions representative o rourke s senate campaign has been fueled by positivity and has attracted nationwide attention and record grass roots fundraising for this moment in time it is an unorthodox approach with other 2018 campaigns featuring accusations of racism treason and just plain old name calling whether it will be enough for a democrat to be elected to statewide office in texas for the first time since 1994 is another question but for a positive campaign to bring a liberal even this close the statement may have already been made in this midterm we ll see if that strategy of not going low works says mark rodriguez an o rourke supporter i hope we don t get to that point that reasonable people can t win but you never really know it took less than 48 hours last week for beto o rourke to express regret over attacking ted cruz the united states senator he hopes to unseat this year grassroots energy record fundraising hauls and a democrat actually being competitive statewide in ruby red texas have combined to make this one of the most closely watched contests in the country but representative o rourke a three term congressman from el paso has also attracted supporters and internet celebrity by running a largely positive campaign in the months he has campaigned across the state he has rarely criticized senator cruz saying he instead wants to focus on issues inclusion and optimism perhaps in a sign of the tenor of the times he has departed from that approach in recent weeks criticizing cruz at events in campaign ads and during a statewide televised debate with o rourke trailing in the polls less than two weeks from election day experts say the recent burst of negativity is a sign that a hitherto unconventional campaign is reverting to tried and tested methods for his part o rourke has vowed not to personally attack his opponent again while a national ramp up in negative political rhetoric is to be expected at this late point in a campaign cycle that has been nationalized in many corners as a referendum on president trump around the country it is reaching new levels of demonization and vitriol two years after michelle obama told the democratic national convention when they go low we go high some prominent democrats have said the party needs to essentially do and say whatever it takes to defeat republicans this year republicans meanwhile have accused democrats of treason and inciting mobs this week prominent democratic leaders and critics of the president became the targets of pipe bombs on friday law enforcement announced they had arrested a suspect in connection with the bombs o rourke s rise has been fueled by positivity however and while he has begun to criticize cruz more the attacks have rarely been personal hehas said they are necessary to push back against misleading criticisms of his record but he has so far avoided going to extremes for this moment in time it is an unorthodox approach in this midterm we ll see if that strategy of not going low works says mark rodriguez an o rourke supporter i hope we don t get to that point that reasonable people can t win but you never really know whether the balance o rourke is trying to strike will be enough for a democrat to be elected to statewide office in texas for the first time since 1994 is another question but for a positive campaign to bring a democrat even this close the statement may have already been made it also stands in contrast with races elsewhere in the country in a florida gubernatorial debate democratic candidate andrew gillum said that while he wouldn t call his republican opponent ron desantis a racist i m simply saying the racists believe he s a racist in a heatedarizona senate debate republican candidate martha mcsally accused her democratic opponent kyrsten sinema of saying it s ok to commit to treason in new jersey republican challenger bob hugin revived an unproven allegation that democratic sen robert menendez had hired underage prostitutes an attack ad the new york times described as misleading civility and an emphasis on the personal have been features of o rourke s political brand he has refused to take money from political action committees but raised more than 61 million double his opponent through regular appeals for small donations outside groups have funded ads supporting both candidates he held town halls in all 254 counties in texas crisscrossing the vast state in a fashion reminiscent of lyndon johnson s helicopter powered senate campaign in 1948 only with more selfies and facebook livestreams one of o rourke s earliest forays into national news came in a road trip with gop rep will hurd last year showing that politicians can disagree without being disagreeable in a tweet he criticized protesters who shouted cruz and his wife out of a washington restaurant his senate campaign gained national attention after a video of his defense of kneeling nfl players in response to a question at a town hall in houston went viral reasonable people can disagree on this issue and it makes them no less american he said i can think of nothing more american than to peacefully stand up or take a knee for your rights both reflect that while o rourke is undeniably liberal his policy positions include universal health care and abortion rights civil disagreement is at the core of his political brand his supporters say they gravitate to that sense of fair play he s running on just good values it s so different said denise avila a grandmother and high school english teacher who attended a rally last week i haven t seen that in texas in a long time o rourke edged away from that brand in recent weeks culminating in attacks in a televised debate last week including one rare reference to trump he s dishonest that s why the president called him lyin ted o rourke said referencing trump s nickname for cruz during the gop primary in 2016 the line got a big cheer from a packed room of democratic voters watching in a san antonio bar but o rourke didn t look especially comfortable delivering it two days later at a town hall hosted by cnn he said perhaps in the heat of the moment i took a step too far i don t know that that s the way i want to be taking this campaign he added he has begun to release ads attacking cruz s positions however on issues like immigration and education they are not your traditional attack ads no black and white images or ominous music just o rourke speaking into a camera outside groups have been financing anti cruz ads including some directed by boyhood director richard linklater cruz has been attacking him for longer in a battle of the nicknames rafael ted cruz s first ad released in march mocked o rourke s beto nickname a latino truncation of roberto cruz has consistently characterized his opponent as being too liberal for texas earlier this week at an event in georgetown texas he joked that o rourke should share a jail cell with hillary clinton experts say these are all indications that as the race enters its home stretch and with the latest polls showing cruz ahead by single digits it is becoming more conventional it has helped o rourke that he has not limited himself to just complaining about republicans in general or running against cruz or running against trump says harold cook a democratic strategist and former executive director of the texas democratic party but that alone doesn t put you in the lead he adds you cannot win without presenting a compelling reason for the incumbent to be fired both republicans and democrats in texas have been buoyed by record numbers of midterm ballots being cast in counties around the state for early voting which began on monday after polls closed on tuesday in san antonio hundreds of o rourke supporters flocked to the cowboys dancehall here for a rally as the nine piece band shinyribs played on the stage they milled around the venue lining up to buy o rourke t shirts and stickers take selfies with a neon beto for texas sign and chatting near a vacant mechanical bull charging her phone near the mechanical bull norma leza says she s never been as invested in a candidate as she is in o rourke that s why i ve kept following him she says referring to his positive campaigning and the attacks of recent weeks for the most part it was necessary ms leza says she doesn t agree with the broader notion that democrats should do whatever it takes to win but if you re trying to prove a point or disprove another point about your policies i like it mr rodriguez who has been following the campaign for nearly a year says it has been exciting to see the crowds grow from a few dozen last year to the hundreds in the cowboys dancehall he echoed many other supporters in saying it was refreshing to see him so positive i just hope it s not down to one candidate he adds i hope this could be a playbook for other candidates to generate excitement and good will get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox as he
