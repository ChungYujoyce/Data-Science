over the course of six weeks in 1989 chinese students and those they inspired gathered in central beijing in tiananmen square it began as a spontaneous outpouring of respect and grief following the death of reformist leader hu yaobang but the event then took on a life of its own as mourning became protest against corruption and repression and a call for greater political freedom the demonstrations expanded to other chinese cities as the crowds swelled some within the communist party leadership began to fear that the protests might continue to expand and to threaten the communist party s political dominance a cat and mouse game began as the state tried to find ways to move security forces into the square to end the tiananmen occupation and as the protesters looked for ways to block them as the crowds grew so did the audience of people watching from around the world then the decision was made on june 4 1989 chinese tanks used the cover of darkness to force their way into the square in the process the chinese government massacred at least hundreds maybe thousands of its own people most of them students three decades later the fight over tiananmen continues on the rare occasion when a chinese state official addresses these events at all it is to justify the decision on june 2 2019 china s defense minister described the events of 1989 as political turmoil that the central government needed to quell which was the correct policy because of this he said china has enjoyed stability and if you visit china you can understand that part of history on the one hand it s hard to understand how a visit to china can shed light on the events of that era yes china s people have much more access to information today than they did in 1989 yet particularly when it comes to a subject as sensitive as the protests and massacre in the square the chinese state keeps a tight grip those who use social media in china must register accounts under their real names and the authorities can demand access to those names whenever it wants the government also uses state of the art censorship tools to erase mention of a number of politically sensitive search terms or to redirect the user toward other subjects video recognition software can detect images related to the square and its bloody history in short china s leaders have come as close as technically possible to erasing all record of what happened on the other hand the chinese communist party leadership has presided over the largest economic expansion in human history in 1989 when adjusted for differences in purchasing power china s economy generated just 4 11 of global gdp today it s 19 24 there is an obvious human dimension to this success market reform in china has undeniably lifted hundreds of millions of people from poverty nearly two thirds of the population lived on 1 90 per day or less in 1990 in 2015 it was less than 1 per capita income increased by more than 900 over that period and infant mortality rates fell by more than 80 thirty years after the murders in tiananmen square china presents a contradictory legacy its leadership has provided opportunities for a better life to a larger number of people than any government in history and china remains a police state where citizens can t publicly acknowledge that this mass murder ever took place this appears in the june 17 2019 issue of time contact us at editors time com
