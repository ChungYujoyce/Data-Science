enough people to keep up with the spike in orders grocery orders were up 150 percent in march compared with the same period last year the system relies on an army of delivery workers to bring food

to order could cost them and the struggling restaurants that make the food much needed income at the same time many of the most popular delivery apps have been accused of exploiting the workers and restaurants they contract with by taking the lion s share of the income from deliveries in some cities delivery slots have become extremely hard to come by someone from a low risk group taking up that slot may mean a person who can t go to the store either because they re sick immunocompromised or have a disability misses out on the chance to acquire food they re unable to get for themselves there
