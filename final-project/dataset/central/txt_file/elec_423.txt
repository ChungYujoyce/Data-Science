between executive and political power are enormous loading september 22 2015 was carly fiorina a good business executive or a poor one that s a hot question in united states politics as ms fiorina rises in the polls right now the media is full of in depth examinations of her tenure as ceo of hewlett packard and her 20 years at lucent both firms grew during her tenure but both struggled after she left and it remains unclear whether her decisions contributed to their stumbles however amid the flurry of competing profit claims and clashing job figures there s a third question that s going largely unasked is the top level business experience of fiorina and donald trump actually relevant to the presidency after all the oval office is a very different place from a fortune 500 corner office government bureaucrats don t instantly obey orders troublesome lawmakers can t be dismissed reporters are so interested in your decisions that a horde of them occupies a press office in your own building some ceo qualities are indeed useful in politics jpmorgan chase chairman and ceo jamie dimon said sunday on meet the press successful business executives have a general talent for running things he said and for identifying and recruiting successful subordinates it s not sufficient though you have a whole other set of attributes necessary to the presidency said the jp morgan chief it s complex it s three dimensional chess mr dimon is a self identified democrat who has supported hillary clinton in the past so it s possible he has a partisan interest in pushing the notion that ceo experience isn t a white house prerequisite but it s undeniable that the greatest presidents weren t business leaders in at least one case harry truman a successful president was a private sector flop herbert hoover was a prominent mining engineer executive and investor before his disastrous oval office tenure jimmy carter peanut broker is typically rankednear the bottomof modern presidents george h w bush made a fortune in oil and then lost his presidential reelection bid amid an ailing economy george w bush was the first us president with an mba given the rise of that credential among the american elite class it s unlikely he ll be the last in fact 2016 could be a business executives year fiorina and trump both insist that business experience is crucial to understanding the economy and job creation and to bringing order and clarity to difficult issues trump in particular boasts that america would be transformed by the sheer power of his business acumen pressed last month by george stephanopoulos of abc news about how he would find and deport the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the us and where he d get the billions to pay for the move trump said it s called management the substance of trump s immigration proposals aside management might not be enough to carry them out or indeed to push though and then execute any complex controversial us political action the differences between executive and political power are simply enormous by comparison executives are the masters of their domain their leverage over subordinates is direct and considerable their ability to set strategy for their entity is similarly unchallenged presidents have little of that their hiring power extends to their own staff and cabinet top levels congress holds the purse strings and has a huge say in the direction of the nation public opinion is a powerful influence in his classic study of the office presidential power and the modern presidents the influential scholar richard neustadt argued that presidents areweak when it came to domestic matters they weren t in any sense the nation s ceo presidential power is the power to persuade mr neustadt concluded that involves lots of skills ceos don t need they include the ability to cajole 435 lawmakers all of whom think they should be sitting in your chair they include the ability to take an indirect line toward your goal and often settling for far less than you wanted they include an inclination to compromise and an acceptance that muddling through isn t so bad particularly when it comes to foreign policy there s no equivalent in the corporate world to the separation of powers that often thwarts a president s will and the job demands political savvy more than managerial experience wrote bloomberg s david lynch in 2012 when considering businessman mitt romney s presidential qualifications this doesn t mean ceos are by definition unqualified for presidential duties to reach the top they need drive clarity the ability to set goals and the ability to rally a staff all useful qualifies in politics and business failure can lead to political success the outline of harry truman s story is well known he s the failed haberdasher who rose to finish world war ii and save europe with the marshall plan but truman s kansas city clothing store thrived until an economic downturn sucked it under many of truman s friends from national guard days used the store as an informal clubhouse and through the store he met many local small businessmen and joined civic associations this gave him his entr e into the local democratic machine he entered county politics then won a us senate seat and was chosen as franklin d roosevelt s vice president on the afternoon of april 12 1945 truman received an urgent summons from
