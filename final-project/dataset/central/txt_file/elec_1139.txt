hide caption former vice president joe biden left and sen bernie sanders of vermont are putting forward very different visions in the democratic presidential primary updated at 11 35 a m et bernie sanders and joe biden are very much on each other s minds at his campaign rally in philadelphia on saturday the former vice president went off script twice to deride a protester with a whistle that must be bernie or somebody biden apparently said raising eyebrows and drawing laughs the line is at 8 21 into this video you can decide for yourself what he said minutes later with biden talking about unity and governing amid more background whistling he used the whistler as a punchline you know there s serious work that has to be done biden said but it s not being done by a president who wakes up in the middle of the night and wages war on twitter or like the guy on the whistle back there wonder whose campaign he s with in those two offhand remarks biden flashed a raw look at his view of the difference between himself and sanders when it comes to governing an adult seeking consensus or a kooky guy with a whistle sanders a senator from vermont swatted back the next day on nbc s meet the press noting that while beating president trump was no 1 that was not enough i understand that our campaign is unique in the sense that we re going to try to win the democratic primary that we are going to try to beat trump but you know what else we re going to try to do we re going to try to transform the united states of america so our campaign has a different goal it s to transform this country and we re taking on the entire establishment when we do that and what s more establishment than the former vice president from an administration that many progressives lament as too incremental too na ve and too wide eyed about working with republicans there is this dynamic tension between wanting to win and wanting to be inspired said karen finney a top democratic strategist who worked for hillary clinton s campaign on stacey abrams gubernatorial campaign in georgia in 2018 and is now working for higher heights an organization working to elect black women finney though notes that biden has appeal among democrats because he represents something of a soothing balm an antidote to almost three years of a hard departure from normalcy in the view of democrats many independents and some republicans part of wanting to win is there is a mood in the country for i don t like to say going back to normalcy but to establish a new normal that you feel confident that the person in charge knows what he s doing or she s doing finney said and there s something about biden partially because he has the experience on the big stage with obama that reminds you what that s like that is likely why biden so far in this very early stage of the primary is comfortably ahead in surveys of democratic voters the disadvantage if you want to call it that for biden is voters do want a new face of the party a younger face of the party said adam hodge a democratic consultant who was an obama administration and democratic national committee spokesman but all of that is secondary to who is the best person to beat donald trump next november and who can amass a large governing coalition to actually get things done a majority of the democratic party do want a president to not only win but also get things done governing and consensus building are things biden has been harping on well i m going to say something outrageous i know how to make government work biden said saturday adding i helped make this government work before and i can make it work again to me our principles must never be compromised but compromise itself is not a dirty word consensus is not a weakness it s a necessity it s how this government was designed to work that is not popular with progressives who want bold change and they don t trust biden to hold the line on those principles i will be damned if the same politicians who refused to act then in recent decades are going to try to come back today and say we need to find a middle of the road approach to save our lives progressive star rep alexandria ocasio cortez of new york said after hearing biden could be crafting a middle of the road climate change approach the split comes down to unity versus anger restoration versus revolution it s a political revolution that s needed said larry cohen head of our revolution an outside group supporting sanders that grew out of his 2016 campaign restoration in this country what period are we going to go back to the period of jim crow state militias we are moving forward not restoration to build a democracy here it has to be inclusive in a meaningful way there are warning signs for both biden and sanders the democratic takeover of the house was fueled in 2018 by women and a pew poll out thursday found that women especially those under 50 were far less enthusiastic about voting for a white male than for a woman and there are nearly two dozen candidates for democrats to choose from including prominent women like sens kamala harris of california elizabeth warren of massachusetts amy klobuchar of minnesota and kirsten gillibrand of new york who will be fanning out this memorial day weekend from iowa to new hampshire so far biden and sanders have stood out but the campaign is about to enter an important next phase debate season begins next month those events will be for many voters their introduction to some of these candidates and someone could break out this is why the debates are going to be so important finney said because right now it s hard to get a sense of their strength in terms of how they re doing with voters because there are 23 of them seeing how they engage each other will give us a lot more information on the strength of these candidates at the end of the day though despite the very real and clear divisions party strategists believe the party will come together because of trump one of the most galvanizing forces in american politics in recent history is the trump presidency hodge said and i think democrats regardless of who the nominee is will absolutely unite behind whoever we nominate case in point cohen said of biden if he s the nominee his group will support him enthusiastically at the end of the day elections are binary it s like a light switch i want the light on it s not a close call there s a huge difference between vice president biden and donald trump that said he added now is the time to talk about what kind of nation we can be and what can we get done and let s aim higher npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
