 help snopes become a founding member u s president donald trump suggested during a white house briefing that injecting disinfectants could treat covid 19 on april 23 2020 social media users encountered numerous comments that claimed u s president donald trump had suggested injecting disinfectants as a cure for covid 19 during a white house press briefing as many of these comments included jokes instead of a link to trump s alleged remarks some people were left wondering what trump actually said about disinfectants injections and covid 19 the comment in question came shortly after a presentation by william n bryan the acting undersecretary for science and technology at the u s department of homeland security about how heat and humidity could impact the spread of covid 19 during the summer months bryan mentioned a recent non peer reviewed study that showed how disinfectants and sunlight could kill the coronavirus on non porous surfaces such as counters or door handles bryan s presentation focused on how light and disinfectants affected the coronavirus on surfaces but when trump took the podium he started talking about what would happen if light and disinfectants were brought inside the body to fight the virus here s the official white house transcript of trump s remarks emphasis added the president thank you very much so i asked bill a question that probably some of you are thinking of if you re totally into that world which i find to be very interesting so supposing we hit the body with a tremendous whether it s ultraviolet or just very powerful light and i think you said that that hasn t been checked but you re going to test it and then i said supposing you brought the light inside the body which you can do either through the skin or in some other way and i think you said you re going to test that too it sounds interesting acting under secretary bryan we ll get to the right folks who could the president right and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that so that you re going to have to use medical doctors with but it sounds it sounds interesting to me so we ll see but the whole concept of the light the way it kills it in one minute that s that s pretty powerful trump made this comment following a presentation on how sunlight and disinfectant affect the coronavirus this presentation prompted trump to discuss a question he said probably some of you are thinking of concerning what would happen if you brought the light inside the body as trump continued he also offered his thoughts on how disinfectants could be brought inside the body by injection while trump noted that this method would have to be checked by doctors he said it sounded interesting to him the remarks spurred widespread condemnation from health officials who issued statements urging people not to inject or ingest cleaning products dr vin gupta a pulmonologist and global health policy expert and nbc news contributor said this notion of injecting or ingesting any type of cleansing product into the body is irresponsible and it s dangerous it s a common method that people utilize when they want to kill themselves reckitt benckiser the british company that manufacturers lysol and dettol published a statement on its website saying that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body due to recent speculation and social media activity rb the makers of lysol and dettol has been asked whether internal administration of disinfectants may be appropriate for investigation or use as a treatment for coronavirus sars cov 2 as a global leader in health and hygiene products we must be clear that under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body through injection ingestion or any other route as with all products our disinfectant and hygiene products should only be used as intended and in line with usage guidelines please read the label and safety information while medical experts and cleaning supply companies feared trump s suggestion that disinfectants could be injected as a treatment for covid 19 could result in people poisoning themselves by ingesting or injecting cleaning products some of the president s supporters claimed his remarks were taken out of context white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany noted that trump also told americans to consult with their doctors regarding coronavirus treatments leave it to the media to irresponsibly take president trump out of context and run with negative headlines she said other trump defenders noted that trump clarified later in the briefing that disinfectants would not in fact be administered through injections but the clarification itself was less than clear it wouldn t be through injection trump said we re talking about through almost a cleaning sterilization of an area maybe it works maybe it doesn t work but it certainly has a big effect if it s on a stationary object in any case attempts to deflect criticism of trump s remarks were rendered moot the next day when the president essentially admitted discussing the injection of disinfectants to treat covid 19 by claiming he said it sarcastically to prank reporters i was asking a question sarcastically to reporters just like you just to see what would happen i was asking a sarcastic and a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside but it does kill it and it would kill it on the hands and it would make things much better whether or not his tone was sarcastic is something of a subjective call here is the video we have big plans we need your help ssamuels brett trump says remarks about heat light
