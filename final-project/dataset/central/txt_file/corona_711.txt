day trips to nearby walden pond allow for a slower pace and reflection in the spirit of america s first social distancer loading may 21 2020 a man must generally get away some hundreds or thousands of miles from home before he can be said to begin his travels wrote henry david thoreau why not begin his travels at home i took a day trip two of them actually two visits to walden pond in concord massachusetts an hour from our quarantined home where better i thought to explore the idea of isolation it s what thoreau did albeit for nearly 800 days not 80 in two days at walden here is some of what i found an empty parking lot and then one so full it was blocked kayakers picnickers swimmers in both wet suits and bikinis walkers in masks fishermen in waders and a woman who emerged from the water to tell me of having visited walden more than 500 times on that first visit in april you could feel thoreau there you could not help thinking of his circumstances 175 years ago when he decamped to this place and how strangely those circumstances echo our own you could picture thoreau in his home depot shed grappling with isolation being sheltered on a circumscribed parcel of earth and feeling like he had no idea what was coming next like us thoreau i think might have understood our collective predicament or so it seems on this dank april day in a spring that meteorologists are calling new england s coldest ever i am in concord massachusetts standing in front of a replica of the hut where henrydavid thoreau undertook his version of self isolation at walden pond i peer at it like i expect it to speak have you seen it it really is small ten feet by 15 feet the size of a lawnmower shed you could buy at a hardware store one room one door two windows a fireplace in building a dwelling thoreau would later write in walden consider first how slight a shelter is absolutely necessary inside behind the locked entry but visible through the window a cot a three legged desk two wooden chairs and on this day the anachronism of a day glo sandwich board urging people not to forget the visitor center 100 yards away editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall the hut like the visitor center is beside the parking lot at what is now walden pond state reservation the park is officially closed to aid in the prevention of the spread of covid 19 yet here and there a few people wander in the chill having come for the trails still accessible though now routed in one way loops or maybe just to escape the house occasionally they glance at the tiny hut which even though a replica somehow looks genuine antique and careworn and moss eaten you can imagine thoreau huddled inside it sheltering in place with no plumbing but the pond no heat but burning wood no light but candles not to mention zero wi fi and definitely too few bars for facetime thoreau moved into his hut on july 4 1845 he lived there alone for two years two months and two days nine years later he published walden describing what he d done and nearly two centuries on people come here to see where he d done it as it happens i wasn t supposed to be here back in january in times b c before coronavirus this was planned as a different kind of travel story the monitor s memorial day kickoff of summer vacation season the plan was to fly to washington d c buy bike share passes and crisscross the national mall to document the scenes at the monuments the great gatherings of every kind of human that belittle our differences and exalt our community fractious times sure but not in these places not while reading abraham lincoln s carved words opposite his enormous hand on his enormous knee not while watching dr martin luther king jr emerge indomitable from a stone but of course things changed and there would be no flights or hotels or runabout bicycles handed from one unsanitized tourist to another so what would there be for this story for this summer for all of us day trips it turns out or so say the zeitgeist pollsters and travel forecasters we re all going to take short trips in our cars near our homes with our lunches packed and our face coverings in our pockets and i figured i should go on one too so i took a day trip two of them actually two visits to walden pond in concord an hour from our quarantined home where better i thought to explore the idea of isolation it s what thoreau did albeit for nearly 800 days not 80 thoreau was the original social distancer though his isolation unlike ours was not forced in two days at walden here is some of what i found winter and then summer though just 12 days apart an empty parking lot and then one so full it was blocked kayakers picnickers swimmers in both wet suits and bikinis walkers in masks fishermen in waders and a woman who emerged from the water to tell me of having visited walden more than 500 times between those walden visits i read walden itself reread it if you count high school which i shouldn t and tangentially i tumbled down the rabbit hole of never ending debate over thoreau s cultural reputation and literary standing was thoreau a hypocrite was thoreau a fraud was thoreau in the characterization offered by a 2015 new yorker headline pond scum so my day trips bloomed into something more which is maybe what we should wish from our day trips if they re all we have it s what thoreau would have wanted on that first visit in april you could feel thoreau there you could not help thinking of his circumstances 175 years ago when he decamped to this place and how strangely those circumstances echo our own you could picture thoreau in his home depot shed grappling with isolation being sheltered on a circumscribed parcel of earth and feeling like he had no idea what was coming next like us a man must generally get away some hundreds or thousands of miles from home before he can be said to begin his travels wrote thoreau why not begin his travels at home would he have to go far or look very closely to discover novelties why not indeed but before we return to walden the pond or even walden the book what about the pandemic prompted travel question that led to this adventure in the first place will americans even go on vacation this summer not as intended they won t already 66 of americans have canceled their summer vacation plans leaving unclear the matter of whether they ll substitute different ones according to mmgy global a travel industry marketing firm mmgy identifies three factors affecting consumer willingness to travel perception of safety economic factors and isolation orders as many of us continue to lead lives sheltered in place the simplest of travel activities seem fantastical says katie briscoe mmgy s president when will travelers feel safe to step on a plane when will hotels welcome guests again not for a while according to a harris poll a majority of americans say they ll wait at least seven months before they ll fly on a plane and four months before they ll stay in a hotel which for most of the country essentially wipes out overnight travel for the entire summer some 58 of travelers say that restaurants will be off their itineraries until july or later as for cruises 57 say they won t get on a ship for a year or longer and 23 say they ll never take another cruise again people just feel safer controlling their own experience says ms briscoe whether that be in their car around friends and family or just back in trusted and familiar places this represents the beginning of travel recovery there are some exceptions to the general travel collapse that illustrate what the analysts describe at the same time that two thirds of people have scuttled their vacation plans and canceled the flights and hotel rooms that go with them campground operators are being swamped with reservations warren meyer owner of recreation resource management runs 150 campgrounds and day use recreation sites on public parks and land across the united states those of us two or three hours away from travelers homes are going to be mobbed this summer he predicts reservations at rrm run sites are running 20 ahead of their 2019 rates we re going to be full everywhere all the time people are not scared of camping he says you travel in your own car you sleep in your own shelter you keep your distance while cooking your own dinner in the ventilated outdoors plus in times of uncertainty it becomes increasingly attractive he says to pay 25 to camp under the red rocks in sedona arizona instead of 400 to stay in a lodge at yellowstone mr meyer has seen this kind of dynamic before during the great recession campsite occupancy never fell the cheap travel option thrived similarly after 9 11 in the summer of 2002 when people still didn t want to fly we had a record camping year he notes still rrm has to weather the lockdown if it s going to flourish in the summer before some states began to ease restrictions in may 143 of the company s 150 facilities were shuttered and rrm like every business has a breaking point mr meyer says the company will be in big trouble if it doesn t open by memorial day of course only 14 of americans camp whereas almost everyone say the analysts will day trip but where to to do what no one knows how long many attractions such as museums and theme parks will remain closed or limited a currently invaluable benefit of day trips is flexibility william schaffner a health policy expert at vanderbilt university in nashville tennessee told afar magazine social distancing in a variety of forms is going to be with us for a long time it s easy enough to maintain distance though if you drive chicago s suburbs with a map of frank lloyd wright houses in your lap or exit miami for a day of snorkeling in nearby bahia honda state park in the florida keys in sum think hyperlocal that s the buzzword of the moment among travel industry insiders we ll be staying near not going far maybe we ll be discovering about our own backyards what dorothy went to oz and back to figure out except no balloons we ll be driving according to mmgy chief executive officer clayton reid 2020 could well become the year of the car a likelihood abetted by gas prices that are now lower in 20 states than at any time in u s history inflation adjusted the great american day trip is on i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately so begins perhaps the most iconic line among thoreau s many but the reality of it wasn t that simple nor anywhere near that iconic the thoreau who went to walden was far from the prophet he s often made out to be he was mostly just a young man at loose ends 27 years old no attachments few prospects little idea of his path he had gone to new york chasing a writer s life and returned to concord homesick and unsuccessful he had started a school with his brother john only to lose both the school and far worse his brother when john died of complications from cutting his finger in the spring of 1845 thoreau could have been the sad second cousin in a jane austen novel he was hungry for something his prospects of finding it were slim if he decided to go live in the woods there was no one to stop him none of which makes his experiment in deliberate living less brave or ambitious when you go to walden that s part of what you sense you walk the rolling rocky ground around the pond and climb the small slope to where the tiny cabin was and you can t help but think of the new england winter and the cold and the snow you think of the fire he burned incessantly and the wood he chopped to feed it you think of the food he laid up and the vermin that ate it you think of how hard it must have been for all his claims about his leisure it s easy to get walden wrong i know i did before reading it again somewhere along the line we stopped letting the experience breathe and turned it into a few quotes handed down on tablets simplicity simplicity simplicity the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation if a man does not keep pace with his companions perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer you can see them on posters on google just two clicks away they sound like a man who brooks no dissent is unwavering who never entertains doubt but thoreau was full of doubt and he let his mind waver a lot he both hated work and exalted it was both an introvert and an extrovert on the one hand he said i never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude on the other he decreed i think that i love society as much as most and am ready enough to fasten myself like a bloodsucker for the time to any full blooded man that comes in my way i am naturally no hermit every idea he encountered he tried on desperate to feel each one as tangibly as a stone in a hand we too often mistake walden as a book about finding finding the path finding the truth finding the way but it s not it s a book about searching it is on my second trip to walden on a may day suddenly gleaming and warm that i meet christina davis she comes out of the pond after wading in thoreau s cove aren t you cold someone asks her she isn t you get used to it she says she swims here every year on may 1 she s been coming since 1996 and now has been here more than 500 times we sit down to talk what kind of person visits a site 500 times ms davis doesn t mind trying to explain emphasis on try she says since she s not fully sure herself she is a poet author and curator of the woodberry poetry room at harvard university s lamont library but in 1996 she d just finished three years of graduate study at oxford university and discovered she needed to come home to america turned out i was more american than i d thought she says i needed to reacquaint myself she was living in new york then and at loose ends one day she ventured north by train to boston and then concord and then by foot two miles from the station to the pond a pilgrimage she s never stopped making them you have your pilgrimages don t you she says over the years she s done most of the things you can do at walden she s sat on rocks and written poems with her ankles in the water she s ice skated she s made friends all while you feel a personal relationship with this person called henry she shyly quotes something she has written it is with this i have formed a family as shadows grow we walk on pine needles up the path to the original site of thoreau s hut ms davis stops points at the brown wooden sign now that s a sentence she says it s a poem that sentence it s perfect her awe causes me to look again better yet causes me to forget the quote books and commencement speeches that have dulled the line to me here it is thoreau in full i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived after ms davis leaves i linger for a moment on the ground where the hut had been marked now by granite posts and chains around the periphery the afternoon is ending and no one is here there are only the sounds of shouts far across the water and now and then the echoed thunk of an oar on a boat hull as i write this lockdowns are being lifted on various timetables in various places of course unlike thoreau s isolation ours has involved lamps not candles bathrooms not pits we have had the internet and zoom and netflix but right now it can feel like we know as little about what comes next as thoreau did when he made his experiment soon as summer unspools we ll all travel again just not as far as we d planned we ll think hyperlocal we ll forget our overstuffed vacation itineraries of old and dial down the pressure we ll day trip maybe as i did on my outing you ll reacquaint yourself with your local thoreau or that nearby wonder that turns out no less wonderful for its modesty or someplace you ve seen plenty but never really looked at if you re fortunate you ll meet your christina davis you ll go slower you ll expect less you ll discover unimagined things precisely because you didn t think you had to would we have to go far or look very closely to discover novelties thoreau asked at walden beside a common new england pond in an ordinary new england woods one doesn t think so one thinks we can make discoveries in our own backyards for a very long time and as we do maybe we ll find our way back to the place all our quarantines and social distancing have made us hungriest for maybe we ll be able to say about ourselves what thoreau was finally able to say in walden get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox at present i am a sojourner in civilized life again editor s note
