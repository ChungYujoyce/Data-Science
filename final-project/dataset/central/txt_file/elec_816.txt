voters interpret that differently than establishment voters do loading october 27 2016 in the hyperpolarized world of the 2016 election one of the best markers of political division may be a single word corrupt donald trump uses it and its offshoots corruption corrupted a lot he ll begin by referring to specific hillary clinton activities he charges are corrupt such as her use of a private email server as secretary of state and then expand it to cover much of what occurs day to day in washington i want the entire corrupt washington establishment to hear and to hear and to heed the words i am about to say mr trump said at a north carolina rally wednesday if we win on nov 8 we are going to washington d c and we are going to drain the swamp the image is striking the entire corrupt washington establishment is fetid stinking and needs to be swabbed out some of this is pure partisanship of course but there s a deeper division over what corruption means to the clinton campaign to establishment democrats at large to many anti trump republicans and to much of official washington corrupt largely refers to facts it is a charge of self dealing or other type of bounded illegality it is investigated through appropriate channels evidence is aired and weighed it is established or not to populists the insurgent wing of the gop some of the democratic left and others historically suspicious of established authority it s more of a feeling that something about the system is fundamentally flawed after all it was left wing sen bernie sanders who earlier this month said trump s ability to avoid paying federal income taxes highlighted the corrupt political system in this country such concerns about the system are widely shared fully 75 percent of americans think corruption is widespread in the country s government according toa gallup poll from september 2015 that s up from 67 percent in 2007 it is trump who has capitalized the most on this suspicion running less on implementable policies than emotions he uses corrupt as an all purpose negative modifier that links together all the things he opposes in general the entire election at least what we re hearing from the republican side is about conspiracy says jennifer mercieca historian of american political rhetoric at texas a m university and corruption is the action of conspiracy will this work for trump wikileaks is putting some details into trump s generally vague charges after all its latest leak is a 12 page memo that outlines the tangled business ties between ex president bill clinton former aides and the clinton foundation that s part of a steady drip of revelations about actions which whatever their legality seem politically inept at best darkly conspiratorial at worst on monday james o keefe s controversial project veritas which infiltrated the clinton campaign released an undercover video reinforcing the conspiracy theme it showed democratic operatives talking about how they encouraged violence at trump rallies and other gop events the two democratic operatives have left their positions that video and others released this week have generated plenty of attention in conservative circles but they have received relatively little attention in the mainstream media in part because the group s reporting has been misleading in the past afebruary column from new york times writer david brooks might exemplify what s behind this split as political primary season got under way the center right leaning mr brooks decided to list the ways he d miss president obama brooks said he disagreed with many of obama s policies but he d come to appreciate the president s basic decency he said there had been nothing like the reagan era iran contra affair during the obama years the obama administration has been remarkably scandal free brooks wrote a wide array of conservative writers and interest groups denounced this conclusion as ludicrous their list of perceived scandals began with benghazi and included the fast and furious gun sting operation the irs treatment of conservative nonprofits the botched rollout of the obamacare website and a dysfunctional bureaucracy that denied vets health care from the department of veterans affairs brooks conclusion ignored a culture of corruption that has seeped into every major federal agency over the past eight years wrote conservative writer and pundit michelle malkin at the time the columnist and his critics may have been arguing less over the facts than about their implication to brooks and other establishment figures some of what ms malkin labeled corruption was perhaps something less nefarious incompetence or bad luck or poor planning or not even a problem at all to the gop populists they were more evidence of nefarious connections a web a confederacy of dunces obama s scandals didn t get more publicity because the mainstream media is part of the defending team a corrupt media is willing to overlook massive amounts of evidence of malfeasance to benefit their allies in the democratic party wrote roger aronoff of the conservative accuracy in media watchdog group following the brooks column in some ways the ease with which the right throws around the word corrupt is a throwback to the founding fathers notes professor mercieca they had inherited a more expansive meaning of the word from greek and roman political tradition to george washington partisanship by itself was a corrupt practice that changed with the rise of political parties now in our own time the republican party has returned to this broader definition to discredit democratic administrations this has been greatly amplified by the rise of a conservative media establishment more interested in its principles than actually gaining power so much of center right political discourse over the last 10 years or more has really been rooted in this notion of conspiracy mercieca says the apparent is not the real a trump loss wouldn t do much to change this dynamic if hillary clinton does win the oval office a gop controlled house is almost certain to mount yet more inquiries into the details of her emails her benghazi testimony and the clinton foundation get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox and at least one clinton adversary has gone so far as to raise the i word in
