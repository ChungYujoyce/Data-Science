hide caption mitt romney the presumptive republican presidential candidate arrives to announce his choice of running mate aboard the u s s wisconsin in norfolk va on aug 11 during the next two weeks the major political parties will assemble their faithful in tampa fla and charlotte n c to officially nominate their presidential tickets these conventions were once places of high political drama but over the decades as the primary system has determined the candidates well in advance conventions have become political theater with that in mind there s much to be said on staging in politics not substance but style in the theater stars are stars at least partly because of the way they re presented in brighter lighting on higher platforms lesser characters can walk onstage stars make an entrance preferably at the top of a staircase with the rest of the cast looking up as angela lansbury did in mame or richard kiley did in man of la mancha and last week when presumptive republican nominee mitt romney introduced his running mate rep paul ryan in norfolk va he took a page from that playbook then nominee barack obama s speech at the 2008 democratic national convention at invesco field at mile high in denver colo was carefully staged against a backdrop of classical pillars max whittaker getty images hide caption then nominee barack obama s speech at the 2008 democratic national convention at invesco field at mile high in denver colo was carefully staged against a backdrop of classical pillars there was a slight kink in the introduction he left the vice out of vice president essentially introducing ryan as the next commander in chief but romney s glitch ceased to matter the moment the camera zoomed out for a wide shot of the u s s wisconsin high above the stage heralded by a fanfare from the movie air force one was ryan and as he bounded down a staircase it felt as if the technicians had learned from romney s entrance a few moments earlier they d let their presidential candidate hit the stage during a musical lull but for ryan they timed the music perfectly it peaked just as he walked those last few steps to embrace his running mate weeks of rehearsal could not have made it more effective it s soaring emotionally resonant because the music s all but dictating your reaction the republicans let s note have not always been quite so securely at the top of their game in the last presidential race it was the democrats who owned the political staging remember that football stadium they outfitted like a greek amphitheater for their convention finale then candidate barack obama was framed for his acceptance speech by towering columns on a majestic classical stage set to communicate the idea that history was being made a week later the republicans offered candidate sen john mccain far more simply in a spotlight on a bare stage though his teleprompter was silhouetted like a music stand so that it looked like he was about to give a concert no music pumped up his arrival there was an imax sized screen behind him though when it filled with a billowing american flag the flag looked fabulous but as the cameras pulled back to capture the full effect the candidate looked tiny now if you re a theater nut you know that whether you re talking classical theater or political theater staging matters that s why campaigns seek picture perfect backdrops for speeches natural vistas when the subject is the environment shuttered factories when talking unemployment and conventions are a campaign s most controlled public space the one spot where everything can be made to serve the message so during the next two weeks it s likely to be instructive to turn down the sound on your tv and pay attention not to what the candidates are saying but to how they re being framed rest assured it s all by design to counter perceptions that romney is aloof and distant for instance republican strategists are designing their stage in tampa to have the warmth of a living room with stairs running from the podium into the audience to convey the candidate s approachability the democrats meanwhile will return in charlotte to what worked so well for them in denver their supporting cast will play a 19 000 seat indoor arena while their leading man will deliver his acceptance speech to a far larger crowd in the city s 73 000 seat football stadium will any of this matter well sure in the sense that conventions can provide a temporary bounce in the polls but in theatrical terms a party s convention is only its opening number splashy spectacle designed to introduce the players and set the tone for what s to come there s still plenty of time on the campaign trail for falling in love with the hero for hissing the villain for building to that big number in the final act that seals the deal npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
