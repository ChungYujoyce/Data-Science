election cycle cody nelson mpr news hide caption sen amy klobuchar holds an event at shift cyclery coffee bar in eau claire wis on feb 16 klobuchar is among the democratic presidential hopefuls paying attention to wisconsin in this election cycle here s something democrats thought they knew during the last presidential campaign wisconsin was safe it was a lock for democratic nominee hillary clinton but when the votes were counted it was a stunning upset for republican donald trump in 2020 democrats apparently aren t taking the state for granted even though the first nominating contests in iowa and new hampshire are some 11 months away and with wisconsin s primary not until april 7 of next year the campaign stops have already begun sen amy klobuchar spoke to a packed bicycle shop and coffee house in eau claire two weeks ago it was the first stop on her very first campaign trip since declaring her candidacy a week earlier klobuchar highlighted a family history in the midwest including wisconsin i do not come from money the candidate began my mom was a teacher my dad was a newspaperman my grandpa was an iron ore miner and those relatives in wisconsin during the depression my grandpa worked in a pie shop heading to eau claire was a practical choice it s not far from the wisconsin border with minnesota klobuchar s home state iowa is right next door as well there was also symbolism in the form of the message it sent to democrats everywhere that a traditionally blue battleground won t be ignored this time clinton s missed opportunity in the 2016 election the clinton campaign had a relaxed approach to wisconsin from the time she accepted the nomination in late july right up to election day clinton never campaigned in the state in person she made zero visits to the state in those crucial final months leaving that task to surrogates wisconsin delegates are seen during democratic national convention in philadelphia in july 2016 where hillary clinton won the democratic party nomination for president drew angerer getty images hide caption the democrats had pretty good reason to take that approach after all the last republican to capture the state s electoral votes was president ronald reagan in 84 and in 2016 the polls in the state pointed to that trend continuing my poll and all 33 other polls in the state showed clinton leading by an average of about 6 points says pollster charles franklin of marquette university law school still trump s campaign treated wisconsin like a hotly contested battleground he made repeated visits there in the final 100 days of the campaign at a rally in the city eau claire in the western more rural part of the state he predicted in just one week we are going to win the great state of wisconsin and we are going to win back the white house it s going to happen folks ultimately trump carried wisconsin by just 22 177 votes a winning margin of less than 1 percent it was part of a trio of upsets in previously blue states that included michigan and pennsylvania giving him the margin he needed to win the white house in december 2016 then house speaker paul ryan and gov scott walker gave president elect donald trump and vice president elect mike pence green bay packers jerseys in honor of winning their home state of wisconsin morry gash ap hide caption there are a lot of things factoring into that result of course but pollster charles franklin says two things happened trump did well in the rural western side of the state a more republican area but one that barack obama had managed to carry plus franklin adds turnout in the state s largest urban area the democratic stronghold of milwaukee was significantly lower than expected that resulted in fewer votes overall for clinton in a big city where she needed to run up the score upset victories in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania combined were key to trump s electoral college victory talk to everybody everywhere democrats have been taking notes klobuchar hardly has wisconsin to herself this time around another potential democratic presidential hopeful dropped in recently former rep beto o rourke at a tour of the milwaukee area technical college he said it s good that the state is getting attention wisconsin perhaps like other parts of the country perhaps even including where i m from in far west texas too often is overlooked he said o rourke said he s still deciding whether to enter the presidential race meanwhile wisconsin democratic party chairperson martha laning says she s been hearing from other candidates about early visits to the state as well it sends a message to the whole nation laning tells npr of the candidates she adds that it s evident that after what happened in 2016 they re not going to take anything for granted and they re stopping by wisconsin right now but laning stresses that candidate visits are only part of it yes there are lessons from clinton s absence last time but she acknowledges that the wisconsin democrats need to be better at reaching voters in every part of the state urban and rural blue and red wisconsin democratic party chair martha laning meets wisconsin assembly candidate ann groves lloyd in april 2018 in portage wis laning notes that the 2018 midterms were a positive sign for democrats morry gash ap hide caption she says the 2018 midterms were a good start as it was a very strong democratic year in wisconsin they easily re elected democratic sen tammy baldwin and they defeated republican gov scott walker who had been seeking a third term in office laning says the lesson of 2016 s defeat is that you need to talk to voters everywhere and if you pick up an unexpected vote here or a vote there it can make the difference when there s another election with a razor thin margin just ask president trump npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
