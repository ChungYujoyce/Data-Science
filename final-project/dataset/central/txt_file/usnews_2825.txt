it s a warm september day at a quaint winery in new mexico but while photos of happy brides and grooms line the walls the people gathered here today aren t celebrating a marriage they re here to see brad parscale parscale president trump s 2020 campaign manager has a message for the 60 or so trump supporters on hand at the sept 17 gathering volunteering is how you win he says don t expect just money on tv and a digital program is going to win this again trump s campaign is betting big on grassroots organizing in 2020 a significant change from his unorthodox and thinly staffed 2016 campaign they ve created the trump victory leadership initiative a training program for volunteers and organizers modeled on the fellowship program barack obama s campaign pioneered in 2008 and 2012 according to parscale the trump campaign had 700 000 trained volunteers in 2016 this time they re aiming for 2 million in 2016 trump s team had 5 000 trained fellows a more experienced type of volunteer parscale says they re already at 30 000 for the 2020 election the introduction of a new volunteer training program is the clearest sign yet that the trump campaign is trying to evolve from its bare bones rally and tv focused 2016 roots to a professional campaign operation that marries big money a national field program and local coordination it carries opportunities for trump s campaign which is focused on boosting turnout among the president s core supporters and has time and party resources on his side the staff and infrastructure is only going to be larger going into this cycle says chris carr the political director for the trump campaign and the republican national committee rnc we have a much longer runway to work now we can actually afford to have a cadillac operation as they build their program parscale and others on the campaign and at the rnc have been studying the book groundbreakers how obama s 2 2 million volunteers transformed campaigning in america a senior campaign official told time it s not the first time republicans have turned to obama s historic campaign for tactical guidance in 2016 for example texas sen ted cruz gave copies of obama s former campaign manager david plouffe s book to his senior presidential campaign team telling them to nakedly and shamelessly emulate this some veteran obama hands are skeptical that team trump can pull it off it s one thing to say you read a book and that you re going to do a training says jeremy bird president of 270 strategies and the former national field director for obama s 2012 campaign it s another thing to actually embody that and there s still some stigma among republicans about the very idea of this type of campaigning community organizing one trump campaign official joked in a text message to time who are we democrats but the campaign believes it has an opportunity to marry obama s organizing blueprint to the intensity of trump s core supporters they re eyeing people like michelle garcia holmes who has run for lieutenant governor of new mexico and mayor of albuquerque holmes was a lifelong democrat she says until she voted for trump in 2016 she went to trump s rally in rio rancho n m monday night and to tuesday s event at the winery now she wants to get more involved absolutely she says when asked tuesday if she s planning to volunteer for trump this cycle some former obama aides worry that republicans have caught up to democrats when it comes to organizing joy cushman a deputy field director for obama s 2008 campaign published an op ed in the new york times in august titled the trump campaign knows why obama won do democrats cushman wrote i fear that the wealthy elites on the left have less respect than ever before for the strategies that got mr obama elected if democrats want to win in 2020 they must get back to investing in the power of everyday people through organizing that s why parscale and other members of the trump team are spending time in blue states like new mexico imploring people to sign up to volunteer and get trained remember winning elections is not about what i do on my computer or what we do across the country parscale the digital media director for trump s 2016 campaign tells supporters in new mexico it s what you do in neighborhoods the campaign s data shows that there is a 15 lift in turnout in an area where the campaign has fully built out a neighborhood team leader model parscale asked the supporters at the winery to text a campaign number send an email or sign up online so the campaign can build its list and tells them to choose your weapon of social media platform those who want to go the extra mile to become more skilled volunteers or organizers can participate in trump victory leadership initiative trainings the sessions last about six weeks and teach new organizers how to do voter registration how to use an app to mobilize volunteers and how to go door to door in exercises that simulate a super saturday obama s team stressed this type of formal experiential training the biggest difference is we really invested the staff and the resources to make a training program that took people all the way through says bird as opposed to what i had seen before which was trainings that were one off sessions that were done now and again in the obama fellowship program organizers were taught policy and messaging and how to effectively manage volunteers as well as learning tangible on the ground skills according to bird this type of investment in volunteers and relational organizing presents its own challenges for any campaign having a large network of organizers and volunteers is messier harder to control and requires more trust in people on a local level but trump s supporters say they re up to the challenge standing beside a row of grapevines after listening to parscale sally gomez 66 is feeling inspired after the morning s event i sure will she says when asked if she s planning to volunteer i m a senior citizen so i do have the time so whatever they need me to do i ll be glad to do which is what the trump team is counting on registering new voters is going to be a big part of what we are doing says carr the campaign s political director republican operatives the gop the national party we got away from voter registration that is not something we are going to overlook this cycle with reporting by
