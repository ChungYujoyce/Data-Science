welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at snug harbor cultural center ms clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on staten island today after republican donald trump delivered a typical stump speech at a republican brunch but ms clinton perhaps sensing or recalling staten island s ever present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough which is more conservative than the rest of new york city the majority of its voters are registered democrats but the borough
