washington as the number of coronavirus infections in russia increases exponentially paul whelan s family is more terrified than ever about his fate the 50 year old michigan man has already spent more than 16 months in a moscow prison on espionage chargesamid escalating concerns about his physical and mental health now whelan and other americans detained by hostile governments face a new threat as prisons around the world become breeding grounds for covid 19 you think well it can t really get any worse and then the pandemic comes said david whelan paul s twin brother from what we understand the ppe personal protective equipment that prisoners are given is a face mask and an onion a day i guess the onion is for vitamin c or something david whelan said president donald trump has long touted his success in securing the release of americans held abroad and state department officials have used the pandemic to ratchet up pressure on some foreign governments to free detained americans if you are wrongfully detaining americans during this time and they become infected and die of coronavirus we will hold your government strictly responsible secretary of state mike pompeo said at an april 29 news briefing all wrongfully detained americans should be released immediately but pompeo isn t the only diplomat to seize on covid 19 as an opening for prisoner negotiations nor have other governments been shy about highlighting the danger of coronavirus infection in american prisons the bureau of prisons hasreported 2 100 coronavirus infections among prisoners and 320 cases among staff at least 42 inmates in the u s have died from covid 19 last week russia s ambassador to the u s anatoly antonov posted an open letter to the u s state department justice department and bureau of prisons pleading for the release of russians who have committed nonviolent offenses and have underlying health conditions their life and health are under the threat antonov wrote in his letterposted on facebook similarly iranian officials have said they want to negotiate a prisoner swap with the u s we hope that as the outbreak of the covid 19 disease threatens the lives of iranian citizens in the u s prisons the u s government eventually will prefer lives to politics ali rabiei an iranian cabinet spokesman said on sunday according to an iranian outlet he said iran was ready to talk without conditions but the u s had not responded a state department spokesman did not respond directly to rabiei s remarks but said the trump administration continues to prioritize the release of americans detained in iran and elsewhere the spokesman who was not authorized to speak on the record said iran had agreed to extend a medical furlough formichael white an american navy veteran who contracted covid 19 in an iranian prison in march after white became infected he was transferred into the custody of the swiss embassy in tehran which acts as a diplomatic mediator between the u s and iran we remain concerned for mr white s health as well as for the health and safety of all u s citizens wrongfully detained in iran the spokesman said a spokesman for white s familysaid his mother spends every night wishing for her son s safe return he is a cancer survivor so his health was already a major concern for her she lives on pins and needles said jonathan franks the spokesman white is still dealing with the aftereffects of his covid 19 infection and his return to the united states is particularly urgent in light of the pandemic he said iran was hit early and hard when the novel coronavirus began spreading across the globe to date it has reported more than 100 000 infections and 6 600 deaths according to data from the johns hopkins university coronavirus tracker russia has become a hot spot more recently reporting11 656 new cases on sunday alone overall russia has220 000 reported infections and more than 2 000 deaths critics say the death toll is likely much higher than that and it s unclear what s happening inside russia s prisons amnesty international has warned of a looming catastrophe saying the russian penitentiary system is already overcrowded with poor ventilationand inadequate medical care and lax sanitary conditions many prisoners already have poor health they are in penal colonies hundreds of kilometers from home and away from civilian hospitals natalya prilutskaya amnesty international s researcher for russia said in a march 31 statement urgent measures must be taken to prevent a potential catastrophe on april 28 the russian news agencyinterfax reported 271 cases of coronavirus among employees of the federal penitentiary service and 40 cases among prisoners david whelan said russia has closed its prisons and courts to outside visitors meaning u s embassy officials have not been able to visit his brothereven as his trial began in late march he said paul mentioned getting a face mask and his daily onion ration ina note he sent through his lawyers the note asked for help obtaining some legal documents for his trial the russian government has accused whelan of espionage his family says the charges are absurd and flat out false the state department and u s embassy officials in moscow have also questioned russia s spying allegations and expressed concern about his treatment we also continue to monitor mr whelan s case closely and to press for fair and humane treatment unrestricted consular access and access to appropriate medical care said the state department spokesman we will continue to raise mr whelan s case at every opportunityand will continue to press for access to the court hearings which have been closed to the public up to this point david whelan says he has not seen any evidence of increased pressure from the trump administration on the russian government to release his brother amid the pandemic it sounds a little bit like empty words to me he said when asked about pompeo s threat to hold foreign government s accountable for covid 19 cases in at least one case however trump s ramped up pressure campaign has borne some fruit on march 19 the president announced that amer fakhoury anaturalized american citizen from lebanon was on his way home to new hampshire after negotiations with the lebanese government it was a big thing very big the president said noting thatfakhoury haslate stage cancer and needed medical treatment in the u s he would have died had he stayed there saidceline atallah a lawyer for fakhoury s family when the virus began to spread in lebanon atallah said his four daughters became terrified they were crying all the time now they re still worried about his healthbut relieved he is getting cancer treatment back in the u s she said atallah said she s thrilled the trump administration is making it apriority to get americans releasedfrom hostile governments but argued thatthe u s should demand the same from allies including saudi arabia which is holding at least two u s citizens if they are truly our allies they should act like it and immediately send our citizens back home she said
