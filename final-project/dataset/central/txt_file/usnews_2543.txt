that the hundreds of parents removed from the country without their kids under the zero tolerance policy chose to leave them behind if any parent has been deported without their child health and human services secretary alex azar said last month that likely would be a scenario where the parent had actually asked that the child remain the trump administration rolled back the zero tolerance policy in june in response to public backlash against the more than 2 500 family separations that took place at the border during the crackdown in recent weeks the country s attention has drifted away from the humanitarian crisis at the border as hundreds of immigrant families have reunited in picture perfect scenes at airports and government facilities across the country but with the summer drawing to a close more than 500 migrant children remain apart from their parents despite a court order requiring the u s government to reunite every separated family by july 26 parents of 366 of the still separated children have already been sent back to their home countries xol s case highlights the legal and bureaucratic obstacles preventing the government from swiftly reuniting those families as well as the emotional toll that the zero tolerance policy continues to exact on separated parents and children for every parent who is not located there will be a permanently orphaned child u s

not the same xol said it felt very empty in his first calls home byron cried and begged his father to come for him he asked why he d been abandoned in texas but byron doesn t cry anymore after a few weeks his sadness turned to resentment if i am your son find a way to come and get me out he told his father recently now he only wants to speak with his mother during the weekly calls my son has started to hate me xol said he said why did you leave me am i not your son i told him not to say that this kid needs a lawyer a farmworker with no formal education xol grew up in the village of san miguel lim n in a region that was ravaged by fighting during the decades long guatemalan civil war which officially ended in 1996 when xol was 5 years old even after a peace agreement was signed in guatemala city xol said the violence continued to rage in the country s rural villages in the late 1990s soldiers shot his grandfather he said two decades later xol lives in a small cottage in san miguel a 7 hour drive from guatemala city the nearest hospital is more than 100 kilometers away he starts his days before dawn when he gets water for his family from the nearby river before going to work at a palm oil farm run by palmas del ixcan a guatemalan agriculture company with no access to the internet he communicates with the outside world using an old fashioned mobile phone where he also keeps a grainy photograph of byron when he left guatemala in may xol planned to work in the united states for a few years then return to san miguel with enough money to pay off a loan two years ago he said he had a run in with local gang members who tied him up and threw him into a river despite that harrowing experience he said he never intended to request asylum in the u s or put down permanent roots in my family we suffer with a lack of money xol said i don t have a good job so that was the intention going to the u s to work to give a better life to my sons in the future xol said he brought byron with him on the advice of a local smuggler who told him that parents with children have an easier time getting into the country than adults traveling solo he also hoped to enroll his son in school in the u s in early may the smuggler guided xol and byron to the mexican state of chiapas on the border with guatemala from that point the pair rode in a pickup truck to villahermosa a city in southern mexico where they spent a week in a safe house before smugglers loaded them into a tractor trailer along with around five dozen other immigrants xol said he and byron shared a wooden crate with two of the other migrants speaking in whispers as the tractor trailer made its way north to the mexican border city of reynosa just across the rio grande from mcallen despite the cramped conditions xol felt lucky the crate had three tiny air holes i was never afraid he said but he said not everyone on board survived the grueling trip at one point xol heard screams from the other crates a woman had suffocated to escape the stench of her corpse the immigrant who was sitting next to the woman when she died joined xol and byron who squeezed together to make room xol and byron reached american soil on may 18 about two weeks after they left home according to court documents i felt hope xol recalled but nothing went as it was planned xol s journey back to guatemala at the end of may was significantly faster a plane took him from texas to guatemala city in a matter of hours but how long it will take the authorities to get byron back to alta verapaz remains anyone s guess in a court filing earlier this month the u s department of justice outlined a plan for reuniting the remaining families that calls for the american civil liberties union the group that successfully sued to end the family separations to make many of the arrangements itself using information provided by the government there s still no clear indication of the government s willingness to do this said efr n olivares an official with the texas civil rights project i don t think there is a political will on their end we need to keep the pressure on at the moment byron who turned 8 in june has no hearing date in immigration court according to two people familiar with the case nor does he have family members in the u s to monitor his situation or help get him back to guatemala this kid needs a lawyer said jodi goodwin an immigration attorney in harlingen had this family had an advocate on their side i think they could ve gotten this worked out the case was at a standstill until late last week when the celebrity lawyer michael avenatti and his laredo based associate civil rights attorney ricardo de anda agreed to represent the family pro bono avenatti and de anda were alerted to byron s case by sylvia rodriguez an immigrant advocate in new jersey who has worked with the family this summer and raised money to support separated children in recent weeks avenatti an outspoken trump critic better known as the attorney representing porn star stormy daniels in her legal battle with the president has collaborated with de anda on a number of family separation cases including the reunion of an immigrant child named antony with his deported mother in guatemala city on aug 14 the new legal team has two options for reuniting xol and byron ask an immigration judge to grant byron a voluntary departure so that he can return to guatemala or seek to overturn xol s original deportation paving the way for him to reunite with his son in the u s and seek asylum de anda said that after preliminary conversations with xol he s leaning toward the second option when he spoke with his client last week de anda said xol described his past run ins with gangs in guatemala as a potential source of danger for his family the maras have been pressing to recruit him into their criminal activities he refused to be pressed into this sort of action the attorney said using the spanish word for gangs he s been beat up before and he s afraid he ll be beat up again still alta verapaz generally has a very low gang presence according to pablo castillo a spokesman for guatemala s national police and xol has made clear that he does not want the reunification to take place in the u s my wife has been giving me advice about taking it slow and seeing what we can do for him to come he said we both have been praying to god for our kid to come back soon any effort to overturn xol s deportation order and bring him back to the u s could prolong byron s separation for weeks or months immigration experts say overturning a deportation order is extremely extremely complicated and would probably take lots of fancy footwork said goodwin the harlingen based attorney and then bringing someone back is yet another nightmarish hurdle de anda acknowledged the possible downsides of attempting to overturn xol s deportation order but he added the safety of the child is paramount it needs to be clear to me that byron will not be placed in danger if he s returned to guatemala he said where is my son xol didn t tell his wife he had been separated from byron until he arrived back in alta verapaz at the end of may i didn t want her to feel bad when i was coming he said she didn t know anything the day he returned florinda went outside to greet xol as a bus dropped him off at their cottage in san miguel she hadn t heard a word from her husband since he and byron arrived in reynosa earlier that month where is the child she said in q eqchi as xol climbed out of the bus my son where is he he stayed there xol told her florinda let out a shriek i couldn t say anything xol recalled she started to scream and scream he stood and watched her in silence don t cry he said after a moment he s going to come back unlike some other facilities for immigrant children the bcfs shelter in baytown has no history of child abuse or serious safety violations according to state records during his time in the u s byron who spoke only q eqchi when he set out for the border in may has begun to pick up some spanish and english but that s little consolation to his parents in san miguel where neighbors have begun to gossip about the family s missing child in my class i have 19 students said carlos pop byron s first grade teacher today only 18 were present there is one that is in the u s they say xol said he faces constant questions from nosy villagers about his trip to the border they say you went because you are dumb he said that s the first thing they say how did you not think you left your son in the u s as byron s separation from his parents stretches into its fourth month small town gossip and family tension are the least of xol s problems to finance his unsuccessful journey north he had to borrow money from a friend and take out a third mortgage on his house now he s scrambling to make payments on 8 000 in debt handing all his monthly earnings to the bank a trip designed to build a better life for his children has turned into a financial nightmare with the family struggling to pay bills and his son stranded in texas xol said he has contemplated suicide it s not that i am not a man he said but i don t know how to pull through anymore xol and florinda got a boost on june 24 byron s eighth birthday when three dozen congregants from the local evangelical church gathered at their cottage to eat tamales and pray i had never received so many people at my house xol said but even in the company of dozens of friends and well wishers he said the family felt
