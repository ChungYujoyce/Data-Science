democrats energy in november as well as their votes loading february 8 2016 kalyn dasilva a student at franklin pierce university in rindge n h is all in for bernie sanders she s been doing dorm storms at her school knocking on doors telling fellow students about senator sanders offering bus rides to the polls finally over the weekend just days before tuesday s new hampshire primary ms dasilva got to see the rumpled septuagenarian in the flesh at a raucous rally at her school s fieldhouse bernie speaks the truth and everything he says he believes in now he believed in 30 years ago says dasilva a psychology major wearing a bright blue students for bernie t shirt and what if hillary clinton is the democratic nominee i m not sure i ve always been i wouldn t vote republican but it depends she says i have one republican in mind who i d probably vote for marco rubio he just kind of seems like the most realistic out of them such a response is a dagger to the heart of the clinton campaign not only are they counting on young voters to turn out for them in november including those who go for sanders in the primary they are counting in particular on young women to be inspired by the prospect of the first woman president democratic voters like dasilva are the exception when push comes to shove most say they ll vote for their party s nominee come november but the lack of enthusiasm for mrs clinton by many young democrats could present a profound challenge for the former secretary of state despite her big loss to sanders among voters under age 30 in last week s iowa democratic caucuses 84 percent to 14 percent and an expected loss tuesday in new hampshire clinton is still favored in national polls to win her party s nomination where she loses among the young she wins big among older democratic voters especially women and she ll need all the ground troops she can muster to get out the vote in what is expected to be a closely fought general election young voters a key part of the democratic base were critical to barack obama s victories in 2008 and 2012 both in turnout and in volunteering senator sanders has eroded hillary clinton s appeal to the idealist sometimes unrealistic change oriented young who want to challenge the established order and with it politics as usual writes kathleen hall jamieson director of the annenberg public policy center at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia in an e mail he s accomplished this by successfully associating the clinton campaign s fundraising from large donors her speaking fees and her advocacy of nuanced wall street reform with corruptive power arrangements that advantage the upper 1 percent historically young voters have been a particularly tricky bunch not known for being loyal voters today the so called millennials those under age 35 have little trust in the pillars of society including the government wall street and the media according to a survey released last april by the harvard institute of politics so for a candidate like clinton a washington insider for decades tapping into youthful idealism has been a stretch especially with the idealistic sanders on the scene the spread of social media also has been a boon to the top outsiders in the 2016 race sanders and donald trump there is a common level of frustration and anger and so i think that they have captured the first digital response to political activism says andrew card president of franklin pierce university in rindge speaking of the sanders trump phenomenon they re able to speak with very little filter indeed young democratic voters talk about facebook feeds that are on fire with the debate over sanders vs clinton shawn bond a college student from louisville ky who is volunteering for clinton in new hampshire says his facebook feed is mostly clinton oriented though he s been unfriended by a couple of sanders supporters having an argument on social media is fruitless but on facebook it s all there says mr bond a student at american university in washington taking part in a canvassing event saturday at clinton s concord n h office so it s very easy for a post to be hijacked by someone who doesn t believe the same things i do bond says in his work for clinton he asks his peers to look at who s more capable of getting things done that was a big reason why i picked hillary clinton over bernie sanders he says there was a time when i had this existential crisis and i felt like my friends were supporting bernie sanders and i was supposed to be supporting bernie sanders but once i gave the candidates a real look it became very clear that one has always been a fighter one has a record of getting things done one challenge for clinton which stems from the social media phenomenon is the challenge in correcting misimpressions one franklin pierce student said she couldn t support clinton because she clinton was not always pro choice on abortion clinton in fact has a record of supporting abortion rights since she became a public figure bernie has always been pro choice and always favored equal pay for equal work says the student he almost has more feminist ideals that she does some young women bristle at the notion that they should support clinton because she s a woman i m waiting for the day when i can vote for a woman president who i can completely support who s not hillary says emily brisson a social work student at franklin pierce being a woman is not a reason to cause me to want to vote for her former secretary of state madeleine albright a clinton backer may not have helped matters over the weekend when she asserted at a clinton event here that there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other still the frustration by older women over younger women who shrug at clinton s history making potential is palpable generally young women grew up with less discrimination and didn t have to go through the abortion battles says barbara landwehr a lawyer and clinton supporter in concord n h bernie is more exciting and for some she isn t some observers also note a double standard in the words and actions a male candidate can take versus a woman candidate at franklin pierce sanders at one point theatrically doffs his jacket and hands it to a student sitting behind him i feel like a rock and roll star sanders says to cheers nothing more is coming off that s it it s probably not something a serious female presidential candidate could say some democrats plead for perspective over the hand wringing at clinton s enthusiasm gap among young voters wait for the republicans to settle on a nominee and then get the word out on that person s policy views the choice is going to be very stark no matter who the republican nominee is says democratic strategist peter fenn he notes for example that senator rubio does not allow for any exceptions on abortion including cases of rape and incest get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox i think hillary is very appealing says mr fenn she ll have to work it and get down to those college campuses and get those folks fired up it won t be 2008 when obama lit up campuses with hope and change he adds but he s confident clinton can pull it off link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your subscription to
