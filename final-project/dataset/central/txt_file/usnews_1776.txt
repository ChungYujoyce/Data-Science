if peter navarro ever doubted that he was a democrat a look at the other side was enough to convince him republicans talked about virtue and prosperity but they were really a bunch of greedy intolerant hypocrites he thought the insufferably bigoted close minded and dangerously well disciplined storm troopers on the religious right he wrote in a 1998 memoir san diego confidential wield far too much influence at the ballot box the gop was in thrall to buffoons sociopaths and zealots like rush limbaugh newt gingrich and ralph reed its economic policies consisted of tax schemes to further enrich the rich and its leaders could not be trusted to do anything but trash the environment under the phony banner of economic progress twenty years ago navarro was a liberal economist who admired hillary clinton argued for taxing the rich and had run for office as a democrat four times today he is a top economic adviser to a republican president as donald trump s director of trade and industrial policy navarro is known for his advocacy of tariffs and opposition to trade deals it is navarro who has pushed trump to wage an escalating trade war that pits the u s against not only economic adversaries like china but also allies like canada and the european union he is the most powerful person in washington on the most volatile issue of trump s presidency navarro s positions put him at odds with most economists most republicans and many in the business community but they are in sync with the president s long standing conviction that the u s is being ripped off by other countries trump listens to peter especially when it comes to china says stephen moore a fellow at the conservative heritage foundation who frequently advises trump and who disagrees with the tariff push it is navarro who helps translate trump s beliefs into action supplying him with policy direction affirmation and arguments to help his case his role is akin to that of trump s senior policy adviser stephen miller who has become notorious for pushing trump toward the restrictionist immigration policies he instinctively favors navarro though less well known is the miller of economic policy the voice in trump s ear that eggs him on against the experts his power has grown in recent months navarro 69 won a formal promotion in february most of his free trade opponents on trump s economic team have left the administration the u s has moved aggressively to implement his preferred policies imposing wide ranging tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imported goods trump wants to do protectionism and when almost everyone in the room is saying we cannot do that it ll destroy the economy he ll say where s my peter what does peter think says a prominent conservative trade expert the president looks for validation and the folks keeping the devil off his shoulder have disappeared trump s tariffs have drawn retaliatory actions and jolted the markets they have also created diplomatic headaches complicating relations with america s closest allies most economists believe that in the long run navarro s vision would cause a major hit to the u s economy with rising inflation bankrupt farms and businesses and thousands of lost jobs there is a lot of evidence that inward looking economic policies that isolate a country from the rest of the world are bad for that country says greg mankiw a harvard economist who chaired the council of economic advisers under president george w bush you could make a list of the 100 most prominent economists in the world and peter navarro wouldn t be on it his views are very very far from the mainstream as the trade debate rages the policy s architect remains something of a mystery how did navarro a democrat whose philosophy was formed by environmentalism and anti corporatism become the man behind trump s trade war peter navarro originally set out to be a politician not just an adviser to one but he had a problem people didn t like him he had this burning desire to be important to be in charge says larry remer a san diego based democratic consultant who managed navarro s campaigns he was right about a lot of things but he was just an a hole born in massachusetts navarro grew up in florida and maryland raised by his mother a secretary after her divorce from his father a musician the family was working class in high school navarro was a self described latchkey kid who worked multiple jobs and slept on a sofa in a one bedroom apartment he earned an academic scholarship to tufts university then spent three years in thailand with the peace corps idealistic but adrift navarro found his calling in economic policy while pursuing his ph d at harvard he wrote his first book the policy game a screed against the special interests he charged with stealing america he argued strongly against protectionism saying tariffs hurt consumers threatened global stability and could lead to a trade war that caused an unstoppable downward spiral by the entire world economy after receiving his doctorate navarro moved to southern california where he eventually became a professor of economics and public policy at the university of california irvine his involvement in san diego politics started with his opposition to developers whom he saw as greedy despoilers of the environment in his memoir navarro called them punks in pinstripes and argued that their plans would ruin the port city s character he formed an anti growth organization called prevent los angelization now and attempted to parlay his activism into elected office navarro hadn t always been a democrat before running for office he had been registered as both a republican and an independent and in his writing he professed concern that democrats waste taxpayers money but he was he wrote a strong environmentalist and a progressive on social issues such as choice gay rights and religious freedom while republicans seemed to prefer the every man for himself approach navarro believed we ought to progressively tax the rich to help everybody else by the time of his first campaign in 1992 he was sure he belonged in the democratic party navarro won the democratic primary for san diego mayor on his first try he was ahead in the polls for the general election when he ran an ad attacking his republican opponent susan golding for her ex husband s conviction on drug money laundering charges but golding turned the tables portraying herself as the victim of a smear campaign navarro s fate was sealed when in their final debate she tearfully recounted the pain navarro had caused while he smirked after losing the mayoral race navarro ran for city council in 1993 and county board in 1994 losing both races undeterred he ran for office again in 1996 this time for a seat in the house of representatives held by brian bilbray a first term republican swept into office by the newt gingrich revolution opposition to gingrich who is today a major trump ally was the poll tested theme of navarro s campaign he decried gingrich s agenda which he described as anti choice anti environment anti working people and anti medicare and his slogan was the democrat newt gingrich fears most navarro got a three minute speaking slot at the 1996 democratic convention in chicago president bill clinton the first lady and vice president al gore all came to california to fundraise and campaign for him in a memoir navarro singled out street smart savvy nancy pelosi for praise but hillary was his favorite gracious intelligent perceptive and yes classy he called her expressing puzzlement that many americans seemed to hate her okay so this uppity woman has made it all too clear to middle america that she d rather be an activist first lady than rearrange white house furniture he wrote but so what this is the dawn of the 21st century navarro lost by 11 points the campaign left him ruined and embittered his wife discomfited by public life had divorced him and he was deep in debt looking around he saw plenty of people responsible for his defeat from bill clinton to the local media to dirty campaign tricks to the poorly informed voters who ultimately determine elections his book san diego confidential named names and spewed insults but he knew he bore some of the blame in focus groups voters found him harsh arrogant and angry it s like everything is a war with him one woman said it was his personality not his policies that turned off voters says remer who is puzzled by navarro s current position the peter i knew he says would have had to swallow a lot to do what he s doing with trump so what happened to peter navarro liberal warrior in the ensuing decades he would make one more unsuccessful run for elected office losing a 2001 campaign for san diego city council he was a supporter of democratic politicians as recently as 2008 when he backed hillary clinton in the presidential primary in op eds and newsletters in the past decade he called for an aggressive climate policy including a carbon tax and a ban on incandescent bulbs and supported a stimulus package to combat the financial crisis but on trade his views evolved in 1998 he had written that he strongly supported free trade but after china joined the world trade organization wto in 2001 he started to notice that his mba students were losing their jobs despite their sterling qualifications he concluded that china s trade practices including export and production subsidies currency manipulation and theft of intellectual property were putting americans at an unfair disadvantage in other words navarro seemed to see in china a scapegoat for people like himself well credentialed americans denied access to the success they felt they d earned he wrote his first book on the phenomenon the coming china wars in 2006 followed by 2011 s death by china and 2015 s crouching tiger death by china was made into a documentary narrated by martin sheen and it attracted the attention of then businessman trump i urge you to see it he wrote in a promotional blurb when trump ran for president navarro heard a politician willing to take on the evils of globalism foreign influence and china someone who like navarro was convinced america was getting screwed most economists disagree with this view they agree that china s entry into the wto led to a period of china shock for the u s economy as a flood of cheap imports displaced american goods such as clothing furniture toys and electronics leading to a sharp decline in manufacturing jobs but experts generally believe that the shock wore off and trade with china has been a net benefit to the u s for the past decade or so lowering consumer prices and opening a huge new market to american companies many agree with navarro that china s state managed economy engages in unfair practices but virtually no economists believe tariffs are the solution it s a trillion dollar coin toss says douglas holtz eakin a conservative economist and former director of the congressional budget office it s a very risky approach economists may disdain navarro but plenty of americans agree with him as the 2016 election showed both trump on the right and bernie sanders on the left tapped into populist opposition to foreign trade deals in one 2016 poll 68 of americans said they d rather have an american factory that created 1 000 jobs than a chinese owned factory that created 2 000 jobs in their community navarro joined trump s campaign as an economic adviser in 2016 but in the white house trump was initially surrounded by free traders who sought to dissuade him from imposing tariffs and pulling out of global agreements such as nafta republicans in congress pushed trump to focus his energies on tax cuts rather than duty hikes the internal debate was contentious with screaming matches in the oval office and bureaucratic fights behind trump s back for the first year the globalists seemed to prevail marginalizing navarro who was reportedly excluded from many top level strategy meetings and required to copy chief economic adviser gary cohn on all his emails two key departures in early 2018 changed the equation staff secretary rob porter a strong advocate of free trade resigned in february amid accusations of domestic violence cohn followed him out the door in march after trump insisted on moving forward with tariffs on steel and aluminum for a long time navarro was put in a closet where he couldn t do any harm says tony fratto a former treasury department official under george w bush but when gary stepped down it left a huge hole for him to run through and he was pushing on an open door because trump has believed these things for years out of trump s earshot navarro is as abrasive as ever berating and demeaning those he disagrees with and working aggressively to block contrary views from reaching the president according to three sources in and outside the administration as for how the onetime environmentalist who deplored greedy corporations feels about working in a white house that has rolled back environmental regulations and enacted a massive corporate tax cut it s not clear navarro declined to be interviewed for this article his most recent writings give few hints to his current views some of his past concerns are still evident in death by china navarro blasts greedy corporations for putting their profits ahead of jobs for american workers and he criticizes china for polluting the environment navarro s allies argue that traditional economic analyses fail to account for the destruction free trade can wreak on people s lives we lost the trade war decades ago he told axios in june once we entered into nafta and let china into the wto the results of navarro s influence on trade are evident china canada and members of the e u have imposed retaliatory tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of american goods leading to warehouses full of excess meat and a giant surplus of dairy products the price of soybeans has plummeted while the prices of some washing machines are up by 20 auto prices could soon follow the nation s only major television manufacturer element electronics announced it would close its factory and lay off 126 workers because of the rising price of chinese components conservative economists like moore hope that tariffs are merely a means to an end giving trump leverage to negotiate deals that would result in freer markets in my discussions with donald trump it s been about using the tariffs as a bargaining tool moore says in the end he wants to get to zero tariffs but navarro has a different view he advocates a permanent regime of tariffs barriers and quotas to balance the trade deficit discourage imported goods and encourage domestic manufacturing the administration s actions as opposed to its rhetoric are moving in that direction the renegotiated u s korea trade agreement that was announced in march would extend a 25 tariff on south korean trucks for 30 years nafta talks have reportedly stalled because u s negotiators are demanding that autos be built with 70 american steel to qualify for duty free treatment at the wto the u s is blocking judicial appointments to win freer rein to impose anti dumping duties in senate testimony in july robert lighthizer the u s trade representative acknowledged that the administration was not seeking zero tariffs with the e u trump appears to like where all this is headed tariffs are working big time he tweeted on aug 5 adding that the duties would enable the u s to begin paying off the 21 trillion national debt economists mocked the notion but white house sources say it is an argument trump gets directly from navarro all this has alarmed conservatives in congress i don t think the administration even fully knows what its trade policy is says republican senator bob corker who has proposed a bill to curb trump s steel tariffs they just wake up in the morning and make it up gop lawmakers ceos and policy mavens have paraded through the white house in a bid to persuade trump to change course trump has waved them all away he is sensitive to the idea that the rural whites who comprise his political base might not like tariffs in july he announced a 12 billion agricultural bailout but he s convinced he won t lose their votes at a july 31 rally in florida he lamented the effects of china s actions on farmers but said they were willing to bear the pain our farmers are true patriots trump said and you know what our farmers are saying it s o k we can take it back in the 1990s navarro lamented republicans appeal to these types of voters they relied he wrote on the fear mongering trinity of crime illegal immigration and affirmative action to get the votes of frightened seniors and white and angry blue collar men one such politician was then california governor pete wilson who was contemplating a run for president navarro issued a stark warning this man without core beliefs he wrote wants to cynically ride a tidal wave of white male rage and anti immigrant fervor right down the potomac and into the white house even then he saw how well it could work this appears in the september 03 2018 issue of time write to molly ball at molly ball time com
