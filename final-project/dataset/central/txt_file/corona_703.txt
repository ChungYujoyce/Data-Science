the virus it could cause more harm than covid 19 if everyone started smoking jason sheltzer a fellow at cold spring harbor lab a nonprofit research and educational institution created a twitter threadhighlightingflaws in the study so in short i think that this analysis is severely flawed they re comparing statistics that shouldn t be compared sheltzer tweeted after analyzing the study i don t think that there s any convincing evidence that smoking protects against coronavirus more information is needed in order to rate the claim that nicotine substitutes could help in fighting covid 19 symptoms as true or false it is possible that nicotine substitutes could aid in fighting the coronavirus but findings from the french study were very preliminary and more research is needed
