 jessica taylor republican presidential candidate jeb bush speaks with npr s steve inskeep on wednesday in boston kayana szymczak for npr hide caption republican presidential candidate jeb bush speaks with npr s steve inskeep on wednesday in boston many republicans may have sided with donald trump s controversial proposal to ban muslims from entering the u s but his rival jeb bush predicts that the gop faithful will eventually oppose the plan and see it his way trump clearly banning all muslims would actually be so counterproductive in our efforts to destroy isis that it s foolhardy the former florida governor told npr s steve inskeep in an interview wednesday in boston i mean it s beyond ridiculous it s quite dangerous earlier this month in response to terrorist threats trump said there should be a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on the plan was renounced by many of his republican rivals and gop leaders bush himself said trump had become unhinged but polls showed a majority of republican voters sided with trump and trump s poll numbers went up in the aftermath too but bush believes that will change by the time actual voting rolls around in february i think the emotion of the here and now will subside jeb bush in a month from now they won t agree that s the point bush said the point is that we re living in this reality tv kind of political environment where trump fills the space by saying outrageous things people based on their emotions will express support for the sentiment not necessarily the specifics because there are none and then he ll backtrack and he ll move on to the next thing and he fills the space i think the emotion of the here and now will subside bush continued are people scared about the national security interests of our country being violated because of a lax immigration system or a visa waiver program that wasn t designed for people being radicalized yes they re scared and the job of a president or a candidate for that matter isn t to scare them more it s to give them solutions and that s what i m trying to do president obama believes trump is exploiting the anxieties of blue collar workers in his campaign as obama told inskeep in a wide ranging interview at the white house this month bush said he didn t exactly agree with the president s characterization of the root of that frustration obama s got this notion of what blue collared white voters kind of think that s so out of touch he said people are legitimately angry with washington d c and yes mr president they re legitimately angry with you you have divided the country up in all sorts of disparate parts that division in the country bush argued has allowed for an unconventional candidate to rise i would argue that donald trump is in fact a creature of barack obama he continued but for barack obama donald trump s effect would not be nearly as strong as it is we re living in a divided country right now and we need political leaders rather than continuing to divide as both president obama and donald trump do to unite us trump continues to lead national polls but he has seen a dip in some of the early states most surveys show texas sen ted cruz rising in iowa bush has largely put his hopes in new hampshire a state much friendlier to establishment candidates with its large swath of more moderate republicans and independents still bush is lagging there behind trump and other rivals including florida sen marco rubio new jersey gov chris christie and ohio gov john kasich i would argue that donald trump is in fact a creature of barack obama but for barack obama donald trump s effect would not be nearly as strong as it is jeb bush later wednesday the bush campaign signaled it would be shifting more resources to early states but with a particular focus on new hampshire it canceled planned ad buys in iowa and south carolina pointing out that the superpac supporting the governor had bought a chunk of ad time there next month the campaign s efforts in the critical granite state will double to more than 40 staffers talking to inskeep bush dismissed the notion that he had to win an early state new hampshire included to remain in the gop primary fight i don t think i have to win any of them because we re organized in every state he explained so depending on how it plays out if someone rolled the table then that would have an impact be hard for anybody else to to overcome it the good news is expectations are low for me and i m definitely gonna beat those he said i feel really good about new hampshire to be honest with you just just the way it it feels on immigration the proposal ought to be for a conservative for the people who are here illegally a path to legal status not a path to citizenship but a path out from the shadows where you pay a fine where you learn english where you work where you don t commit crimes you don t receive federal government assistance and over an extended period of time you earn legal status people came here illegally 40 percent of the people that came here illegally by the way didn t cross the border they came with a legal visa and they overstayed a great nation ought to be able to identify where these folks are for national security purposes alone but for a lot of other reasons as well why should people gain citizenship by coming here illegally i i just i don t quite understand why that is such a compelling moral argument on isis if anybody doesn t think that they would use whatever means possible to do us harm i think they re naive we can t be paralyzed in place and that s where we are today whether or not isis is the greatest threat that we have in terms of the world that s debatable i would say iran empowered by an agreement that will allow them now to destabilize the region is a serious threat i would say an unstable pakistan is a threat on syrian refugees when you have 4 million refugees in syria 4 million in camps literally you know millions at a time in turkey lebanon and jordan the destabilizing impact that has on those countries and the potential of a breeding ground for islamic jihadist activity for for a long long while that s a serious threat when you see the refugee challenges that partially created the tragedy in paris that s a threat i view it as a threat because it s a long term threat against western civilization they effectively have declared war on us on the bush brand and legacy it would be integrity it would be having a servant s heart it would be patriotic loving the country and in my case you know look i m a conservative but i believe that conservatism needs to be applied in a hopeful optimistic way and i think that s another part of the bush brand that i hope people will be reminded of that it s a hopeful optimistic message not a divisive one npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
