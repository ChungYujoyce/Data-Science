the coronaviruslockdowns havehad an extreme effect on daily carbon emissions causing a whopping 17 dropglobally during peak confinement measures byearly april levels last seen in 2006 however it is unlikely to last according to a new analysis by an international team of scientists who saidthe brief pollution break will likely be a drop in the ocean when it comes to climate change this is the first analysis to measure the pandemic driven global drop in carbon dioxide co2 emissions fromjanuary to april of this year carbon dioxide emitted from burning fossil fuels such as oil gas and and coal is the greenhouse gas that s most responsible for global warming it stays in the atmosphere about a century before dissipating while the impact of lockdown measures is likely to lead to the largest annual decrease in emissions since the end of world war ii 2020 is still on track to be one of the five hottest years on record and the study notes that these reductions are no silver lining pandemic causing changes will an unprecedented decline in carbon emissions help limit climate change the study was published in the peer reviewed british journal nature climate change professorcorinne le que re of the university of east anglia in the u k led the analysis she said population confinement has led to drastic changes in energy use and co2 emissions these extreme decreases are likely to be temporary though as they do not reflect structural changes in the economic transportor energy systems the extent to which world leaders consider climate change when planning their economic responses post covid 19 will influence the global co2 emissions paths for decades to come she said for a week in april the united states cut its carbon dioxide levels by about one third china the world s biggest emitter of heat trapping gases sliced its carbon pollution by nearly a quarter in february india and europe cut emissions by 26 and 27 respectively warming fueling hurricanes global warming is making hurricanes stronger study says this annual drop is comparable to the amount of annual emission reductions needed year on year across decades to achieve the climate objectives of the u n paris agreement study co author rob jackson of stanford university said the drop in emissions is substantial but illustrates the challenge of reaching our paris climate commitments we need systemic change through green energy and electric cars not temporary reductions from enforced behavior outside experts praised the study as the most comprehensive yet saying it shows how much effort is needed to prevent dangerous levels of further global warming that underscores a simple truth individual behavior alone won t get us there said pennsylvania state university climate scientist michael mann who wasn t part of the study we need fundamental structural change extreme heat unsuitable for human life to flourish up to 3b will live in extreme heat by 2070 study warns some of the report s key findings include the estimated total change in emissions from the pandemic amounted to 1 048 million tonnes of carbon dioxide through the end of april the largest decrease in emissions occurred in china followed by the u s europeand india in the u s california and washington saw the biggest decline in emissions emissions from surface transport such as car journeys accounted for almost half 43 of the decrease in global emissions during peak confinement on april 7 pollution levels are heading back up and for the year will end up4 to7 lower than 2019 levels depending on the duration of the lockdown and the extent of the recovery contributing the associated press
