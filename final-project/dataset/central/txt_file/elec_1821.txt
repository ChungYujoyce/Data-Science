 washington the political landscape for the midterm elections favors democrats in general and femalecandidates in particular a new usa today suffolk university poll says raising the prospect of significant perils for president donald trump in the next congress at the traditional labor day start of the campaign s fall sprint those surveyed said by 50 percent 39 percent that they were more likely to vote for the democratic congressional candidate in their district not the republican one that double digit advantage if it holds would probably enable democrats to win control of the house of representatives giving them the power to launch investigations and even consider impeachment of the president i feel that the good people need to have their voices heard in this election said erica may 34 a political independent and stay at home mom from hood river oregon who was among those polled trump has made it ok to say and do things that were generally felt to be inappropriate or immoral or just rude both supporters and opponents of trump called the stakes in november higher than usual if the gop loses power gregory bailey 58 a republican from oklahoma city warned in a follow up interview the democrats are just going to stifle getting any positive legislation through by wasting their time trying to impeach trump democrats need an advantage nationally of about 8 percentage points to flip at least 23 house seats that would bring a majority said david wasserman of the nonpartisan cook political report the 11 point edge in the poll may understate the risk for republicans because undecided voters 10 percent in this survey historically and in special elections this year have broken against the party in power more pivot counties will be key in fight for senate control more trump to focus on senate races pence mostly on the house aide says by 58 percent 34 percent those surveyed said they wanted to elect a congress that mostly stands up to trump rather than one that mostly cooperates with him the president s job approval rating was 40 percent approve 56 percent disapprove those who strongly disapprove of how trump is handling his job hit the highest level of his

theld their primaries opposition to trumpprompted some women who had never run before to seek office and they have been more successful than in the past in winning nominations fifty percent of the democratic nominations for the house in open seats those without an incumbent running have been won by women wasserman said when at least one man and one woman sought the nomination in those contests women have won 69 percent of the time a success rate he called breathtaking the2018 midterm elections could be described in one word r e s p e c t said david paleologos director of the suffolk university political research center he said the metoo movement and alarm about trump s record and rhetoriccontributed to the sharp rise in women running female candidates are finding friendly terrain in the poll three of four voters said they had no preference between voting for a male or female candidate for congress those who did have a preference said they would rather vote for a woman than a man 16 percent 7 percent the sentiment is not bipartisan and the female candidates nominated this year have been disproportionately democrats among democrats and democratic leaning voters one in three 29 percent preferred to vote for a woman just 5 percent for a man among republicans and republican leaning voters 10 percent preferred to vote for a man just 3 percent for a woman there s a gender gap and a generation gap on the issue as well 21 percent of women but just 9 percent of men would prefer to vote for a female candidate those 18 to 24 years old would prefer a female candidate over a male by 24 percent to 7 percent those 65 andolder would narrowly prefer a male candidate 11 percent to 9 percent why the preference the reason most often named by those who preferred a female candidate is the belief that she would be more likely to care about the issues that matter most to me women were seen as more likely to shake things up in washington as of right now it s primarily dominated by males said benjamin jones 21 an independent from queens new york it s good to have a change get a different perspective the reason most often named by those who preferred a male candidate is the belief that men are less emotional and that they are better leaders muslim americans seekelective office this year in the largest numbers since the sept 11terror attacks they include two democratic
