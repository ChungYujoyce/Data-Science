6 min read reuters more states in the u s south and midwest signaled readiness on wednesday to reopen their economies in hopes the worst of the coronavirus pandemic had passed but california s governor held firm to sweeping stay at home orders and business closures the patchwork of still evolving orders across the 50 states meant some americans were still confined indefinitely to their homes unable to work while others began to venture out for the first time in weeks i wish i could prescribe a specific date to say that we can turn on that light switch and go back to normalcy california governor gavin newsom a democrat said in his daily remarks to the nation s most populous state on the coronavirus crisis we have tried to make it crystal clear that there is no light switch and that there is no date in terms of our capacity to provide the kind of clarity that i know so many of you demand and deserve newsom said the governor said that among the steps health officials would need to take before 40 million californians could return to jobs schools and stores would be ramping up testing for the virus to 25 000 patients a day newsom said u s president donald trump a republican had committed to sending 100 000 testing swabs next week and 250 000 the following week health officials in santa clara county california said on wednesday the virus appeared to have circulated there in january weeks earlier than thought and early deaths were likely mistaken for the flu l2n2ca27e nationwide u s deaths totaled 47 050 on wednesday up about 1 800 with some states yet
