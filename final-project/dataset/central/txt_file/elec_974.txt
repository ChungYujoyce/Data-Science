 with the smell of manure hanging outside in the cold air amy klobuchar walked into timbukbr a bar so remote that its slogan reads welcome to the other middle of nowhere after greeting the 20 local democrats waiting inside the minnesota senator started sipping a beer cracking open peanut shells and ticking through several top issues in her campaign for president after explaining she favored improving obamacare over passing medicare for all mckinley bailey nodded in approval that s why you re in my top three bailey a 39 year old former iowa lawmaker told the senator ohhhh the ultimate compliment klobuchar exclaimed her voice dripping with sarcasm in new hampshire there was a guy who said i was in his top two but he was 11 years old that was an all time low but better to be in the top two right the bar erupted in laughter but klobuchar s joke served as only a momentary respite from an ongoing challenge for her presidential bid converting iowans who have her on their short lists into committed voters locking in such support has proven difficult for many candidates in the extremely fluid race with polls showing about two thirds of iowans still willing to change their minds before they vote in just two months with less money and more ground to make up than the race s leading contenders the margin of error is particularly slim for klobuchar if she is to survive beyond iowa s first in the nation caucuses on feb 3 complicating matters klobuchar acknowledged is that she often finds herself in the political paradox of voters liking her but unwilling to commit because they re not sure she has a chance to win her chances to win of course only improve when such voters decide to back her it is so hard because from the beginning i always knew i would not be in the top two or three because of the fact that i wasn t running for president forever and i wasn t as well known klobuchar said in an interview as she campaigned across iowa last week so here i am at no 5 and moving up and people are going to have to look at me in that way we still have a lot of people who are undecided and so that s my case to make and i m going to make it for months the race has featured the front running foursome of south bend mayor pete buttigieg massachusetts sen elizabeth warren former vice president joe biden and vermont sen bernie sanders followed by the rest of the jumbled field of 15 candidates through much of 2019 klobuchar slowly and steadily has made her way through that pack to a position she hopes will make it possible for her to be the latest to join the club of late surging surprise candidates in iowa s notoriously turbulent caucuses there are some signs of momentum for the minnesota moderate at a time when many candidates in that group are stagnating in the polls and struggling to keep their campaigns financially afloat klobuchar s operation is growing she is one of just six candidates who has qualified for the december debate and is in the midst of doubling her iowa campaign offices to more than 20 doubling her paid staff in new hampshire and has hired up in the other early states of nevada and south carolina she also has been on the move in the polls with a recent survey by the des moines register and cnn showing her support doubling to 6 since september that placed her in fifth place three percentage points ahead of the next closest candidates but still trailing buttigieg with 25 warren with 16 and biden and sanders each with 15 klobuchar is seeking to fill a moderate lane where others also see opportunity as biden s poll numbers continue to slide and his fundraising lags behind the other three front runners that s led billionaire former new york mayor michael bloomberg and onetime massachusetts gov deval patrick both to enter the race in recent days further crowding the picture moving forward for klobuchar she has however outlasted candidates who began the race with larger national profiles including former texas u s rep beto o rourke new york sen kirsten gillibrand and california sen kamala harris who dropped out of the race tuesday amid dwindling funds staff cutbacks and campaign dysfunction nor has klobuchar had to launch last ditch fundraising appeals to stay in the race like new jersey sen cory booker another high profile candidate who is in danger of not qualifying for the next debate i don t think people thought i was going to do this klobuchar said when asked how she s maintained a viable campaign but that s what happens to me a lot i get underestimated and i just keep going klobuchar is trying to cut through all the noise with a message that boils down to a blend of experience and electability she often presents both themes as barely veiled contrasts to buttigieg a fellow midwestern moderate who along with biden remains the senator s top competition in winning over iowa centrists the third term senator repeatedly reminds voters how she has won three statewide elections carrying minnesota s urban suburban and overwhelming republican rural congressional districts those are feats that buttigieg who got walloped in a 2010 bid for indiana state treasurer cannot match while the 37 year old mayor has run a city of 100 000 people for eight years the 59 year old klobuchar frequently mentions her eight years as prosecutor in hennepin county a jurisdiction of more than 1 million people that includes minneapolis she then notes how she moved beyond local government to serve 12 years in the senate and passed more than 100 bills as the lead democrat a depth of experience buttigieg also lacks we need someone from the middle of the country on this ticket there s only two of us now on the debate stage from the middle of the country and i am one of them klobuchar often notes on the trail willing voters to the comparison with buttigieg 2020 election voter guide get the latest election news analysis and opinion she also spends a lot of time delving deep into policy details as a way of illustrating her experience on various issues in the senate while making the point that other presidential candidates haven t spent enough time focusing on the topics klobuchar contends too much time has been spent arguing over medicare for all which she dismissed in the october debate as a pipe dream instead of eliminating private insurance and placing everyone in the government program she prefers adding a nonprofit public option to compete with private insurers on the trail klobuchar frequently spends more time discussing driving down the cost of prescription drugs doing more to address mental illness passing background checks and red flag laws for gun purchases funding treatment for opioid addiction instituting immigration reform and giving farmers a role in combating climate change she also frequently mentions the need to address long term care for older americans noting her 91 year old father resides in an assisted living facility klobuchar s political strategy is as straightforward as her plain spoken stump speeches visit all stretches of iowa big and small urban and rural and emphasize that she is the only candidate who can as one of her campaign slogans says win big that mantra displayed on signs at all of her events comes with a political hypothesis as the only major candidate who has won republican districts klobuchar not only can defeat trump by winning back obama era voters who backed the president but help rack up victories in moderate areas needed for democrats to solidify their majority in the u s house and regain control of the u s senate only then klobuchar contends will democrats have the chance to actually enact their bold ideas she figures the best way to deliver that message is to blanket the areas of the state that are home to many of those voters with a goal of campaigning in each of iowa s 99 counties before the caucuses last week she crossed off no 68 on her list with a visit to the north central iowa town of grundy center which locals said made her the first presidential candidate this cycle to visit grundy county there is no town that is small enough for me to not be there klobuchar said as 60 people packed into a coffee shop laughed i think this is going to be a real resurgence for small town america in this election donald trump thinks he can just show up and not follow through but i don t think he gets that the people in rural america actually are watching and they know what they need and they know he hasn t kept his promises klobuchar regularly reminds voters that trump s trade war with china has crushed farmers saddled by low soybean prices and shrinking demand she also highlights the renewable fuel standard waivers trump has given to big oil companies that have hurt the market for iowa s biofuel plants and the growers who sell crops to them the senator made those points during a recent lunch focused on farming in new hampton the 3 500 person seat of chickasaw county in northern iowa nick leibold a fourth generation farmer took the opportunity to press klobuchar on whether congress is going to pass a proposed trade deal with mexico and canada to replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement leibold who farms 1 100 acres near new hampton said he was frustrated the deal had stalled because it would help exports and increase the price of soybeans klobuchar responded that she took it as a good sign that house speaker nancy pelosi recently suggested a deal was nearing on the pact which trump has favored and accused democrats of holding up amid ongoing house impeachment hearings of the president afterward leibold reluctantly acknowledged he voted for trump in 2016 but said he was unlikely to do so again he plans to caucus in february and has narrowed his choice down to to klobuchar and buttigieg she s got some good ideas she s from the midwest and she knows what needs to be done to get us back on track leibold 60 said of klobuchar i d like to see her get up there near the top so we can have someone who isn t so leftist get the nomination over the span of two days in iowa last week klobuchar held events in eight north central iowa counties that voted for trump in 2008 five of those counties voted for obama in 2012 three of them did visiting each came with varying degrees of difficulty after a heavy snowfall fell on much of northern iowa just before thanksgiving with 50 mph wind gusts frequently making it difficult to distinguish where the state highways ended and the adjacent farm fields began local radio stations were peppered with announcements of cancellations for church services meals on wheels deliveries factory shifts and even a church quilting club despite travel advisories warning drivers to stay home klobuchar did not cancel any events during one trek the senator rode in the passenger seat of her campaign s gray chrysler pacifica minivan as a driver slowly navigated gravel roads covered with several inches of snow on the way to a remote cabin in st ansgar when klobuchar finally arrived a line of suvs and pickup trucks were neatly parked on a patch of land that had been cleared by a giant plow inside a vaulted living room with a giant stone fireplace packed with 30 people awaited and klobuchar tried to convince them to make a final choice i know a lot of people say i have good news for you you re in my top three she said ok but it s getting close now it s time to make a decision after every event field organizers wearing green team amy t shirts circulated the room in search of items coveted by every iowa campaign signed caucus cards once a voter signs a card it signals an end to their shopping for a candidate and a commitment to not only caucus but in many cases volunteer for a campaign ray hammer signed one after hearing klobuchar speak to about two dozen people in the living room of a giant white victorian home in forest city a town of 4 100 in north central iowa she just has so much knowledge about what s going on and it s all in her head it s amazing said hammer 79 a retired insurance data processor who also considered supporting buttigieg pete is knowledgeable also but she definitely has a lot more government experience and that s important after speaking to about 20 people in the back room of the la frontera restaurant in hampton a town of 4 400 klobuchar exclaimed to no one in particular we got another caucus card the woman over there in the red coat the majority of voters who come to hear klobuchar speak however leave uncommitted in hampton marie boyd politely declined a caucus card the 29 year old who works for a food education nonprofit said she thought klobuchar was great and well versed in all the issues but was still torn between her warren and buttigieg boyd said she is more moderate and would like to support a woman but ultimately will back whoever has the best shot to win klobuchar she said isn t quite there yet she still has a lot to gain as far as public support she obviously has been very successful but i want to see if she can get up there higher boyd said of klobuchar although i think obama really proved you don t have to be the front runner from the beginning people can truly emerge and the caucuses can make a huge impact so we ll see obama trailed for much of 2008 before catapulting to the lead in november some winners have emerged even later in iowa caucuses since 2004 only three of those who led in the des moines register s iowa poll at this point in the race went on to win the state obama republican mike huckabee in 2008 and hillary clinton who eked out a win over sanders in 2016 three other candidates john kerry in 2004 rick santorum in 2012 and ted cruz in 2016 all entered the race s final two months in third place or lower unlike standard elections where voters cast a secret ballot in a booth caucuses remain a public act of commitment and persuasion caucusgoers gather in a large room listen to speeches by supporters of each candidate and then cluster in groups according to the campaign they are supporting those who support a candidate who doesn t reach 15 support in the room must disperse and pick a second candidate instead that s where the energy of a campaign can become crucial not only in turning out its own supporters to the caucus but in convincing second choice voters to join in inside the bar in clarion where klobuchar had joked about making the list of bailey s top three candidates the former iowa lawmaker pressed the senator on her viability he questioned whether she d have enough organization to turn out large numbers in iowa s 1 681 precincts across the state my biggest concern is that i ll show up to caucus and it s just gonna be me for amy bailey told klobuchar can you win seriously klobuchar responded with mock outrage to a round of laughs that s not true we are on the up in the last iowa poll we re up to 6 in a really crowded field iowa has always been discerning you ve looked at candidates you ve made a decision and i have the strongest case after klobuchar promised bailey he wouldn t be alone and joked that she d personally call him on caucus night she finished her beer led the bar in a rendition of happy birthday for a campaign staffer and departed into the snowy night because of her strong appeal to moderates and disaffected republicans bailey said he was convinced that klobuchar would just stomp trump if she won the nomination his fear of commitment however still lingered do i just jump in and say i m doing it i m for amy i don t know bailey said people around the country may not understand but we take this very seriously everyone in this bar has it narrowed to five or three or two but a lot of decisions aren t made until the very end it s exciting anything can happen this story was featured in our daywatch newsletter sign up here to start your day with our top stories it was also featured in our smart
