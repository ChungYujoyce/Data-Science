 eyder peralta 1 of 10 wisconsin gov scott walker just the third governor in u s history to face a recall effort is now the first to successfully defeat such an attempt the associated press projected that walker would defeat milwaukee s democratic mayor tom barrett in what was a rematch of the 2010 gubernatorial election the race was closely watched nationwide because it became a proxy of sorts for national politics at the macro level it was about different visions for the role of government but it all stemmed from legislation championed by walker that severely limited the collective bargaining rights of public employees walker became a hero to some who saw public unions as a special interest that feed mercilessly off taxpayers and a foe to those who thought he was dismantling the fabric that gave workers a decent life and the prospect of a happy retirement it was a brutal 17 months that saw nonstop protests unions and democrats collected more than 900 000 signatures to trigger only the third gubernatorial recall election in u s history but in the end the gop outraised and outmaneuvered democrats in the state walker raised 30 5 million while barrett raised only about 4 million in a statement walker said it was time to move past the divisions bringing our state together will take some time but i hope to start right away walker said it is time to put our differences aside and figure out ways that we can move wisconsin forward but at the state capitol in madison the mood was one of disbelief one barrett supporter said walker had destroyed the progress unions had made in the past 50 years maureen zarrella a retired teacher from st charles ill who had participated in anti walker rallies in madison and chicago told npr s liz halloran that she feared walker s agenda will be a template for the rest of the country i just hope we can keep up the courage keep up the fight she said as npr political junkie ken rudin has reminded us the two governors to have been recalled were lynn frazier of north dakota who was in his third two year term when he was recalled in october 1921 and gray davis of california who was recalled in october 2003 we live blogged all night so keep reading if you want to see how it all developed update at 11 53 p m et still in opposition in a statement the democratic party of wisconsin said that while they congratulate walker they still oppose his policies mike tate the party chair in the state said because the debate must continue unions must be able to bargain collectively and provide workers with basic protections the middle class must not be asked to give up protections built together over the years even while the richest among us sacrifice not at all our elected officials must speak with the public honestly and operate an open government not flout our laws and our norms and finally regardless of party wisconsin must be wisconsin again without the big money tea party influence that has colonized our state turned neighbor against neighbor and created an idea dangerous to democracy that our very government is up for sale update at 11 40 p m et making the tough decisions in times of crisis what has made america

wouldn t be called until late said john matthews 72 who has been executive director of the local teachers union for 44 years what we have built here the last 50 years has been destroyed by walker to say there s a 23 point margin i don t think that s possible he said after comforting a teacher who was in tears he and others said reports of high voter turnout in democratic strongholds like madison and milwaukee made the results difficult to believe maureen zarrella a retired teacher from st charles ill who has participated in anti walker rallies in madison and chicago says she fears walker s

told you earlier walker raised 30 5 million while barrett raised only about 4 million but as don gonyea told our newscast unit earlier today walker raised that much money because big donors millionaires and billionaires saw him as someone who s standing up to democrats and big labor they view walker as a hero said don and this was also a crucial election for unions do or die don said

costing us too much money this election said gergen means people decided they couldn t afford it update at 10 18 p m et a tea party victory in a statement the tea party express said this race gained national attention because it echoes the themes at stake in november it was a battle between conservatives policies that successfully balanced the budget and encouraged economic growth and the big government policies found under the obama administration amy kremer chairman of tea party express said in a statement tonight we sent a message that should shake obama s chicago headquarters tea party momentum is going to be coming strong and mercilessly in november indeed as the washington post reports this race started as a swift reaction against tea party ideals remember that to get to this point walker opponents had to collect thousands of signatures to trigger a recall election but as the post points out the recall campaign simply energized republicans and they were able to raise huge money and expand its turnout operation where democrats traditionally have the edge update at 10 07 p m et ap calls the race republican wisconsin gov scott walker has survived his recall election the

wisconsin tweets that s not changing tonight protesters gathering outside wis capitol awaiting results in wirecall heavy police presence polls close in 4 minutes update at 8 45 p m et voters uncomfortable with recalls we ve got about 15 minutes to go before polls close in wisconsin so we ll use that time to point to another interesting bit from tonight s exit polls as the washington post reports voters have been traditionally uncomfortable with recalls just three sitting governors have faced a recall vote in all of u s history the post reports in fact of those who voted today 60 percent said recalls are only appropriate because of misconduct of course that differed depending on party the post reports republicans said by a near unanimous margin that recall elections are never appropriate or only appropriate in the case of official misconduct but slight majority of democratic voters said recall elections are appropriate for any reason update at 8 25 p m et a record breaker 63 5 million that s how much the center for public integrity calculates both candidates and independent groups spent on the recall election in wisconsin that eclipses the previous record of 37 4 million set in during the governor s race in 2010 and most of that money came from outside the state here s cpi with some details while barrett has received about 26 percent of his 4 million in campaign donations from outside the badger state walker has drawn nearly two thirds of his 30 5 million contributions from out of state according to campaign filings released may 29 walker has outraised barrett 7 1 2 to 1 since late 2011 though barrett didn t enter the race until late march update at 8 13 p m et what the polls say if you look at polls walker has an edge over barrett tonight he has polled at around 50 percent over the past month or so real clear politics which tracks polls says that on average walker leads by 6 7 points yesterday nate silver the new york times statistics guru made a bold prediction he said using one statistical model walker has a 95 percent chance of winning silver adds one of the new polls over the weekend from public policy polling which conducts polling on behalf of democratic clients as well as publishes its own polls independently showed a somewhat tighter race with mr walker s democratic opponent mayor tom barrett of milwaukee having closed his deficit to three percentage points however the firm has showed somewhat more favorable results for mr barrett than other polling firms and this reflected a relatively minor change from the firm s previous poll which had mr walker ahead by five percentage points at the same time the public policy polling survey had mr walker at 50 percent of the vote and had very few undecided voters the presence of undecided voters tends to correlate with higher unpredictability on election day while the absence of them as in this case means that even a small lead is more likely to hold up update at 7 47p m et heavy turnout how significant is this recall election in wisconsin in some places the turnout is being compared to the turnout for 2008 s presidential election that s what npr s don gonyea reported on all things considered this afternoon in some precincts said don turnout could exceed 100 percent and yes that s possible when same day registration is allowed npr s liz halloran is in the southside of milwaukee and reports that turnout in the heavily hispanic area has been heavy there were lines not huge but lines she tells us the milwaukee journal sentinel reports that turnout was so heavy in milwaukee the city s election commission called out reserve poll workers the paper adds no statewide figures were available but local election officials offered fairly similar accounts of a heavy turnout in communities large and small in both democratic and republican areas in many places election officials said turnout was as strong as or stronger than it was for the 2010 gubernatorial election a few even compared it to the 2008 presidential election update at 7 23 p m et re electing obama the new york times exit polling finds that voters tonight would re elect president obama who also bested the republican presidential candidate mitt romney when voters were asked who would do a better job with the economy the questions however may not help barrett the times reports polling in recent weeks has shown mr walker leading even as voters said they preferred keeping mr obama in office that may reflect a queasiness with recall elections a large majority of the voters who turned out on tuesday said recall elections are only appropriate when incumbents are accused of official misconduct update at 7 16 p m et exit polls cnn is reporting some interesting numbers based on exit polls in wisconsin among them 32 percent of voters said someone in their household was a union member 68 percent said they had no connection to a union that s a higher union turnout than 2010 and 2008 when
