 domenico montanaro hillary clinton would have a significant electoral advantage over donald trump in the general election based on an npr analysis the democratic former secretary of state would start out with already exactly enough electoral votes to win the presidency 270 191 based on states considered safe likely and to lean toward either candidate the ratings which will be updated at least monthly until election day are based on fundamentals historical trends and demographics plus reporting and polling both public and private but there is also the potential that this fall s presidential battlegrounds could be re sorted pitting white working class voters whom trump is appealing to against latino voters who appear to be in clinton s corner traditional ways of thinking about the map should and will be challenged so in addition to our current ratings we also explore several possibilities and scenarios including trump s potential path and even two potential ties based on trump doing well in the upper midwest and clinton racking up wins in competitive states where the latino vote is important clinton 270 191 safe d 164 california connecticut delaware hawaii illinois maine 3

congressional district 3 in maine and 4 in nebraska are considered safe for democrats and republicans respectively 1 each could potentially be in play barack obama won 1 delegate out of nebraska omaha in 2008 colorado florida iowa north carolina and ohio are considered pure tossups at this point according to the analysis so even if trump who is the de facto republican nominee were able to get all of those he would still come up short clinton 332 206 considering strictly who is leading in public surveys as curated by the website realclearpolitics clinton would be ahead by a landslide 332 206 but that includes states where polling is within the margin of error and at this point polling is almost irrelevant the cases have not been litigated yet the campaigns have not been waged neither candidate has even officially crossed the magic number to win his or her respective primaries yet bottom line there is a lot of time to go one note about colorado the only poll in the rcp average of the state is one quinnipiac poll from november showing trump up 11 that s hardly a good indicator of what will happen this upcoming november but for the sake of having something to go on it s why we put colorado red for a more up to date primer on the state of play in colorado with on the ground reporting check out colorado public radio s ben markus report here it notes how the gender gap may be the biggest hurdle for trump in colorado clinton 164 136 safe clinton 201 180 safe likely democrats start out with an electoral edge because of demography especially growing latino populations in key states as well as democrats clustering in big cities in big states like california new york and illinois republicans on the other hand have seen their greatest appeal in the south and rural areas of the west and midwest their biggest electoral vote state is texas so looking at just the seats considered safe clinton or any democrat would start with a 164 136 advantage adding in the likely states democrats still lead 201 180 donald trump would argue that he can pick off some of these traditionally safe and likely democratic states notably his home state of new york as well as bordering new jersey where trump backer chris christie is governor but there s just no evidence of that yet here s why trump may have won the new york primary but the republican primary was 91 percent white according to exit polls the 2012 general election was only 67 percent white new jersey s primary comes up june 7 and trump will probably win it but that state too is far more diverse in a general election than in a gop primary neither state has gone republican in almost 30 years and barack obama won them both twice new york by at least 28 points new jersey by at least 15 because of christie and because of trump s proximity we move new jersey to likely instead of safe but more would need to happen to move either into a lean category and if polling does show them coming into play it means other more potentially reachable states have also very likely moved in trump s favor it s tempting to be safe and put the usual suspects in the tossup column significant resources will be spent in wisconsin michigan pennsylvania nevada new hampshire and virginia those are places where the fight will be waged but that doesn t necessarily mean they re tossups it also doesn t mean republicans can t win there but clinton starts with an edge because of history in some places and demography in others obama won all of these states twice he won them by an average of 6 points in 2012 and 10 in 2008 pennsylvania and michigan haven t gone republican since 1988 wisconsin since 1984 although it was the closest state in 2004 nevada virginia and new hampshire had all once been swing states george w bush won all three in 2000 but john kerry won nevada and new hampshire and obama won all of them nevada and virginia in particular have shifted more democratic because of demography hispanics in nevada and in virginia hispanics as well as asians and exurban growth what about arizona on the republican side the only lean state is arizona the state has gone republican for the past 20 years and arguably bill clinton won it only because ross perot pulled votes from george h w bush but the state has a significant percentage of hispanic voters it s something that has sitting sen john mccain the 2008 gop nominee concerned that with trump at the top of the ticket it could fire up latinos and get more out to the polls even though the state is 30 percent hispanic that group made up just 18 percent of the electorate in 2012 georgia another state to watch its demography has become much more nonwhite and republicans won it by only 5 and 8 points in 2008 and 2012 respectively one poll showed a trump clinton race a dead heat but given its presidential and down ballot history we are leaving it as likely gop until there s more hard evidence utah though one poll in march ahead of the gop primary showed clinton winning by 2 points we put that in likely for trump because a utah has a long history of voting republican it hasn t gone democratic since 1964 and b there was a very high number of undecided voters in other words no one was near 50 percent and a republican is far more likely to get there florida you could argue that the sunshine state is at least a finger on the scale for democrats given its rapidly changing demography the poll average has clinton with a 5 point lead and better ones in the average have it high single digits that all makes you think but for now we leave it a tossup given its history in addition to the tight races in 2000 and 2004 obama won it by only 2 points in 2008 and less than 1 point in 2012 the real sorting though will be between white working class voters and latinos which group is more motivated could determine the election republicans start at a demographic disadvantage in 2016 and have been at one for the past couple of election cycles in large measure because the face of america is changing it s especially getting more hispanic and asian latinos in particular have affected american politics in profound ways and they are still underrepresented at the polls pollsters project that the share of the white vote will be its lowest in history being at or possibly even dipping below 70 percent for the first time that gives democrats a significant advantage in key states like florida virginia new mexico colorado and nevada it also could put in play places like arizona and georgia democrats hope one day that will mean texas too which is already majority minority but there are more latino republicans in texas than anywhere in the country plus in the midwest an area trump has to likely do well in if he hopes to win the population has decreased and voters especially white ones affected directly by trade have gotten older trump 276 262 this path is dependent on trump being able to use his populist protectionist and anti globalization rhetoric to fire up white working class voters affected by outsourcing in the rust belt and upper midwest trump believes he can do that with an anti free trade message especially against the wife of the president who signed the north american free trade agreement to do it he would have to win all the likely and safe republican states then sweep pennsylvania 20 ohio 18 michigan 16 wisconsin 10 and iowa 6 that would mean trump could lose virginia florida and colorado and you could even take away iowa and he still gets to 270 trump 285 253 it also means he could trade florida for pennsylvania and win too by a wider margin 285 253 of course this is also dependent on trump being able to maintain arizona and even north carolina and iowa which have seen latino growth 269 269 there are at least two different 269 269 ties that we could come up with through trump s trade winds route they both of course depend on florida if there is a tie it goes to the house which is controlled by republicans here s an explanation npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
