 nobody s perfect or so hannah montana says but i can t be the only person who feels little enthusiasm for any us presidential candidate i don t even feel the bern although this is the first election in which i can vote i feel little incentive to do so none of the candidates excite me or even intrigue me and while i believe it is extremely important to exercise one s right to vote i wonder if i should really vote for a candidate i have no faith in here are the reasons why i find the front running candidates hillary clinton bernie sanders donald trump ted cruz and marco rubio inadequate to be president maybe i m too picky but shouldn t we hold our potential president to high standards googletag cmd push function googletag defineslot window sectionandpostadsettings feed 1x1 1 1 div gpt in content ad addservice googletag pubads googletag enableservices googletag display div gpt in content ad bernie sanders i m sure many young people reading this article are pulling their hair out and screaming how can you not be a fan of bernie although i consider myself to be an independent i am more right leaning than left leaning politically speaking a candidate like bernie or hillary will never suit me for several reasons that i could write another article on one of the main reasons that i will not vote for bernie is because i simply believe his plans are too good to be true free college tuition cheap healthcare and substantially lower taxes for everyone except the rich sounds incredible but will bernie s plans even pass through congress most reports say the chances are slim to none even with a democratic congress let s play devil s advocate and say that bernie wins the presidency and congress approves his christmas wish list the extremely wealthy are taxed to pay for these services college tuition healthcare etc for everyone else until ultimately the wealthy will not be wealthy anymore the average joe rejoices because he now has all this free stuff and his formerly rich neighbor taxed into oblivion no longer has his fancy mercedes to flaunt subscribe to our newsletter thank you for signing up check your inbox for the latest from odyssey this is not a valid email please try again but think about it we will eventually run out of other people s money what happens when there are no wealthy people left who will pay for all of these free services for everyone else come on people nothing is free sure i d love it if tuition was free so that students could begin their careers without being saddled with debt and it would be great if healthcare costs decreased but we don t always get what we wish for in addition bernie did not hold a steady job until he reached the age of 40 when he was elected as mayor of burlington vermont sure he worked some odd jobs such as being a freelance writer and a filmmaker but he did not really begin a career until the age of 40 i want my president to be someone that worked hard for his or her entire life had a steady career and a proven work ethic hillary clinton first there is the benghazi scandal that not many people have not taken the time to research i suggest reading the book under fire by fred burton and samuel m katz educate yourself on what really happened in benghazi and analyze hillary s reactions the fact that hillary stated that the attack on the us diplomatic compound in benghazi was caused by an anti islamic video is absolutely embarrassing in addition those in the benghazi compound requested more security but hillary denied their requests the congressional committee held an investigation which angered democrats because they believed the issue was being politicized to damage hillary s upcoming presidential bid during the congressional committee hearing ron johnson a senator from wisconsin tried to get an answer from hillary as to how and why the attacks occurred hillary responded what difference at this point does it make this is a completely unacceptable answer from the secretary of state imagine if i was giving a presentation in one of my courses in college and at the end the professor asked me a question what if my response to him was i am done with my presentation what difference at this point does it make my professor would probably be shocked sum me up to be a poor student and give me a bad grade hillary on the other hand is freaking secretary of state and that is her response are we in elementary school please have educated answers when you hold such a high position of authority and don t even get me started on the email scandal if hillary cannot keep emails separate and secure to ensure that our nation is safe then she is ineligible to be president is knowing how to use email accounts too much to ask for in a potential presidential candidate if the democrats have made it this far to my article i commend you i m sure the entire time you re thinking surely bernie and hillary are better than any of the republican presidential candidates actually the republican presidential candidates are equally as bad donald trump some want to vote for trump because they say he is an excellent businessman but he has filed for bankruptcy four times some say that filing for bankruptcy can be a smart business move if your business is failing but that s the point his businesses were failing perhaps most importantly though the us is not a business it s a country yes we need a strong economy but running a business and running a country are two entirely different things trump has not studied politics or international relations enough to understand what that entails in addition trump s comment that all muslims should be banned from the us after the paris attacks also displays his lack of knowledge about international politics banning muslims from the us will further marginalize them which leads to more terrorist organizations which leads to more attacks also isis and other groups such as assad s regime in syria are killing muslims and thus they are trying to escape their war torn and extremely dangerous country by seeking asylum in the us i understand the stigma surrounding immigration in the us as well as europe but do we want to look back on this situation in fifty years and feel shame because we turned back victims of sexual violence and torture if you lived in syria right now in fear of your life would you want another country to provide you with aid trump s presidency is based on fear of the other which doesn t exist we are all humans and we need to treat each other as such ted cruz cruz has said that only the four states that were named in the supreme court s decision on gay marriage should follow the ruling but that other states should not follow the ruling i just can t believe that we are still arguing about gay marriage this is another issue we will look back on in fifty years and be ashamed of the supreme court ruled that gay marriage is legal in the us so it is legal in the us cruz has also said that he would consider carpet bombing isis and wants to send arms to the kurdish peshmerga forces to help battle isis because sending arms to forces has worked before and it hasn t caused any terrorist groups to form or anything screams internally also wasn t good ol ted born in canada marco rubio rubio is also against gay marriage which makes me hesitant to vote for him i also do not agree with his views on climate change rubio claims that environmentally friendly standards and organizations are costly and that the economy is much more important to rubio than the environment while i agree that we must strengthen our economy being environmentally sustainable will lead us to be economically stable in the long run cough opec cough rubio s views on abortion are also concerning mainly because they are unclear i personally do not believe in abortion except in the cases of rape incest and health of the mother in the past rubio has stated that he has a zero tolerance policy on abortion but he has also co sponsored legislation that allowed abortion in the cases of rape and incest rubio needs to choose a side and stick to it our president needs to have a clear idea of his beliefs and he must be able to follow through with those beliefs appropriately so that the american people are not mislead there are several issues that i have not discussed for all candidates such as gun control and term limits in washington for the sake of length of the article perhaps i am being much too picky but i believe that our president should be held to extremely high standards we should expect honesty clarity respect responsibility and transparency from our president maybe the corruptness of washington and the lobbyists have eliminated these values and we will never have the government that the founding fathers envisioned i love my country and i want to exercise my right to vote but i am feeling disillusioned with our government and political system i think we can do better don t you you ve been begging him to change it up and now he won t have a choice let s be honest most of our dads are wearing the same shirts today that they probably wore while changing our diapers and holding our hands as we learned to walk sure we love them for it but whether you re quarantined with him wearing the same two shirts on rotation every week or every time you facetime him you know what he ll be wearing before he answers the phone he needs to add some new items to his wardrobe rotation and you know dads they ll feel guilted into using practically anything you were to give them but these shirts are sure fire ways to get him to switch up his wardrobe and he ll be more than excited to wear each and every one of them plus most of them are under twenty dollars so no harm in dropping more than a couple in to your cart and letting dad have his pick of his favorites just because coronavirus has greatly impacted the wellness industry doesn t mean wellness stops if you re anything like me your weekly fitness classes are a huge part of your routine they keep me fit healthy and sane honestly these classes help my mental health stay in tip top shape just as much as they help my physical health due to the coronavirus covid 19 pandemic gyms and fitness studios are facing temporary closure yes this means my personal routine is thrown a curveball but this also means the wellness industry is one of many that is looking at unemployment and hardship do i miss my monday spin class of course but do the wellness professionals whose worlds were flipped upside down have a lot more to overcome than a slight change of routine absolutely thankfully if anyone can prove the ultimate flexibility it s the wellness industry all he says is i love you which is great and all but omg i can t get

to be one of the most intimidating women in the beauty business not only did she launch her beauty marketing career at legendary smashbox cosmetics she went on to lead luxury high end brands like kate somerville and josie maran just to name a few but sitting down to meet liu for the first time in an underground new york bar over a year ago felt like meeting a friend i d known since childhood as she walked into the bar in a chic red dress it was impossible not to feel her immediate warm presence when she talks about her history as an entrepreneur and truly at heart she always was one you don t

grade was the year that you were allowed to participate in a school sport this was what my friends and i had all been waiting for since we started middle school i had already made the cheer team with my friends but i had to wait to start that in the winter since we cheered for basketball i really wanted to have some sort of activity in the fall but i did not know what to do somehow i decided to run cross country not really sure how i decided on a sport where it was quite literally just running a few of my friends were doing it as well so i knew it was going to be fun physical activity helps my mental health in a world that feels uncertain before the pandemic i exercised a handful of times a week at best in quarantine i ve been exercising every single day i don t want this article to be another spiel about how exercise changed my life and all the other cliches that health gurus use to convince others to work out more rather i want to reveal that exercise is a tool that works for me because it boosts my mental health when i feel like the world is spiraling out of control eat the snacks look like a snack to say that 2020 has been a bit of a roller coaster is an extreme
