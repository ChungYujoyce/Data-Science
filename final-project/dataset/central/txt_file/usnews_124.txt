every 10 minutes or so someone knocks on the big wooden door of alexandria ocasio cortez s office on capitol hill the noise makes staffers stiffen it s almost always a harmless fan one of dozens who arrive each day leaving neon colored post it notes as devotional offerings but in her first three months in congress aides say enough people have threatened to murder ocasio cortez that capitol police trained her staff to perform risk assessments of her visitors this is the daily reality for america s newest human rorschach test wonder woman of the left wicked witch of the right ocasio cortez has become the second most talked about politician in america after the president of the united states since beating 10 term incumbent joe crowley in the democratic primary to represent new york s 14th district last june the 29 year old former bartender has pressured 2020 presidential candidates into supporting her green new deal made campaign finance reform go viral and helped activists banish amazon from queens with a couple of tweets no lawmaker in recent memory has translated so few votes into so much political and social capital so quickly her twitter following has climbed from about 49 000 last summer to more than 3 5 million thousands of people tune in to watch her make black bean soup or re pot her houseplants on instagram live immediately after she tweeted the name of her signature red lipstick beso by stila it sold out online at the same time she s a freshman legislator trying to get the hang of her first big full time job i miss being able to go outside in sweats she says in her office one day in march settling into a black leather chair after a long day of subcommittee hearings she s much smaller than she looks on tv with a warm but cautious manner i can t go anywhere in public and just be a person without a lot of people watching everything i do ocasio cortez represents one vision of the democratic party s future she s a young hispanic woman three cornerstones of the party s electoral coalition she s a democratic socialist at a time when confidence in capitalism is declining especially among progressive millennials the issues she ran on a green new deal medicare for all a federal jobs guarantee abolishing ice are animating a new generation of democrats she s a political phenomenon part activist part legislator arguably the best storyteller in the party since barack obama and perhaps the only democrat right now with the star power to challenge president donald trump s the woman everyone calls aoc is as much a villain to the right as she is a hero to the left she s replaced hillary clinton as the preferred punching bag of fox news pundits and republican lawmakers and the hits are taking their toll public opinion of ocasio cortez has soured as she becomes better known according to a gallup poll conducted in february 31 of americans overall have a favorable impression of her against 41 unfavorable a 15 point swing since september the same poll found that her popularity had increased with democrats and nonwhites her green new deal proposal has driven policy debates on the left but it has virtually no chance of becoming law anytime soon her allies plan to boost primary challengers to moderate and conservative democrats a push that ocasio cortez has distanced herself from but one that has earned her the enmity of some colleagues many house democrats resent her celebrity and worry it overshadows efforts to reach the moderate voters who propelled the party to the majority privately some admit they re also a little afraid of her that s because ocasio cortez threatens the status quo bringing a youthful impatience to a set of policies popularized by bernie sanders 2016 campaign like medicare for all and tuition free public college like sanders she seems more concerned with movements than elections she doesn t talk about flipping seats and votes but rather of winning hearts and minds hers is the politics of the possible not the practical by the time legislation actually gets through it is five years from now she says so everything we introduce needs to have 2025 or our kids in mind she s not thinking about how to keep the democratic majority for another two years she s thinking about how to define the agenda for the next two decades it s a big change in a party that spent the last 10 years following incrementalist leaders like obama and hillary clinton it s not just that ocasio cortez is pushing for more progressive policies she s recast the division between left and center as a tug of war between the party s past and its future there s always this talk about division within the democratic party ideological differences she says in her office but i actually think they re generational differences because the america we grew up in is nothing like the america our parents or our grandparents grew up in on ocasio cortez s office bookshelf near a picture of her late father and a photo of her with a local girl scout troop two books nestle together in uneasy union one is the federalist papers written mostly by james madison and alexander hamilton and published in 1788 the other is the uninhabitable earth life after warming written by journalist david wallace wells 231 years later there s a picture of wonder woman leaning in one corner of the office and a giant cardboard cutout of cardi b s face in another on her desk are handwritten crib sheets for a february hearing i m going to be the bad guy she wrote in pencil more than 40 million people watched a subsequent nowthis news clip of her questioning a government accountability watchdog about campaign finance laws ocasio cortez was born in 1989 a few weeks before the berlin wall fell george h w bush was in his first year as president nancy pelosi had just gotten to congress sanders had already lost two senate races and joe biden had just bungled his first presidential bid she was in elementary school during the financial prosperity of the 1990s eating dunkaroos while grownups clucked on television about bill clinton balancing the budget an entire generation which is now becoming one of the largest electorates in america came of age and never saw american prosperity she says i have never seen that or experienced it really in my adult life she was born into a working class family in the parkchester section of the bronx her dad owned a small architecture company her puerto rico born mother cleaned houses they were deeply rooted in the neighborhood but also wary of its limitations ocasio cortez has told friends she learned early on that wearing hoop earrings and nameplate necklaces was fine in the bronx but she wouldn t be taken seriously if she wore them to a job interview the family moved to the prosperous westchester county suburb of yorktown heights when she was about 5 so that she and her brother could go to better schools but they returned frequently to see the rest of their family those 40 minute drives taught her how zip code determines destiny she says by the time she was in college some of her cousins were already having kids ocasio cortez describes herself as a dorky kid who once asked for a micro scope for her birthday her 2007 high school microbiology project on the effects of antioxidants on the life span of roundworms won second place in the microbiology category at the intel international science and engineering fair she often joined her mom to clean the homes of neighbors and she wrote her college application essay about the two of them helping a man who d lost his wife the only way they could by cleaning out his fridge she took out student loans to enroll at boston university graduating in 2011 with a degree in economics and international relations when ocasio cortez was a teenager her father was diagnosed with lung cancer just before she returned to boston for her sophomore year she went to see him in the hospital i didn t know that it was going to be the last time that i talked to my dad but toward the end of our interaction i started to feel like it was she says i said goodbye but i think he knew and i knew and so i started to leave and he kind of hollered out and i turned around in the doorframe and he said hey make me proud he died about a week later in the fall of 2008 the death plunged the family into financial trouble just as the economy was melting down her mother picked up a job driving school buses to stave off foreclosure on their home after graduation ocasio cortez moved back to the bronx to work at an educational nonprofit with a side gig as a bartender at a manhattan taco joint most of her peers were piecing together two or three jobs to stay ahead of the bills spoiler alert the gig economy is about not giving people full time jobs she says so it should be no secret why millennials want to decouple your insurance status from your employment status for most of her 20s she lived paycheck to paycheck she paid 200 a month for an affordable care act health insurance plan with a huge deductible like 44 million other americans she had student loan debt about 25 000 worth which meant 300 a month in payments we have an entire generation that is delaying or forgoing purchasing houses she says our entire economy is slowing down due to the student loan crisis ocasio cortez had gotten her first taste of politics during college as an intern in massachusetts senator ted kennedy s office by the time bernie sanders launched his 2016 campaign she was hooked she volunteered to knock on doors for his campaign across the bronx and queens i had done grassroots organizing before she says but sanders race was one of my first times where i crossed that bridge from grassroots community organizing to electoral organizing when trump won ocasio cortez was shocked but not surprised in the weeks after the election she and her friends piled into a borrowed 1998 subaru and drove from new york city to the standing rock indian reservation to join the lakota sioux s resistance to the dakota access pipeline they drove through the midwest stopping in flint mich on their way to the freezing plains of north dakota they had long bull sessions about whether sanders would have beaten trump and whether the media had been in the tank for clinton they sang tlc s no scrubs and subsisted on red bull clif bars and hot cheetos from gas stations the standing rock trip was transformational for ocasio cortez she had visited a city poisoned by lead on her way to help a community fight the construction of a massive government backed oil pipeline the trip helped her connect a lot of different dots about how environmental degradation affects everybody no matter where you live i think the me that walked out of that she says was more galvanized and more open to taking risks then as she was driving back to new york she got a call she never expected someone wanted her to run for congress once it became clear that sanders wouldn t win the nomination a few of his former staffers formed a group called brand new congress the goal was to recruit progressives who weren t wealthy well connected white men to run for the house and senate so that a future progressive president would have allies in the legislature saikat chakrabarti now ocasio cortez s chief of staff and corbin trent now her communications director began soliciting names of working class leaders who might be willing to run in the end they got some 11 000 nominations from across the country one of them was a letter from gabriel ocasio cortez 26 touting his older sister alexandria she fit the mold exactly we looked at the brother telling the story of a sister who wasn t a giant nonprofit executive she didn t go work on the hill for 10 years recalls alexandra rojas now executive director of justice democrats an organization allied with brand new congress she was someone who watched her family struggle through the financial crisis the campaign was a long shot from the start everyone said she s really cute but maybe next time ocasio cortez recalls crowley the fourth ranking house democrat was a prolific fundraiser who had been in congress since 1999 her campaign was mostly volunteers staffers wrote their job titles on post it notes above their desks in their small queens office ever the activist her campaign had an informal flexible structure resembling leaderless social movements like the one she saw at standing rock one of ocasio cortez s first events was at the home of jake degroot a former theater lighting designer who had been involved in occupy wall street after hearing ocasio cortez shout over the air conditioner in his living room to fewer than a dozen people degroot joined her campaign first as a volunteer and then as digital organizing director many of her top volunteers were former actors who had gotten involved with politics during the sanders campaign and now saw organizing as a second career the 14th district contains parts of astoria queens which is nicknamed actoria because so many actors live there that meant her campaign was infused with the imagination that animates all good drama and a team that knew how to tell a story theater and politics are very simpatico says degroot theater done well is politics politics done poorly is theater more important there was a shared sense among the young volunteers that they had been screwed we were all children of the recession say waleed shahid of justice democrats there s an overwhelming sense that the economic and political system in our country is rigged that s why young americans have become increasingly attracted to democratic socialism which aims to build a stronger social safety net through democratic elections after sanders rise in the 2016 democratic primaries membership in the democratic socialists of america dsa soared from fewer than 10 000 members in early 2016 to more than 55 000 by 2019 a 2018 harvard poll found that 39 of young americans favor democratic socialism and even young americans who don t identify with the movement overwhelmingly support ideas like medicare for all tuition free public college and a green new deal every year young people are ticking a couple points more left says john della volpe of the harvard kennedy school institute of politics who has been tracking youth political attitudes since 2000 on literally every single question they re moving left the dsa endorsed ocasio cortez and young enthusiastic volunteers stormed her district in the weeks leading up to the election in the end she beat crowley by about 4 000 votes the upset made her the new face of the young progressive movement within weeks she was traveling the country speaking to packed rooms and standing ovations as she stumped for candidates in kansas missouri and michigan she pointed to her own unlikely victory and sanders insurgent campaign in the 2016 primaries as evidence that progressives could win across the country she has this ability to understand a moment and then how to leverage it says rhiana gunn wright policy director for the left wing policy shop new consensus she understands that she has a lot of shine right now and yet most of the campaigns ocasio cortez supported ended up losing of 78 candidates endorsed by justice democrats in 2018 only four nonincumbents won their seats all replacing other democrats in deep blue districts organizers argue that losing isn t really losing since progressive primary challengers often pull moderate nominees to the left still america isn t her district says joel benenson a democratic consultant who advised obama s and clinton s presidential campaigns and argues that neither party can win if they don t win moderates democrats shouldn t take the bait but this is the paradox facing the democrats ocasio cortez represents a merging of movement and electoral politics that hasn t permeated the rest of the party let alone the rest of the country the ideas generating the most enthusiasm among the party s very loud very online left flank don t necessarily win elections which to some progressives is beside the point the point of a message is not to win an election it s to change policy to move things for people to lead with your ideals says dr abdul el sayed 34 who stumped with ocasio cortez in his bid to become governor of michigan who cares about winning elections indeed he lost the democratic nomination by more than 20 points when she goes to meetings in her district ocasio cortez takes notes hunched over a single subject notebook as if she were in science class as soon as she starts speaking the room changes in a hot and stuffy education meeting in the queens neighborhood of jackson heights the crowd stood up and cheered when she took the microphone then swarmed her afterward to ask for hugs and selfies at a community board meeting in an astoria wedding venue one older board member slept through the entire session waking up only to click a few pictures of her on his cell phone camera afterward ocasio cortez crouched to listen to a constituent s concerns about the rise of anti semitism her beige heels slightly scuffed were a half size too big the reception in washington hasn t been quite as warm ocasio cortez is among the most visible of a group of young left wing freshman democrats including representatives ilhan omar of minnesota and rashida tlaib of michigan who have sparked controversy for their views on everything from impeachment to israel some fellow first term democrats welcome the spotlight she brings we have this really dynamic rock star who is getting a lot of attention says representative haley stevens of michigan a co president of the freshman class why is that a bad thing in person democratic sources say ocasio cortez is friendly and respectful nothing like the firebrand who spars with critics online she s quiet as a mouse in caucus meetings says one congressional source yet the attention she gets has also prompted plenty of grumbling from colleagues you could go a day without writing a story about aoc groused representative mark pocan a co chair of the congressional progressive caucus and a co sponsor of the green new deal many democrats argue that proposals like the green new deal a nonbinding resolution that won t become law with republicans in control of the senate and the white house put democrats in purple districts in a tough spot ninety house democrats have signed onto it but others who care about climate change are wary of backing a document that contains provisions like a jobs guarantee that put off moderates and tee up gop attacks at the recent conservative political action conference former trump adviser sebastian gorka dubbed the proposal a watermelon because it was green on the outside and deep deep communist red on the inside freshman democrats representing conservative districts including representatives abigail spanberger of virginia and ben mcadams of utah have been asked about socialism at their town halls the old adage in washington is that there are two types of members of congress workhorses who revel in the details of legislating and constituent work and show horses who crave the cameras in interviews a half dozen house democratic aides described ocasio cortez as the latter her office says she attends more hearings than any of her colleagues there s little question her first months in congress have included some freshman blunders her office botched the rollout of the green new deal by inadvertently posting an unfinished version she took two months longer than any other freshman representative from new york to open a district office and conservative groups have filed complaints with the federal election commission alleging improper campaign finance arrangements ocasio cortez has called the allegations bogus and experts have suggested it s unlikely her team committed significant campaign finance violations she boosted the grassroots effort to block amazon s plan to establish a new hub in new york but critics say the deal s collapse cost the city jobs she sometimes responds to tough coverage including media outlets pointing out errors she s made by firing back at the press i think that there s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely factually and semantically correct than about being morally right she told cnn s anderson cooper as an activist ocasio cortez is used to focusing more on moral imperatives than on incremental policy wins i don t think that we can compromise on transitioning to 100 renewable energy we cannot compromise on saving our planet we can t compromise on saving kids she says we have to do these things if we want to do them in different ways that s fine but we can t not do them capitol hill s traditional emphasis on civility and compromise she thinks is merely a delay tactic there are always these folks that will say you re not wrong but she says rolling her eyes they avoid the political liability of disagreeing with you but also they can stall you as much as possible to actually prevent the thing from happening so evaluating ocasio cortez s success depends on the time frame in which she is judged will she help deliver medicare for all and a green new deal in the next two years no but having the debate is already making a difference in how d c does business i used to be much more cynical about how much was up against us she says i think i ve changed my mind because i think that change is a lot closer than we think with reporting by alana abramson washington charlotte alter is a national correspondent at time krisanne johnson is a photographer based in new york
