continuing to respond to the coronavirus outbreak for this analysis we surveyed 11 537 u s adults in march 2020 everyone who took part is a member of pew research center s american trends panel atp an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses this way nearly all u s adults have a chance of selection the survey is weighted to be representative of the u s adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories read more about the atp s methodology here are the questions used for the report along with responses and its methodology as the number of confirmed covid 19 cases continues to rise and schools workplaces and public gathering spaces across the united states remain closed a new pew research center survey finds that the coronavirus outbreak is having profound impacts on the personal lives of americans in a variety of ways nearly nine in ten u s adults say their life has changed at least a little as a result of the covid 19 outbreak including 44 who say their life has changed in a major way amid widespread calls from experts for americans to socially distance from one another to avoid spreading the virus what recently seemed like mundane daily activities now elicit concerns from large swaths of the population about nine in ten u s adults 91 say that given the current situation they would feel uncomfortable attending a crowded party roughly three quarters 77 would not want to eat out at a restaurant in the midst of a presidential election year about two thirds 66 say they wouldn t feel comfortable going to a polling place to vote and smaller but still substantial shares express discomfort even with going to the grocery store 42 or visiting with a close friend or family member in their home 38 how are people adapting their behavior in light of the outbreak four in ten working age adults ages 18 to 64 report having worked from home because of coronavirus concerns a figure that rises to a majority among working age adults with college degrees and upper income earners still despite current circumstances about two thirds of adults with children under 12 at home say it s been at least somewhat easy for them to handle child care responsibilities the virus also has impacted americans religious behaviors more than half of all u s adults 55 say they have prayed for an end to the spread of coronavirus large majorities of americans who pray daily 86 and of u s christians 73 have taken to prayer during the outbreak but so have some who say they seldom or never pray and people who say they do not belong to any religion 15 and 24 respectively among u s adults who said in an earlier survey they attend religious services at least once or twice a month most 59 now say they have scaled back their attendance because of the coronavirus in many cases presumably because churches and other houses of worship have canceled services but this does not mean they have disengaged from collective worship entirely a similar share 57 reports having watched religious services online or on tv instead of attending in person together four in ten regular worshippers appear to have replaced in person attendance with virtual worship saying that they have been attending less often but watching online instead these are among the findings of a pew research center survey of 11 537 u s adults conducted march 19 24 2020 using the center s american trends panel 1 other key findings from the survey include nearly nine in ten u s adults say their personal life has changed at least a little bit as a result of the coronavirus outbreak with 44 saying their life has changed in a major way just 12 say their life has stayed about the same as it was before the outbreak women 47 are more likely than men 41 to say their personal life has changed in a major way as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and while more than four in ten white 45 and hispanic 47 adults say this has changed their lives significantly about a third of black adults 34 say the same income and education are also linked to assessments of the personal impact of the coronavirus outbreak more than half of those with higher incomes 54 say this has changed their life in a major way compared with 44 of those with middle incomes and 39 of those with lower incomes 2 similarly 61 of those with postgraduate degrees and a narrower majority of those with bachelor s degrees 54 say the coronavirus outbreak has changed their life in a major way by comparison 43 of those with some college and about a third of those with a high school diploma or less education 35 say this has happened to them across income groups those with at least a bachelor s degree are more likely than those with less education to say the coronavirus outbreak has changed their life in a major way across age groups similar shares say the coronavirus outbreak has had a major impact on their personal life for example 43 of adults younger than 30 say the outbreak has changed their life in a major way as do 45 of those ages 65 and older not surprisingly those in states with a high number of coronavirus cases are more likely than those in states that haven t been as affected to say their personal life has changed in a major way because of the outbreak about half of those who live in states with a high number of cases 51 say their life has changed in a major way compared with 43 of those in states with a medium number of cases and 40 of those in states with a low number of cases 3 among the 33 of americans who say they or someone in their household has either lost a job or took a pay cut because of the coronavirus outbreak 54 say their personal life has changed in a major way as a result of the outbreak this compares with 39 of those who say they have not experienced either of these situations democrats are more likely than republicans to say their personal life has changed in a major way as a result of the coronavirus outbreak about half of democrats and democratic leaners 51 say this compared with 38 of republicans and those who lean to the gop these partisan differences remain even after accounting for the fact that democrats are more likely than republicans to live in states with a high number of confirmed cases of covid 19 about a third of democrats 34 live in these states compared with 22 of republicans more than half of democrats in states with a high number of cases 57 say their life has changed in a major way compared with 42 of republicans in states with a high number of cases similarly in states with a medium or low number of cases democrats are more likely than their republican counterparts to say the coronavirus outbreak has impacted their life in a major way about six in ten americans say they would feel comfortable visiting with close friends and family members at their home 62 and going to the grocery store 57 given the current coronavirus outbreak roughly four in ten say they would not be comfortable doing these things 38 and 42 respectively far fewer express comfort in going to a polling place to vote 33 or eating out in a restaurant 22 and only about one in ten 9 say they would feel comfortable attending a crowded party there are some notable demographic differences in what americans are comfortable doing during the current outbreak in particular younger adults are more likely than older americans to express comfort with leaving their homes for various reasons across all age groups majorities of americans say they are uncomfortable eating out in a restaurant still about one quarter of young adults ages 18 to 29 27 say they would be comfortable doing this compared with just 16 of americans 65 and older younger americans are also more likely to feel comfortable visiting with family and friends 68 of adults younger than 30 say they d be comfortable doing this compared with 60 of americans ages 30 to 49 64 of adults ages 50 to 64 and 56 of those 65 and older across a variety of measures republicans are more likely than democrats to say they are comfortable continuing with regular activities republicans are significantly more likely than democrats to say they are comfortable going to a grocery store and visiting friends and are far more likely than democrats to say they are comfortable eating in a restaurant roughly seven in ten republicans 69 say they are comfortable visiting with a close friend or family member at their home while 31 say they would be uncomfortable democrats are more divided 55 say they would be comfortable doing this while 45 say they would not be comfortable when it comes to americans comfort with visiting with those close to them partisan differences remain even after accounting for the fact that democrats are more likely than republicans to live in states with a high number of confirmed cases of covid 19 about two thirds of republicans in states with a high number of cases 65 say they would be comfortable visiting with close family and friends compared with 50 of democrats in these states similarly in states with a medium or low number of cases republicans are more likely than their democratic counterparts to say they are comfortable visiting with family and friends overall americans living in suburban and rural areas are more likely than those living in urban communities to feel comfortable visiting with close friends and relatives however americans living in urban areas are divided depending on how many confirmed cases of covid 19 are in their state those living in urban areas in states with a high number of cases are the least likely to feel comfortable visiting with others 47 while urban dwellers in states with a medium 56 or low 67 number of cases are more likely to feel comfortable going out to visit friends these differences are not as stark in suburban areas and there is no difference in comfort with visiting others among americans in rural communities regardless of the number of cases in the state amid recommendations for social distancing to help prevent the spread of covid 19 about one in five adults 21 say they have used a food delivery service instead of going to a restaurant or grocery store as a result of the coronavirus outbreak adults younger than 30 are particularly likely to say they have used a food delivery service because of the coronavirus outbreak three in ten in this group say they have done this a quarter of adults ages 30 to 49 also say they have used a food delivery service because of the coronavirus outbreak while smaller shares of those ages 50 to 64 15 and those 65 and older 14 say the same hispanic adults 26 are more likely than white 19 and black 20 adults to have used a food delivery service instead of going to a restaurant or grocery store as a result of the coronavirus outbreak and while about a quarter of women 23 say they have done this about one in five men 19 say the same there are no notable differences by educational attainment income or whether people live in states with a high medium or low number of coronavirus cases four in ten working age adults those ages 18 to 64 say they have worked from home as a result of the coronavirus outbreak 4men and women in this age group are about equally likely to say they have worked from home about three quarters of working age adults with a postgraduate degree 73 say they have worked from home as a result of the coronavirus outbreak as do 62 of those with a bachelor s degree far smaller shares of working age adults with some college 35 or with a high school diploma or less education 22 say they have worked from home similarly working age adults with higher incomes are more likely than those with lower incomes to say they have worked from home because of the coronavirus outbreak 61 of those in the upper income tier say they have done this compared with 41 in the middle income tier and an even smaller share 27 of those with lower incomes in states with a high number of coronavirus cases 45 of working age adults say they have worked from home because of the outbreak smaller shares in states with a medium or low number of cases say the same 38 each even as many schools have closed because of the coronavirus outbreak 65 of adults with children younger than 12 at home say it has been at least somewhat easy for them to handle child care responsibilities during this time with 32 saying it has been very easy about a third 35 say this has been very or somewhat difficult for them similar shares of men 68 and women 63 with young children at home say it has been easy for them to handle child care responsibilities during the coronavirus outbreak the difference between the shares of men and women saying this is not statistically significant black and hispanic adults with children younger than 12 at home are more likely than white adults with children in the same age group to say handling child care responsibilities has been difficult for them during the outbreak about four in ten black 38 and hispanic 40 adults with young children say this compared with 28 of their white counterparts still majorities of at least six in ten in each group say it has been easy for them to handle child care responsibilities during this time majorities across income groups also say handling child care responsibilities has been at least somewhat easy for them so far but those with middle incomes are more likely than those with upper or lower incomes to say this seven in ten middle income adults with children younger than 12 at home say it s been easy for them to handle child care responsibilities compared with 58 of those in the upper income tier and 63 in the lower income tier more than half of u s adults say they have prayed for an end to the spread of the coronavirus evangelical protestants are among the most likely to say they have prayed for an end to the virus 82 say they ve done so a similar share of adherents of the historically black protestant tradition 79 say they have done the same two thirds of catholics 68 and mainline protestants 65 also say they have prayed for an end to the outbreak roughly one third of jews 35 say they have prayed to end the virus religious nones especially self described atheists and agnostics are less likely than those who identify with a religion to say they have prayed for an end to the outbreak though 36 of those who describe their religion as nothing in particular say they have prayed about the virus fully 86 of people who pray every day say they have prayed specifically about the virus as have two thirds of those who say they pray on a weekly basis half of those who say they pray a few times a month report having prayed about the coronavirus as have 15 of those who generally seldom or never pray more women than men say they have prayed for an end to the spread of the disease and more black respondents than white and hispanic respondents say the same older people are more likely than younger adults to say they have prayed for an end to the virus and more republicans than democrats have prayed about the outbreak these patterns are consistent with overall differences in the religiousness of these groups the survey also shows that the outbreak has changed the religious attendance habits of u s adults at least for the time being among people who said in a previous survey that they generally attend religious services at least once or twice a month 59 now say they have attended less often recently as a result of the outbreak and a similar share 57 say they have watched religious services online or on tv instead of in person 5 across christian groups half or more of those who typically attend church at least monthly say they have been going less often because of the virus many of them including two thirds of evangelical protestants say they have tuned in to church services online or on television instead of attending in person women who attend worship services monthly or more often are a bit more likely than men who attend with the same frequency to say they have turned to the internet or television to watch religious services though no more likely to say they have been attending less often in person white church attenders are more likely than blacks and latinos to say they have attended less often higher shares of republicans than democrats say they have stayed away from religious services and that they have turned to virtual alternatives in reaction to the outbreak combining the two questions suggests that four in ten americans who typically attend religious services at least monthly appear to have replaced their in person attendance with virtual religious participation 40 say they have been attending religious services less often and that they have been watching them online or on television instead as a result of the outbreak one in five 19 are attending less often but not replacing in person attendance with watching services electronically and 17 appear to be supplementing their in person attendance with virtual participation i e they say they are not attending less but that they are watching online or on tv one quarter of those who typically attend religious services monthly say their attendance habits have not changed they are not attending less often nor are they watching services online or on television among those who typically attend church at least monthly the share of christians who indicate they have replaced in person attendance with watching church services online or on tv tops out at 47 among evangelical protestants white people are more likely than black and hispanic respondents to say they are now watching religious services online while attending less in person while black and hispanic people are more likely than white respondents to say they are supplementing their in person attendance with virtual religious participation or that their attendance habits have not changed correction april 1 2020 a previous version of the first chart in the report had an incorrect percentage for the share of americans who would feel uncomfortable going out to the grocery store it should have been 42 this change does not substantively affect the report s findings fact tank01 17 2019 fact tank09 06 2018 fact tank11 28 2018 internet
