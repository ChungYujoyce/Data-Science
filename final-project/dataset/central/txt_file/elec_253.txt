as dan schwabel at quartz in a piece modestly entitled the complete guide to winning the millennial vote this election recently noted as we head into november s us elections all candidates are vying for the millennial vote and for good reason millennials are a critical bloc for any campaign 69 2 million are now eligible to vote which is more than double compared to the past decade when added together with gen x voters 2016 represents the first time young people have displaced the baby boomer vote at the same time millennials are historically less likely to vote than their older peers with only around half having voted in the last presidential election knowing this there s no question that all political parties will be pushing hard to get them to the voting booths this fall i too covet the kids allegiance yet i an aging boomer confess to finding the millennials mystifying i am the father and co owner of three of them plus one gen xer i know more than a few others they re everywhere and deeply enigmatic yet i have a theory that could provide the key to resolving their riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma they have not yet found but absolutely must conceive and declare their own narrative let the candidates take note making this strong demand of them would be an act of tough love it could pay huge dividends a quick glance at the new generation gap betraying just how old a fogey i am let me recount a bit of conversation from a few years ago with a lovely young fogey millennial discussing a column of mine in the long lost parcbench com it was about how the beatles the who and the rolling stones through respectively revolution won t get fooled again and sympathy for the devil stopped an impending communist takeover of america and the west let s add buffalo springfield s for what it s worth the young fogey s response stopped me cold that s really interesting i ve heard of the beatles so who am i to judge and yet the sociologists and pollsters obsessively study these magical unicorns with something like the ardor of an anthropologist encountering a newly discovered tribe in the amazon basin their earnest scholasticism is interesting but does not resolve the enigma schwabel summarizes some of the pollsters observations the world economic forum s annual global shapers survey found the top five most concerning world issues for young people are climate change large scale conflicts religious conflicts poverty and government accountability socioeconomic wellbeing is also important as 20 of millennials are living in poverty many whom are unemployed underemployed or have even given up on finding a job these young voters want politicians to close the poverty gap and regulate student loans so that they aren t poor and in debt the same harvard poll found that millennials feel the division between rich and poor is worse than before they were born finally they want the government to be more transparent and less corrupt after the recession and the following bailouts they became more suspicious of politicians and they have to work harder to earn their trust back a mere one in every four millennials says they can trust the government always or most of the time sounds true yet as winston churchill purportedly once demanded of a waiter take away this pudding it has no theme the poll results similarly do not reveal a theme every generation needs to write its own story we boomers were great at generating drama manufacturing meaning for our lives and achieving glory time for the millennials to step up and top us a few years ago a group of collegiate millennials came to interview me they had the usual surly attitude toward us boomers we had they seemed to believe ruined everything i told them point blank to their astonishment that they were dead wrong about us we boomers have a great track record and are weary and waiting for them to step up wrest power from us and use it for good they were astounded the boomers inaugurated an imperfect but amazingly successful worldwide epoch of world peace human dignity and equitable prosperity bringing this about took many pitched battles with the establishment our victories many hard fought fulfilled our human hunger for drama and glory now it is time for the millennials to step up and bring it home peace our generation won the cold war one of the outcomes the number of nuclear weapons in the world has dropped from something like 60 000 in 1985 to about 3 000 deployed today that s a really big deal there is of course more to be done former secretary of defense william perry now heroically and shrewdly calls upon america to scrap the most dangerous element of the nuclear weapons triad icbms taking the threat of nuclear war down another big notch would be a great cause for the millennials come on kids time to step up to the plate the pentagon still needs some exorcising despair is not a strategy step up dignity in winning the cold war we took down communist totalitarianism over most of the world replacing it imperfectly but impressively with classical liberal republican governance elsewhere we softened totalitarianism to authoritarianism that s an amazing triumph for human dignity there is of course more to be done the eradication of racial discrimination is a moral imperative and ending racial bigotry while justifiably the cause c l bre is not the only bigotry to fight one of the polls cited by schwabel identifies religious liberty as a big millennial value add in opposition to religious bigotry come on kids time to step up to the plate how about making george washington s declaration to bigotry no sanction a rallying cry despair is not a strategy step up prosperity the boomers placed the world on course to nearly end abject poverty we achieved this startlingly not through government aid but through policies of market driven economic growth there is of course more to be done environmental degradation as a side effect is a serious problem solve it how worried about climate change think it s induced by co2 we boomers used market driven innovation to drive down the cost of emission free energy solar wind and the attendant storage devices needed for intermittent power by in some cases 99 emission free energy will soon be cheaper than fossil fuels bonus no co2 come on kids step up to the plate cleaning up the land air and oceans and accelerating the development and adoption of cheap emission free energy are great causes despair is not a strategy step up given the epic almost mythic successes of us boomers how can the millennials hope to compete what story will they ride to glory millennials could undo the wreckage of the classical liberal republican order wrought by well meaning progressives this path has been meticulously charted by public intellectual jonathan rauch our crumbling national physical infrastructure is just a shadow on the cave wall cast by our degraded political infrastructure great cause millennials of a more militant stripe can lead the fight against the cultural revolution that is attempting to create an undifferentiated dangerously romantic utopian cultural hegemony great cause those of a more nurturing stripe can undertake to commence a secular project to reweave the social fabric great cause the most obvious and compelling cause might be to inaugurate a true golden age of equitable prosperity call it restoring the american dream of prosperity and justice for all the parties have become ridiculously polarized republicans for prosperity and democrats for justice these are not mutually exclusive we need both and actually know how to get both once we force the politicians to stop using the american dream as a political football the system has blindly stumbled into a little dark age 16 years of economic stagnation this is almost certainly due to bad monetary policy which since about the turn of the millennium has caused gdp to grow at only half its historical trend compounded that has cut our wages and wealth and the national gdp by about a third from where it should be this tsunami of poverty has hit millennials especially hard the american dream prosperity conjoined with economic justice has slipped into a long coma restore good job growth and equitable prosperity by restoring the classical gold standard millennials can double the rate of real gdp growth generating great jobs gaining the means to pay off those onerous student loans and get on with prospering great cause there are many potential great causes beckoning we boomers however are worn out so far though crickets step up demanding that the millennials step up looks like the solution to the enigma and the means to earn their allegiance and votes a presidential candidate who publicly applies this tough love lesson to the millennials will inspire a massive constituency and earn many votes save i am the editor in chief of the committee to unleash
