sentiment praising harris s exuberance and ability to excite people in the room the former california attorney general has long been seen as a candidate with crossover appealwho can winover moderates and liberals alike and who has the ability to catch fire in the race but her campaign has lost steam nearly two months after an electric performance at the first democratic debates strategists and political observers say five polls taken after the second round of democratic debates put her in the single digits consistently behind former vice president joe bidenjoe bidenthe hill s morning report

result harris s trip to an enclave of the democratic base at the height of the summer vacation season comes with her campaign at something of a crossroads the daughter of an indian mother and jamaican father harris has an inspiring background and life story that seems to speak to the times she has strengths that compare favorably to all of her main rivals from her age her ethnic background and even her state she s a californian to the core growing up in a state that is now a bastion of democratic power she s a relatively new face to the national political stage but she also has experience as a former attorney general and now senator yet harris also has some weakness some of which strategists say have been exacerbated by her campaign to date she s positioned herself as both a progressive and a moderate causing her to be viewed as inauthentic said one democratic strategist i still don t think anyone really understands why she s running the strategist said and if you re running for president and you don t know why you re running no one else will either earlier this month fivethirtyeight s nate silver said harris seems to be stuck in between joe biden on the one hand and elizabeth warren and bernie sanders on her other more left leaning hand and that s starting to show up in the numbers silver said he pointed to a quinnipiac poll which showed that there s no single group of democrats say wealthy or young or black among whom harris is polling at higher than 10 percent the large field which includes two dozen candidates has also made it tough for harris political observers say it s so hard in a field of two dozen to capture attention on a relatively regular basis and if you don t have that attention you tend to drift downward said cal jillson a professor of political science at southern methodist university and really it s happened to almost everyone jillson said while harris had her breakout moment in the first debate when she challenged biden s opposition to federal busing the electorate s second sense of it was more mixed a harris campaign spokesmandid not respond to a request for comment another strategist who is not attached to any of the campaigns said harris has suffered because she s been very cautious with her approach drawing comparisons to hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more s cautious campaign in 2016 basil smikle who served as the executive director of the new york state democratic party and is a former aide to clinton said harris has been unable to overcome the initial perception of her candidacy to her detriment many voters initially viewed harris as a good vp pick for someone like biden and she didn t have the built in national constituency that biden warren or sanders possessed smikle said but smikle said there s time for harris to recover she s well established in the top tier of candidates and benefits from any slippage in biden s black voters and redistribution of support when others drop out of the race he said adding that as of now harris has the money to stay competitive through the early states and perhaps until super tuesday when her home state of california gets to vote another factor that could work in harris s favor biden s recent verbal gaffes his lead is a bit tenuous jillson said and once you get below him there are negatives with sanders and warren with some people who think they re too far left what that means for kamala harris is be as solid as you can be to always be there for a second look he added some people that look beyond biden and see bernie and elizabeth warren will keep
