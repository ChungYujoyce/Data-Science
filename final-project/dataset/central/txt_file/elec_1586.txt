to the high salience vp picks have had in previous election years vice presidential picks often serve as a unifying force for a party after a divisive contest for the nomination a point trump is likely considering as he tries to woo establishment republicans onto his side the right vp candidate could help bring party leaders republican voters and big donors into the trump fold all people the campaign desperately needs ahead of the general election even if it doesn t move the needle much the vice presidential selection can help compensate for some of the problems and concerns that voters have about a nominee julian zelizer a professor of history and public affairs at princeton university writes for cnn in trump s case this is especially important given how unprecedented and unpredictable his candidacy is the assumed vp frontrunners governor christie and former representative gingrich could help trump work the legislative aspect of the presidency gingrich has the experience during his 20 years as a representative from georgia gingrich served as house minority whip for six years and speaker for four and christie who was appointed as us attorney for the district of new jersey by president george w bush in 2002 before becoming governor in 2010 has been crucial to the trump campaign shopping around for endorsements and donations trump is the first to admit that he doesn t know all the ways of washington robert jeffress a dallas pastor who has been close with trump during his campaign told the washington post so to actually push what he wants through he s willing to reach out and get somebody to lend a hand with more than 60 percent of voters feeling unfavorable about trump at the end of june the right vp pick could help voters feel more positive about the republican ticket however gingrich and christie might not be the ones to do it when gingrich withdrew from the presidential race in 2012 he had unfavorable ratings ranging between 56 and 67 percent and even before his unsuccessful presidential bid gingrich had a less than perfect track record as john pitney jr explains trump might be thinking that gingrich could be his link to the washington establishment that he has so long criticized if so he should think again during his speakership gingrich alienated his colleagues through his impetuous leadership style there was an abortive gop effort to depose him in 1997 and in the following year colleagues finally forced him to leave after the clinton impeachment backfired politically during his presidential race few lawmakers endorsed him and christie who once seemed like a presidential contender himself may not be that much better get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox christie s approval
