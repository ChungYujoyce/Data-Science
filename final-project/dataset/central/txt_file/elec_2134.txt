a harsh business environment the result is a disturbing symbiosis as one media watcher put it loading march 21 2016 this election season the news industry ideal of giving comparable attention to the major presidential candidates has utterly collapsed and donald trump has been the undisputed beneficiary twin forces are at play the manhattan billionaire has a clear knack for putting himself in the news through a provocative statement or tweet but a second factor appears to be at least as important news organizations in an era of wrenching financial upheaval are often following paths of least resistance in their quest for profits the tug of war between principles and profits in campaign coverage isn t new for media outlets but it s in a new phase say some experts on the news industry in terms of fairness they ve completely blown that concept up says kevin smith former president of the society of professional journalists spj and current member of its ethics committee the amount of coverage they give to trump compared to any other candidate is astronomical the coverage isn t all favorable by any means but in focusing attention on one candidate the numbers are stunning last week an analysis in the new york times found that trump had amassed nearly 1 9 billion worth of free media coverage over the course of the campaign even as his campaign spends less by far than most every other candidate texas sen ted cruz running second now to trump in the race for the republican nomination received about 313 million worth of coverage according data the times cited from mediaquant in portland ore hillary clinton the democratic front runner received 746 million the times reported while her competitor sen bernie sanders received 321 million and ohio gov john kasich the other republican left in the race has only received about 38 million in earned media coverage over the past year according to mediaquant the all trump all the time coverage of many if not most news outlets violates the basic principle of balance in political coverage mr smith says a lot of things that have happened during this election campaign coverage are going to find their way into ethics textbooks for years to come yes there s self referential irony in yet another story about trump now questioning that very coverage but over the past week the media profession has been doing a bit of journalistic navel gazing if not hand wringing over the outsize coverage of the real estate mogul s outsize personality these are the sort of cleansing conversations smith says should happen on a daily basis particularly during an election season is the public service role of american journalism its long understood duty to inform an electorate and thus foster democracy merely quaint in an era of rollicking twitter and facebook feeds it s a well documented challenge that journalism scholars have been lamenting for over a decade says aram sinnreich professor of communication at american university in washington despite recognizing that they re violating their public service mandate news organizations for large structural reasons that have economic policy and technological origins have an even more immediate mandate to grow audiences and advertising dollars and make more money political journalism s principle of fairness or giving leading candidates at least comparable coverage has been altogether abandoned this cycle he says so there is indeed a crisis within journalism in terms of its ability to perform its central task of reporting the news and maintaining an informed electorate says professor sinnreich also a fellow at thecenter for media social impact in late february cbs chairman les moonves told an audience at the morgan stanley technology media telecom conference in san francisco that donald s place in this election is a good thing it may not be good for america but it s darn good for cbs mr moonves said according tothe hollywood reporter man who would have expected the ride we re all having right now the money s rolling in and this is fun he continued i ve never seen anything like this and this going to be a very good year for us sorry it s a terrible thing to say but bring it on donald keep going the cable news network cnn has seen itsratings climb 170 percent and during the debates with trump ad revenues were 40 times higher than an average night in terms of fairness we always talk about ethical breaches as if they are assaults from outside the profession inward says smith who is also deputy director ofthe kiplinger program in public affairs journalism at the ohio state university in columbus so when we revised spj s ethics code in 2014 one of the things we purposefully inserted something that i wanted in there was about being an independent journalist denying favored treatment to special interests and advertisers governor kasich also chasing trump for the republican nomination said voters are only now beginning to get his platform trump got you know 1 8 billion worth of free media i got like none ok kasich told chuck todd on nbc s meet the press on sunday by contrast no candidate has mastered the click hungry media landscape of the digital age more than the brand savvy reality star trump simply taps out something provocative in 140 characters and it becomes widespread news a disturbing symbiosis as the new york times put it between the gop front runner and the news media as media watchers continue to discuss after the march 8 elections all of the cable news outlets covered trump s entire 45 minute news conference which he used to highlight trump steaks and trump wine at the same time mrs clinton s victory speech was not covered sinnreich says the problem has been around since the demise of the fairness doctrine in the 1980s when terrestrial airwaves the domain of the public gave way to cable lines which are private property broadcasters always hated the doctrine he says it limited their ability to make a profit and they felt like it was limiting their editorial independence but trump is a symptom of a new malaise afflicting journalism he says the rise of the attention economy so anybody who wants to compete with trump has to make this devil s bargain of either trying to communicate something substantive via a medium that is architecturally antithetical to substance or to stoop to his level and try to became as much of soundbite able branded commodity as he is sinnreich says and as this happens smith says a vicious cycle begins in which journalists mimic the larger profit driven media culture instead of maintaining their long held professional and ethical standards get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox and what i believe is happening journalists instead of encouraging and trying to bring more people non journalists into the ethical tent of the media instead find a way to get out from under the tent smith says we should operate with the understanding that we have standards he says and they should be high standards link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight your
