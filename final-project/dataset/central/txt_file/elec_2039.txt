from iowa but their different approaches to the milestone point to an underlying truth for women in politics loading october 23 2014 this november iowans have the opportunity to break the glass ceiling and send their first female to congress staci appel democratic candidate in iowa s third congressional district yells it from the rooftops iowans can make history this year her website enthuses joni ernst iowa s republican candidate for the senate doesn t make a big deal of her gender i believe that we should vote for the person the right candidate regardless of gender she says matter of factly is she right does gender really not matter to voters or perhaps do women vote for women the short answer is this women vote for democrats admittedly that s an overly broad statement that needs the words tend to in there women are more likely to vote for democrats than men says kelly dittmar assistant professor at the center for american women and politics at rutgers university in new brunswick n j party preference trumps any sense of gender affinity for a woman candidate she says sometimes when both candidates are pretty moderate or perceived to be fairly equal women will cross over to support a female candidate such as in the case of former republican senator from maine olympia snowe but that s rare interviews on the campaign trail in iowa as unscientific as they may be bear professor dittmar out as do gender gap data for instance ms ernst who is a senator in the iowa state legislature and a lieutenant colonel in the iowa army national guard enjoys a 15 point advantage among males it s the reverse for her opponent democrat bruce braley an iowa congressman he enjoys a 15 point advantage among women according to a des moines register poll this month the two are running neck and neck in this purple state republicans and democrats are both working hard to get out the women s vote in iowa but the gender gap among voters explains why ernst is sticking to a boilerplate gop message of low taxes a balanced budget and fewer regulations while mr braley is speaking directly to women about issues such as pay equity and the minimum wage and so is ms appel who has a phalanx of volunteers appel women for change contacting women voters on her behalf she says that voters should consider her positions and accomplishments but she also says that having more women in elective office makes a real difference that at least was her experience as an iowa state senator when we brought more women into the state senate we looked at early childhood issues we looked at child safety issues we looked at child diet and physical activity says appel those were previously neglected areas she points out it would be great to be elected as the first iowa woman to congress because i think we need more women there she says right now there are 79 women in the house and 20 female senators out of a total of 535 seats despite several high profile races that give the impression that the midterm elections are the year of the woman it s not a record year in terms of number of female candidates says dittmar at rutgers get the monitor stories you care about delivered
