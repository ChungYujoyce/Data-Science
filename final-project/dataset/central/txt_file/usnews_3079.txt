texas sen ted cruz endorsed donald trump on friday just a couple months after he reinforced their bitter rivalry by declining to back trump in a speech at the republican national convention long before cruz credited trump with being the only thing standing in hillary clinton s way the two spent months slinging insults back and forth here are some of the most memorable trump cruz is worse than hillary he said with the being a canadian citizen he said oh i didn t know that how did he not know that then he said with the loans oh i didn t know that smart guy he doesn t know that yeah that s worse than hillary when you think about it trump said of cruz on jan 20 trump how can ted cruz be an evangelical christian how can ted cruz be an evangelical christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest trump tweeted on feb 12 trump you are the single biggest liar you are the single biggest liar you probably are worse than jeb bush trump told cruz at a primary debate on feb 13 nasty guy now

trump the ad actually came from an anti trump super pac cruz real men don t attack women donald real men don t attack women your wife is lovely and heidi is the love of my life cruz tweeted on march 24 after trump shared an unflattering comparison of melania trump and heidi cruz cruz donald you re a sniveling coward it is not acceptable for a big loud new york bully to attack my wife it is not acceptable for him to make insults to send nasty tweets and i don t know what he does late at night but he tends to do these at about 11 30 at night i assume when his fear is at the highest point cruz said on march 24 i don t get angry often but you mess with my wife you mess with my kids that ll do it every time donald you re a sniveling coward leave heidi the hell alone cruz consistently disgraceful donald trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow cruz tweeted on march 25 cruz nominating donald trump would be a train

and hillary clinton are both big government liberals cruz tweeted on april 26 trump cruz s father was somehow involved with jfk s assassin his father was with lee harvey oswald prior to oswald s being you know shot i mean the whole thing is ridiculous trump said about cruz s father rafael in an interview on may 3 what was he doing with lee harvey oswald shortly before the death before the shooting it s horrible cruz this man is a pathological liar this man is a pathological liar he doesn t know the difference between truth and lies he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth and in a pattern that i think is straight out of a psychology text book his response is to accuse everybody else of lying cruz told reporters on may 3 the man cannot tell the truth but he combines it with being a narcissist a narcissist at a level i don t think this country s ever seen donald trump is such a narcissist that barack obama looks at him and goes dude what s your problem the man is utterly amoral morality does not exist for him cruz added donald is a bully bullies come from a deep yawning cavern of insecurity cruz vote your conscience and to those listening please don t stay home in november cruz said on july 20 in his speech at the republican national convention declining to endorse trump if you love our country and love your children as much as i know that you do stand and speak and vote your conscience vote for candidates up and down the ticket who you trust to defend our freedom and to be faithful to the constitution cruz i am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father i am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father cruz said on july 21 after declining to endorse trump in his convention speech what does it say when you stand up and say vote your conscience and rabid supporters of our nominee begin screaming what a horrible thing to say cruz said if we can t make the case for the american people that voting for our party s nominee is consistent with voting your conscience is consistent with defending freedom and being faithful to the constitution then we are not going to win and we don t deserve to win trump he may have ruined his political career honestly he may have ruined his political career i feel so badly i feel so badly and you know he ll come and endorse over the next little while he ll because he has no choice but i don t want his endorsement what difference does it make i don t want his endorsement i have such great i don t want his endorsement ted stay home relax enjoy
