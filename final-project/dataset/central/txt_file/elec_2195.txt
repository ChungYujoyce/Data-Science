his most ardent foot soldiers whom the senator so far has failed to rein in loading february 24 2020 what makes bernie sanders supporters so passionate they form a grassroots army unmatched by any other democratic campaign and have propelled the iconoclastic vermont senator s improbable rise to the front of the 2020 democratic field with a double digit win in nevada yes they like the idea of free college free health care and forgiving student debt but it s not just about what he can do for them he s encouraged them to get involved in democracy themselves as a powerful antidote for those feeling demoralized i feel like he s showing us how to fight for ourselves says marie duggan an economics professor at keene state college in new hampshire a fraction of sanders supporters have drawn criticism for how they wage this battle wielding profanity and menacing threats across the increasingly coarse twitterverse where senator sanders has more followers than his four top rivals combined there s a lot of slander of bernie supporters by people who seem outraged by our passion tweeted one supporter advocating medicare for all after losing her mother and watching her dad fall into financial ruin do they ever stop to ask why are these people so energized the supporters who have propelled bernie sanders to the front of the democratic field range from septuagenarian social justice warriors to millennials saddled with student debt but they share this the iconoclastic senator from vermont has awakened in them a sense of empowerment at a time when liberals have been feeling particularly demoralized many put it in kennedyesque terms saying it isn t just about what he can do for them it s about what they can do for their democracy he s asking us to create a popular movement that will be strong enough to change the system and make it works for us says marie duggan an economics professor at keene state college in new hampshire i feel like he s showing us how to fight for ourselves in his most resounding show of force yet mr sanders won the nevada caucuses over the weekend by more than 25 points finishing far ahead of his closest rival former vice president joe biden that win was powered by a grassroots army of passionate fans who host bern baby bern disco parties and bake cookies featuring the senator s unruly white hair in frosting despite many having very limited budgets they respond over and over to the sanders campaign s relentless requests to donate collectively giving him nearly 75 million in small donations by farthe most of any democratic campaign and theyenthusiastically advance his cause on social media where mr sanders commands a twitter following of 10 6 million more than that of his four top rivals combined the disproportionately young and digitally savvy cadre of supporters has been instrumental to theimprobable rise of a democratic socialist whose digital game dwarfs that of his democratic rivals and has inspired many to get involved in politics for the first time at the same time there s a darker side to some of this enthusiasm some sanders devotees have sparked concern within the democratic tent for vitriolic and even menacing rhetoric toward political opponents raising questions about the extent to which mr sanders should be held accountable for all his supporters behavior while the senator has repeatedly condemned any harassment or violence in his name his campaign like the trump campaign in 2016 faces a particular challenge as it s bringing in people who feel disenfranchised and tend to distrust the system saysbrian levin director of thecenter for the study of hate and extremism at california state university san bernardino his campaign is in a unique position to inspire people who would not otherwise be involved in politics says professor levin and although that s clearly a positive thing some of his supporters also tend to operate from an anti institutional framework and may be willing to go to extreme lengths to achieve their goals we have to beware of the any means necessary people he says shelby parham a young latina administrative assistant in chicago writes in her twitter bio i like bernie i m one of the bros that s a reference to a pejorative term coined during the 2016 campaign for mr sanders passionate and at times combative online army ms parham sees the term in a different light the media tries to paint bernie supporters as the left wing trump supporters as being aggressive mean twitter hacks who just can t leave people alone or respect other people s decisions says ms parham but to me a bernie bro is a die hard supporter that will be the ones to go knocking on doors we re the ones who have been with him and will stay with him before work after work and whenever she has a break at work she pulls out her phone to tweet or retweet pro bernie material sometimes when she really indulges she says laughing she will retweet as often as 30 times an hour other sanders supporters wield four letter words far more frequently against his critics sometimes with threatening undertones david klion a journalist in brooklyn with nearly 60 000 twitter followers created a firestorm when hetweetedon feb 13 libs who are flirting with bloomberg now should be aware that they are going on lists next time they pretend to care about racism or sexual harassment or really anything other than money and power we will remember what they were doing right now and we will remind everyone after the culinary workers union of nevada warned its 60 000 members in aflyerthat they could lose their hard won health care insurance under sanders medicare for all policy self proclaimed bernie supporters unleashed a barrage of attacks against two union leaders both minority women this is your chance to fix your mistake before the millions and millions of bernie sanders supporters will find you and end your ability to earn a living said one email obtained by thenevada independent calling the women corrupt expletive s and fascist imbeciles when questioned by pete buttigieg at last week s las vegas debate over the issue mr sanders said that out of his 10 6 million twitter followers 99 9 of them are decent human beings are working people are people who believe in justice compassion and love and if there are a few people who make ugly remarks who attack trade union leaders i disown those people they are not part of our movement in the hours after the debate a monitor analysis of responses to pinned tweets from mr buttigieg and michael bloomberg found that the vast majority of negative responses came from pro sanders accounts mr sanders also intimated that perhaps russian trolls were to blame two days later the washington post reported that u s officials told mr sanders that russia was seeking to boost his campaign but even if russian actors are seeking to exploit divides within the democratic electorate in keeping with their aim of sowing discord in american democracy at least some of the most prominent antagonists are high profile sanders surrogates and verified twitter users who are very much american and to a certain extent that s not surprising given that mr sanders is drawing from the most progressive flank of the party or even outside the party s traditional bounds what you end up getting when you re sampling from the fringes is you end up with the people who are more interested in radical change says university of maryland sociologist dana r fisher whose recent book american resistance looks at how left leaning activism has grown since donald trump took office but she adds i don t think mr sanders is cultivating it at all sanders supporters say they too have been subjected to vicious attacks and deny the premise that their camp disproportionately displays offensive online behavior many describe the bernie bro narrative as deliberately seeded by their detractors first by the clinton campaign in the 2016 cycle and now others within the democratic party we recognize that our opponents in the establishment would like to perpetuate a false myth to discount the breadth and diversity of our supporters and we categorically reject it says sarah ford deputy communications director for the sanders campaign as the senator has said loudly and clearly there is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online and we must live our values of love and compassion sanders rallies are the political version of a rock concert only the star has shaggy white hair and glasses the senator did make an album once in 1987 but when singing where have all the flowers gone he sounded pretty much the same way he does when shouting his political demands hunched over gripping the mic with his left hand and waving his right somehow in an era when older white males are not cool he always brings down the house before mothers holding babies in slings across their chests and students waving his face on sticks before upscale women in fancy coats and scruffy men in ripped jeans he barks out his call for free health care free college and equal pay for women people whoop and pound the floor with their feet in rapid succession until the din of democracy spills out into the silent streets of small towns across america sanders supporters aren t angry just for being angry saysdavid robin co founder of new york city for bernie sanders 2020 and a digital strategist who does social media work for a number of progressive politicians and causes they ve been screwed over by the system mr robin who grew up in a lower middle class family and was assured by his high school counselor that there was no need to worry about taking out loans for college because he d pay them back once he started working graduated in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis with 40 000 in debt the job market was tight so he went back to school in hopes that getting an extra degree and giving the economy a couple years to bounce back would make it easier to find work he came away with a master s degree in sociology and 137 000 in debt driving him to join the occupy wall street movement in 2011 his first foray into political activism he says he s paid income adjusted installments on his loans consistently but isn t even keeping up with interest he now owes 175 000 i m just throwing money at this and it s just getting worse and worse he says citing abrookings institution reportthat estimated student loan default rates could reach 40 by 2023 it definitely radicalized me
