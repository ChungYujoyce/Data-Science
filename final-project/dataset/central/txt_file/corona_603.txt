6 min read new york reuters a newly revised coronavirus mortality model predicts nearly 135 000 americans will die from covid 19 by early august almost double previous projections as social distancing measures for quelling the pandemic are increasingly relaxed researchers said on monday the ominous new forecast from the university of washington s institute for health metrics and evaluation ihme reflect rising mobility in most u s states with an easing of business closures and stay at home orders expected in 31 states by may 11 the institute said we expect that the epidemic in many states will now extend through the summer the ihme director dr christopher murray said in a statement the projections reinforced warnings from public health experts that a rising clamor to lift restrictions on commerce and social activities in hopes of healing a ravaged economy could exact a staggering cost in terms of human lives the novel coronavirus is already known to have infected almost 1 2 million people in the united states including 68 762 who have died from covid 19 the respiratory illness it causes according to reuters own tally the institute s predictive coronavirus model periodically revised to account for changing circumstances and scientific insights surrounding the pandemic has become an influential data point often cited by the white house and public health authorities in gauging the crisis the ihme projections are presented as a statistical range of outcomes the latest forecast predicts the cumulative number of u s deaths from covid 19 will run from as few as 95 092 to as many as 242 890 by aug 4 with 134 475 lives lost representing the most likely middle ground by comparison the previous revision issued on april 29 put the middle case figure at 72 400 deaths within a range between 59 300 and 114 200 fatalities the upward spike reflects increasing human interactions as more states begin to ease social distancing requirements the chief public health tool available to curb the spread of a highly contagious virus for which there is no vaccine and no cure the relaxation of social distancing rules will more than offset any decline in transmissions that might come from warmer weather and stronger containment measures such as more wide scale testing and tracing the contacts of infected people so they too can be tested and isolated murray said the revised ihme projections coincided with disclosure of an internal trump administration forecast predicting a surge in covid 19 cases killing 3 000 americans a day by the end of may up from a current daily toll that a reuters tally places at around 2 000 that projection first reported by the new york times and confirmed by a reuters source also forecast about 200 000 new coronavirus cases each day by the end of the month up from the current rate of about 25 000 cases every 24 hours asked about the confidential forecast white house spokesman judd deere said this is not a white house document nor has it been presented to the coronavirus task force or gone through interagency vetting president donald trump has given varying predictions for the number of people in the united states who will succumb to covid 19 as recently as friday he said he hoped fewer than 100 000 americans would die and had talked last week of 60 000 to 70 000 deaths but on sunday night the president acknowledged the
