3 min read london reuters many people across asia wear face masks to try and protect themselves against covid 19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus in europe and the united states masks are less commonly worn but many people are asking should they wear them during the pandemic the world health organization s advice is that if you are healthy you only need to wear a mask if you are caring for someone with suspected or confirmed covid 19 infection you are coughing or sneezing yourself or suspect you might have covid 19 masks work by capturing droplets that are dispersed in coughs sneezes and breath these are the main transmission route of the new coronavirus there are two main types of mask surgical masks which are strips of fabric worn across the nose and mouth and closer fitting ones sometimes called respirators close fittingmasks such as n95ones can offer good but not total protection against infectious droplets while the next rank up the n99 rated masks can give better protection but some find them difficult to breathe through the n rating relates to the percentage of particles of at least 0 3 microns in diameter that the mask is designed to block n95 masks stop 95 and n99 masks stop 99 some masks have a valve in the front to help prevent moisture in exhaled breath condensing on the inside making the mask wet and more liable to virus penetration masks are only effective if you combine wearing them with frequent handwashing and ensure you don t touch your face anyone using a mask should make sure their hands are thoroughly cleaned with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer before putting it on the mask should cover your mouth and nose and there should be no gaps between your face and the mask as much as possible avoid touching the mask when the mask becomes damp replace it with a new one do not re use single use masks wearing a mask can also reduce the propensity for people to touch their faces which happens many more times a day than we all realise and is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene said stephen griffin an associate professor at leeds university s institute of medical research reporting by kate kelland editing by sara ledwith all quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes see here for a complete list of exchanges and delays 2020 reuters all rights reserved
