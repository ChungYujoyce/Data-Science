donald trump speaks during a primary night news conference tuesday in new york city lately it s been a political guessing game of which donald trump is going to show up in the past 24 hours alone the whiplash between what rival turned uneven surrogate ben carson called the two different donald trumps was on bold display from a serious foreign policy address in the morning he returned just hours later to his regular slapstick mockery of his rivals but as trump moves even closer to securing his party s white house nomination the unpredictable dichotomy is one that s sure to worry gop leaders anxious over which trump will show up when it matters most in november on wednesday evening it was pure unfiltered trump who took the stage in indiana hoosier legend former indiana university basketball coach bobby knight whose own temper is controversial in itself introduced him endorsing the real estate mogul as the most prepared man in history to step in as president of the united states there has never been a more honest politician than donald trump said knight who was fired from iu in 2000 after uncivil defiant and unacceptable behavior that included allegedly choking a player they say he isn t presidential i don t know what the hell that means knight thundered to loud applause trump s speech that followed was largely of the mold that many gop leaders worry is decidedly unpresidential the mocking of ohio gov kasich s eating habits was a staple he again berated ted cruz boasting that he has won evangelical voters this cycle while cruz holds up the bible puts it down and then he lies and even though he had some kind words about the fourth estate after his tuesday night landslide trump was back to calling the press corps following him the world s most dishonest people on wednesday evening in indiana the crowd as usual ate it up and joined along in the jeers just a week earlier there seemed to be a shift in trump land ever since the gop presidential front runner hired political strategist paul manafort to helm his maligned delegate operation the longtime republican hand has tried to telegraph the message that the controversial reality tv star would eventually evolve and tone down his temper and tenor on the campaign trail that promise seemed to have been fulfilled after trump s landslide win in new york last week in a more subdued victory speech at trump tower he was cordial to his bitter rival cruz even referring to him as senator instead of the lyin ted moniker he s bestowed on him but a week later that collegiality was gone after trump himself pushed back on the idea that any change was forthcoming campaigning in rhode island and pennsylvania ahead of his sweep of five states tuesday trump was back to insults and his usual freewheeling unpredictable style that s where he premiered his critique of his struggling rival kasich s eating style on the campaign trail he has the news conference all the time when he s eating i ve never seen a human being eat in such a disgusting fashion trump thundered after his big wins on tuesday which possibly put him on an irreversible path toward winning the gop nomination trump was back to a more unplugged style turning an eye toward the general election and likely rival hillary clinton he went hard after the democrat for playing the woman s card it was a new line of attacks that likely worry many party strategists as they seek to woo the important female voting bloc in november among whom trump has high unfavorables in general election polling if hillary clinton were a man i don t think she would get 5 percent of the vote he jabbed at the end of his remarks calling in to news shows the next morning he continued that line of criticism later wednesday afternoon however a more presidential sounding and looking donald trump showed up giving a major foreign policy speech in washington he was far more straight laced reading prepared remarks from a teleprompter here s how npr s domenico montanaro described it the speech was more a litany of what trump doesn t think has worked rather than a prescription of specifics he did not mention his wall with mexico and only alluded to his call for a temporary ban on muslims coming into the u s but his 38 minute remarks did offer a peek into trump s worldview a window into a trump doctrine that is reflexively protectionist against nation building underlined by the slogan america first and reliant on a backbone of military strength it also gave trump the opportunity to appear more serious and less bombastic if there are two trumps as ben carson has said this was presidential trump there were no lyin ted references or mocking of john kasich s eating habits just hours later though he was back to his usual routine for the most part there was one subtle instance of restraint during his indiana rally wednesday night he still took glee in mocking cruz s decision to tap carly fiorina as his vice presidential pick even though the texas senator is mathematically unable to get enough delegates on the first convention ballot but he refrained from any overt attacks on fiorina herself a departure from last fall when he derided her appearance overall trump perhaps summed up his philosophy best during his trump tower victory speech tuesday night if you have a football team and you re winning and then you get to the super bowl you don t change your quarterback right trump may take a knee more often on the campaign trail and give voters flashes of that more subdued version of himself but wednesday alone demonstrated he s going to continue to blitz in his own way like it or not for the foreseeable future npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
