school shutdowns at the end of december and early january when it was clear the coronavirus was ravaging parts of asia as miami s school buildings closed the district rushed to provide 90 000 more devices and around 11 000 wi fihotspots carvalho said still thousands of students will inevitably backslide not justin miami but everywhere it s carvalho s most pressing worry we are bracing ourselves for an unprecedented historic academic regression experienced by ourmost fragile population of students he said middle and upper income suburban districts have also struggled to help disadvantaged families get connected beyond that expectations vary for student engagementand how much new material to cover even within the same district children s experiences can dependon who their teacher is there s huge variance said elizabeth self an assistantprofessor of education at vanderbilt university sometimes districts are saying this is the basic expectation but then among teachersin that district there s a huge variance outside of that depending on their comfort with technology in suburban milwaukee two wealthy adjacent districts took demonstrably different approaches nicolet high school a single school district with about 1 000 students raced to hold teacher meetings after march 13and to create digital lesson plans by march 17 thedistrict expected students to log intothe learning management system canvas even as it worked to secure additionalhot spots for students and staff next door at thewhitefish bay school district which enrolls around 3 000 students the districtwon t officially launch its virtual learning plan until this week nearly a month after online learning started at nicolet students logged on for two practice days last week the delay prompted dozens of complaints by whitefish bay parents some key differences in nicolet the district is made up of only the high school soleaders only had to worry about older students most of whom already had district issued laptops whitefish bay students did not all have laptops and the district had to figure out how to also serve younger learners whitefish bay also chose not to have teachers gather in mid march to work out the learning plans in person meanwhile wisconsin held anelection wisconsin health officials tracking whether new coronavirus infections are tied to in person voting still districts should not be judged on whether they were fast or slow to develop a plan cautioned maya israel an associate professor of educational technology at the university of florida what s more important she said is whether the plan is developmentally appropriate sensitive to the technological bandwidth people have in the homes and responsive to thesocial and emotional needs of students and staff the quick rollout schools may have had to do more adjusting than the slow rolloutschools she said despite so much conversation about online education themost common model ofremote learninghas featuredinstructional packets prepared by teachers according tomathematica a nonpartisanresearch organization with thelong term school closures looming most districts are nowmoving toward offering morereal time support from teachers through videoconferencing phone calls or email steven malick and felicia hurwitz two mathematica researchers have been combing previous studies forwhat works when it comes to remote learning there is no research that really gets at our situation precisely malick said what s clear is that real time engagement with teachers is necessary they said andstudents doing online courses on their own does not typically produce positive results so far districts that have found a way to offer a full schedule of live classes are rare malick and hurwitz said a small number of districts are using the crisis to completely reimaginewhat s possible they said for example a school may decideto have a teacher who s really good at fractions teachall children the material instead of just his or her own class most schools serving low income students have faced daunting challenges in this new world of learning and districts alone cannot always solve the problem of internet connectivity many families live in places where service is spotty or nonexistent as a result many schools have no idea where some of their children are in los angeles where about 80 of students live in poverty 15 000 students are absent online and around 40 000 aren t checking in daily with teachers according to the los angeles times you re looking at fairly serious losses in learning time for kids said andy rotherham co founder of bellwether education partners a nonprofit focused on improving schools the immediate challenge we need to triage is access across california only 59 of public school parents surveyed in late march thought their district s learning plan was successful according to a statewide poll for those concerned theirchild would be unable to participate 41 said not having enough computers or internet deviceswas the top barrier according to poll results from the education trust west a group that advocates foreducational justice this isn t just an issue of devices said preston smith ceo of rocketship public schools a charter school organization that serveslow income students in threestates andwashington d c we re talking about trying to reachfamilies that were already on the fringes of society living intrauma and toxic stress smith said theseparents are losing their jobs or they re out there as low wage workers potentially being exposed rocketship provided2 500 chromebooks and also wi fito families butat least 20 to 40 of its students werestillnot connected depending on the school smith said and after the first week of remote learning online participation dropped off to around 50 to 70 he added still staff have tried to uphold rocketship s brand of joy and communityonline daily celebrations that open and close the school day are now simulated on facebook live teachers hostlunchtime video conferences staff are connecting families with rent assistance or meals if students indicate on daily surveys that they haven t felt safe at home staff follow up with them we have a moral obligation to serve these students smith said we re figuring out how we push ourselves on innovation and equity and access despite the call from devos for students to learn new material some education experts believe it s ok to reduce demands temporarily schools couldpay less attention now to curriculum and gradesand more attention to students social and emotional needs my fear is that everyone eventually hits a place where more and more people are sick and this period stretches longer and longer and the energy gets harder to sustain said self at vanderbilt what kids actually retain will inevitably suffer schools should focus onlaying plans for helping students catch up when buildings reopen saidthomas hatch an education professor at teachers college at columbia university we know that online learning doesn t alleviate or ameliorate gaps in opportunities it exacerbates them hatch said we have not designed our schools to enable
