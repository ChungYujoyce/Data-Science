president donald trump defended his attacks on four freshman democrats at a white house event on manufacturing monday arguing that it was not racist to tweet that they should go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came over the weekend trump tweeted the criticism of reps alexandria ocasio cortez ilhan omar rashida tlaib and ayanna pressley all of whom are u s citizens and all but one of whom were born in the united states democrats denounced the tweets while republicans mostly stayed silent then on monday trump responded during a white house event reiterating that it the lawmakers did not like u s policy then you can leave below is a transcript of his remarks thank you very much appreciate it okay do you have any questions on how well our manufacturing business is doing press the press well that s a lot of press look question who were you talking about in your tweet about going back to their home inaudible trump well i don t mention i didn t mention names and i didn t do that but i will tell you with our country and i think everybody in this audience these are great manufacturers great workers in our audience two they brought a lot of their workers here if you are not happy here then you can leave as far as i am concerned if you hate our country applause if you re not happy here you can leave that is what i say all of the time that s what i said in a tweet which i guess some people think is controversial a lot of people love it by the way a lot of people love it but if you are not happy in the u s if you are complaining all of the time very simply you can leave you can leave right now come back if you want don t come back that s okay too but if you are not happy you can leave applause question inaudible is that true trump wow that s just a very racist statement somebody that would say that so speaker pelosi said make america white again let me tell you that s a very racist that s a very racist statement i m surprised she would say that john go ahead question inaudible trump well they are very unhappy i am watching them all they do is complain so all i m saying is if they want to leave they can leave john they can leave i mean i look at the one i look at omar i don t know i never met her i hear the way she talks about al qaeda al qaeda has killed many of americans she said you can hold your chest out you can when i think of america when i think of al qaeda i can hold my chest out when she talked about the world trade center being knocked down some people you remember the famous some people these are people that in my opinion hate our country now you can say what you want but get a list of all of the statements they have made and all i m saying that if they are not happy here they can leave they can leave and you know what i m sure that there will be many people that won t miss them but they have to love they have to love our country they are congresspeople and i never used in the names but these are people my quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet quiet these are people that if they don t like it here they can leave and i would be i don t know who s going to miss them but i guess some people will one of them is polling one of them is polling and one of them is polling at 8 percent one of them is polling at 8 percent so when i hear people speaking about how wonderful al qaida is when i hear people talking about some people some people with the world trade center some people no not some people much more than some people when i hear the statements that they have made and in one case you have somebody that comes from somalia which is a failed government a failed state who love somalia who ultimately came here and i now was a congresswoman who is never happy says horrible things about israel hates israel hates jews hates jews it s very simple and if the democrats want to wrap their bows around this group of four people one of them kept amazon out of new york tens of thousands of jobs would have been a great thing and she kept amazon from going would have been a good deal i mean could he have made it better maybe but tens of thousands of jobs and new york has not been the same since that happened it s really hurt new york and new york city amazon was getting together was going to relocate a major section of their business to new york she kept them out it was a terrible thing she did a terrible thing she did so here s a story here s a story i see them complaining they re complaining constantly i watched lindsey graham today on fox and friends talking about the same subject and frankly even stronger than what i m saying he s saying they re communists i m saying i m saying that they re socialists definitely as to whether or not they re communists i would think they might be but this isn t what our country is about nevertheless they re free to leave if they want and if they want to leave that s fine and if they want to stay that s fine but the people have to know and politicians can t be afraid to take them on a politician that hears somebody where we re at war with al qaida and sees somebody talking about how great al qaida is pick out her statement that was omar how great al qaida is when you hear that and we re losing great soldiers to al qaida when you see the world trade center gets knocked down and you see the statements about the world trade center all the death and destruction i ll tell you what i m not happy with them and it s very easy to say oh gee well it s ok if weak politicians want to say and the democrats in this case if they want to gear their wagons around these four people i think they are going to have a very tough election because i don t think the people of the united states will stand for it applause john go ahead go ahead john go ahead question does it concern you that that tweet was seen as racist lindsey graham said encouraged you to aim higher and does it trouble trump no he didn t say aim higher he just said don t go see i disagree with lindsey these are congressman what am i supposed to do just wait for senators no these are four so i disagree with lindsey about that that was the only thing he said aim higher shoot higher what am i supposed to do wait till we get somebody else in a higher position higher office these are people that hate our country hey john hate our country they hate it i think with a passion now it s possible i m wrong the voter will decide but when i hear the way they talk about our country when i hear the anti semitic language they use when i hear the hatred they have for israel and the love they have for enemies like al qaida then you know what i will tell you that i do i do not believe that this is good for the democrat party certainly it s not the party that i ve known over the years question mr president where should question mr president question does it concern you that many people saw that tweet as racist and that white nationalist groups are finding common cause with you on that post trump it doesn t concern me because many people agree with me and all i m saying they want to leave they can leave now it doesn t say leave forever it says leave but what it says and what that john what that says is if they re not happy with the united states if they re doing nothing but criticizing us all the time you see these people walking down criticizing the united states we just hit the highest stock market in history all of these incredible manufacturers that are in these are great businesspeople they employ many people and we have workers with us too they re having the best year they ve ever had can i say that is that a correct statement applause and they re hiring more people than they ever have and more people are making a good living than they ve ever had we just hit 27000 plus on the dow it s the highest the stock market has ever been and you have to go by the election because the market started going up the day after i won you know they like to add all of that tremendous gain they like to try to give it to obama the fact is if i would have lost the stock market would crash out of these people that i watch in those debates ever got their hands on the united states government 401ks the values of your company everything else we talk about we are so proud of it s down the tubes people will lose their money they ll lose their wealth you ll have a crash like you ve never seen before and i m really good at this stuff i know what i m talking about thank you all very much thank you thank you applause the ice raids the ice raids the ice raids were very successful people came into our country illegally illegally many were felons many were convicted of crimes many many were taken out on sunday you just didn t know about it in fact i went to i spoke to the head of ice i spoke to a couple of people we had many people it was a very successful day but you didn t see a lot of it but it was done a lot you ll speak to them and i m not even sure they should be telling you but it was a lot and it wouldn t have to be sunday we ve been doing this look we have been removing ms 13 they re monsters we ve been removing ms 13 by the thousands during my administration and i tell my people much easier to go the other route but i say focus on the criminals focus on the people that are killing people that are causing crime focus on them much easier just to go to general population that s easy but i don t do it the easy way we are getting tremendous number of criminals and yesterday it was just reported to me before i walk cause
