 by lori robertson jessica mcdonald and robert farley posted on march 3 2020 democrats have criticized president donald trump for his administration s response to the new coronavirus making claims about cuts to public health programs and the silencing of government experts but they haven t always gotten their facts right it s true that the president s proposed budgets have included funding cuts to the centers for disease control and prevention but congress hasn t enacted those cuts sometimes democrats accurately have said trump tried to cut back on the cdc as sen amy klobuchar said in the feb 25 debate in south carolina former vice president joe biden used harsher language in saying in a cnn town hall on feb 26 that trump tried to defund the cdc the president proposed reducing the cdc budget some years by double digit percentages not completely defunding it but democrats including biden also have dropped the qualifier tried from their claims saying uncategorically that trump had reduced the cdc funding on abc s this week on march 1 biden said they ve cut the funding for the cdc and he has defunded he had defunded centers for disease control cdc so we don t have the organization we need former new york city mayor mike bloomberg said in the feb 25 debate in a statement issued the same day bloomberg said trump has slashed funding of the cdc and other essential health agencies as we ve written before a president s budget proposal is more a statement of priorities than anything congress would vote to enact in fact republican sen mike enzi chairman of the senate budget committee said that he wouldn t hold a hearing on trump s latest fiscal 2021 budget adding congress doesn t pay any attention to the president s budget exercise dara lieberman director of government relations for the nonprofit nonpartisan trust for america s health told us the administration has proposed but congress has for the large part rejected cuts to cdc s budget democrats are free to criticize the president s proposals and they have house speaker nancy pelosi said in a feb 27 news conference the trump budget called for slashing almost 700 million from the center for disease control and this was the budget which came out after we knew about the coronavirus threat the fiscal 2021 budget proposal did call for a 693 3 million reduction to the cdc s funding compared with what was enacted for fiscal 2020 according to this cdc budget document that would be a 9 reduction in the cdc s budget the president s budget proposal was released on feb 10 after the covid 19 outbreak began and the first u s case was confirmed on jan 20 but the president has proposed cuts to the cdc in past budgets that congress did not enact it s misleading at best to claim trump slashed funding when his proposals haven t taken effect for instance trump s fiscal 2020 budget proposal would have reduced cdc funding by 750 6 million compared with what was enacted for fiscal 2019 see the program level line in the linked document but congress passed and trump signed a budget that increased cdc funding by 420 million for fiscal 2019 trump put forth a 1 36 billion cut to cdc s funding in his budget proposal but what ended up being enacted was a 261 6 million increase over what was passed the year before the president proposed a 19 4 reduction but congress enacted a 3 7 increase for fiscal 2018 trump s first full budget proposal as president he proposed a 17 reduction in funding for the cdc but what congress enacted amounted to a 2 3 drop in funding for the annualized 2018 continuing resolution after congress enacts a budget and passes appropriation bills the cdc creates an operating plan for the funding below is a chart of cdc operating plans since fiscal 2016 which ended sept 30 2016 nearly four months before trump took office the fiscal 2017 budget would have been enacted under former president barack obama however congress passed continuing resolution appropriation bills for that fiscal year after trump took office the cdc s operating budgets not adjusted for inflation show the cdc funding has gone up a bit under trump the trust for america s health 2019 report on funding of the public health system includes a chart on cdc funding adjusted for inflation and that shows a small overall decrease of 460 million from fiscal 2016 to 2019 or 170 million from fiscal 2017 to 2019 see figure 2 however that chart notes that a comparison with 2019 funding requires accounting for a transfer of cdc funds to the assistant secretary for preparedness and response after making that adjustment and another for one time laboratory funding that boosted the 2018 budget the report says the cdc had flat funding in inflation adjusted dollars from 2018 to 2019 the 2020 cdc operating plan shows an increase from 2019 of 7 adjusted for inflation according to the trust for america s health overall the group s report says there has been a chronic underfunding of the public health system in the u s but that began before trump took office and has continued one area of concern is funding for the prevention and public health fund which was created by the affordable care act the aca which said the fund would back expanded and sustained national investment in prevention and public health programs set the annual appropriation for the fund at 500 million for fiscal 2010 increasing to 2 billion for 2015 and thereafter however congress and the secretary of health and human services has used some of this appropriation for other programs and expenses the pphf has been repeatedly cut and used to pay for other legislation the trust for america s health report says for instance in 2013 the hhs secretary used nearly half of the pphf funding for implemention of the aca s insurance marketplace according to a 2017 congressional research service report under trump congress passed and he signed the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which repeals 1 35 billion in pphf appropriated funding over 10 years the actual funding for the pphf has amounted to about half of the 2 billion annually called for in the aca since 2015 the trust for america s health report shows see figure 3 but since that has been the case for several years the overall cdc funding doesn t show a cut from year to year as we said trump has proposed cuts every year to the cdc but they haven t been enacted by congress in his fiscal 2021 budget he also proposed reduced funding for global health programs and funding to the world health organization and the pan american health organization the president defended the proposed cuts when asked about them in a feb 26 press conference on the coronavirus we can get money and we can increase staff trump said we know all the good people it s a question i asked the doctors before some of the people we cut they haven t been used for many many years and if if we have a need we can get them very quickly and rather than spending the money and i m a business person i don t like having thousands of people around when you don t need them when we need them we can get them back very quickly some experts told the washington post that it s not that easy to staff up quickly during a crisis employment at the cdc has declined by 591 positions or 5 4 from december 2016 through march 2019 the most recent data available from the office of personnel management as for increased funding to respond to the coronavirus the administration has asked congress for 2 5 billion but democrats said that was too little trump said in his press conference if they want to give more we ll do more the biden campaign also pointed to news reports in 2018 that the administration wouldn t renew expiring funding for the global health security agenda a program in which the cdc works with other countries to strengthen public health systems and reduce the risk of infectious disease outbreaks most of that program s funding was a one time five year appropriation that was expected to run out at the end of september 2019 but we haven t been able to confirm to what extent the cdc ended up cutting back on the program we ll update this story when we have more information biden also claimed in the cnn town hall that trump tried to defund the nih it s true that trump s fiscal 2018 budget proposal called for a reduction in funding for the national institutes of health but congress instead increased the nih budget as several news organizations reported at the time similarly trump s proposal for fiscal 2020 included reduced funding for nih but what congress enacted was an increase from the previous year numerous democrats denounced the trump administration s coronavirus response by pointing to the disbanding of a team within the white house dedicated to coordinating a response to a pandemic bloomberg first drew attention to the move in the democraticdebatein south carolina bloomberg feb 25 and one of the great problems today you read about the virus what s really happening here is the president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago so there s nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing the next day in a cnn town hall he mentioned it again saying number one he fired the pandemic team two years ago biden also noted it in a cnn town halleventthat aired two hours after bloomberg s and in anappearance on cnn s state of the union on march 1 he said w e set up an entire mechanism as to how to deal with future outbreaks of pandemic diseases they trump administration officials eliminated that office when they came in play the trump administration did indeed eliminate a key position that would have been involved in pandemic response thewashington postreported that former national security adviser john boltondissolvedthe nsc s office of global health security and biodefense in may 2018 in a reorganization effort that s when rear adm r timothy ziemer who was senior director of the office left his post he was not replaced as areportby the bipartisan think tankcenter for strategic international studiesexplains the global health security and biodefense directorate pooled nsc staff focused on domestic and international biodefense and health security issues and was designed to plan for and oversee rapid efficient government wide responses to global health security threats president obama had instituted the unit in 2016 following a yearslong ebola outbreakin west africa trump appointed ziemer who had beencoordinatorof thepresident s malaria initiativeunder both president george w bush and obama to head the office inapril 2017 ziemer departed abruptly a little over a year later just as a newebolaoutbreak was starting in congo he now servesas senior deputy assistant administrator for the bureau for democracy conflict and humanitarian assistance at usaid tom bossert a former white house homeland security adviser who helpeddevelopthe administration s biodefense strategy and was thedesignated leadfor coordinating the american response to a biological crisis was alsoreportedlypushed out when bolton took over bossert resigned inapril 2018 a day after bolton started as national security adviser three anonymous sources toldthewashington postthat bolton requested his resignation contrary to some recentnewsreports bossert wasreplacedwith aseriesof people but the job of coordinating a pandemic response does not appear to have followed when trumpannouncedhis coronavirustaskforceon jan 29 he did not name current homeland security adviser julia nesheiwat in any capacity just because ziemer s position was discontinued does not mean everyone who was part of the team was fired or that all of the functions of the directorate ceased according to reporting by theatlanticand thewashington post some team members were shifted to other groups and others took over some of ziemer s duties an nsc spokesman at the time said that the administration remains committed to global health global health security and biodefense and will continue to address these issues with the same resolve under the new structure but the lack of someone in the white house to coordinate the response to a widespread disease outbreak in the u s is somethingnumerousexpertsandgroupsat the time had cautioned against in a november 2019report the center for strategic international studies recommended restoring the global health security position on the nsc as one of seven key changes to better protect the american public from global health threats it remains unclear who would be in charge at the white house in the case of a grave pandemic threat or cross border biological crisis the report reads noting that such leadership is critical in navigating challenging political issues like quarantines and travel bans and in communicating to and reassuring the american public the authorities currently in place at hhs are insufficient to address these critical complex and often urgent interagency demands the report continues in addition to coordinating the interagency process a global health security and biodefense directorate at the nsc can reform fragmented programs and ensure higher efficiencies strengthened accountability and better spending of scarce resources we reached out to the white house press office but we haven t received any information on the nsc staffing biden went too far when he claimed that trump is muzzling government scientists and hasn t allowed his scientists to speak about the coronavirus it s true that government scientists were told to clear their public appearances through a newly created coronavirus task force but scientists including dr anthony s fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases have since made numerous public appearances to talk about the epidemic biden s comments stem from anew york timesstoryon feb 27 that said the white house moved to tighten control of coronavirus messaging by government health officials and scientists directing them to coordinate all statements and public appearances with the office of vice president mike pence according to several officials familiar with the new approach the day before trump hadtappedpence to head up the administration s coronavirus response according to thetimesstory dr fauci has told associates that the white house had instructed him not to say anything else without clearance that led to charges from some democrats that trump was attempting to politicize the response to the epidemic after government scientists had contradicted him on several points earlier in the week for example aswe wrote trump s claim in a feb 26 press conference that the number of covid 19 cases in the u s is going very substantially down not up was contradicted by the cdc which said to expect more cases and while trump said the u s will essentially have a flu shot for this in a fairly quick manner fauci said a vaccine at best won t be ready for a year to a year and a half a day after thenew york timesstory was published bidenallegedduring a feb 28 cnn interview that the experts are not allowed to speak the president has silenced them biden specifically cited fauci who biden noted has worked for multiple administrations you need to let the experts speak biden saidon cnn i was told i heard on the news this morning dr fauci is not allowed to speak publicly what is this all about no one takes the president s word for these things at a minimum he exaggerates everything and the idea that he s gonna stand there and say everything s fine don t worry who s gonna believe that let the experts speak like we did in our administration according to thewashington post fauci told lawmakers during a house briefing that day feb 28 that he was not being gagged or muzzled though he did cancel appearances on some sunday talk shows after pence was tapped to lead the coronavirus response according to the post fauci told house members that the change was necessary because such appearances must always be cleared and the clearance process restarted after pence was named wednesday to head the response look he said to everybody i am not being muzzled i want to clear that up democratic rep mark takano told the postabout the exchange but that when the vice president took over he was already booked they said look stop we want to just reevaluate everything so don t go on those programs yet biden s campaign also pointed to comments by democratic rep john garamendiinan appearance on msnbc garamendi who was also in that briefing said insofar as i can repeat what fauci said he said i was not muzzled however i was to go on the sunday talk shows five of them the vice president s office then took over the control of this situation and told me to stand down not to do those shows now you can draw your own conclusions whether he was muzzled or not but clearly he was scheduled to do sunday talk shows and he was told not to proceed with that later that day fauci appeared onmsnbc s hardball with chris matthews and said the situation was completely misconstrued fauci also was interviewed bypoliticothat same day feb 28 and he talked about striking a balance between telling the truth and not butting heads with the president you should never destroy your own credibility and you don t want to go to war with a president fauci said but you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth the following day feb 29 fauci again addressed the controversy in a white housepress conferencewhen a reporter asked about reports that he was being muzzled so let me clarify fauci said i have never been muzzled ever and i ve been doing this since the administration of ronald reagan i m not being muzzled by this administration what happened which was misinterpreted is that we were set up to go on some shows and when the vice president took over we said let s regroup and figure out how we re going to be communicating so i had to just stand down on a couple of shows and resubmit for clearance and when i resubmitted for clearance i got cleared so i have not been muzzled at all that was a real misrepresentation of what happened in ateleconferenceafter trump s press conference another government scientist nancy messonnier director of cdc s national center for immunization and respiratory diseases provided further updates on the virus nonetheless biden continued to press the line of attack that trump should let the scientists speak and that trump was muzzling the scientist biden abc s this week march 1 and look right now you have this president hasn t allowed his scientists to speak number one he has the vice president speaking not the scientists who know what they re talking about like fauci they should let the scientists speak i see no preparedness other than a political talking points putting someone in charge who is not a scientist and muzzling the scientist fauci did not appear on any of the sunday political talk shows instead pence and health and human services secretary alex azar went on the shows to talk about the epidemic and the administration s response but fauci and others have continued to speak publicly to the press for example fauci spoke at length about the coronavirus epidemic oncnn s new day on march 2 readers can make what they will of the white house s decision to centralize its public coronavirus response which requires government scientists to clear their public appearances through the task force but government scientists have not been silenced or muzzled with d angelo gore q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
