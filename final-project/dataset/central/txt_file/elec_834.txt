value their role in the electoral process when stakes are high loading november 4 2016 every election day for as long as he can remember angel del carpio would head to the polls and cast his vote he did it when he lived in california and new york now a resident of nevada a closely watched swing state mr del carpio decided to make an early appearance this year the wednesday before the election the retired hairdresser drove to the boulevard mall about three miles east of the strip to vote at a polling station set up inside he walked away proud having done his civic duty i did my part says del carpio holding up his i voted sticker it s very important because our vote is what s going to save this country and it s very convenient he says about voting early del carpio s ballot is one of more than34 millionalready cast ahead of the election this year via in person mail in or absentee ballots the figureis on its way to topping 50 million and setting a record for votes cast before election day according to the pew research center early voter turnout remainsa questionable indicatorof victory but the surge in early voting may suggest that americans continue to value their role in the electoral process particularly when they perceive that the stakes are high political analysts say and voters are eager to take advantage of ways that make it easier for them to play their part they add people want to choose the most convenient thing especially if they re anticipating long lines on election day says david damore professor of political science at the university of nevada las vegas in this election in particular he says democrats and republicans alike tend to see a win for the other side as an existential threat the importance of the outcome looms over most people dr damore says that may not fire enthusiasm but it becomes important to people to participate as voting options expand the percentage of voters nationwide casting their ballots early have soared from about 11 percent in 1996 to 33 percent in 2012 pew reports data for 2016 suggests the trend will hold in states such as nevada and colorado nearly half the total electorate had already cast their votes five days before the election says paul gronke founder and director of theearly voting information centerat reed college in portland ore in tennessee and arizona nearly two thirds have turned in their ballots that sthe biggest story the earliness professor gronke says his theory as to why is somewhat less optimistic people are very unhappy with this campaign they want to get it over with the notion of casting ballots ahead of election day has been around since the civil war when republicans in an effort to secure the soldier vote for abraham lincoln pushed for legislation to allow servicemen to cast their vote while away from their home states early voting for convenience however took shape only in the 1970s first when congress passed a law allowing overseas voters without legal homes in the us to mail in their ballots and then when california introduced a no excuses law that let any registered voter cast an absentee ballot by the 1980s oregon had adopted the country s first vote by mail election system sending registered voters ballots that they could either mail in or drop off in person today 37 states and the district of columbia allow some form of early voting the shift makes sense says dan schnur director of the jesse m unruh institute of politics at the university of southern california the democratic ideal is to make it as easy as possible for people to participate he says in an earlier era that meant face to face communication at an appointed time and place that s no longer the case today professor schnur notes you don t have to go to your bank to withdraw money you don t have to harvest your food before dinner he says even without crossing the divide into online voting which is an idea of debatable value there s no reason in the world that a voter should be required to cast their ballot at a single precinct location for some las vegas voters the expansion of early voting and laws that require employers to give workers time to vote provides a chance to reaffirm their role in the democratic process we re fortunate to get to do it on the clock says belinda a hotel employee who declined to give her last name she and two of her coworkers had arrived at a polling station about a mile off the strip on a charter bus that takes hotel workers to and from the site it makes a big difference she says our voices are being heard some say the main draw is the luxury of getting in their ballots minus the hassle of election day crowds particularly in a race as volatile as this one with everybody split up the way they are the country s going to be crazy come nov 8 says timothy salmon a father and video producer as he left a satellite polling station in the parking lot of a local shopping center except for work he says i don t want to go out that day for others the chance to vote early simply means an easy way to fulfill a sense of obligation after all voters had only to go online to find the site closest to their home or workplace it was very fast i thought it was going to be more difficult says raul sanchez who plays in a mariachi band though in his 50s mr sanchez is a first time voter spurred to the polls by a desire to see someone who isn t donald trump win the white house sanchez says the experience left him encouraged and inspired him to take part in future elections that nevada is a swing state has also led residents here to feel more keenly the weight of each individual vote get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox we have to make the election count says del carpio the retired hairdresser this is a state
