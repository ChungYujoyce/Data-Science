utah sen mitt romney became the sole republican to break from his party wednesday afternoon after announcing his plan to convict trump on one article of impeachment in a speech that immediately took hold on social media romney said he will vote to convict the president on the first article of impeachment abuse of power but vote to acquit him on the second article obstruction of congress for the past few weeks romney had indicated his hesitation over the vote but it was unclear which way he would ultimately lean i knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president the leader of my own party would be the most difficult decision i have ever faced romney said during his speech on the senate floor i was not wrong read his full speech below the constitution is at the foundation of our republic s success and we each strive not to lose sight of our promise to defend it the constitution established the vehicle of impeachment that has occupied both houses of congress for these many days we have labored to faithfully execute our responsibilities to it we have arrived at different judgments but i hope we respect each other s good faith the allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious as a senator juror i swore an oath before god to exercise impartial justice i am a profoundly religious person i take an oath before god as enormously consequential i knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president the leader of my own party would be the most difficult decision i have ever faced i was not wrong the house managers presented evidence supporting their case the white house counsel disputed that case in addition the president s team presented three defenses first that there can be no impeachment without a statutory crime second that the bidens conduct justified the president s actions and third that the judgement of the president s actions should be left to the voters let me first address each of those defenses the historic meaning of the words high crimes and misdemeanors the writings of the founders and my own reasoned judgement convince me that a president can indeed commit acts against the public trust that are so egregious that while they are not statutory crimes they would demand removal from office to maintain that the lack of a codified and comprehensive list of all the outrageous acts that a president might conceivably commit renders congress powerless to remove a president defies reason the president s counsel noted that vice president biden appeared to have a conflict of interest when he undertook an effort to remove the ukrainian prosecutor general if he knew of the exorbitant compensation his son was receiving from a company actually under investigation the vice president should have recused himself while ignoring a conflict of interest is not a crime it is surely very wrong with regards to hunter biden taking excessive advantage of his father s name is unsavory but also not a crime given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the president s counsel that a crime had been committed the president s insistence that they be investigated by the ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit there is no question in my mind that were their names not biden the president would never have done what he did the defense argues that the senate should leave the impeachment decision to the voters while that logic is appealing to our democratic instincts it is inconsistent with the constitution s requirement that the senate not the voters try the president hamilton explained that the founders decision to invest senators with this obligation rather than leave it to voters was intended to minimize to the extent possible the partisan sentiments of the public this verdict is ours to render the people will judge us for how well and faithfully we fulfilled our duty the grave question the constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme and egregious that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor yes he did the president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival the president withheld vital military funds from that government to press it to do so the president delayed funds for an american ally at war with russian invaders the president s purpose was personal and political accordingly the president is guilty of an appalling abuse of the public trust what he did was not perfect no it was a flagrant assault on our electoral rights our national security interests and our fundamental values corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one s oath of office that i can imagine in the last several weeks i have received numerous calls and texts many demand that in their words i stand with the team i can assure you that that thought has been very much on my mind i support a great deal of what the president has done i have voted with him 80 of the time but my promise before god to apply impartial justice required that i put my personal feelings and biases aside were i to ignore the evidence that has been presented and disregard what i believe my oath and the constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end it would i fear expose my character to history s rebuke and the censure of my own conscience i am aware that there are people in my party and in my state who will strenuously disapprove of my decision and in some quarters i will be vehemently denounced i am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters does anyone seriously believe i would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before god demanded it of me i sought to hear testimony from john bolton not only because i believed he could add context to the charges but also because i hoped that what he said might raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment like each member of this deliberative body i love our country i believe that our constitution was inspired by providence i am convinced that freedom itself is dependent on the strength and vitality of our national character as it is with each senator my vote is an act of conviction we have come to different conclusions fellow senators but i trust we have all followed the dictates of our conscience i acknowledge that my verdict will not remove the president from office the results of this senate court will in fact be appealed to a higher court the judgement of the american people voters will make the final decision just as the president s lawyers have implored my vote will likely be in the minority in the senate but irrespective of these things with my vote i will tell my children and their children that i did my duty to the best of my ability believing that my country expected it of me i will only be one name among many no more or less to future generations of americans who look at the record of this trial they will note merely that i was among the senators who determined that what the president did was wrong grievously wrong we re all footnotes at best in the annals of history but in the most powerful nation on earth the nation conceived in liberty and justice that is distinction enough for any citizen write to madeleine carlisle at madeleine carlisle time com
