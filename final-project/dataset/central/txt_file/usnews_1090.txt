three weeks into the partial government shutdown travelers at some of america s busiest airports are feeling the squeeze with longer security lines and even closed terminals as some transportation security agency tsa screeners begin to call in sick rather than show up to work without pay hartsfield jackson atlanta international airport advised fliers to arrive three hours early for their flights on monday as average wait times topped one hour at miami international airport a security checkpoint was closed for hours on saturday and sunday other big airports that haven t experienced tsa sickouts are preparing for the problem to get worse a spokesperson from chicago s o hare airport said that officials have contingency plans prepared that they hope will mitigate the problem and keep security lines moving more than twice as many tsa agents called out sick on monday compared to last year according to the tsa the tsa has assured workers that they will be paid after government funding is restored but that won t come until president donald trump and congressional democrats break their impasse over trump s 5 7 billion demand for a border wall tsa administrator david pekoske has also promised to provide every officer with a 500 award in recognition of their hard work during yet another busy holiday travel season maintaining the highest of security standards during an extraordinary period according to the tsa jim gregory a tsa spokesperson told time last week that while most security officers are professional and dedicated to the tsa s mission he did not want to speculate about whether more tsa employees will call out during the shutdown but tsa employees are not some of the higher paid federally workers out there gregory said tsa agents earn about 30 000 per year on average gregory said i don t have a good crystal ball all i can say is it does cause additional stress gregory said the longer it goes on the harder it is on these employees some of the other major impacts of the shutdown may not be as visible to passengers about 3 300 faa aviation safety workers have been sidelined and air traffic controllers have sued the federal government for requiring them to work without pay on jan 3 a passenger was able to fly from atlanta to tokyo with a gun that tsa screeners missed the agency said the security lapse was because standard procedures were not followed not because of the shutdown for now airports are urging travelers to arrive for check in earlier than usual and to monitor line wait times on airports websites when they can here s what you

atlanta international airport wait times stretched for over an hour at the airport s main checkpoint on monday morning according to elise durham the airport s director of policy and communications nearly 104 million passengers passed through atlanta in 2017 durham acknowledged that monday s long wait times were caused by the shutdown mondays are typically very busy days at hartsfield jackson but this morning we did feed the impact of the federal shutdown more than we have thus far durham said fortunately until today we really hadn t had any operational impact durham said that the airport had brought in more customer engagement agents to guide passengers the airport also offered live music to soothe frustrated passengers at checkpoints durham urged passengers to check wait times at atl

communications the airport has closed terminal b and shifted passengers to terminal c however trahan says that increased wait times at the airport have been pretty minor over the past few days wait times have gone up to about 20 minutes at peak travel times trahan says according to trahan this is not significantly longer than a regular travel day on a typical day passengers can usually get through security in about 10 or 15 minutes trahan said trahan said he was not sure when the airport will reopen the closed terminal not all travel issues can be blamed on the government shutdown

another unforeseen event the weather the faa ordered the airport to a ground stop on sunday night in response to a snow storm the airport ultimately received about 10 6 inches of snow says
