now that donald trump is the presumptive republican nominee for president every officeholder and opinion maker associated with the american right is expected to announce whether they support him everyone is anxious to put their cards on the table here are mine i am both nevertrump and neverhillary because i know how i will feel on election day when i was younger i made a habit of voting for hopeless third party candidacies hoping to send a message of disgust with the two parties as they were now i think that message is better sent by simply not voting at all and i will send it again this november if clinton wins the presidency i ll feel a little bit relieved and sad and if trump wins the presidency i might crack a smile but i ll wake up every morning afterward and immediately make sure my family s passports are in order a hillary clinton presidency certainly means the end of a divided era on the supreme court and the consolidation of liberal gains in the judiciary in turn that means the reversal of incremental pro life gains on the state level it will mean more and more pitched battles over religious liberty that will gradually hamper the ability of my co religionists to run their colleges schools and other businesses according to their consciences since clinton was shaped by the fear that democrats lose elections for not being tough enough on foreign policy she is likely to blunder with american air power the model for these disasters is her libyan intervention or the intervention in kosovo both were launched in the name of human rights and empowered islamist extremists in the end however all the imaginable demerits of a clinton presidency are known to me i can anticipate them they are just intensifications of the sort of political frustrations i already have trump s victory would be something else altogether in part because a trump victory would by definition involve the defeat of nearly every certainty in america s political culture that i might enjoy the status quo deserves a major upset but i would be very nervous theoretically i should be cheered that someone running against washington s stupid wars and against an out of control immigration system won but trump is mostly lying about his foreign policy judgment when wars are on the horizon he generally supports them and his nationalist views on immigration and trade are practically labeled for the rubes he openly mocks his own supporters when he says that he could shoot someone and not lose a vote he admits if it gets a little boring i just say we will build the wall when his campaign says that trump doesn t want to waste time on policy and thinks it would make him less effective on the stump he is intermittently breaking the fourth wall and letting everyone know just how stupid he thinks his supporters are the truth is that if trump cared about american workers he would invest in them he wouldn t get on a debate stage and claim that america is too hot for american workers trump s great political advantages are his shamelessness his ignorance his touchy ego and his complete freedom from the norms of our political culture these traits made him dangerous to other republicans when trump was just one candidate among many and they would make him dangerous to his countrymen if he were invested with the awesome powers of the presidency without the constraints of party orthodoxy without the restraint of personal shame we would be electing a man with a hyper sensitive personality and little working knowledge of government to lead the most important nation on earth i m still the sort of conservative who thinks it wrong to knowingly elect people of low and base character to high offices but the most important reason i ll be nervous if trump wins is this his victory will invite foreign rivals to challenge the united states and i simply don t want the man who goes to defcon 1 on tv rivals like rosie o donnell to be the person who actually gets to command our armed forces to go to defcon 1 i write on the internet i m sorry why america should envy brexit the establishment lacks imagination the nationalists lack skill who will prevail the new social conservatism trump insults marine veteran rep conor lamb calls him an american fraud how pandemics change society
