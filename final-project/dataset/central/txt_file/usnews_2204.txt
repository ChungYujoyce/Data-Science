president al gore told former time editor in chief nancy gibbs that it s possible the house of representatives could impeach president donald trump and the senate could vote to convict and remove him

assumed that the republican controlled senate would never convict and remove i don t know the evidence still matters gore also urged americans to vote out politicians in both parties who oppose

living with chronic diseases just last month oz revealed that his mother was diagnosed with alzheimer s i recognize that if we start treating people as soon as they have alzheimer s we ve still missed the boat he said i can slow down her progression but she s not going to be the sharp woman who was able to negotiate any political scenario like she was when i was younger leading scientists also spoke about the progress researchers have made to treat diseases once thought to be incurable maria carrillo chief science officer of the alzheimer s association said she feels encouraged by scientific develops in other fields of medicine that could become models for fighting disease all we need is to crack that window open she said and we can open the floodgates u s department of health and human services hhs secretary alex azar called medicare for all a utopian and simplistic approach to health care adding it would end up being medicare for none the reason we re seeing the attractiveness of simplistic notions like medicare for all is that the affordable care act aca made a lot of promises it didn t deliver on them azar said when asked by editor in chief edward felsenthal whether health care is a human right which massachusetts sen elizabeth warren has argued azar said hhs wants everyone to have access to affordable health care that meets your needs and that s the highest quality that can possible be delivered what bows you wrap around that i don t know he added that the u s needs better individual market solutions and that many people like the health care coverage they have now azar also spoke about the trump administration s plan for health care saying the system should be personalized affordable and patient centric he said the administration also wants to focus on public health crises including youth vaping opioid addiction maternal mortality and geographic disparities in health leana wen the former head of planned parenthood and professor at george washington university addressed her controversial tweet on tuesday that abortion should be safe legal and rare many abortion rights activists disagree with the the clinton era phrase arguing the term rare stigmatizes the procedure wen told arana huffington that she s deeply disturbed by how health care has become so politicized so much so that we cannot even discuss our points of agreement and the nuanced views that many people can have without being attacked from all sides she said wen continued a lot of us believe that abortion is a complex moral issue and we may not want to have an abortion ourselves but would never get in the way of somebody else making this deeply personal medical decision for themselves or maybe we re even uncomfortable about abortion but would not want women to die because they don t have access to safe legal abortion either former president bill clinton said that the u s is at a crossroads on health care reform and we should pick the low hanging fruit first when speaking with dr david agus director of usc s lawrence j ellison institute for transformative medicine the problem is the system is still entirely too complex clinton said the premiums are going up way more than wages are going up and the co pays and deductibles and the drug prices are going up even more than the premiums so we re kind of at a crossroads now i think we need to pass a public option and go back to encouraging all payer systems in states so that you can have some control over the costs and keep it as simple as possible clinton continued his comments came just two days after multiple leading candidates in the democratic presidential primary such as sen elizabeth warren or sen bernie sanders advocated for medicare for all a single payer proposal in the primary s fourth debate the great appeal for the single payer system is it s universal and it s simple clinton said on thursday prune nourry whose upcoming documentary serendipity depicts her battle against breast cancer spoke with time s senior health correspondent alice park about how her health has impacted her art park asked about nourry s latest sculpture the amazon the creation of which is included in serendipity as a sculptor i felt through breast reconstruction that i was becoming the sculpture that sculpture the amazon was a way for me to get back to being the sculptor she said it became my catharsis part of the amazon is covered in joss sticks evoking the acupuncture needles nourry used during her treatment to maintain feeling in the ends of her fingers which she needs as a sculptor i think rituals are important when you re ill to celebrate every different step she explained and at the end of the treatments i decided to create this sculpture like a celebration seema verma the administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services under the trump administration called medicare for all scary in a conversation about drug and health care pricing with kaiser permanente ceo bernard tyson and agus i m always very concerned that we re hearing conversations about more government more medicare for all i think those kinds of things are very scary to me she said we see the day to day problems with a government run system when pressed about whose responsibility it would be to lower drug prices verma said the government would have a role taking care of the u s s most vulnerable using programs like medicaid and medicare but she said at the end of the day though patients have to be empowered to make decisions about their care they need to be in the driver s seat she said turning over negotiation to the government doesn t work well 23andme co founder anne wojcicki said people will grow used to genetic testing as time goes on likening privacy concerns to
