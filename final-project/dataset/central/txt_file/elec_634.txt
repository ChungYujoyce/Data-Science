finished third thank you new hampshire sanders told supporters let me take this opportunity to thank the people of new hampshire for a great victory tonight but sanders narrow victory leaves the democratic field unsettled with no clear front runner sanders of vermont had been heavilyfavored to win the state where he trounced democrat hillary clinton in 2016 by more than 20 percentage points in the days leading up to tuesday s primary sanders had a comfortable 7 percentage pointleadin state polling according to an average by realclearpolitics sanders also had the benefit of being from a neighboring state althoughsanders will likely gain momentum from his win it s not enough to allow him to breakaway from the pack sanders first place finish comes days after he finished in the top two in the iowa caucuses the iowa democratic party said buttigieg won the most pledged delegates in that state although sanders won a slightly larger share of the popular vote buttigieg faces challenges in the next two democratic contests the nevada caucus on feb 22and the south carolina primary on feb 29 the two states are much more diverse than iowa and new hampshire and buttigieg has struggled to gain support from black and latino voters here are some of the top takeaways from new hampshire s primary klobuchar is having a moment at least she did in new hampshire klobuchar of minnesota hadfinished in fifth in iowa but in new hampshire shebested sen elizabeth warren who had the benefit of being from neighboring massachusetts more sanders buttigieg klobuchar leading new hampshire primary field as two candidates drop out thank you new hampshire we love you new hampshire klobuchar told her supporters at her campaign headquarters in concord new hampshire my heart is full tonight while there are still ballots left to count we have beaten the odds every step of the way klobuchar rose to the third spot in pollingjust a day before the primary boosted byher strong debate performance friday nearly half of voters said they made up their minds about who they were going to vote for in the final days leading up tothe primary klobuchar has cast herself as a centrist alternative to progressives such as sanders and warren i do not have the biggest name up on this stage i don t have the biggest bank account she said in her closing statement at the debate i m not a political newcomer with no record but i have a record of fighting for people i m asking you to believe that someone who totally believes in america can win this because if you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense you have a home with me klobuchar s strong finish could help bring in needed money as she looks toward nevada and south carolina klobuchar is polling in the low single digits in both states according to an average from realclearpolitics klobuchar who has toutedher midwestern roots has struggled to gain traction with black and latino voters according to a january washington post ipsos poll klobuchar is at 0 with black voters nationally the next hurdle for klobuchar is to see whether she can maintain momentum as the race moves to more diverse states the acceleration of this race is hard to capture david plouffe the 2008 campaign manager for barack obama said on msnbc she s got to now put together a national campaign overnight klobuchar campaign manager justin buoen wrote on twitter that the campaign had raised more than 2 5 million since the polls closed in new hampshire surveys of voters taken before polls closed in new

we ve accomplished so much together andrew yang ends his campaign for presidency joe biden former vice president joe biden placed fifth in new hampshire behind warren a showing that raised new doubts about his viability he came in fourth in iowa long seen as the democratic front runner biden has seen his national poll numbers plummet following his iowa loss bidendidn t stickaround for the new hampshire results he headed instead to south carolina a state with a large proportion of african american voters and where he has been leading in the polls over the past several days biden and his campaign hadsought to lower expectations about new hampshire and iowa they have argued that the two states which are overwhelmingly white are not representative of the broader democratic electorate biden is polling at 31 in south carolina according to an average of surveysfrom realclearpolitics he video chatted into his new hampshire rally from columbia south carolina as results from the primary continued to roll in biden went on to speak to supporters in south carolina he noted that the most committed constituency in the democratic party the african american community and the fastest growing segment of society the latino community have yet to vote so to hear all these pundits and experts all these cable tv talkers talk about the race tell them it ain t over man we re just getting started our votes count too he told voters at his columbia rally biden has repeatedly argued that he is the best candidate to take on trump but his recent losses substantially undercut his electability
