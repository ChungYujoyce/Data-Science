 gov j b pritzker s extension of a statewide stay at home order continued to face pushback wednesday with a second republican state lawmaker challenging the order in a lawsuit accusing the governor of creating a police state the lawsuits along with calls for more rallies later this week to protest the governor s order reflect a growing frustration over the state shutdown in some quarters even as state officials said the number of known covid 19 cases in illinois had pushed past 50 000 the state on wednesday began its efforts to fend off a court ruling that exempts downstate rep darren bailey a xenia republican from pritzker s stay at home order asking the illinois supreme court to take up its appeal directly the clay county court s narrow ruling only allows bailey to ignore the directive rep john cabello a machesney park republican and a rockford police officer said he seeks broader results from the lawsuit he filed wednesday in winnebago county once we heard the arguments and that it really only seems to be applying to bailey i didn t want that i wanted it to apply to the rest of the state said cabello co chair of president donald trump s 2016 presidential campaign in illinois so we re trying to find a way of doing it so that it applies to anyone that wants to do it not to just one person and make no mistake this does not force anyone to leave their homes this would give them the option illinois has been under a statewide stay at home order since march 21 the order was originally set to expire april 7 but pritzker announced last week that residents would be under a stay at home order through may 30 with modifications due to take effect friday the modified order will require people to wear face coverings in stores and other public places but also begins a gradual reopening of state parks and allows activities like golf with strict social distancing guidelines trump said wednesday the federal government s coronavirus social distancing guidelines will be fading out when they expire thursday with a reliance on states taking charge as they pivot to reopening the administration says its cautionary guidance issued 45 days ago has been incorporated into recommendations given to the states on how they can begin gradually easing restrictions and reopening their economies change can t come quickly enough for some illinoisans small protests over the past two weekends at the state capitol in springfield have urged that the state s economy be reopened while some downstate leaders have pushed for regional reopening plans more protests are planned for friday in chicago and springfield the chicago event scheduled for 9 a m to 3 p m in the loop is being organized by freedom movement usa which on its website describes itself as a group of like minded republican activists the organization has held pro trump rallies in other parts of the state in another sign of partisan discontent three republican state lawmakers in a wednesday video news conference criticized pritzker for what they contend is exceeding his emergency powers by extending illinois stay at home order past 30 days without legislative approval whether you agree with the governor or disagree with the governor we believe that a separate but equal branch of government the general assembly should have input in the direction of the state of illinois said rep c d davidsmeyer of downstate jacksonville gop rep dan ugaste of geneva said pritzker was bucking a system of checks and balances by acting alone in extending the state s stay at home order the illinois emergency management agency act grants the governor emergency powers for 30 days following the declaration of a disaster but beyond that the statute is silent said ugaste it doesn t provide for the governor to extend it but it also doesn t state how the legislature will be involved pritzker has said throughout the covid 19 crisis he would leave decisions about reconvening the general assembly to legislative leaders though he said he s suggested they consult with the state department of public health about how to do so safely the general assembly has canceled weeks of session already and no plans for reconvening have been announced it is possible to meet at any time it doesn t have to be today or next week or even next month it really could be at any time and again that s up to the legislature pritzker said at his wednesday briefing if i started dictating a date for them to meet i m sure there would be blowback from legislators so i have left it to them to make decisions pritzker who over two days earlier this week harshly criticized bailey over his lawsuit called cabello s lawsuit another attempt at grandstanding both lawsuits argue that pritzker has gone beyond his legal boundaries in extending the stay at home order cabello s lawsuit accuses pritzker of distorting the state s emergency management agency act to create a police state through his stay at home orders the suit contends pritzker has used police powers reserved for the legislature to enforce his order and that he has usurped powers to limit travel that are reserved for local health departments pritzker has maintained he is using powers granted to him through the emergency management agency act even if well intentioned by pritzker his actions as governor have left every citizen of this state completely devoid of any procedural due process rights to protect their liberty afforded them by the united states and illinois constitutions and further guaranteed them by the legislature under idph s own administrative rules the lawsuit said the state responded to the judge s ruling in bailey s lawsuit on wednesday with a filing in illinois 5th district appellate court arguing that the representative s request besides being dangerous is flawed as a matter of law it rests on an erroneous reading of the act and ignores the governor s independent authority under the illinois constitution to take the actions bailey challenged the brief says it also contradicts the longstanding practice by numerous governors of issuing multiple and often successive emergency disaster proclamations that have allowed them to continue exercising emergency powers for the duration of the disaster the attorney general s office also seeks to poke holes in bailey s argument that approval from the general assembly is required to extend a disaster declaration beyond 30 days pritzker and his two immediate predecessors republican bruce rauner and democrat pat quinn all issued disaster proclamations for flooding and extended them beyond 30 days according to the filing when pritzker did so amid flooding in may 2019 his efforts were celebrated by bailey himself the filing said later wednesday the attorney general s office asked the illinois supreme court to take the matter up directly if the high court agrees it would skip over the appeals court the legal wrangling came as state officials on wednesday announced 2 253 new known cases of covid 19 including 92 additional deaths the known case count statewide stands at 50 355 while the known death toll is 2 215 since the outbreak began earlier this year pritzker acknowledged wednesday that the death toll related to the new coronavirus may be higher than the current counts indicate and that some deaths may have been attributed to pneumonia or some other cause there s no doubt that we re going to need to go back through the records he said that s probably going to happen in months hence because we have so much to do now we re probably going to have to go back and see how many of these probably based on all the symptoms were based on covid 19 pritzker also said wednesday that health care workers hired to staff the alternate care facility at mccormick place who now may not be needed there will be redeployed to different areas potentially at nursing homes and other health care facilities officials have been scaling back the scale of the mccormick place facility when it was announced last month build out plans called for the facility to eventually hold beds for up to 3 000 patients so we ve stood down 1 000 of those beds and it looks like we re going to have the ability to stand down much more of that facility pritzker said but again i don t want to speak too soon because all of these identified alternate care facilities need to be in a state of some kind of readiness chicago tribune s rick pearson and john byrne contributed jmunks chicagotribune com aayres brown chicagotribune com dpetrella
