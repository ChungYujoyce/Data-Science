 ken rudin if republicans had their way there would not have been a gubernatorial recall election in wisconsin an unnecessary waste of time many of them said democrats for the most part disagree scott walker s policies they argued mandated the recall election as for today s special election in arizona s 8th congressional district both democrats and republicans agree that it shouldn t be taking place at all giffords resigned her seat in january after 4 years in congress ken rudin collection hide caption it s happening because rep gabrielle giffords d who in 2010 had narrowly survived a tough tea party backed challenge in her bid for a third term was seriously wounded in a jan 8 2011 tucson shooting that left six people including a member of her staff dead unable to sufficiently recover to fulfill her duties as a member of congress she announced her resignation back in january that has left democrats turning to ron barber a 66 year old party stalwart who was giffords chief of staff and who was among those injured in the 2011 shooting barber making his first bid for office says he will follow in her footsteps the republican candidate is once again jesse kelly 30 a retired marine and iraq war veteran who came within one percentage point of defeating giffords in 2010 losing by just over 4 000 votes it was a miserable year for the democrats in arizona two of her house colleagues lost but giffords held on just as there were many attempts to make the wisconsin recall more than it really was there is a similar attempt to portray the arizona special election as a referendum on president obama the tea party or 2012 in reality it could well just be a referendum on gabby giffords and that would be just fine for the democrats who have not been receiving much good news of late last week s victory by walker in wisconsin was seen by many in the party as apocalyptic weak job numbers were of no help either a barber victory today would lessen that pain even if only a little bit the eighth the district as currently comprised is located in the southeast corner of the state with its center in parts of tucson it has a republican registration advantage of about 26 000 from 1985 until his retirement 22 years later it was represented by jim kolbe r a moderate conservative when kolbe left in 2006 the gop nomination went to randy graf a former state rep whose immigration position was seen as so hard line that kolbe refused to support him that gave giffords then a two term state senator the opportunity to make inroads with moderate republicans she won the seat with 54 percent of the vote in 2008 despite the presence of favorite son john mccain on the presidential ballot giffords defeated timothy bee the president of the state senate by 12 percentage points but if 2006 and 2008 were democratic years nationally 2010 was a huge republican year and giffords barely won political updates i post periodic political updates during the week on twitter you can follow me at kenrudin time for some questions from readers q i was confused by your numbers in last week s column regarding the california recall you wrote that gray davis was recalled 55 45 but in the same sentence you said arnold schwarzenegger won the recall by 17 points by my calculator schwarzenegger won it by ten points debbie thompson marietta ga one thing so memorable about the 2003 california recall election was the fine caliber of potential governors on the ballot and so what if this button misspelled gary coleman s name ken rudin collection hide caption one thing so memorable about the 2003 california recall election was the fine caliber of potential governors on the ballot and so what if this button misspelled gary coleman s name a there were two separate ballot issues during that october 2003 recall election the first one was a simple question of recalling davis that passed by a 55 45 percent margin with the possibility that davis would be ousted there was a second question on the ballot which of the 135 candidates should replace him schwarzenegger r easily finished first with 49 percent of the vote followed by democratic lt gov cruz bustamante with 32 percent third place went to gop state sen and now congressman tom mcclintock with 13 percent everyone else finished in single digits q i have a female governor two female senators a female representative until recently a female mayor and chief of police even a female dog cat catcher are there any other districts that can boast such a line up jan strobeck spokane wash a none whatsoever while two other states have two female senators california democrats dianne feinstein barbara boxer and maine republicans olympia snowe susan collins none has a female governor in washington you have gov christine gregoire d sens patty murray maria cantwell both ds and in spokane rep cathy mcmorris rodgers r and until last december the mayor of spokane was mary verner i can t attest to the identities of the dog cat catcher q i was interested in your statement see may 21 column that dwight david eisenhower was actually born as david dwight eisenhower did he ever officially change the order of his names or was that just how he became known coleman travelstead albuquerque n m a this according to the internet accuracy project his family had always addressed him by his middle name dwight to differentiate him from his father who was also named david and later came to be known as dwight david eisenhower birth records the eisenhower family bible and the eisenhowers themselves all confirm he was born david dwight eisenhower and later transposed his first and middle names q i am writing with a plea for my sanity and my ability to continue to enjoy the exceptional political commentary your political junkie segment on npr s

state this day in campaign history south carolina democrats nominate strom thurmond for the senate seat he vacated earlier in the year ok let s see how confusing i can make this in 1954 sen burnet maybank d running for a third term died unexpectedly the democratic state committee decided to reject holding a special primary and instead picked state sen edgar brown as the party nominee angered by the process thurmond a former governor decided to launch a write in campaign and was easily elected with 63 percent of the vote as he promised thurmond resigned the seat prior to the 1956 primary to give voters not the state party committee the choice he won the primary and general election without lifting a finger thurmond switched to the gop in 1964 by the time he retired in january 2003 he broke several records including becoming the oldest as well as the longest serving senator in history june 12 1956 got a question ask ken rudin politicaljunkie npr org npr thanks our sponsors become
