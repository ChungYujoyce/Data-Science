lawmakers have been under pressure to get a deal after the small business administration sba ran out of money last week for the paycheck protection program ppp which was set up to provide loans to businesses that would allow them to maintain payroll during the coronavirus shutdown the new deal would send 50 billion in small business money to the sba s economic injury disaster loan program which provides loans directly to small businesses instead of working through banks and credit unions like the rest of the ppp money it will also set 125 billion for the so called underbanked businesses such as small restaurants and nail salons that don t have strong pre existing relationships with banks the ppp had come under criticism after it emerged that larger businesses such as shake shack and ruth s chris steak house had won funding for the program shake shack announced it was returning the funds it had received the bill does not include new money for state and local governments a demand from democrats that mcconnell and other republicans vigorously opposed republicans were also able to block a 15 percent increase in the supplemental nutrition assistance program that democratic leaders had demanded democrats however got a win by securing billions of dollars for states to implement testing programs before reopening their economies this is one of the last things we had to hold out for we do believe the states need money schumer said of a nationwide testing program you need a national strategy and the president mnuchin and meadows agreed to that to theircredit and it will be in the proposal he said democrats would ask again for more money for states in the next coronavirus relief package which the administration and congressional leaders expect to negotiate later in the spring
