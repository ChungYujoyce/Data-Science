crises and why mrs clinton s health has become a flashpoint issue during this campaign loading september 12 2016 during an event commemorating sept 11 2001 on sunday democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton excused herself early after becoming overheated mrs clinton s physician lisa bardack revealed that the candidate was dealing with pneumonia which had been diagnosed on friday politically the timing was not ideal the revelation came as the clinton campaign has been hit by a wave of conspiracy theories elevated by the donald trump campaign and his supporters about the candidate s health over the past few weeks with many online theorists questioning whether clinton was well enough to be president is clinton being held to a double standard because she is a woman for most presidential candidates throughout history presidential health concerns have not seemed to concerned the public nearly as much as this election raising questions about what makes this campaign different a recent report from nbc news on clinton s health posed the question of why clinton s diagnosis was hidden until hours after her sunday near collapseand wondered if clinton would accept the obligation to inform the public about her health but for much of history such an obligation did not exist according to gallup many presidents have maintained silence on their respective health problems woodrow wilson had a stroke in office ronald reagan underwent secret surgeries and franklin delano roosevelt famously went to great lengths to give the public the impression that he was fully mobile after his battle with polio even though he spent much of his life in a wheelchair grover cleveland once disappeared from the white house for a full four days so that he could have a tumor removed on a yacht away from prying reporters according to npr john f kennedy suffered from more ailments was in far greater pain and was taking many more medications than the public knew at the time or biographers have since described the new york times reported in 2002 and that s only to name a few these presidents all kept their physical ailments secret in order to project an image of strength and reliability to the public a standard that was maintained through much of the history of the office until relatively recently as candidates lives have become increasingly open to scrutiny on the internet and various taboos in media about candidates personal lives have been broken it has become much more difficult for a candidate to hide an illness in response to increasing transparency presidential candidates have begun to come forward with health problems early on in their campaigns including dick cheney s heart issues and john kerry s successful battle with prostate cancer before his campaign began according to gallup at the time of the mr kerry campaign 92 percent of voters both republican and democrat said that they were not concerned about his ability to serve as president in contrast clinton s health has become an increasingly important issue for voters during this election a rasmussen report survey from before sept 8 shows that86 percent of likely voters say a candidate s health is important to their vote with 43 percent who characterize candidate health as very important some 17 percent of democrats and 73 percent of gop andunaffiliatedvoters said that clinton shealth was a legitimate concern for them those numbers could rise after news of clinton s diagnosis while clinton s desire to keep her health issues quiet is nothing new on the presidential front the response from her opponents has proven intense as a female candidate she has proven more susceptible to accusations of weakness from republican presidential nominee donald trump and his supporters in contrast to mr trump s strongman image the trump campaign has had a great deal of success in presenting the republican candidate as a traditionally masculine figure that fights rather than compromises representing his opponents as weaker and incapable of making the tough decisions necessary to run the country in contrast clinton s transparency about her health opens herself up to rhetorical attacks along this line get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox even before her diagnosis became public however clinton was already under attack for similar reasons with many fringe conservative sitessharing fake medical records as proof that she does not have the physical strength to effectively lead the country according to usa today while trump stands to benefit from clinton s diagnosis neither candidate has released a complete medical report to the public link copied get unlimited monitor journalism already a subscriber login less noise more insight
