president trump said monday is he taking hydroxychloroquine a drug the fda says is neither safe nor effective in treating covid 19 hydroxychloroquine is fda approved to treat autoimmune conditions such as lupusand rheumatoid arthritis it can also be used to treat some forms of drug resistant malaria or to protect against certain types of malaria the president appears to be taking it as a prophylactic with the thought it could prevent someone exposed to coronavirus from getting it there is at least one study looking into this usage underway but no data to support the idea yet hydroxychloroquine can be administered either as a pill or by intravenous drip and is marketed under the brand name plaquenil because it is fda approved for those diseases physicians are legally free to prescribe it in any manner they want off label meaning not for the reason listed on the drug s label it is not available over the counter at drug stores it is also different from chloroquine an anti malaria drug that trump has at times suggested as a treatment or preventative for covid 19 there is no data to support the notion that hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine helps people infected with sars cov 2 the virus that causes covid 19 there is strong evidence that hydroxychloroquine can cause abnormal heart rhythms and a dangerously rapid heart rate according to the u s food and drug administration there s no proof that it works and some people might experience side effects that could be severe there s no proof that it works and some people might experience side effects that could be severe said dr daniel kaul a professor of infectious disease at the university of michigan school of medicine the fda has cautioned that hydroxychloroquine should be limited to people in clinical trials which are carefully overseen or who are hospitalized due to concerns about the potentially dangerous adverse effects trump says he s taking hydroxychloroquine the drug he touted as coronavirus treatment despite fda warnings a study posted on april 21involving 368 patients with confirmed cases of covid 19 treated at veterans health administration medical centersfoundthere were more deaths among those given hydroxychloroquinethan those receiving standard care in addition the drug made no difference in the need for ventilators the u s national institutes of health launched a large clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine given in conjunction with the antibiotic azithromycin last week it is among multiple studies underway to see if the drug can help decrease hospitalization and death from coronavirus in a statement on the n i h website about the study dr anthony fauci noted that while where was anecdotal evidence that the drugs might benefit some people we need solid data from a large randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether this experimental treatment is safe and can improve clinical outcomes this will kill you people are warning others following trump s apparent use of hydroxychloroquine the university of minnesota is also in the midst of a large study of whether the drug can be used prophylactically but it will not be completed until august there is no data that pre exposure prophylaxis is effective in prevention covid 19 the study we re conducting should help us answer the question saidmahmoud al kofahi a professor of experimental and clinical pharmacology at theuniversity of minnesota another worry is that people taking it might have a false sense that they re protected from becoming infected covid 19 or cannot become infected and therefore cannot pass it along the concern would be they might change their behavior and put others at risk said michigan s kaul the drug first came to public attention after severalsmall anecdotal non peer reviewed reportsabout the drugs in chinain february none were up to the scientific goldstandard of a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial that would definitively show they worked or not interest in hydroxychloroquinetook off when a controversial microbiologist in franceposteda video on feb 25promoting the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat covid 19 didier raoult hasdenied

multiple times on fox and friends but later backedaway from it trump first spoke about hydroxychloroquine given together with the antibiotic azithromycinon march 19 he went on to tout them numerous times in various media and public events on april 13 he announced his administration had deployed roughly 28 million doses of hydroxychloroquine from the national stockpile just recently a friend of mine told me he got better because of the use of that that drug he saidin a briefing since late april trump had toned down his support ofthe drug but during a roundtable discussion with restaurant executives at the white house on monday said he began about a week and a half ago that was around the time two people in the white house who would have been in close contact with him tested positive
