with stark differences in personality and style but they do see eye to eye on one thing winning when donald trump became president he and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell were wary of one another to some in the trump camp it doesn t get any swampier than mr mcconnell now finishing his sixth term in the senate but over time they ve developed a mutual respect through experience passage of major tax reform and the confirmation of a record number of federal judges including two supreme court justices president trump has learned that mr mcconnell s advice is worth listening to both men are all about winning whether in elections or on legislation and confirmations or now in ensuring that mr trump survives an election year impeachment trial with party unity intact this hard fought alliance now faces a major test in the senate trial which began in earnest tuesday namely will mr trump continue to defer to mr mcconnell or will he muddy the messaging at this high stakes juncture in his presidency the president i think sees mitch as a class a operator says chris ruddy ceo of the conservative newsmax media and a longtime friend of mr trump in an email he s also a pretty frank guy and i know the president appreciates that candidness they are perhaps the ultimate washington odd couple one is a charismatic showman who operates on gut and instinct the other is low on charisma and shrewdly calculating one is a political outsider who has remade the republican party in his own populist image the other embodies the gop establishment yet despite some high profile clashes punctuated by angry tweets president donald trump and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky have made their relationship work foremost they re both all about winning whether in elections or on legislation and confirmations or now in ensuring that president trump survives an election year impeachment trial with party unity intact through experience passage of major tax reform and the confirmation of a record number of federal judges including two supreme court justices mr trump has learned that mr mcconnell s advice is worth listening to the president i think sees mitch as a class a operator a master of the senate who has helped him tremendously to move his legislative agenda through says chris ruddy ceo of the conservative newsmax media and a longtime friend of mr trump in an email he s also a pretty frank guy and i know the president appreciates that candidness mr ruddy acknowledges that when mr trump became president the two men were somewhat wary of each other but over time they ve developed a mutual respect they both like winners and put a value on getting things done he says this hard fought alliance now faces a major test in the senate trial which began in earnest tuesday namely will mr trump continue to defer to mr mcconnell or will he muddy the messaging at this high stakes juncture in his presidency since his dec 18 impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of congress mr trump has sent mixed signals on what he wants from outright dismissal of the articles of impeachment to the calling of democratic witnesses including former vice president joe biden house speaker nancy pelosi and house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff mr mcconnell has said that an effort to dismiss the case would fall short to the president s embarrassment furthermore for mr trump being acquitted after a trial sends a stronger reelection message than a dismissal presidential allies argue mr mcconnell and mr trump s lawyers oppose the calling of witnesses democrats want to call four including former national security adviser john bolton and acting chief of staff mick mulvaney and question them about mr trump s alleged quid pro quo with ukraine to help in his reelection effort for now the mcconnell game plan in conjunction with the trump lawyers is in effect but with the mercurial mr trump one can never be sure what he might say or do indeed for all their shared goals the two men can seem at times from different planets the key to making any joint trump mcconnell venture work say sources connected to each is to acknowledge those differing styles and take advantage of the best of each mcconnell s not a golfer mcconnell s not a backslapper says scott jennings a former campaign aide to mr mcconnell from kentucky think of them as a corporation someone s got to work in sales and marketing and someone s got to work in product engineering at the same time mr trump s alliance with mr mcconnell reflects a pragmatic streak in the president a willingness to compromise on his stated goal of draining the swamp that is changing the way washington works because to some in the trump camp it doesn t get any swampier than mr mcconnell now finishing his sixth term in the senate and expected to win his seventh in november former aides to mr mcconnell are all over washington working as lobbyists and consultants ken cuccinelli a trump acolyte and top official at the department of homeland security once called mr mcconnell the head alligator in the swamp that type of rhetoric may have resonated with mr trump when he first arrived in washington certainly the early going between the two was rough in july 2017 when the senate failed to repeal the affordable care act mr trump was furious spurring a month of severely strained relations punctuated by angry presidential tweets slamming mr mcconnell by name a phone call between the two men reportedly descended into a profanity laced shouting match followed by weeks of no contact mr mcconnell faced other sources of frustration that summer including mr trump s controversial reaction to protests by white supremacists in charlottesville virginia and the president s open antagonism toward some of mr mcconnell s gop senate colleagues complicating matters was the position of mr mcconnell s wife elaine chao as transportation secretary when asked that summer about the tensions between her husband and mr trump she said i stand by my man both of them by the end of the summer the two men had patched things over populist bomb thrower steve bannon a major mcconnell antagonist was out as mr trump s chief white house strategist and tax reform was on its way to passage the president s mood was brightening on the effort to repeal obamacare mcconnell got it as close as he could but the votes weren t there mr jennings says from that day forward they ve been hand in glove on just about everything last year mr mcconnell even gave himself a nickname the grim reaper as he promised to defeat all progressive proposals in the senate at this point mcconnell is probably one of his best advisers and trump probably realizes that says al cross a former longtime louisville reporter now at the university of kentucky in lexington for mr trump having an ally who doesn t compete for the spotlight is a plus mr mcconnell is famously taciturn and keeps his own counsel mcconnell keeps things close to the vest even with his own leadership team he doesn t make decisions on the fly says jim manley who ran communications for former democratic senate leader harry reid in meetings between reid and mcconnell neither of whom are known for eloquence reid was always the more loquacious of the two also working in mr mcconnell s favor may be the fact that he isn t quite the institutionalist that some make him out to be he resisted mr trump s entreaties to get rid of the legislative filibuster so he could pass bills with a 51 vote majority in the senate and not 60 votes but when it came to another senate tradition filling a supreme court vacancy expeditiously mr mcconnell was willing to break the mold he refused to hold a hearing or a vote on president barack obama s nominee merrick garland named in march 2016 saying the next president should fill the vacancy the gambit paid off after mr trump won the election allowing him to name a conservative to the high court in all mr mcconnell has overseen the confirmation of 187 federal judges ensuring a conservative judicial legacy that will last decades of all the impacts from the trump mcconnell partnership that may be the biggest of all to see all of the monitor s impeachment coverage go here could bernie sanders win the democratic nomination and then get routed in the general election because he s seen as too liberal that concern lurks then again 2016 blew up the political playbook with just 12 days until the iowa caucuses and a dominant front runner yet to emerge what once struck many as an unlikely outcome democratic nominee bernie sanders is suddenly looking like more of a possibility mr sanders polling strength is eliciting anxiety within certain quarters of the democratic party not unlike the reaction many republicans had in 2016 to another party outsider donald trump the worry a far left nominee could backfire for democrats i do believe that senator sanders is too liberal to defeat an incumbent republican president especially an incumbent president with a good economy and a huge bankroll says marshall matz a registered democrat who worked on the failed 1972 campaign of george mcgovern but like president trump mr sanders promise to upend washington has attracted a passionate group of followers the ironic similarity between bernie and trump is that they both have clear messages says iowa based democratic strategist jeff link bernie is incredibly clear and consistent and authentic and that is powerful in a time when people are cynical about politicians marshall matz knows what a losing campaign looks like an adviser to sen george mcgovern s 1972 white house bid mr matz had a front row seat to one of the biggest losses in presidential history senator mcgovern a liberal who opposed the war in vietnam drew large and enthusiastic crowds on the campaign trail but went on to lose every state save massachusetts and the district of columbia to an unpopular incumbent today mr matz finds himself watching the campaign of vermont sen bernie sanders with a growing sense of alarm that history may repeat itself i do believe that senator sanders is too liberal to defeat an incumbent republican president especially an incumbent president with a good economy and a huge bankroll says mr matz a registered democrat who still admires the late senator mcgovern and considered him a close friend i m trying to sound the alarm and say heads up here he says with just 12 days until the iowa caucuses and a dominant front runner yet to emerge what once struck many as an unlikely outcome democratic nominee bernie sanders is suddenly looking like more of a possibility even though a heart attack threatened to derail his campaign last fall senator sanders raised 34 5 millionover the final months of 2019 more than any of his rivals one recent iowa poll showed him in the lead there for the first time this cycle and a new national cnn poll has him leading the pack at the final debate in des moines last week mr sanders was given one of the center stage spots reserved for front runners he s benefitted in part from the struggles of fellow progressive sen elizabeth warren whose support appears to have fallen off in recent weeks and with whom he had a public spat last week over whether or not he once told her he believed a woman could not win the white house mr sanders strength is eliciting a kind of anxiety within certain quarters of the democratic party not unlike the reaction many republicans had four years ago to another party outsider who few initially believed could win donald trump like president trump mr sanders unconventional style and promise to upend washington has attracted a passionate group of followers who can t be neatly categorized and could wind up scrambling the usual rules of politics the ironic similarity between bernie and trump is that they both have clear messages says iowa based democratic strategist jeff link bernie is incredibly clear and consistent and authentic and that is powerful in a time when people are cynical about politicians a lot can change in the weeks leading up to iowa and frequently does four years ago mr sanders closed a12 point gapin the final three weeks before the iowa caucuses today polls show that 60 of the state s caucusgoers are still undecided but if mr sanders actually wins iowa which he very nearly did in 2016 and then goes on to win new hampshire as he did in 2016 it is not hard to envision his momentum carrying him on to win in nevada and beyond the latest poll out of california which will vote on super tuesday has mr sanders in the lead there the realization that his campaign is viable enough to win multiple early states and with the funding there as well has awoken many to the possibility that he could win the nomination says scott mulhauser a longtime democratic operative who was vice president joe biden s deputy chief of staff during the 2012 obama biden reelection campaign there is a steadiness to his campaign that has endured despite seemingly everything lately the drumbeat from establishment democrats warning against a sanders nomination has grown noticeably louder hillary clinton made headlines tuesday for speaking out against her 2016 primary rival nobody likes him nobody wants to work with him he got nothing done she says in a forthcoming documentary an assessment she repeated in an interview inthe hollywood reporter when asked if she would support mr sanders were he to win the nomination she replied i m not going to go there yet she later clarified that she would do whatever i can to support our nominee in some ways that s a fight many of mr sanders supporters seem to relish to beat mr trump in november they say the democratic nominee will need to excite new voters and get them to the polls voters who like many of mr trump s supporters have been disappointed by the party and are unhappy with the status quo some hypothetical general election matchupsdo show mr sanders along with mr biden faring best against mr trump one poll published last weekby marquette university law school found they were the only two to beat mr trump in the crucial swing state of wisconsin but while mr sanders supporters see the passion he inspires as a strength other democrats see it as a threat many blame mr sanders for mrs clinton s general election loss in 2016 and fear that if he fails to win the nomination again in 2020 his supporters will stay home on nov 3 instead of rallying around the party s nominee sanders concerns democrats by getting the nomination and by not getting the nomination says dennis goldford a political scientist at drake university in des moines iowa democrats are scared down to their toes that sanders could tank the whole ticket of course not everyone is convinced that mr sanders has a real shot at clinching the nomination most democratic voters simply would never vote for someone who calls himself a democratic socialist says professor goldford i think people forgot that he has a solid floor he says in response to the recent flurry of sanders induced panic but at least last time around he seemed to have a solid ceiling and he would be underestimated only if he breaks that solid ceiling this time around some activists on the ground in iowa express skepticism about mr sanders strength in northern iowa a conservative region represented by far right gop rep steve king in congress several local democratic leaders say chatter about mr sanders rise is overblown i just don t see it says logan welch a member of the hamilton county democrats and local councilman for webster city if you just went around webster city and asked all the democrats who they are going for i don t think bernie would be in the top three he sees more local support for former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg senator warren and mr biden in webster city a town of less than 8 000 peoplean hour s drive north of des moines true mr sanders surprised everyone with his near win against mrs clinton in 2016 says mr welch but it would be shocking for him to rise to the top again this year with such a thick bench of democratic candidates julie geopfert chair of the neighboring webster county democrats says mr sanders supporters don t seem as fanatical this time around in fact she says she has seen a lot of sanders backers from 2016 switch over to other candidates this cycle but the bigger field could actually be helpful to mr sanders like mr trump he may benefit from a large and fractured primary in which those opposed to him wind up splitting their support among various other candidates and the percentage any one candidate needs to win is lower in a january 2016 des moines register poll 43 of likely caucusgoers said they would describe themselves as socialist which ended up being a good proxy for mr sanders eventual support in the caucus that year in this year s poll only 28 of likely caucusgoers described themselves that way at first glance that may seem like disappointing news for mr sanders but that also might be all he needs to win the campaign has thought all along that if they can maintain their base and there is a credible challenger to biden in the establishment lane then they would be in good shape says mr link the way the iowa caucuses work could benefit mr sanders even more if candidates are deemed nonviable on caucus night meaning they have the support of less than 15 of those in the room then their supporters can realign with a different candidate kelcey brackett chair of the muscatine county democrats speculates that two candidates who may wind up as nonviable are hawaii rep tulsi gabbard and entrepreneur andrew yang and he expects a high percentage of their supporters many of whom identify as independents will join the sanders camp indeed mr brackett says mr sanders is looking quite strong in the southeastern corner of the state where he did particularly well in 2016 his campaign is large and active in muscatine county says mr brackett and seems to be knocking on more doors and making more calls than other campaigns we ve probably been underestimating his support agrees judy downs executive director of the polk county democrats iowa s most populous county and home to the state capital of des moines the sanders campaign empowers volunteers by giving them a lot of autonomy says ms downs but this also means it s more difficult to fully estimate the strength of his campaign i think sanders will be very happy on feb 4 she predicts since publicly speaking out against mr sanders earlier this month mr matz says several of his colleagues from the mcgovern years have reached out to say they agree we need to be more pragmatic than idealistic says mr matz who has the best chance of winning i m not sure who that is yet but i m pretty sure who it s not the middle east faces a crisis and egypt is no different too many young people too few jobs so the country s autocratic leader is trying to craft a new persona that s engaged fatherly and a little bit hip nine years ago disaffected young egyptians launched a revolution that overthrew longtime president hosni mubarak like the current president he was a career general who presented himself as a nationalist leader today president abdel fattah al sisi is presiding over the fastest growing economy in the middle east construction is everywhere and investor confidence is returning but more than half of egypt s population of 100 million is under the age of 25 and even as gdp has risen so too has poverty youth unemployment hovers above 30 mindful of the past a restless president sisi is pushing programs to meet the new generation s needs housing health care youth forums and jobs he s using these programs to project a fatherly persona that of a concerned leader providing for young egyptians hugging young people in front of cameras pushes the point home i have one million youth trying to enter the labor market each year they want a home they want to marry they want to raise children mr sisi recently told a group of foreign reporters how many jobs would you need to create could you do that every year for one million people egyptian president abdel fattah al sisi is presiding over the fastest growing economy in the middle east tourism is booming and a war against isis styled militants appears over construction is everywhere and investor confidence is returning there is a palpable energy and confidence radiating from cairo s streets then why is the egyptian leader restless two words one million over half of egypt s population of 100 million some 52 are under the age of 25 while two thirds are under the age of 30 and are looking for jobs and homes at a time the egyptian economy is still recovering i have one million youth trying to enter the labor market each year they want a home they want to marry they want to raise children president sisi recently told a group of foreign reporters one million how much would that cost in highly developed countries how many jobs would you need to create could you do that every year for one million people therein lies egypt s challenge it was nine years ago that disaffected young egyptians launched a revolution that overthrew president hosni mubarak like president sisi he was a career general who presented himself as a nationalist leader with that recent past in mind mr sisi whose tenure has been marked by the suppression of dissent is rushing to offer a warm embrace to young egyptians to head off any potential unrest opposition and instability last month capped a remarkable recovery for egypt which just three years ago faced 30 inflation 20 unemployment a debt crisis and devastating terrorist attacks across the sinai and even in cairo itself egypt s gross domestic product grew by 5 8 in 2019 up from 3 when mr sisi was sworn in as president in 2014 inflation dipped down to 2 7 in november the lowest since the 2011 revolution but these numbers do not tell the whole story while gdp has risen so too has poverty with poverty rates up 5 over the past three years according to the government central agency for public mobilization and statistics youth unemployment hovers above 30 in egypt the population is still growing the majority still have access to higher education yet the economy is not growing at a pace fast enough to create jobs for young people says amr adly political economist and assistant professor at the american university of cairo creating youth employment is no easy task the government is now rolling out a series of youth dialogues forums and technocratic socio economic programs to address those challenges and telegraph its good intentions one symbol of president sisi s urgent youth embrace is the world youth forum an annual gathering to discuss the challenges and concerns of young people in egypt the arab world africa and beyond that is the brainchild of the egyptian president himself at the forum held in the red sea resort town of sharm el sheikh mr sisi presides over panels and talks with young people flown in from across the world among the issues discussed artificial intelligence the fourth industrial revolution cryptocurrency and food security but more than just an emcee mr sisi is an active participant at the 2019 forum last month the egyptian president was sitting in the front row furiously scribbling down notes on a pad of paper and asking probing questions of speakers and the young audience he also never wasted an opportunity to tell egyptian audiences of the stability he upholds on the sidelines his ministers were buzzing about projects ranging from community biofuel plants to bike sharing schemes for university students young egyptian entrepreneurs and their businesses were showcased in booths the government is encouraging and opening doors for young entrepreneurs says khaled el sayed founder of a startup highlighted at the youth forum it is a very different environment than a few years ago when we wouldn t have even been noticed some of mr sisi s other youth programs are paternal bordering on invasive one such program is mawadda or the affection initiative which promotes the importance of marriage among young egyptians to cut rising divorce rates it aims to teach young people how to pick the right partner another the presidential leadership program plp directed by mr sisi s office trains potential young leaders in social sciences and governance to prepare them for positions across government to be the force for reform and change in november mr sisi swore in 11 new governors who were plp graduates and the president says he expects to fill more government positions from these youths according to independent media reports graduates of the program are now also filling posts in state run and private media organizations directing content at the behest of intelligence services initially there were different priorities for mr sisi who upon his rise to power in a 2013 military coup against islamist president mohammed morsi was flush with 20 billion in funds from saudi arabia and the uae eager for an ally to crush mr morsi s brotherhood movement since his 2014 election the egyptian president embarked on a series of megaprojects among them an 8 billion expansion of the suez canal and a new administrative capital built outside cairo to mixed results the fight against terrorism and a brutal crackdown on political opposition also consumed cairo s energies yet as gulf funding dried up and security was restored mr sisi and his government shifted to a series of targeted reforms partnering in recent years with the private sector and the world bank to fill gaps to provide housing health care and support for young entrepreneurs after a 40 billion housing project with the united arab emirates to build 1 million affordable homes broke down egypt pursued its own program with local banks and the world bank providing homes to 241 517 families it launched the long live egypt fund a charitable fund to serve the poor and young egyptians in health and housing and wrote new regulations to support small to medium enterprises which employ a bulk of egypt s citizens last year cairo rolled out a new universal healthcare system that allows egyptians to choose their health service providers lowers their medical payments and allows immediate care in private or public hospitals a scheme praised even by government critics mr sisi has used these programs to project a fatherly persona that of a concerned leader providing for young egyptians to help ease painful economic reforms as his government grapples with decades of deep seated economic issues hugging young people in front of cameras pushes the point home the programs also have been instituted at a time the government has slashed energy subsidies raised fuel prices imposed taxes and devalued the egyptian pound to comply with a 12 billion international monetary fund loan this paternal approach also stems from mr sisi s belief that young egyptians want a home job and a family rather than freedoms and democracy the president frequently blames the chaos of the 2011 democratic revolution for derailing egypt s economy and allowing extremist groups to flourish after years of post revolution uncertainty his argument is persuasive to some egyptians but many liberal and independent egyptians chafing under speech restrictions and those from marginalized regions who have borne the brunt of austerity measures would disagree so too would the thousands of young people some reportedly as young as 11 who have been arrested for alleged political activity or anti corruption protests and who continue to languish in jail yet in conversations on the streets of cairo and on the sidelines of the youth conference a number of ordinary young egyptians say unprompted that they feel mr sisi has their interests at heart there is an establishment in place that historically worked against the egyptian people but president sisi is changing this says mostapha ali a cairo craftsman who initially qualified for an affordable housing program before a local bank declined to approve his participation at the very least he is trying and working for our interests perhaps it was fitting then that mr sisi used a hastily arranged local youth conference in september to respond to corruption allegations by a former government contractor that went viral and sparked a spattering of protests against his rule i am establishing a new state i am doing so in the name of egypt the whole world will see it mr sisi said to an audience of young egyptians on national television defending the construction of lavish presidential palaces and listing his government s achievements nothing is in my name mr sisi insisted it is in egypt s name in colombia an ex combatant in the country s decadeslong civil war has been elected to office it shows a path to reconciliation and the hard questions that come with it guillermo torres walks the sweltering streets here like a celebrity he s been famous for decades known as the singer of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia or farc but last october he made headlines for something new he was elected mayor of turbaco becoming one of the first ex farc combatants to win an election by popular vote three years after a peace agreement colombia is still struggling to emerge from years of conflict mr torres is a symbol of the nation s broader tensions as demobilized guerrillas seek to build a place for themselves in a society that still sees them as criminals let off easy the peace accord made big promises like reparations for victims and reduced sentences for ex combatants who tell the truth as mr torres takes office this month his success could be a broader test for the nation i m never going to leave the path of peace anymore he says i know the risks guillermo torres walks the sweltering streets in this bustling northern colombian town like a celebrity teenage boys ask for selfies children hug him like family and throngs of men and women earnestly shake his hand mr torres has been famous for decades under the alias juli n conrado and nickname the singer of the farc he was a key member of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia for 30 years the guerrilla group is accused of crimes ranging from kidnapping to drug trafficking and until a 2016 peace accord was locked in a bloody civil war with the colombian government for half a century but last october mr torres made headlines for something new he was elected mayor of turbaco becoming one of the first ex farc combatants to win an election by popular vote as colombia struggles to emerge from years of conflict thevallenato singer is a symbol of these broader tensions as demobilized guerrillas seek to build a place for themselves in colombian society after decades of bloodshed there are deep seated stigmas surrounding ex combatants like mr torres he faces accusations of violence from his involvement with the farc though he denies ever doing more than sing songs of peace for the rebel fighters as mr torres assumes office this month his political ascent poses a tough question for the country that s ended war on paper but still struggles to feel at peace is it possible to move ahead when the decades of conflict are still unresolved the peace deal is meant to facilitate the reintegration of former combatants and pay reparations to nearly 8 8 million registered victims it promises things like a special court for transitional justice providing reduced sentences for ex combatants who tell the truth about what happened during the conflict i m not a militant of the farc anymore mr torres says sitting in a market in the heart of turbaco on a late december morning i don t want to be a militant of any party i want to be a militant of my people the 2016 peace agreement promised an end to 52 years of violence between colombia s government and guerrillas hiding away in the rural reaches of its jungles combatants set down their arms and a newly formed farc political party was given seats in congress but an inherent distrust of the combatants still simmers when the farc emerged in the 1960s they referred to themselves as the people s army set on countering violent military crackdowns but the insurgents turned into something more destructive relying on forced recruitment extortion and colombia s lucrative drug trade to fuel their war against the government the farc committed egregious crimes against humanity says sergio guzm n director of colombia risk analysis they raped they killed they kidnapped it s not like they have a bad reputation undeservedly in 2018 president iv n duque took officeafter campaigning heavily against the peace agreement saying it created an environment of impunity the conservative politician denounced inhumane criminals who have killed kidnapped extorted and recruited children arriving to congress under mr duque faith in the peace process has faltered as the government fails to implement key facets of the agreement paramilitary fueled violence in former farc zones surged in the power vacuum left behind ex combatants have been targeted and assassinated by other armed groups and key farc leaders made renewed calls to arms against the government mr torres received death threats during his campaign and now walks around town with a bodyguard the stigma of being an active part of the conflict is going to remain with them forever mr guzm n says about former farc members mr torres was born in 1954 in the impoverished town of turbaco which sits just a stone s throw away from the tourism hotspot of cartagena he claims he began singing in the womb as a young man his ballads turned political as he noticed the corruption permeating coastal governments like turbaco s he became what he called the people s singer crooning about injustices facing his town in coastal rhythms of vallenato i sing because the people need their singers he says it s how the people express their joy it s how the people express their sadness it s how the people express their desires their will their dreams singing about injustice was a dangerous proposition at a time when anyone speaking out against the government was lumped in with leftist guerrillas mr torres started to see a violent backlash against his political activism in the early 1980s when paramilitaries killed his friend juli n conrado a doctor and fellow singer 29 year old mr torres fled to the jungle cloaked sierra nevada mountains and joined the farc many colombians didn t have any other options to save our own lives mr torres says noting that many joined the farc or the military simply to not be caught in the crossfire it was a decision i made forced by circumstance he gave himself the alias juli n conrado to honor his friend when he joined mr torres hoped to someday leave the fighters and return home in the farc torres became a troubadour for the guerrillas i am a guerrilla but you know what has been my weapon for all my life my singing torres says i was always armed with a guitar some observers say he was armed with more lethal weapons while mr torres electoral victory was historic his past is front and center for many critics as he assumes office before mr torres demobilized in 2016 the singer was wanted by the united states drug enforcement agency for alleged crimes including drug trafficking and conspiracy there were numerous warrants out for his arrest in colombia including for homicide and kidnapping while he wasactively a part of the farc the u s government offered up to 2 5 million as a reward for information leading to his arrest former colombian president juan manuel santos dubbed mr torres a narco terrorist in 2011 when he was captured and imprisoned for three years in venezuela he was released to join peace negotiations with the colombian government in havana mr torres denies all allegations against him saying he was associated with the actions of farc leaders because he played music at key events i m not a man of war i ve never been a man of war mr torres says i spent a lot of my childhood under the bed because i was scared of fireworks the now 65 year old mayor says he tried to demobilize with other guerrillas after a few years in the farc forming the leftist political party patriotic union but when party members became targeted by paramilitaries drug lords and security forces mr torres says he returned once again to the jungles colombia s october 2019 local elections were the first in which the farc political party participated in a popular vote it served as a referendum on the guerrillas popularity and ability to integrate into a society that still fears what the fighters once represented says gimena s nchez garzoli andes director of the washington office on latin america mr torres says that in an attempt to leave the stigma of the farc behind he ran for office under the leftist party colombia humana not the rose banner of the farc party his anti corruption message won50 7 of the vote nearly 20 more than his closest competitor while the farc party ran more than 300 candidates for thousands of open mayoral and council seats only two were elected two other ex combatants also won mayoral seats under the helm of other parties the elections offered the party an opportunity to show they had been redeemed in the eyes of the public ms s nchez garzoli says but in practice the results were the opposite it shows that colombian society was tired of war but they were also tired of the farc ms s nchez garzoli says though a relative outlier mr torres coastal town may offer an alternative path forward people need second chances says luis montalbon a moto taxi driver here he s done bad but now the people are choosing him because he is leading against the bad things that have been happening in this town mr montalbon a father of two in his late 30s lived nearly his entire life with the farc and colombian government at war leaning on his motorcycle the scorching coastal sun beating down on his sweat speckled face he talks about the rampant corruption and soaring levels of poverty and unemployment he believes is holding colombia back in turbaco there isn t anything he says mr torres promises for change presented a sliver of hope he explains though people still whisper about the mayor s past despite the outpouring of support in his hometown torres may have a rude awakening as he faces the rest of the country as a public official mr guzm n says

guira rokia kon niariu and ms ke ta niariu had been performing in an underground parisian group when she was invited to come to the studio to write and sing on the second album the emphasis was more in talking about the violence on the women but that can also be perpetrated by women says niariu noting that female circumcision is often performed by women so it was also a way of first of all uplifting women again but also make us realize the strength that we have and how we can change things together this time out several songs pair male and female vocalists their inclusion isn t just artistic it s also symbolic men have their part to play in feminism says niariu femininity is in everyone male and female she says praising jon grace and boy fall from the group nyoko bokbae for their emotional sensitivity on their shared song that doesn t mean that i m not masculine enough that means today i embrace my feminine side and that s something that i think males have to understand society has to understand because there s a lot of pressure of what we call masculinity the singer also sees a role for women to embrace masculine qualities such as strength heavy is a tribute to female entrepreneurs such as boy fall s senegalese grandmother an immigrant who launched a successful hair salon in paris niariu cites single mothers as another example of women who embody both masculinity and femininity her own mother is among them when she was young she was that cool kid a rebel niariu says shaving her head piercing her nose and wearing leather and then she got married and then her life changed and she didn t have the tools to be able to follow her dreams the singer demurs on providing details of her mother s marital experience as an immigrant from guinea there were a lot of really desperate moments she allows the aunts who helped raise niariu inspired the song smile this message is a way to speak for my mom who needed and still needs this sisterhood she says it s a message to everyone that had the same story or is going through the same things and also trying to break this cycle the final track on the album power gathers 16 vocalists to reiterate a similar message it s a universal rallying cry for ending violence against women and ushering in equality and respect without women holding this world together we wouldn t be at peace she says women are the glue that sticks people together as a society niariu says she s going to sit her mother down to listen to the album soon i know she s going to tell the whole world about it she says laughing politics in the u s has become so intense that spending on political ads for the 2020 elections could reach 20 billion at the same time private giving to nonprofit groups may also see a banner year in 2019 charitable giving reached an estimated 430 billion up slightly from the year before in both types of giving whether for advocacy on a national issue or for action to solve a local problem the motive is often a strong belief in how to shape society the big picture is one of greater civic engagement at least measured by donations giving to a cause can transform both the donor and the recipient it incites others to give it helps people align their values for common purpose for many giving is merely a reflection of the good given to them unlike the money itself the effects can be immeasurable politics in the u s has become so intense that spending on political ads for the 2020 elections could reach 20 billion that would be a big jump from 16 billion four years ago more people are willing to give more money for public causes at the same time private giving to nonprofit groups may also see a banner year in 2019 charitable giving reached an estimated 430 billion up slightly from the year before despite a 2017 tax law that reduces taxpayer incentives to itemize donations and during the november event known as giving tuesday charities raised 511 million globally compared with 380 million in 2018 in both types of giving whether for advocacy on a national issue or for action to solve a local problem the motive is often a strong belief in how to shape society political donors of course may be trying to rig public policy for their personal benefit but the line between selfless and selfish giving is often blurred the larger picture is one of greater civic engagement at least measured by donations groups that rely on private giving are concerned that americans have a limit on their generosity they warn of a competition for dollars between charities and politicians or they worry about the rising cost to run an ad asking for money yet the limitation is not in the amount of discretionary money in people s bank accounts it is in the vision of those asking for the money a worthy cause can alter a person s spending priorities giving to a cause can transform both the donor and the recipient it incites others to give it helps people align their values for common purpose for many giving is merely a reflection of the good given to them the meaning of giving has also expanded to include ethical investing or investing in for profit businesses with social goals such as selling goods made of recycled material as trust in traditional institutions declines young people are inventing new ways to help others they seek giving that is egalitarian and results guaranteed the biggest result of giving is a more compassionate society giving helps build community whether it is a donation to a political campaign or a homeless shelter unlike the money itself the effects can be immeasurable each weekday the monitor includes one clearly labeled religious article offering spiritual insight on contemporary issues including the news the publication in its various forms is produced for anyone who cares about the progress of the human endeavor around the world and seeks news reported with compassion intelligence and an essentially constructive lens for many that caring has religious roots for many it does not the monitor has always embraced both audiences the monitor is owned by a church the first church of christ scientist in boston whose founder was concerned with both the state of the world and the quality of available news thoughtful consideration is a good thing but when we re stuck in a cycle of rumination that hampers progress where can we find peace and answers we can listen for divine guidance letting the all knowing god bring the calm and inspiration we need do you ever get stuck mulling over an idea imagining all the different ways it could play out or replaying a conversation and thinking of all the ways you could have responded better or when you think about a person or even yourself do you sometimes get stuck dwelling on something they did wrong rather than the 95 of things they do right sometimes when i find myself doing this it almost feels as if i m not in control of my own thinking i get so focused on that one thing that i become almost mesmerized by it i just keep turning it over and over ruminating on it rumination is a term used to describe the eating process of cows and other ruminant animals including sheep goats deer elk buffalo giraffes and camels these animals have four stomach compartments and can store food so they can come back to it later to chew on it again which is called chewing the cud this is what we do figuratively speaking with thoughts or ideas when we ruminate on them they come back to us over and over to keep chewing on or wrestling with constructive thoughtfulness is a good thing of course but when it becomes something more extreme how do we stop unhelpful cycles of rumination i have found a couple of ideas helpful in these situations one has to do with a particular way to think about god science and health with key to the scriptures by mary baker eddy the discoverer of christian science provides several synonyms for deity that find their basis in the bible one of them is mind divine mind both the old and new testaments share accounts of god as all knowing wise possessing infinite understanding and having good counsel and righteous judgment or discernment see for instance isaiah 40 13 14 psalms 147 4 5 and romans 11 33 34 the idea that god is infinite all knowing mind possessing wisdom and knowledge of all that is good and true and governing all by his wisdom and goodness has direct relevance for us the first chapter of the bible explains that we are created in god s image and likeness as god s spiritual reflection we express that infinite mind this means that understanding is a quality inherent in the true spiritual nature of each of us so when we re looking for answers we can listen for divine guidance and let the all knowing mind calm our thought it can seem hard to listen when our mind is spinning in circles of rumination but i like the example of jesus responding to the fears of his disciples when he was out on a boat with them in a raging storm see matthew 8 23 27 from the vantage point of his spiritual understanding of god mind the bible says jesus rebuked the winds and the sea with an authority that stilled the wind and waves and calmed the thoughts of his disciples this profound example of expressing divine authority reminds me that storms of thought within us can be stilled god governs his creation with love and only ever wants peace for us as this bible passage conveys for i know the thoughts that i think toward you says the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil or fear doubt or rumination to give you a future and a hope jeremiah 29 11 new king james version as the expression of god s love and goodness we can and do experience and express that divine peace psalm 46 counsels be still and know that i am god verse 10 even when mental tumult seems overwhelming we can take a moment to turn wholeheartedly to god to still our thought the infinite divine mind is always peaceful and has just the inspiration we need at every moment i ve found that a willingness to let the divine mind guide us tends to break the cycle of rumination leaving me free to think clearly and to be receptive to new ideas and a fresh perspective and we can trust that god s answers which come with clarity and calm will benefit us and those involved in whatever the situation may be so next time you re caught up in mulling over some thought again and again remember we can leave the ruminating to the cows and let god help us feel the clarity and true peace of mind thank you for joining us today we hope you ll come back tomorrow
