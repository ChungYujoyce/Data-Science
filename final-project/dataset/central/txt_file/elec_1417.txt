universal health care coverage whether it be through a single payer system a dual system or otherwise this week o rourke again movedaway from full single payer health care saying he supports giving

medicare for all he added o rourketold cbs newson thursday that medicare for all is one of the possible paths to expanding health care coverage but made it clear he prefers a different approach that would allow people to keep their employer based coverage if they wanted and leave medicare as an option i think the fastest way to get there is to ensure that people who have insurance that they like through their employer are able to keep it and that we complement that with those who can purchase medicare be covered by medicaid o rourke said in the interview he separately said in iowa this week

o rourke s struggles with medicare for all also highlight how the issue hascreated a rift in the democratic party many progressives say backing single payer health care is a necessity for the eventual nominee but more establishment democrats think it is a smarter strategy politically to allow people to keep their employer sponsored coverage if they like it rather than mandating an end to it republicans have already seized on the elimination of private insurance coverage under medicare for all as a leading line of attack a kaiser family foundationpoll in januaryfound that support for medicare for all drops from 56 percent to 37 percent when people are told the proposal would mean the elimination of private insurance companies a proposal along the lines of what o rourke issuggesting to make medicare an option for all has the support of 74 percent of the public the poll found o rourke also indicated thursday that he could try to work with republicans on the issue a far different tone than that of sanders who has called his presidential run a continuation of the political revolution he says started in 2016 i m convinced that we will have to work from as much common ground as possible o rourketold radio iowaon thursday no one person and perhaps no one party can force the decision on this this has to be something that america comes together on adam green co founder of the progressive change campaign committee pccc pushed back on o rourke s openness to working with gop lawmakers the larger problem here is his entire theory of the case on being president green said green noted that pccc supported o rourke in the senate race last year but questioned his more recent remarks it s becoming increasingly clear that if someone wants a medicare for all champion in the white house that beto is kind of taking himself out of consideration for that champion role which is rather unfortunate green said for many progressives there are worries that o rourke

critics also said he offered few policy specifics whether o rourke can do that again in what is expected to be a crowded democratic primary field and with progressives rallying around medicare for all is an open question democratic strategist brad bannon said o rourke in general has put more of an emphasis on charisma and appeals to unity rather than on detailed policy proposals it seems to me he s running a personality campaign as opposed to a policy campaign he said but he added that o rourke could be an appealing pick for democrats focused primarily on defeating president trumpdonald john
