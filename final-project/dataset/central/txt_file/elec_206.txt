mississippi senate democratic primary bottom line mike espy announces mississippi senate bid more s r term but the prospects of a low turnout election and a drop off in enthusiasm are looming as major hurdles for the gop senator once considered a shoo in she s come under immense scrutiny after joking about her willingness to be on the front row if a supporter invited her to a public hanging she s also come under fire after joking about making it more difficult for liberal students to vote and after 2014 pictures emerged of her wearing a confederate hat during a visit to a museum her public hanging comments earned a sharp rebuke from espy who said they are harmful to the state and reinforce stereotypes that mississippi has worked hard to overcome hyde smith has defended herself but ultimately apologized at a debate between the two candidates last week republicans have sought to move past the gaffes and to attack espy as an out of touch liberal but there are growing fears that republicans will suffer from an enthusiasm gap compared with democrats mississippi saw record turnout for a midterm during the four way special election on nov 6 hyde smith came in first in that race with 41 5 percent of the vote while espy ended slightly behind with 40 6 percent both below the 50 percent cutoff needed to avoid a runoff strategists on both sides of the aisle expect much lower turnout since the runoff falls just five days after thanksgiving that makes it critical for hyde smith to rally the gop base including those who voted for republican candidate chris mcdaniel in the nov 6 election to make another trek to the polls will trump s eleventh hour visit to mississippi save hyde smith fearing an enthusiasm gap republicans brought in trump to headline two rallies on the eve of the runoff in a last ditch effort to excite base voters and pull hyde smith over the finish line trump won mississippi by nearly 18 points in 2016 and remains popular in the state prior to his rallies in tupelo and biloxi the president has offered several endorsements of hyde smith as he hopes to build a stronger senate majority last week trump defended hyde smith saying she had made the public hanging comments in jest while calling it a shame that she has to go through this the rallies are a calculated gamble for trump he risks suffering an embarrassing outcome like the one in the

moore who went on to lose to sen doug jones d ala after facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct that he denied but republicans feel more confident about hyde smith s prospects in mississippi and are hopeful trump s rallies will prove as helpful as they have for a number of republican senate candidates in close races this year will loyal chris mcdaniel supporters back hyde smith to ensure victory on tuesday hyde smith will likely need support from voters who backed mcdaniel a conservative firebrand and state legislator who came in third in the nov 6 race with 16 5 percent of the vote or 146 000 votes but that is not guaranteed in a republican party that has seen some nasty primary races this year brought on by anti establishment candidates that still leaves open the question of whether mississippi will see a unified republican party or whether mcdaniel supporters will stay home or even consider backing espy mcdaniel clashed with senate majority leader mitch mcconnelladdison

is to deny the truth about lack of supplies more r ky and other gop leaders when he challenged cochran in a vicious gop primary in 2014 and came close to unseating him some republicans initially feared hyde smith s appointment to cochran s seat earlier this year because they were concerned about another mcdaniel bid and her vulnerability among gop voters because of her past affiliation with the democratic party despite a contentious race mcdaniel has said he now supports the gop senator now it will be up to his loyal anti establishment backers to determine whether they ll follow in his footsteps will espy build a winning coalition for another deep south upset if espy is to have a shot at flipping the deep red seat he ll need a surge in black voters in a state where african americans make up about 38 percent of the state s population overall espy will likely need to win at least 90 percent of nonwhite voters as well as about 25 percent of white voters strategists said stitching together a coalition similar to the one that brought jones to the senate from alabama last year exit polling from the nov 6 election showed that black voters made up 33 percent of the electorate with espy winning an overwhelming majority of that vote while hyde smith won 60 percent of white voters to improve on those numbers espy will likely need to boost support from the delta which makes up a

espy has been out of public office and off the campaign trail for more than two decades after serving in congress from 1987 to 1993 when he left to become former president clinton s agriculture secretary republicans have seized on that past to ramp up their attacks against espy linking the democrat to the clintons and the swirling controversies from that administration espy also brings baggage of his own having stepped down as agriculture secretary in 1994 amid claims that he improperly received gifts he was acquitted of all charges in 1998 but republicans have sought to put a spotlight on the bribery allegations hyde smith and republicans have also raised questions over espy s past lobbying contract with a west african despot fox news reported he earned 750 000 through a contract with former ivory coast president laurent gbagbo despite saying in 2011 that he only collected half that amount espy said he ended the contract with gbagbo who s currently on trial for crimes
