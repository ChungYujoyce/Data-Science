algebra questions and your budget report due at noon welcome to work in the time of covid 19 as both offices and schools go remote working parents balancing act has become even more difficult employees double lives as parents are now out in the open and testing fault lines around divisions of labor employer expectations and gender stereotypes but this new terrain is also presenting opportunities for people to rethink their ideas about what it means to be a working parent or employ one and possibly identify longer term shifts that could benefit all the crisis has made this much clearer that these are universal problems that nearly all families are facing says kathleen gerson a sociology professor at new york university now we can see how essential it is both economically and for personal well being and for family well being that we address the caregiving crisis in our society she says three years ago when the now viral video hit the internet of a father in a live television interview interrupted by two stumbling toddlers professionals with kids around the globe laughed tears of schadenfreude but today as schools and day cares are canceled and governments worldwide encourage or require citizens to remain home to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus the risk of their own client calls or video conferences getting interrupted by crying kids or exasperated teens is exponentially high so high in fact there are photos and videos posted online from late night comedy hosts university professors local news anchors and even canadian prime minister justin trudeau in self quarantine documenting the juggle of their day jobs with their now ever evident roles as parents editor s note as a public service all our coronavirus coverageis free no paywall working from home while children are present is extremely challenging for some families it s near impossible already the global lockdowns are testing fault lines around familial divisions of labor employer expectations gender stereotypes and parental patience but at this unique moment it s largely understood that if you have kids and are able to work remotely the two worlds will collide and that presents opportunities for employers and employees to rethink their perceptions about working parents and possibly identify longer term shifts that could benefit all once we ease out of this crisis people are not going to want to work in the same way they did before says deborah croft co founder of thriving talent a european company helping businesses and organizations meet their gender diversity goals people are going to be asking for different ways of working because they will have done it and seen that it can work lauren romansky from acton massachusetts regularly works remotely for a research and consulting firm based in connecticut now with day care shuttered ms romansky and her husband trade off shifts of work and child care for their 2 and 4 year old daughters finishing up what remains after the kids are in bed it makes for incredibly long days what i ve been trying to explain to a bunch of my colleagues who aren t used to working remotely is this is not business as usual even just in terms of remote work says ms romansky she thinks it s too early to tell what impact the covid 19 crisis will have on perceptions of working parents but her daughters have been more visible to her colleagues than they normally are which she embraces in part that visibility is intentional her department started a daily optional exercise class that staff and their families or roommates or pets are invited to join it s a really great way to authorize everyone to recognize that we re all working in different circumstances and it doesn t have to be something we re ashamed of or is a problem she says of the realities and responsibilities each person is juggling for jamie schroeder a business operations managerfor google in mountain view california kids showing up on team video calls has become something of a norm there s lots of babies in the background that you hear but it feels very empowering and there s a supportive dynamic about it she says adding that she doesn t rush to mute her computer when her 16 month old makes a peep most organizations are really trying to do something to make it easier for parents now working from home with the added stresses of child care and schooling says ms croft it is teleworking where you are going to have children popping out and coming through the door it s going to be chaotic and there is an acceptance of the fact that that is the case some 56 of parents who also work professionally say it s difficult to balancethe responsibilities of work and family according to a 2015 pew research center survey parents often feel pressure to hide their double lives as caregivers from their employers whether due to personal fears or long established stigmas experts say seventy four percentof parents with kids under the age of 18 say they sometimes feel too busy to enjoy life according to a 2018 pew survey and that was all before most parents lost their child care amid the coronavirus crisis child care that even in normal times is often excessively expensive in every u s state the cost of infant and toddler child care exceeds the federal definition of affordable according to the center for american progress on average families in high income countries around the world spend 14 5 of their income on child care but those living in new zealand the united kingdom and the united states can expect to spend closer to one third the crisis has made this much clearer that these are universal problems that nearly all families are facing says kathleen gerson a sociology professor at new york university who studies gender work and families now we can see how essential it is both economically and for personal well being and for family well being that we address the caregiving crisis in our society she says already the disruptions in some parents lives are translating into hopes of more permanent shifts down the line my view of working from home has changed a lot says karla martinez de salas editor in chief of vogue mexico and latin america who had never tried it before the pandemic in normal times she is required to travel frequently for work and returned from a trip to italy in early march that meant two weeks of self quarantine which she discovered was a blessing in disguise because of the time it allowed her to spend with her twin 4 year old daughters as the girls get older it s harder and harder to be away so perhaps working from home once or twice a week would be the ideal scenario for a mom like me she says with the covid 19 crisis we have accelerated that whole question mark of can we or can t we do flexible working because you have to says ms croft from thriving talent carlos taboada a human resources consultant in monterrey mexico and father of two says he never liked the idea of his team members working remotely i m the worst at home office i get distracted so easily he says in the past that perception translated to how he viewed it for his six direct reports too four of whom are parents although mexico hadn t required business to close yet mr taboada gave his team the option to work from home starting in mid march he s had to put a lot of faith into his employees to meet deadlines within the time frame they see fit for their particularly chaotic lives right now sometimes assignments are delivered at 1 a m but together they re making it work i ve seen baseballs thrown in the background of calls a cleaning woman dancing with her mop a client breastfeeding he says of the past two weeks of work calls his takeaway is that in the future it s going to be even more important to balance these personal family needs with the needs of business but the flexibility to work from home is not a win for everyone it s been enormously disruptive says julia rous a self employed single mother in the british village of horsley who juggles three jobs including teaching the loss of steady income combined with schools shift to distance learning is taking its toll there is no support in self employment gender fault lines in juggling home and work are not new but are shining brighter than ever in recent weeks according to a recent kaiser family foundation survey both fathers and mothers are fretting more about the effects of coronavirus on their well being and earnings than people without children however women report being more worried 36 say the stress has had an impact on their mental health versus 27 of men changes always are slower than we d hope but there are so many men disconnected from the sphere of the home and caregiving and this moment obligates them to confront it says nicko nogu s founder of the instituto de machos a hombres the organization tries to challenge machismo across latin america and parts of europe via partnerships with private companies and international organizations it opens an opportunity where we can show men that they have a lot to gain getting more involved at home he says there s more acceptance among working parents that they re doing their best even if the hodgepodge nature of caring for kids and meeting deadlines is best encapsulated in internet memes these days i think the aha moment is coming and in an even bigger way but i don t think it s come just yet says daisy wademan dowling founder and ceo of the consulting firm workparent which trains companies how to support and retain parents get the monitor
