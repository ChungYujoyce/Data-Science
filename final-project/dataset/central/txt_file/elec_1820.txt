objlink render the lead up to tuesday s election day was an ugly time in america the impeachment proceedings cemented the hard feelings between the two parties seemingly spoiling any chance that the republicans and democrats will agree on much going forward but on election day that changed at least at three rivers school in pembroke that s where residents voted members of both parties and that s where they essentially said the same thing to me when asked if it s time our high profile spot in the voting process moved on hands off our first in the nation primary they said it belongs to us we should be keeping it said mike murphy a children s music teacher we know people are complaining they say we are not diverse enough rep diane schuett cited our congressional delegation which includes three women and a gay man i travel a lot and people say how come you have the first primary schuett said well i say because we were smart enough to institute it did you catch it the word we coming from both murphy and schuett murphy loved president donald trump schuett is a democrat finally harmony an olive branch a treaty on tuesday anyway the months of political rancor melted away as granite staters coalesced around our special day the one that makes other states envious i get to talk to the candidates said bernie fournier standing in front of the school with a three tier sign promoting bernie sanders i can ask them questions and see them answer without a script what they think and what they feel he continued where else can you get first hand information from the candidates it s one of the nice things about living in new hampshire not everybody in other states likes that but i do new hampshire s place in the voting order could be tied to the corn stalks in iowa where it took forever last week to tabulate the votes from their caucus and announce the winners something about a malfunctioning app pete buttigieg and bernie sanders led the pack but the jokes on late night tv were relentless leaving the democratic party and officials in iowa with egg on their face as it was iowa had already heard about its shortcomings the same stuff we hear new hampshire like iowa is too white too old too rural too isolated new hampshire is also the perfect state for canvasing our winters notwithstanding the candidates could never buzz around a state like california here it s called retail politics and there s nothing quite like it anywhere in the country being a smaller state candidates can go all over the place fournier told me you talk to everybody you go and shake the hand of somebody you knock on doors earl phair would be irked if the primary was taken from us he admitted however that he also grew tired of the various campaigns that had bombarded him with information sometimes with a ring other times with a knock still other times with the interruption of his favorite tv show we should definitely keep the primary phair said but i think they ought to do away with all the commercials it drives me nuts and we don t answer the phone while acknowledging that new hampshire is home to few minorities sarah carboneau said we ve earned our place at the top of the primary list through tireless research and tough questioning i know there are a lot of people who think that we shouldn t have it carboneau said they think we need more diverse people to cast their votes but new hampshire has had it for so long and we re well versed and educated about it and i think we take it really seriously we do it s a day for the two parties the voters in new hampshire to finally agree on something party affiliation didn t matter not on tuesday at three rivers school reality is set to return though right after the election the arguing the pettiness the politics it s democrats against president donald trump all over again the interpretation of the word truth is so far apart within both camps as to be laughable these days republicans insist that the united states has never been better the maga on those red hats no longer needs to be spelled out we know what it means democrats the clock is ticking on the apocalypse so you d better switch to solar electricity fast thankfully then came election day new hampshire citizens on both sides of the aisle agreed on something agreed to a ceasefire at least for one day i think americans like the way things run murphy said i don t think we see any reason to change it we has a nice ring to it from remote learning to entertainment and games to a video call with friends or the grandparents the amount of screen time
