adam smith the incoming chairman of the house armed services committee said trump has the authority to declare an emergency and have the u s military build the wall but that such an action would likely be challenged and would be a bad use of defense spending in this case i think the president would be wide open to a court challenge saying where is the emergency smith said on abc s this week on sunday you have to establish that in order to do this democratic representative adam schiff of california chairman of the house intelligence committee disputed that the president has the power to act on his own look if harry truman couldn t nationalize the steel industry during wartime this president doesn t have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border schiff said of the former president on cnn trump and democrats are at an impasse over the president s demands for 5 6 billion to build a wall which has caused a partial government shutdown that entered its 16th day on sunday while democrats have offered funding for border security house speaker nancy pelosi has called a wall immoral trump is willing to rule out concrete for the wall if that helps reach a deal with democrats acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said if he has to give up a concrete wall replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that democrats can say see he s not building a wall anymore that should help us move in the right direction mulvaney said on nbc s meet the press one of two appearances on sunday morning political shows while the swap of a steel fence for a concrete wall was presented by mulvaney on sunday as a fresh attempt to compromise trump has been tweeting about a steel barrier for weeks and on dec 21 showed a prototype of a tall structure topped by sharp spikes among weeks of contradictory messages after former chief of staff john kelly suggested in an interview with the los angeles times published dec 30 that the idea of a concrete wall had been nixed long ago trump tweeted the next day that an all concrete wall was never abandoned democrats have insisted that trump support reopening the government while the negotiations on the border wall continue they asked on saturday for a formal budget justification for the administration s position to determine what the white house s request on a border wall is said a person familiar with the discussion house democratic leader steny hoyer said sunday on nbc s meet the press that the suggestion of a steel fence versus a concrete wall will be discussed but that we need to open up the government first before talking about it house appropriations committee chairwoman nita lowey on sunday released the text of four appropriations bills to immediately fund key parts of the federal government the house is expected to consider each of the measures this week in an interview on nbc republican senator susan collins of maine called the debate about whether the barrier should be constructed out of concrete or steel bizarre and said she was frustrated that both sides appear to be intransigent collins one of at least three senate republicans who ve called for reopening government while the debate over the wall continues said she d like to see senate majority leader mitch mcconnell bring house passed appropriation bills to the floor but collins said said she understands why it s not happening if democrats won t provide needed votes and trump won t sign the the measures trump said in december that he would take the mantle of shutting down the government over border security and he believes the standoff could be solved in 10 minutes mulvaney said in an appearance on cnn s state of the union on sunday but the white house and congressional democratic negotiators can t even agree on basic facts and democrats are stalling because they think trump is losing the battle over public opinion he said the democrats for better or worse think they are winning this battle politically mulvaney said sunday s negotiating session will follow a two and a half hour meeting saturday between pence senior trump adviser jared kushner homeland security
