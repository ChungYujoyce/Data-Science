to long term success interviews with half a dozen strategists advising potential candidates say the decision about how and when to launch a campaign has evolved rapidly in a changing media and

launched presidential bids several strategists advising candidates who do not hold federal office said their bosses will have to set up some type of federal campaign account like an exploratory committee in order to pay for the beginnings of a campaign political action committees can pay for travel or contribute to candidates in states like iowa and new hampshire but those outsiders do not have the luxury of a federal campaign account like a senator or a member of congress would have to pay for staff polling and the trappings of a more formal campaign advisers to most major candidates say they will wait until after the midterm elections so as not to appear to place their personal interests ahead of the party s interests at a moment when they have a shot at reclaiming control of congress you want to not look like you re doing it until you re ready to say you re doing it said one strategist advising a prominent potential candidate who asked for anonymity because his boss had not made a final decision about running candidates lay significant groundwork before they actually enter the race hiring staff lining up donors and traveling to early nominating states most candidates then and now are running way before they announce that they re running said joe trippi who ran dean s campaign in 2004 the candidates that make the big mistake are the ones that say i m not going to start running until i decide i m running much better to start running until i decide i m not the announcement itself though represents a major moment for a campaign one of the few times when a candidate is completely in control of the story it is also the most opportune time for a candidate to build the most valuable tool in his or her arsenal an email list that can be mined for donations and volunteers everyone is going to seize that moment through content they control in a way that helps them build their list said david wade a longtime adviser to kerry some candidates have used their more formal announcement speeches to deliver a message they hope sets the narrative for the campaign ahead obama s announcement in 2007 on the steps of the illinois state capital in springfield

tower in downtown miami intending to show his roots as the son of cuban immigrants this year candidates are much more likely to make their case on social media in carefully crafted videos aimed at going viral twenty years ago 30 years ago people waited and an announcement itself was a unique opportunity for media attention and that s just completely been turned on its head between social media content that you can control wade said the whole notion of a big formal ceremony is effectively gone candidates are likely to use the midterm elections both to campaign for fellow democrats to show activists they are helping the party and to help spin the election outcome in their own best interests a wave of democratic wins could embolden progressives who would see those results as a ratification of a liberal pushback against president trump a narrower win might provide a platform for a more centrist candidate who can pitch their appeal to rural or moderate voters in key midwestern states the party lost in 2016 are we running form a position of strength or weakness and who do we most need to win over a third adviser to a potential candidate asked we re all waiting for two things to happen one the midterms two the mueller investigation to get some white house scalps the demands of a modern campaign with months on the trail and countless hours on the phone with donors and activists are likely to mean a wave of announcements in the two months between the midterms and the holidays the earlier you go the better the longer you wait it could be very risky you might never get off the ground trippi said view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite 900 washington dc 20006 202 628 8500 tel 202 628 8503 fax the contents of this site are 2020
