resolve details over a potential second summit secretary of state michael pompeo told south korean president moon jae in upon his arrival in seoul that kim had agreed to meet with trump as soon as possible according to a statement from moon s office the south koreans said the u s and north korea discussed establishing formal negotiating groups to set a denuclearization process and work out a time and location for a follow up meeting to the first trump kim summit in june as president trump said there are many steps along the way and we took one of them today pompeo told moon in seoul in remarks that offered only a broad assessment of his talks with kim it was another step forward pompeo had a good meeting with chairman kim today in pyongyang trump said sunday on twitter progress made on singapore summit agreements i look forward to seeing chairman kim again in the near future pompeo and kim refined options for the location and date of their next summit and they agreed to instruct their respective working level teams to meet soon to intensify discussions on the key remaining issues state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement kim also invited inspectors to visit the punggye ri nuclear test site to confirm that it has been irreversibly dismantled nauert said a u s official told reporters traveling with pompeo that the visit to north korea was better than pompeo s fraught previous trip to the north korean capital in july while adding there was a long haul ahead the trip was the latest turn in a diplomatic saga that saw trump and kim threaten each other with nuclear war last year only for them to hold their historic summit in singapore while the leaders signed a vague agreement to work toward complete denuclearization of the korean peninsula the two sides have bickered over the pace and sequence of steps to achieve that goal pompeo s brief visit wasn t expected to resolve critical issues over to get north korea to disarm or make much progress on a peace treaty to formally end the korean war kim s regime has said it wants to focus on more than just its nuclear program and that it expects the u s to show some flexibility with its demands pompeo and kim met for about two hours and then had a 90 minute working lunch starting with this exchange in front of reporters it s a very nice day that promises a good future kim said for both countries pompeo replied so we had a great great visit this morning thank you for hosting president trump sends his regards and we had a very successful morning pompeo landed in pyongyang on sunday morning to meet kim after visiting japanese prime minister shinzo abe on saturday in tokyo pompeo will continue traveling to beijing and then return to washington on monday in a sign of the modest objectives of the trip pompeo told a reporter en route to japan that one of his goals would be to make sure that we understand what each side is truly trying to achieve a comment that signaled the two countries were still a long way off from detailed negotiations on verified disarmament in tokyo pompeo told abe that the u s wanted to work closely on nuclear talks and that he would raise with the north koreans the issue of japanese abductees held for decades by the regime the sunday stop in pyongyang was pompeo s first chance to introduce his special envoy for north korea stephen biegun to leaders there pompeo had hoped to do that in august when he appointed biegun and announced they would travel to the country but trump called off the trip a day later saying north korea hadn t made sufficient progress toward denuclearization it was pompeo s fourth trip to pyongyang and his first visit since july when he spent the night and left with little to show for his journey soon after the secretary of state left the country on his last visit north korea issued a statement lambasting his gangster like demands kim song hye who had accompanied top north korean official kim yong chol on his june white house visit described trump as generous and a leader during staff level discussions in pyongyang she also said she believed the two countries wouldn t be here without trump despite public criticism from analysts that the u s has obtained little on the disarmament front trump and his team point to a lack of nuclear and missile tests since late last year as signs that their strategy is working and at a news conference last month trump claimed that there is more progress behind the scenes than the public recognizes pompeo has said the u s is making the progress we need in recent weeks u s officials have pointed to a recent meeting in pyongyang between kim and moon when north korea committed to dismantling a missile engine testing site and raised the possibility of doing the same at its yongbyon nuclear enrichment facility we continue to make progress on agreements made at singapore summit pompeo tweeted shortly after arriving in seoul contact us at editors time com
