president donald trump set the stage for former special counsel robert mueller s testimony before two house committees wednesday by tweeting eight times about it before mueller even appeared in the hearing room trump s early morning tweets continued lines of criticism he s lobbed at the special counsel investigation since its inception and attempted to discredit mueller before his first lengthy public remarks about his report s findings the investigation which wrapped up in march 2019 found sweeping russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 election it did not conclude that members of the trump campaign had conspired with russia and did not reach a determination on whether trump had obstructed justice mueller largely stuck to short answers before the house judiciary committee offering clipped responses referring members back to the text of his report in the days before the hearings trump had said he wasn t planning to watch or might just watch for a little bit but with no public events on his schedule until after 4 p m the president had plenty of time to tune in he tweeted a quote from fox news coverage of the hearing in the middle of mueller s testimony which seemed to show he was watching trump s tweets wednesday morning contained multiple inaccuracies here s are the facts behind some of the president s tweets the morning of mueller s testimony tweet facts mueller directly refuted this claim during his testimony before the house judiciary committee on collusion mueller explained we did not address collusion which is not a legal term rather we focused on whether the evidence was sufficient to charge any member of the campaign with taking part in a criminal conspiracy it was not on obstruction the text of the report says if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice we would so state based on the facts and the applicable legal standards however we are unable to reach that judgment accordingly while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him in his testimony mueller said the president was not exculpated for the acts that he allegedly committed tweet facts mueller requested that his deputy aaron zebley appear beside him at the hearings as a sworn witness before the house intelligence committee and as an adviser to him during the house judiciary committee hearing aaron zebley was the deputy special counsel and had day to day oversight of the investigations conducted by the office he will accompany special counsel mueller to the wednesday hearings as was discussed with the committees more than a week ago said mueller spokesman jim popkin cnn reports according to a washington post review zebley is not affiliated with a political party and has not donated to political candidates from either party in private practice zebley represented jim cooper who helped hillary clinton set up her private email server that would later be examined in an fbi investigation the washington post reports tweet facts trump has long referred to the prosecutors on mueller s team as angry democrats mueller is a registered republican a washington post review of voter registration information in 2018 found that 13 of the 17 members of mueller s team had previously registered as democrats and four had no affiliation or their affiliation could not be found six members of the team had donated to hillary clinton in his opening statement before the house judiciary committee on july 24 mueller praised his team for conducting the investigation in a fair and independent manner and said they were individuals of the highest integrity tweet facts mueller responded to questions in the july 24 judiciary committee hearing about whether he had conflicts of interest in his role as special counsel mueller acknowledged that he and former fbi director james comey whose firing by trump helped trigger mueller s appointment were business associates and friends but when rep hank johnson d ga said mueller had no conflicts of interest mueller responded correct trump is accurate on the basic timeline of clinton deleting emails after receiving a subpoena according to a washington post fact check of the claim but according to the post clinton s staff had requested the emails be deleted months before they received the subpoena and comey said his investigation did not find evidence that work emails were intentionally deleted in an effort to conceal them tweet facts mueller did meet with trump in 2017 before he was appointed special counsel but former white house strategist steve bannon told investigators that the white house had invited mueller to speak to the president to offer a perspective on the institution of the fbi the special counsel s report says bannon said that although the white house thought about beseeching mueller to become director again he did not come in looking for the job under questioning about this encounter during the hearing mueller confirmed he had met with trump to discuss the position but interjected to clarify that when he spoke to trump that day it was not as a candidate for fbi director i was not applying for the job i was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job mueller said he added that the conversation with trump was about the job but not about me applying for the job write to tessa berenson at tessa berenson time com
