republicans in the state senate voted against that legislation killing a bill that passed the assembly that year legislative leaders said they would try again to pass such protections early next year

control would be split evenly between republicans and democrats evers has said he wants to dismantle the agency and republicans said they hoped he would come to see its value over the next nine months when republicans have control of the board the original bill would have permanently eliminated evers ability to pick the ceo of the jobs agency lawmakers also removed ameasure that would have allowed the legislature to replacekaul the incoming attorney general with private attorneys picked by lawmakers at taxpayer expense other provisions remained that would allow lawmakers to intervene in lawsuits when state statutes are challenged andhire private attorneys when they are sued republicans backed off on some of their changes limiting evers control of state rules but kept in place a
