 by robert farley posted on april 23 2014 a new ad from senate republican leader mitch mcconnell grossly oversells the percentage of kentuckians that mcconnell saved from income tax hikes last year the ad says mcconnell saved 99 percent from obama s tax increases but the actual figure is closer to 1 percent to 2 percent the claim is based on the compromise mcconnell helped to forge to avert the so called fiscal cliff last year as part of the deal bush era tax cuts that were set to expire were permanently extended for individuals making less than 400 000 and couples making less than 450 000 mcconnell estimates the tax increase falls on less than 1 percent of kentuckians but the mcconnell ad suggests obama wanted the income tax rate to rise for everyone when in fact the president only called for allowing the higher tax rates to kick in for individuals making more than 200 000 or couples making more than 250 000 about 2 percent to 3 percent of taxpayers mcconnell and other republicans can credibly claim to have increased the threshold from 200 000 250 000 to 400 000 450 000 but that s all that translates to saving 1 percent to 2 percent of americans from obama tax increases the ad titled conservative leadership which has begun airing statewide on kentucky television emphasizes mcconnell s conservative credentials less than a month before his may 20 primary against a tea party backed candidate matt bevin according to the ad s narrator last year mcconnell saved 99 percent of kentuckians from an income tax increase on screen it states saved 99 of kentuckians from obama s tax increases small print in the ad explains that it is referring to the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 that s the bipartisan compromise that was reached at the 11th hour to avoid the so called fiscal cliff a potent mix of tax hikes and deep spending cuts that were scheduled to kick in at the end of 2012 absent a deal the congressional budget office warned those tax hikes and spending cuts might trigger a recession one of the major sticking points between the parties was the fate of the george w bush era income tax cuts which were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 republicans wanted to permanently extend the tax cuts for everyone and obama wanted to allow them expire for upper income taxpayers obama staked out his position in his 2013 budget proposal which would have allowed the bush tax cuts to expire for individuals making more than 200 000 and couples making more than 250 000 increasing the top tax rate from 35 percent to 39 6 percent that plan was consistent with obama s longstanding campaign promise not to raise taxes on couples making under 250 000 ultimately the two sides reached a compromise on dec 31 2012 and mcconnell was instrumental in helping to write that deal the bill which congress approved on new year s day 2013 permanently extended the bush era tax cuts for individuals making below 400 000 and couples making below 450 000 the bill passed the senate 89 8 and mcconnell was among the 40 republicans who supported it five republicans opposed it but it was also supported by an overwhelming majority of democrats 47 3 mcconnell s ad says he saved 99 percent of kentuckians from an income tax increase and the text on the screen goes one step further and states that mcconnell saved those 99 percent of kentuckians from obama s tax increases according to the mcconnell campaign without the bill all kentuckians would have faced a tax increase and mcconnell s deal saved from tax increases all but those making more than 400 000 the mcconnell campaign points to 2011 irs data for kentucky that breaks down the number of income tax filers into groups based on adjusted gross income the irs income groups don t match up with the legislation so it s not possible to determine with precision the number of taxpayers making more than 400 000 but by making the assumption that a third of those making between 200 000 and 500 000 earn more than 400 000 the mcconnell campaign approximates that a little less than 1 percent of kentuckians saw their income tax rate rise that s a fair approximation saidroberton williams of the tax policy center but again according to obama s plan only individuals making more than 200 000 or couples making more than 250 000 would have seen a tax increase it s hard to find anyone who wanted to raise taxes on everybody williams told us in a phone interview there were a few hard liners but obama was certainly not one of them in other words mcconnell can only credibly claim to have saved from tax increases those kentuckians who earn between 200 000 and 400 000 individuals or between 250 000 and 450 000 couples according to williams obama s plan would have resulted in higher income tax rates for about 2 percent to 3 percent of americans so mcconnell would only have saved from tax increases 1 percent to 2 percent of americans using the kentucky irs data cited by the mcconnell campaign and making the same assumptions it did we found the compromise plan saved a little more than 1 percent of kentuckians from obama s tax increases any way you slice it that s a far cry from mcconnell s 99 percent boast robert farley q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
