earlier this year senior white house staff were briefing president trump on plans to host the g7 summit in the u s when he piped up with a suggestion for the location to host the leaders of the six other major advanced economies what about doral trump said raising the name of his florida resort that is reportedly facing declines in revenue according to a description of the meeting given by white house chief of staff mick mulvaney now the white house has concluded that the trump national doral miami golf resort is the best place in the country to hold the annual summit which brings together leaders from canada france germany italy japan the united kingdom and the united states it s not the only place it s the best place for the meetings mulvaney told reporters at the white house on thursday there are limitations at other places the white house considered twelve other resorts around the country mulvaney said and concluded that doral was far and away the best choice mulvaney said it would be millions of dollars cheaper to hold the summit at doral over other locations doral will host summit at cost he said but it is unclear how the public will be able to assess that as the white house s internal analysis will not be disclosed mulvaney cited the physical layout of the resort with separate buildings that could hold each country s delegation as a major factor in the white house deciding to host the event there he said that the white house didn t pick the resort because it may lead to future business that could enrich trump consider the possibility that donald trump s brand is strong enough as it is mulvaney said it is the most recognizable name in the english language and probably in the world trump has denied he is trying to profit from his time in office repeatedly saying without evidence he s losing billions of dollars while serving in the white house but trump has kept his finances opaque compared to past presidents and has refused to release his tax returns so it is difficult to check his assertions democrats have raised concerns that trump has used his office to drive revenue to his businesses pointing to hotel stays by foreign delegations at the trump international hotel washington as well as the publicity that follows when trump regularly plays golf at trump national golf club in sterling va his golf club in bedminster n j and his winter weekends at his mar a lago club in palm beach fla the top democrat on the house judiciary committee jerrold nadler said the committee will investigate the white house decision to hold the g7 at doral and whether trump is using his office and making official u s government decisions for his personal financial gain such transactions could violate the emoluments clause of the constitution the doral decision reflects perhaps the first publicly known instance in which foreign governments would be required to pay president trump s private businesses in order to conduct business with the united states nadler said in a statement on aug 28 after trump publicly said he wanted the summit held at his resort contact us at editors time com
