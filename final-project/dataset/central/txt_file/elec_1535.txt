 sep 4 2019 at 1 54 pm a fivethirtyeight chat filed under 2020 election welcome to a special edition of fivethirtyeight s weekly politics chat the transcript below has been lightly edited sarahf sarah frostenson politics editor last monday federal election commission vice chairman matthew petersen announced his resignation leaving the fec effectively shut down as only three positions on the six seat committee are currently filled and the agency is legally required to have four commissioners to be fully operational what this means is that the agency responsible for both enforcing and advising on the nation s campaign finance laws is out of commission for the foreseeable future and because we re in the middle of a presidential election things could get hairy fast the fec has said that it will soldier on continuing to process filings and other reports and has called on president trump to nominate new commissioners and for the senate to confirm them quickly but congress is still in recess and trump has yet to move forward with appointing new commissioners remember there are now three vacancies so here with us today to unpack what this could mean for the 2020 election and campaign finance in general is dave levinthal editor and senior reporter at the center for public integrity welcome dave levinthal my pleasure thanks for having me sarahf so first of all how did we get to the point that the fec is basically not operational and just how big of a deal is this for the fec dave levinthal you can trace the situation back to 2008 the last time the fec found itself in semi shutdown mode because it lacked enough commissioners to legally conduct high level business that year the fec went about six months without a quorum of commissioners until the senate and president bush finally struck a deal to appoint new commissioners and get the agency back on track clare malone clare malone senior political writer and by high level business we mean things like opening investigations into possible campaign finance violations dave levinthal high level business would absolutely include investigating allegations of campaign finance violations as i wrote last week for now the fec can t conduct meetings it can t slap political scofflaws with fines it can t make rules it can t conduct audits and approve them sarahf so what can the fec do in its current situation dave levinthal the most notable thing the fec will continue to do is carry out its transparency function that means that political committees political candidates and so on must still file their periodic campaign finance disclosures with the fec documents that tell the public how much money they ve raised spent etc and the fec staff will still review and post that material but if some political committee screws this up or for that matter acts in a manner that s potentially in violation of federal campaign finance laws they more or less get a temporary pass because the fec commissioners don t have the power for now to do anything about it clare malone cool i was interested to learn that there s been a lot of discord on the commission for a while a democrat and an independent on the committee were apparently irritated that certain investigations they deemed worthy weren t being looked into because the republican members kept things from moving forward so in some ways it sounds like this is the continuation of an already contentious situation at the fec nrakich nathaniel rakich elections analyst and dave without enforcement mechanisms there would be no punishment if a campaign does violate campaign finance laws right dave levinthal generally speaking the fec s law enforcement capabilities are on ice until the senate approves at least one more nominee to serve on the fec right now trump has nominated one commissioner a texas attorney named trey trainor who helped stop an anti trump movement at the 2016 gop convention who he first nominated in september 2017 but the senate has yet to give trainor a confirmation hearing much less going forth and confirming him clare malone so why no hearing i haven t really seen an explanation for that in everything i ve been reading dave levinthal a complex question my best crack at it there s been a tradition often adhered to but not always that the president would nominate fec commissioners in pairs one republican one democrat but since president trump has only offered one nominee the senate has chosen not to give that lone nominee a hearing could it sure did it need to not really until now because the fec has had enough commissioners to at least conduct its high level business nrakich i find it interesting that in an age where the senate has gotten more comfortable with consolidating power within one party eliminating filibusters for presidents nominees blocking merrick garland s confirmation to the supreme court etc that this norm of nominating one democrat and one republican simultaneously to the fec has persisted dave levinthal numbers at the fec commission level have been going the wrong way since the beginning of the trump presidency in march 2017 democratic commissioner ann ravel resigned and in february 2018 republican commissioner lee goodman also resigned that means the fec has been operating with a bare minimum four commissioners for 1 5 years president trump could have nominated people filled those vacancies at any time but he didn t clare malone whew dave champion explanation nrakich not to be too cynical but in practical terms how much of an effect does this shutdown really have the fec s enforcement mechanisms are already pretty toothless and can take years to be resolved anyway for example earlier this summer now sen martha mcsally was fined for campaign finance violations she made in 2014 she has served two full terms in the house since then and despite breaking the rules by taking 319 000 in excess contributions she was fined only 23 000 so there was no financial disincentive clare malone right and we didn t learn about trump s campaign finance violations until well after 2016 so there does seem to be a long lag time on this stuff dave levinthal i ve heard from more than a few folks who ve made that very point that the fec is already so dysfunctional that there won t be much difference but even if the fec deadlocks on investigations even if it s unable to make affirmative rulings on whether someone broke the law and this is often the case at minimum these situations receive a full public airing for instance if special interest groups or others vehemently disagree with an fec ruling they ll sue the organization think of all the big court cases that have fec in their names with citizens united v fec the biggest among them without a functioning fec this process grinds to a halt for all intents and purposes clare malone got it so the shutdown is really affecting the transparency of the fec nrakich i find it interesting though that voters don t seem to care too much about campaign finance violations there s some research suggesting that they don t do as much as say sex scandals probably for obvious reasons they re much drier to hurt candidates at the ballot box and i assume that most candidates will continue filing disclosure reports even if the fec is shut down at the filing deadline but what if they don t would they really suffer any consequences with voters i m not sure they would and that s scary to me clare malone i think that s in part because it s so much a part of american political culture and the culture at large to see big money and politics as linked there s a perception that there s a degree of unfettered spending going on dave levinthal while the fec doesn t have a quorum if a political committee wanted to stop filing campaign finance reports or otherwise violate campaign finance rules the fec would not be in any position to do something about it now the fec may very well pick up the matter once it s in business again but for now political committees don t really have anyone policing their activity in a way that would lead to some immediate penalty said another way the cops are at the station they re doing paperwork but they re not answering emergency calls sarahf so given how critical the situation is won t one of congress s first orders of business be appointing the one commissioner trump has already nominated to get the fec back up and running dave levinthal actually sarah i don t think there is a reason to think that congress will make the fec its first order of business that s not to say that the senate won t act quickly but this is largely in the hands of majority leader mitch mcconnell and to a lesser extent minority leader chuck schumer also president trump plays a major role here he could theoretically nominate a full slate of new commissioners he could clean house float six new nominees but presidents have largely missed opportunities to proactively replace fec commissioners the result the remaining commissioners continued to serve in holdover status serving even though their term has expired sarahf dave levinthal bottom line if trump wanted to defy political convention something he s not exactly shy about doing he could nominate six new commissioners of his choosing legally he can t pack the committee with republicans no more than three commissioners can be of the same party but he doesn t have to nominate democrats he could theoretically nominate three republicans and three libertarians or independents nrakich right i feel like that would be well within character but also i feel like trump doesn t spend a lot of time thinking about the fec sarahf or any president it sounds like so if you re petersen why resign now knowing it would throw the fec into chaos was his resignation a surprise dave levinthal no petersen almost left in late 2017 when trump nominated him for a federal district judgeship but petersen flamed out of the judicial job when he was unable to answer a string of basic questions at his nomination hearing and he withdrew himself from consideration shortly thereafter his consolation prize he continued to serve on the fec at the time december 2017 cpi wrote that even then it seemed like the fec had a strong possibility of losing its quorum of commissioners so it s not as if this problem somehow snuck up on people nrakich yeah i keep coming back to the fact that the public doesn t seem to care about campaign finance it s a big problem imo since this is one of the main mechanisms by which we keep candidates accountable clare malone well very few people ever end up serving jail time for these violations for instance and unlike a sex scandal a lot of people will be bored reading about campaign finance violations dave levinthal but there are some money in politics sex scandals cough stormy daniels cough and the fec plays a role in those or could nrakich right and there are some types of campaign finance scandals like when politicians for example california rep duncan hunter use campaign money for their personal benefit that i think appeal to voters instinct against politicians abusing their office but i think that s different from say mcsally s case where her only crime was accepting more than the legal limit in donations i fear americans see the latter as just violations of arbitrary bureaucratic rules rather than as an immoral act clare malone well not everyone sees breaking the law on certain things as a moral violation the law doesn t necessarily equate with morality lots of people might think the ends big money justify the means they might not think that the moral universe extends to bureaucratic violations dave levinthal great point clare and yes there are wide swings in opinion on whether the stormy daniels matter is a campaign law violation in the first place michael cohen certainly has some thoughts on this clare malone what about for media watchdog organizations like cpi and open secrets though dave how will your work potentially change because of this dave levinthal our job is to report about the role money plays in american politics and while most people often don t care about the legal or technical particulars of campaign finance law i ve never gotten the sense that they don t care about campaign money especially in the context of their favorite candidates raising cash there are tens of thousands of people every day who make campaign contributions millions every year the sophistication of political fundraising has made it as easy as ever to support a candidate or cause that s why for example you see presidential candidates president trump and the gaggle of democrats raising huge amounts of money from small dollar donors nrakich right and voters do seem to care about the source of the money candidates raise for example every democratic presidential candidate has pledged not to accept money from corporate pacs and most have pledged not to accept money from the fossil fuel industry or federal lobbyists they wouldn t be doing that if they didn t think voters cared about those issues clare malone have we seen any irregularities from any of these democratic candidates or from the trump campaign this time around dave levinthal no but the fec also won t be in a position to address some novel questions about how political candidates should act for example lots of cities have sent the trump campaign bills for police and public safety costs related to trump campaign rallies that they believe the campaign should pay the trump campaign doesn t acknowledge these bills and doesn t list them as debt or even disputed debt on campaign finance reports it d be the fec s job ostensibly to figure this situation out it can t now clare malone oh that s really fascinating nyc certainly saw a lot of controversy over the cost of trump tower security right after his election in 2016 sarahf so to wrap it sounds like as long as the fec can still perform some of its basic functions like getting candidates to file their reports we might not see petersen s replacement for a while right where does this political fight head next clare malone i guess nowhere dave is certainly the expert on this but i don t think there s much political will to replace the fec positions and i say that mostly from the point of view of public pressure there s no incentive to change the course of behavior toward the fec nrakich as dave said earlier president bush and congress did finally reach a deal in 2008 the last time the fec went into limbo because it didn t have enough members but i agree with clare i think this is so far down on the to do list for both trump and mcconnell maybe the fec becomes a poor man s merrick garland no action until one party regains full control of government dave levinthal i talked last week with rep derek kilmer a democrat from washington about the broader issue of the fec s role in government and politics and he made the case that the fec needs to be fundamentally reformed and given greater independence and strength he even has a bill that would make the fec a five commissioner body which would address the issue of deadlocked votes the bill isn t going anywhere but his hope is that democrats will win everything in november 2020 and come 2021 the fec will be reformed so i d say keep a close watch on schumer in the senate if he wants to make a big stink about this he could but he too has been pretty quiet about the fec lately i will also be curious to see if this comes up during the presidential debate next week since several candidates have been very anti citizens united and anti big money in their campaign rhetoric nrakich yeah steve bullock presented campaign finance as his big issue when he launched his campaign but in general i ve felt that the candidates have not done a good job sticking to what was supposed to be their signature issue eric swalwell and guns jay inslee and climate change etc dave levinthal even though bullock has made it his signature issue he s had his own little bumps in the road clare malone gillibrand also made public funding a thing if i recall that did not catch on nrakich that said if the fec is shut down for a full year or more say through the 2020 election i bet there will be more of an appetite to reform it come 2021 if democrats are in charge just speculating but i think an fec shutdown might be the kind of thing that gets more noticeable with time dave levinthal an fec that effectively sat out the 2020 election would be monumental it d take us back to a pre watergate era of campaign finance regulation in certain ways the fec was created after watergate to help defend against campaign money problems irregularities and potential lawlessness in fact i d say it d be the most incentive congress has probably had since watergate to fundamentally change the nation s campaign finance regulation regime sarah frostenson is fivethirtyeight s politics editor sfrostenson clare malone is a senior political writer for
