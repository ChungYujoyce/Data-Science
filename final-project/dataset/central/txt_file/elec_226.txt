article looking into allegations made against biden by tara reade who says the then senator sexually assaulted her when she worked as a biden senate staffer the times found no pattern of sexual misconduct by mr biden beyond the hugs kisses and touching that women previously said made them uncomfortable read the original passage in a sunday story before it was removed times executive editor dean baquet told the news organization s media columnist ben smith that the edit was made because the biden campaign argued the phrasing made it appear that other women had made similar accusations against biden the biden campaign thought that the phrasing was awkward and made it look like there were other instances in which he had been accused of sexual misconduct baquet told smith smith then pressed baquet on why the times didn t acknowledge the change in an editor s note to readers we didn t think it was a factual mistake i thought it was an awkward phrasing issue that could be read different ways and that it wasn t something factual we were correcting baquet said smith also raised questions about whether biden was being treated differently in the times coverage than supreme

paper wrote about kavanaugh accuser julie swetnick s allegations the same day they were made without any independent corroboration while the times waited 19 days before publishing a piece on reade s accusations kavanaugh was already in a public forum in a large way answered baquet who argued claims against the then nominee were already in the public forum if you ask the average person in america

great to see ben doing this stuff https t co tmji5p4d84 good for bensmith for asking dean baquet why the nyt covered an accusation against kavanaugh far more aggressively than an accusation against
