joe biden insists he has a path to the presidential nomination others are having trouble seeing it the former vice presidentwas the field s front runner until voters started casting ballots a disappointing fourth place finish in the opening iowa caucuses last week was followed by a disastrous fifth place finish in the new hampshire primary tuesday the collapse of his support into single digits will not only make raising money and rallying supporters more difficult it also raises questions about whether his campaign can survive until the super tuesday conteststhree weeks away it ain t over man we re just getting started biden told a campaign crowd in charleston south carolina where he headed instead of staying in new hampshire he struck a deliberately upbeat tone emphasizing his commitment to african american and latino concerns and noting the lack of racial diversity in the two states that have voted where i come from that s the opening bell not the closing bell and the fight to end donald trump s presidency is just beginning just beginning that said if biden doesn t score a convincing win in the south carolina primary feb 29 not impossiblebut a challenge his third bid for the presidency could be effectively over and with it a career in elective office that spanned six decades i ll probably take a hit here biden faces big test in new hampshire vermont sen bernie sanders was riding high after carrying the popular vote in iowa although not the delegate count and winning new hampshire although with a smaller margin than his landslide over hillary clinton four years ago former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg was a solid second and minnesota sen amy klobuchar parlayed a strong showing in the candidate debates into a surprising third place finish massachusetts sen elizabeth warren was a distant fourth and biden finished even lower in modern times no candidate in either party has been nominated for president after a start as faltering as that all but one of the nominees won either in iowa or new hampshire the exception was in 1992 when iowa wasn t contested and bill clinton sold his second place finish in new hampshire as a victory bythe comeback kid this time biden s calculation is that the democratic race is so unsettled and sanders a self described democratic socialist would be such a risky nominee that history s lessons won t apply registered to vote check your status here a month ago he led the field in new hampshire according to the realclearpolitics average of statewide polls that standing evaporated not because of a spectacular mistake but because of a mediocre campaign overtaken by newer candidates with greater vigor the relentless attacks by president donald trump on biden and his sonhunteron unproven allegations of corrupt behavior in ukrainedidn t help biden s transactional appeal to voters once his strength is his vulnerability from the start the fundamental premise of biden s campaign has been that he was the mostelectable candidate best able to defeat trump in november the problem is that the way to demonstrate electability is to win and he hasn t at least not yet the early losses have eroded confidence in the bargain he offered before the iowa caucuses 44 of those surveyed in a national quinnipiac university poll said biden had the best chance of beating trump in a poll released monday that number plummeted to 27 only a bit higher than sanders at 24 whenbiden spied two little boys squirming in the front row at a rally in downtown manchester he walked over with his handheld microphone to ask their names and hold out the promise of ice cream after the politics was done one boy said his name was keith the other beau biden looked taken aback for an instant and the crowd of several hundred people seemed to hold its collective breath then he said quietly i have a beau too and moved back to center stage just about everybody in the rex theater knew that the death of beau bidenin 2015 from a malignant brain tumor prevented his grieving father from running for the democratic presidential nomination in 2016 four years later joe biden s bid for the white house has taken on almost an elegiac air he has been dubbed uncle joe a nickname that suggests familiarity and perhaps eye rolling exasperation voters say they like him and respect his service but some see him as a figure from a different era shaped by the politics of the past it just seems his time has passed said camille brown 62 of nashua new hampshire the director of admissions at a community college who attended a candidate forum in concord it s time to pass the mantle thank you foryour service her husband barry 61 said praisebut with a sharpened point who s running for president an interactive guideto the candidates candidates on the issues voter s guide to where they stand on health care gun control and more biden was 29 years old when he was elected to the u s senate from delaware in 1972 for the first of six terms now he is 77 in good health but looking his age he does fewer campaign events on an average day than sanders who is 78 and he doesn t display the fist pumping energy of warren who is 70 klobuchar is 59 and buttigieg just turned 38 younger than any of biden s children john lynch a former four term new hampshire governor and biden supporter said he was surprised by biden s decline and acknowledged buttigieg s appeal he s a new faceand not from washington lynch said as he waited for biden to arrive at the manchester rally oftentimes people are attracted to somebody new facing the prospectof a bad night in new hampshire biden decided to get out of town ditching announced plans to attend a victory party in nashua and heading to south carolina for an event featuring rep cedric richmond d la co chairman of his campaign friday and saturday biden is scheduled to campaign in nevada which will holdits caucuses feb 22 biden s strategists have long described the south carolina primary as his firewall noting his strength among more racially diverse electorates but the dynamics from one contest ripple through the others just ask hillary clinton who saw her lead in south carolina evaporateonce barack obama won in iowa in 2008 she ended up being swamped in the state s primary the most worrisome trend for biden in the poll may have been the slide in his support amongblack voters although the sample size was small biden s standing with african americans dropped to 27 from 49 in a poll last month former new york mayor mike bloomberg was close behind at 22 and sanders was at 19 biden s appeal to black voters has been based in part on his association with obama but he isn t the only candidate touting his ties to the last democratic president warren aired an ad that shows obama praising her work on consumer protection issues and bloomberg runs a spot that shows obama praising him for pragmatic solutions on education and gun violence after south carolina s primary on the last saturday of the month the calendar is unforgiving three days later is super tuesday a behemoth of a primary day with contests in california and texas and a dozen other states by then the campaign imperative shifts from greeting voters at diners to spending millions of dollars to air tv ads let s vote when are the 2020 presidential election primaries millions of dollars is what bloomberg has the billionaire is willing to invest an unprecedented amount of his own fortune in the campaign he has outspent the rest of the field combined the republican turned democrat skipped the first four contests planning to jump in on super tuesday march 3 he pitches himself as a pragmatic centrist as does biden and his strategy counts on biden stumbling out of the way at the moment that seems like a reasonable bet
