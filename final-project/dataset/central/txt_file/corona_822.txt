nothing is the same for college students thanks to the coronavirus most have moved out of dorms their classes have moved online labs and performing arts classes now bear little resemblance to normal but one thing hasn t changed at least at some colleges they re still being graded a chorus of students fromacross the country is lobbying schoolsto stop grading on a traditional letter scalethis semester instead studentsare asking for a pass or fail system it s hard enough to manage the major disruptions caused by covid 19 without having to worry about grades they argue moving to online classes brings its own difficulties too as some subjects typically require in person hands on elements that don t translate well to video how online college classes are going a rapping professor a cat in class pornography on zoom college during coronavirus pass fail grading allows students to receive either a p for pass or f for fail instead of a standard a f letter grade students in favor of this grading option say it helps ensure they learn the required material sufficiently without adding in the pressure of letter grades their efforts have gained traction in some states in florida three large state universities announced march 24 that they would switch to pass fail gradingin response to student petitions the university of wisconsin madison declared march 26that the unprecedented situation called for a pass fail grading option allowing the option means other academic policies may have to adjust too the school said maintaining instruction and the quality of academics is and has been our most important campus goal short of preserving the health and safety of our community the university said recognizing that our lives have been significantly impacted by covid 19 our grading and credit policies must adapt but so far efforts by some students haven t succeeded in convincing administrators some colleges have made small concessions the university of arizona is allowing students to request pass fail grading from professors the argument in favor of pass fail grading focuses on how students from more privileged backgrounds likely will fare better in the coronavirus era environment of online courses and staying at home all students have to weather the pandemic but some have lost their income and their parents have lost income some don t have family safety nets to fall back on some are struggling to find a safe place to stay or healthy food to eat some are getting sick or their family members are some don t have reliable internet access the fair move is to take grades off the table for now advocates say the students that may be subject to homes in which they don t have decent internet access or they re concerned about their parents and very anxious about what s going to be happening for the rest of the world those are the students that are going to be very very disenfranchised said alejandro urbina a 19 year old sophomore honors student studying aerospace engineering at arizona state university who is lobbying for pass fail and there are many more of them than there are students that might not get their 4 0 everything at colleges has changed after colleges scrambled to respond to coronavirus their very existence is in jeopardy in an emailedresponse to urbina vice provost frederick corey explained that asu has more technology and experience for working online than other universities he said grades are important to students employers and graduate programs it wouldn t be fair to high achieving students to institute pass fail options corey wrote to award everyone performing at a b c or d levels a grade of passing is unfair to those who excel in their classes and could ultimately be a significant disservice to students with high aspirations for graduate school law school medical school or other endeavors where grades play an important role in competitive admissions corey s email to urbina said but at the university of arizona administrators are now allowing students to change a course to pass fail if they want an individual student can ask for a class to be counted as pass fail for them up until the last day of classes an email to students from provostliesl folks states ivy league schools the country s most elite institutions have largely put some type of alternative grading in place either as an option or
