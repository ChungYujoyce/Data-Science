washington president obama declared donald trump unfit for office on tuesday callingon republicans to distance themselves from their party s presidential nominee yes i think the republican nominee is unfit to serve as president obama said tuesday at a press conference with the prime minister of singapore i said so last week and he keeps on proving it the notion that he would attack a gold star family that hasmade suchextraordinary sacrifices on behalf of our country the fact that he doesn t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues in europe in the middle east in asia means that he s woefully unprepared to do this job the trump khan feud how we got here obama lauded gold star families in a speech to disabled veterans on monday although he did not mentiontrump by name then his remarks were clearly understood as a response to trump s ongoing feud with khizr khan whose son was killed in theiraq warin 2004 and who denounced trump at the democratic national convention last week obama s comments tuesdaywere more specific but delivered in a more dispassionate tone than his own convention speech endorsing trump s democratic rival hillary clinton in that speech obama argued that trump s own convention wasn t particularly republican and it sure wasn t conservative on tuesday he took that argument a step further saying republican denunciations of trump s more bombastic statements ring hollow from gop leaders who continue to support his candidacy notably house speaker paul ryan senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and arizona sen john mccain republican rep richard hanna backs clinton the question i think they have to ask themselves is if you are repeatedly having to say in very strong terms that what he has said is unacceptable why are you still endorsing him obama said what does this say about your party that this is your standard bearer this isn ta situation where you have an episodic gaffe this is daily and weekly where they are distancing themselves from statements he is making obama said it s not an argument he would have made about his former rivals i think i was right and mitt romney and john mccain were wrong on certain policy issues but i never thought that they couldn t do the job trump responded with an e mailed statement on obama s failed leadership saying obama and clinton destabilized the middle east handed iraq libya and syria to isis and allowed our personnel to be slaughtered at benghazi the president s remarks on trump were also notable in that they came during a joint press conference with a foreign leader singapore prime ministerlee hsien loong obama meeting with singapore s prime minister focuses on trade and terror for his part lee largely demurred about a question about u s politics saying i don t think this is the right forum or indeed there is any right forum for me to talk about u s politics in public at this moment but he did say the relationship between the two countries would likely continue after the elections in a calmer cooler atmosphere positions are rethought strategies are nuanced and a certain balance is kept in the direction of the ship of state it does not turn completely upside down he said the americans take pride in having a system with checks and balances so it is not so easy to do things but it is not so easy to completely messthings up lee said we admire that and sometimes we depend upon that he s absolutely right obama replied smiling the wisdom of our founders
