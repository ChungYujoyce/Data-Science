hungry reuters manaure quintero venezuela and china agreed to hundreds of projects to kickstart growth in the south american country after billions in investments however little materialized a 200 million rice plant illustrates the graft and incompetence that opponents say crippled development by venezuela s leftist regime by angus berwick filed may 7 2019 noon gmt en espa ol tucupita venezuela the project was meant to feed millions in delta amacuro a remote venezuelan state on the caribbean sea a chinese construction giant struck a bold agreement with the late president hugo ch vez the state run firm would build new bridges and roads a food laboratory and the largest rice processing plant in latin america the 2010 pact with china camc engineering co ltd would develop rice paddies twice the size of manhattan and create jobs for the area s 110 000 residents according to a copy of the contract seen by reuters the underdeveloped state was an ideal locale to demonstrate the socialist venezuelan government s commitment to empower the poor and the deal would show how ch vez and his eventual hand picked successor president nicol s maduro could work with china and other allies to develop areas beyond venezuela s bounteous oil beds rice power agricultural power ch vez tweeted at the time nine years later locals are hungry few jobs have materialized and the plant is only half built running at less than one percent its projected output it hasn t yielded a single grain of locally grown rice according to a dozen people involved in or familiar with the development yet camc and a select few venezuelan partners prospered venezuela paid camc at least 100 million for the stalled development according to project contracts and sealed court documents from an investigation by prosecutors in europe the thousands of pages of court papers reviewed by reuters were filed in andorra the european principality where prosecutors allege venezuelans involved in the project sought to launder kickbacks paid to them for helping secure the contract the material on the china deal reported here for the first time includes confidential testimony wiretap transcripts bank records and other documents last september an andorran high court judge alleged in an indictment that camc paid over 100 million in bribes to various venezuelan intermediaries to secure the rice

under investigation according to the documents the indictment the names of those charged and their association with chinese companies were reported last year by el pa s the spanish newspaper a reuters review of the case files which are still under seal in andorra gleans how camc and other chinese companies forged ties with many of those charged and paid to win projects the companies often didn t complete the result according to prosecutors was a far reaching culture of kickbacks paid through offshore accounts in which well connected venezuelan intermediaries milked and ultimately crippled projects that were meant to develop neglected corners of the country among other findings reported here for the first time camc agreed to at least five agricultural projects in venezuela valued at about 3 billion that it never completed the company according to contracts and project documents reviewed by reuters received at least half the value of the 200 million contract for the rice project and at least 40 percent of the contract value for the other four developments a combined total of at least 1 4 billion for work it never finished camc paid over 100 million in fees to intermediaries prosecutors say those payments were kickbacks that helped the company win contracts in venezuela neither camc nor any of its executives were charged in the indictment in a statement the beijing based company told reuters the details and assertions in the case files include a large number of inaccuracies but didn t elaborate the company didn t respond to requests to speak with camc executives mentioned in the documents reuters couldn t reach those executives independently our company operates in venezuela in adherence to the idea of integrity and strives to complete every construction project with the best technology and management the statement said china s foreign ministry in a statement to reuters said reports about alleged bribery by chinese companies in venezuela obviously distorted and exaggerated facts with a hidden agenda it didn t specify to what agenda it was referring cooperation between the two countries will continue the statement read based on equal mutually beneficial and commercial principles venezuela s information ministry responsible for government communications and oil giant pdvsa a partner in many of the contracts cited in the court case didn t respond to reuters inquiries it isn t clear when any of those charged could face trial enric gimenez a lawyer in andorra for salazar the venezuelan who prosecutors say brokered many of the contracts told reuters his client is innocent of the charges there the leftist regime founded by ch vez and now led by maduro is facing its most serious threat yet opposition lawmakers with the support of most western democracies say maduro s re election last year was illegal and that juan guaid head of the national assembly is the country s rightful leader last week in a failed uprising guaid unsuccessfully sought to rally venezuela s military the lynchpin of support for the unpopular government against maduro the political crisis was prompted by an economic meltdown of hyperinflation mass unemployment and an exodus of desperate citizens venezuelans suffer regular shortages of food power and water basics that were meant to improve through projects like the one in delta amacuro the dire scarcities and dysfunctional projects the opposition alleges illustrate how corruption and crony capitalism helped impoverish the once prosperous country and many of its 30 million people after an ambitious 2007 agreement between china and venezuela chinese companies were announced as partners in billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and other projects since then china invested over 50 billion in venezuela mostly in the form of oil for loan agreements government figures show in a 2017 speech maduro said 790 projects with chinese companies had been contracted in sectors ranging from oil to housing to telecommunications of those he said 495 were complete some developments have stalled because of graft people familiar with the projects said others were derailed by incompetence and a lack of supervision related content how zte helps venezuela create china style social control oil output goes awol in venezuela as soldiers run pdvsa in delta amacuro even government officials say a mixture of both ruined the rice project the government abandoned it says victor meza state coordinator for venezuela s rural development agency which worked with camc everything was lost everything was stolen prosecutors in andorra where secretive banking laws long made it a tax haven launched their investigation into venezuelan laundering amid a broader effort to clean up the local financial sector the indictment is part of a much larger case in which the prosecutors allege venezuelan officials between 2009 and 2014 received more than 2 billion worth of illegal commissions from contractors state companies and other sources often for enabling transactions with the government the payments the indictment alleges passed through accounts held at banca privada d andorra a local bank known as bpa andorra s government after the united states accused bpa of money laundering took over the bank in 2015 courts there since then have charged 25 former bpa employees with money laundering in a series of cases including the one probing the venezuela contracts a spokeswoman for andorra s government declined to comment for this article in addition to the agricultural projects by camc the andorrans examined two power plant projects by the company and four other power plants built by sinohydro corp another state owned chinese engineering firm none of those plants ever became fully operational leaving towns near them subject to regular blackouts sinohydro wasn t charged in the indictment the company didn t respond to calls emails and faxes seeking comment during a recent

consulting firm he operated in caracas the firm inverdt was owned by a panama based holding company he had established called highland assets according to testimony salazar gave investigators in andorra when they first began probing his bpa account from an office a few blocks from pdvsa headquarters he met often with ram rez and other top officials according to people familiar with his activities ram rez left the ministry in 2014 and was venezuela s ambassador to the united nations until 2017 since then maduro has publicly accused him of unspecified corruption but ram rez wasn t indicted in andorra and hasn t formally been charged with any crime in venezuela he now lives abroad as an opponent of the government ram rez didn t respond to reuters emails seeking comment and couldn t be reached otherwise at the time of the ceremony with xi ch vez was making pdvsa a hub for a growing array of developments many of them unrelated to oil a newly created unit known as pdvsa

development bank were awarded by 2010 the filings say the bank had received 32 billion from the china development bank and another 6 billion from an infrastructure fund created by ch vez china development bank didn t respond to reuters requests for comment salazar began reaching out to chinese executives offering his services as a well connected consultant to help broker business in venezuela he traveled to china monthly and began paying venezuelan officials there to forge ties with companies including camc my work was to convince them through meetings trips and promotion to sign contracts salazar told andorran investigators people familiar with the case said salazar and his alleged associates before the indictment agreed to testify in andorra because they hoped to clear their names in his testimony salazar told the andorran investigators he chose bpa as an offshore bank because he knew other wealthy venezuelans had done so nestled in a quiet valley of the pyrenees bpa had a reputation as a discrete money manager for clients from high risk countries after andorra submitted information requests for its case to caracas a venezuelan court in 2017 ordered salazar arrested on suspicion of corruption money laundering and conspiracy citing the andorran probe the venezuelan arrest order said salazar sought to give legal appearance to funds originating from numerous contracts with venezuelan state institutions a trial date hasn t been set and salazar remains jailed in caracas a lawyer for salazar in venezuela denied the charges before the court gimenez salazar s lawyer in andorra in an email to reuters said chinese authorities decided which companies would receive funds and that neither salazar nor his alleged intermediaries could sway that inverdt salazar s consulting firm offered professional and technical services to many chinese companies gimenez wrote in the email and that only a handful of those companies were chosen to carry out works one of salazar s intermediaries the indictment alleged was francisco jim nez a career engineer who was pdvsa s envoy in beijing and who the andorrans indicted along with salazar salazar first contacted him during a trip to china in 2010 according to testimony jim nez gave in andorra that march jim nez signed a strategic alliance with salazar to promote inverdt in china under the terms of their contract reviewed by reuters salazar agreed to pay jim nez 7 38 million in a bpa account that inverdt helped open bank records in the case files show jim nez later received another 7 million jim nez who now lives in panama didn t respond to phone calls or text messages from reuters salvador capdevila his lawyer in andorra declined to comment another official who prosecutors say helped salazar was roc o maneiro venezuela s ambassador to china and now the country s ambassador to britain maneiro wasn t charged in the andorran indictment numerous court documents including a filing by prosecutors in relation to her testimony refer to her as under investigation for payments they say she received from salazar and for her alleged role helping him make contacts with chinese companies in 2010 bank records contained in the court documents show salazar made a transfer of 30 000 to a chinese account in her name citing services provided by mrs maneiro later salazar made deposits totaling 13 million into a bpa account owned by a panama based company that maneiro in a disclosure document linked to the account said belonged to her an internal report from bpa s anti money laundering committee reviewed by reuters also listed maneiro as its owner maneiro through a lawyer and in a text message to reuters denied helping salazar and receiving payments from him those are assertions with no basis she wrote in the message she told an andorran judge that the signature on the form about the panamanian company is forged the court has ordered an analysis of the signature a briefcase full of contracts by early 2010 salazar s outreach bore fruit sinohydro the engineering firm that march signed a 316 million contract with pdvsa to build a power plant near the city of maracay in the contract sinohydro agreed to pay salazar a 10 percent fee for helping it gain a favourable and positive position to pursue the contract bank records in the case files show the company paid 49 million into salazar s bpa account and another 72 million after sinohydro secured additional power plant contracts from pdvsa sinohydro eventually built four plants but none met full contract specifications engineers say the plant near maracay for example was meant to generate as much as 382 megawatts the contract shows instead the plant is producing no more than 140 megawatts according to jos aguilar a former director at venezuela s state power company soon salazar s company was earning over 100 million a year according to testimony by him and several aides he had a briefcase full of contracts luis mariano rodr guez a salazar deputy also charged in the indictment told andorran investigators we made deals with every company possible he added some of these companies never actually carried out the
