 feb 4 2020 at 6 12 am by nate silver filed under 2020 election carolyn van houten the washington post via getty images in trying to build a forecast model of the democratic primaries we literally had to think about the entire process from start iowa to finish the virgin islands on june 6 actually we had to do more than that since the nomination process is sequential states vote one at a time rather than all at once we had to determine empirically how much the results of one state can affect the rest the answer in the case of iowa is that it matters a lot despite its demographic non representativeness and the quirks of the caucuses process the amount of media coverage the state gets makes it far more valuable a prize than you d assume from the fact that it only accounts for 41 of the democrats 3 979 pledged delegates more specifically we estimate based on testing how much the results in various states have historically changed the candidates position in national polls that iowa was the second most important date on the calendar this year trailing only super tuesday it was worth the equivalent of almost 800 delegates about 20 times its actual number expected bounce magnitude according to fivethirtyeight s primary model everything was a little weird in iowa this year however and there were already some signs that the iowa bounce which essentially results from all the favorable media coverage that winning candidates get might be smaller than normal iowa was bracketed by an extremely busy news calendar president trump s impeachment trial both before and after the caucuses the super bowl on sunday the state of the union address on tuesday there was not the usual climactic uptick in media coverage around iowa from initial indications to the extent any information at all is reliable at this point democratic turnout there wound up being fairly low but we weren t prepared for what actually happened which is that as i m writing this at 3 15 a m on tuesday the iowa democratic party literally hasn t released any results from its caucuses i m not going to predict what those numbers will eventually be although early indications are that bernie sanders pete buttigieg and perhaps elizabeth warren had good results the point is that the lead story around the 2020 iowa democratic caucuses is now and will forever be the colossal shitshow around the failure to release results in a timely fashion maybe there will eventually be a decent sized iowa bounce despite all of this but there s a good chance that the candidates who did well in iowa get screwed and the candidates who did poorly there get a mulligan to repeat there s very little importance in a mathematical sense to who wins 41 delegates iowa is all about the media narrative it produces and all about momentum and that momentum whoever wins is likely to have been blunted who might this help let s pretend for a moment we don t have any hints about how the results might have turned out in fact let s pretend that iowa didn t happen at all i reran our forecast model as though the iowa caucuses were canceled 1 here s how that changed each candidate s chances of getting a delegate majority chances of winning a majority of pledged delegates per fivethirtyeight forecast model on feb 3 pre iowa compared with a version of the model that skips the iowa caucuses the presence of iowa was helpful to sanders whose chances of winning a national delegate majority would have been 24 percent without iowa as compared to the 31 percent chance that he had with iowa as of monday afternoon iowa hurt biden however whose chances of a delegate majority would have been 50 percent without it rather than 43 percent with it and iowa was extremely helpful to buttigieg whose chances of winning the delegate majority were fairly low even with iowa keep in mind that he had slipped to third in polls of iowa and fifth in national polls but would have been virtually nonexistent less than 1 percent without it by giving the winning candidates a boost the presence of iowa also reduced the chance of an unstructured race and a potential brokered convention the chance of there being no delegate majority was 17 percent without iowa but would have been 20 percent with it granted none of those changes say 24 percent versus 31 percent are necessarily that large but that s partly because as of monday afternoon four or five candidates appeared to have a shot at winning iowa for the candidate who actually won iowa it would have been a much bigger deal we estimate that sanders s chances of a majority would have shot up to from 31 percent to 58 percent with an iowa win warren s from 5 percent to 32 percent and buttigieg s from 4 percent to 22 percent and in some ways that still discounts iowa s impact because several of the campaigns for better or worse built their entire strategy around the state would buttigieg have been a major player in the race without iowa considering his lack of support among black voters probably not would candidates such as kamala harris cory booker and julian castro have dropped out so soon that s a harder call since harris booker and castro weren t polling particularly well anywhere but the democratic field might have remained a little more diverse so we ve arrived at a point of some ambivalence on the one hand candidates such as buttigieg who seemingly did well there are liable to be injured by the muddled storylines in iowa following the results reporting disaster on monday night on the other hand it s not clear why iowa was afforded so much importance in the first place and buttigieg possibly owed his entire presence in the campaign to this quirk in the nomination process nonetheless these were the rules of the game as every candidate understood them so if iowa turns out not to matter very much because of the results reporting snafu they have every right to be upset to be even more blunt the iowa democratic party s colossal screw up in reporting results will potentially have direct effects on the outcome of the nomination process the failure to report results will almost certainly help biden assuming that indications that he performed poorly in iowa are correct as they won t get nearly as much media coverage and they ll hurt whichever candidate wins the state most likely sanders or buttigieg although if sanders winds up finishing in second place or lower he also might not mind a reduction in the importance of iowa especially with one of his best states new hampshire coming up next furthermore iowa is typically a state that winnows the field but with every candidate either having performed well there potentially having an excuse for a disappointing finish there or somewhere in between it might not do that delaying the winnowing process would tangibly increase the chance of a contested convention it s not a good situation for the democratic party and it s already too late for the damage to be entirely undone even if iowa eventually gets its act together correction feb 4 2020 8 47 a m an earlier version of this article inaccurately said that democrats have 3 990 pledged delegates this primary cycle they have 3 979 therefore if iowa s delegates were discounted the remaining total would be 3 938 not 3 949 that is assuming that iowa doesn t get to vote at all and the overall number of pledged delegates was reduced to 3 938 nate silver is the founder and editor in chief of fivethirtyeight natesilver538 filed under 2020 election 756 posts 2020 democratic primary 692 iowa 92 see all
