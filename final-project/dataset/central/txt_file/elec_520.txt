the sixth democratic primary debate took place thursday watch it here realclearpolitics the left thinks biden and klobuchar had a good night and calls attention to the tiff between buttigieg and warren biden wasn t flawless but he kept things on the rails had flashes of good humor and was deft with tough moments he could see approaching including about his age he dealt particularly well with the toughest question he got which was about a recent washington post report on how leaders including those in the obama administration misled the country about the status of the war in afghanistan he said he argued against nation building there and emphasized disagreements with the pentagon about things such as the troops surge and he s got documents to back that up he had previously struggled when asked to own particular elements of the obama legacy but he did not on thursday aaron blake washington post many however argue that amy klobuchar deserves a closer look from electability minded democrats back in 2012 obama won 53 percent of the vote in minnesota klobuchar won 65 percent back in 2006 tim pawlenty narrowly defeated his democratic opponent for governor in a race that also saw a significant third party vote klobuchar won 58 percent of the vote in a landslide win if biden s message appeals to you and clearly it does appeal to a lot of democrats you owe it to yourself to ask if klobuchar isn t a more effective vehicle for that message she s younger she doesn t have the specific baggage of having supported the iraq war she doesn t have the specific baggage of hunter biden her policy ideas are broadly continuous with barack obama s just like biden s and her pitch is electability just like biden s but unlike biden she has a record of winning landslide elections in a midwestern state you could do a lot worse than that matthew yglesias vox some note joe biden and pete buttigieg both said many americans are not happy with the economy but polling shows that many americans over 50 percent feel as though the economy is strong telling them they shouldn t feel good when they do is a really bad idea elizabeth warren similarly made an argument in an earlier debate that she hasn t met anyone who liked their insurance company when plenty of people clearly do these sort of arguments aren t only condescending never a good strategy but they re also unnecessary democrats can and should talk about where the economy isn t working and where it could be working even better but without essentially calling voters either liars or too dumb to know they aren t really as happy as they feel that s in part how trump won the first time s e cupp cnn at last night s debate warren called attention to a recent fundraiser buttigieg held at a california wine cave the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served 900 a bottle wine the massachusetts senator said buttigieg responded with a slippery claim that he was the only one on stage who wasn t a millionaire or billionaire but that s true only because of his youth he s likely to be quite wealthy when he s the age of bernie sanders or elizabeth warren in fact as the child of two university professors buttigieg grew up wealthier than almost anyone on the stage further pointing to his relative wealth did nothing to address the issue that his fundraising is coming from wealthy donors if the goal of the other candidates was to sabotage buttigieg s campaign they might have succeeded jeet heer the nation the right sees biden as the winner of the debate and criticizes the democrats pessimistic view of the economy the right sees biden as the winner of the debate and criticizes the democrats pessimistic view of the economy biden was funny and relaxed watching him in all previous debates has been like watching someone unsteady trying to manage a balance beam the ex veep just barely survived those performances no matter what you thought about them and kept his poll numbers but last night he owned the stage warren was awful it wasn t just the contretemps with buttigieg that she lost so badly it was that once again she started playing oprah with money she doesn t have saying she could provide free everything with a tax of just 2 cents more on the dollars of people with more than 50 million it just isn t credible and the more she pushes it the more she seems either deluded or knowingly mendacious john podhoretz new york post the less biden speaks the more likely it is that he ll maintain his front runner status the former vice president is familiar and friendly but he is also prone to gaffes that have opened him up to criticism from republicans and democrats alike biden s campaign stands on its own he hasn t lost support since he entered the race and it s unlikely he will what biden needs to do now is avoid negative press attention and the best way to do that is to show not tell kaylee mcghee washington examiner while people have been expecting and predicting a biden collapse all year long he s still the national front runner and still leads south carolina and nevada by healthy margins sanders is close to the lead in iowa and currently leading new hampshire buttigieg leads iowa and is second in new hampshire warren suffered a real slump but she s still coming out of iowa with delegates and could come back in one or more of those other big four early states the end result is a group of top tier candidates who feel comfortable with where they are and maybe even a little complacent the no first strike philosophy is probably a miscalculation by someone up on that stage it s hard to imagine a scenario where all four candidates feel terrific after new hampshire jim geraghty national review buttigieg s claim that the economy is not working for most americans especially those in the middle and working class is strongly rebutted by most fiscal indicators since president donald trump s tax cuts went into effect wages have gone up while unemployment has hit record lows the impact has been most felt by blue collar and low skill workers who have seen their wages grow by more than three percent in the last year alone meanwhile the number of out of work americans is at the lowest point since the great recession in 2007 likewise the unemployment rate reached 3 5 percent in november the lowest in 50 years haris alic breitbart listening to the democratic candidates describe the us like it s in the throes of another great depression was laughable when it comes to president donald trump s handling of the economy 57 of americans approve according to a gallup poll in november unemployment has fallen to 3 5 the lowest rate in 50 years the numbers look good among the major worker groups including adult men 3 2 adult women 3 2 teenagers 12 0 whites 3 2 blacks 5 5 asians 2 6 and hispanics 4 2 how do democrats expect to defeat president trump when the vast majority of americans are facing low unemployment rates scott jennings cnn a blue hill man wrote a singles ad for his lonely duck bangor daily news
