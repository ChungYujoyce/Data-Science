president obama is greeted by new jersey gov chris christie in atlantic city n j on oct 31 before visiting areas hardest hit by superstorm sandy we may be still catching our collective breath over the 2012 elections but fear not political junkies the 2013 elections are already getting under way here is what s at stake governor new jersey where gov chris christie r has announced he will seek re election and virginia where gov bob mcdonnell r must step down after one term mayor the big attractions are new york city los angeles boston detroit and seattle and then there are the unexpected contests jesse jackson jr s nov 21 resignation from congress means there will be a special election in illinois 2nd district with a primary in february and we still don t know if there will be a special senate election in massachusetts we re waiting to see if sen john kerry d is named secretary of state or defense let s start with governor new jersey june 4 primary gov christie has long had a penchant for attention and publicity which has resulted in sometimes good sometimes bad reviews for the outspoken and controversial republican for the longest time there was uncertainty over whether he would seek a second term but then came hurricane sandy which devastated parts of the garden state and thrust christie into a prominent role boosting his favorability numbers into the stratosphere once derided by some in the gop for his embracing of president obama in the aftermath of sandy he s hurting mitt romney they yelled he is now seen as the odds on favorite for re election with overwhelming approval ratings from members of both parties and he remains a potential presidential candidate in 2016 cory booker the mayor of newark also has a national reputation and has long been thought of as christie s likely democratic opponent next year but sandy and the polls may give booker second thoughts a new quinnipiac university survey has christie leading by 18 points and some speculate that booker is now focusing on the 2014 senate race when incumbent democrat frank lautenberg will be 90 years old the likely lineup for the 2013 va gov race ken rudin collection hide caption the likely lineup for the 2013 va gov race virginia june 11 r convention d primary it s the only state in the country where the incumbent governor cannot run for re election the republicans sweep of 2009 ultimately led to a clash between lt gov bill bolling thought to be the choice of outgoing gov mcdonnell and attorney general ken cuccinelli a controversial figure in his own right who is the darling of the party s more conservative wing the a g has made national headlines with his opposition to obamacare climate change and abortion bolling made headlines of his own last week by announcing he would step aside from the gov contest but the decision was inevitable the gop decided to pick its 2013 nominees at a state convention rather than a primary a decision that clearly favors conservatives and cuccinelli but bolling left the race with a shot at his republican rival saying he couldn t support him would never run for office on his ticket and hinted that he hasn t ruled out exploring a gov candidacy as an independent meanwhile on the democratic side the recent announcement by sen mark warner d that he would not run for the governorship he held from 2002 2005 means that the nominee is likely to be terry mcauliffe a clinton confidant and a former dnc chair who sought the gov nomination four years ago mcauliffe however also has his enemies and his share of controversies and some democrats are hoping another candidate such as ex rep tom perriello gets in as of this writing it looks to be a cuccinelli vs mcauliffe matchup now the mayors new york sept 10 primary michael bloomberg a lifelong democrat who became a republican before his 2001 race and later morphed into an independent is ineligible for a fourth term actually he was ineligible for a third term as well but he helped ram through a change in the law that enabled him to run again in 2009 what this means is that for the first time since 1989 a democratic candidate has a chance at winning in a city where the democrats outnumber the republicans 3 1 the early favorite is christine quinn the city council speaker who would become nyc s first female mayor others mentioned include public advocate bill de blasio former comptroller and 2009 mayoral nominee bill thompson and current comptroller john liu whose candidacy may not come to fruition because of an ongoing campaign finance investigation the gop nominee could be former bronx borough president adolfo carrion who has never run for office other than as a democrat los angeles march 5 primary may 21 runoff mayor antonio villaraigosa d is term limited like new york los angeles has never had a female mayor but controller wendy greuel and councilwoman jan perry are hoping to change that boston primary date uncertain thomas menino boston s longest serving mayor in history recently spent a month in the hospital for a viral infection and blood clot first elected in 1993 he says he hasn t decided whether to seek an unprecedented sixth term detroit aug 6 primary dave bing the former nba star has served since may 2009 when he ousted incumbent kenneth cockrel in a special election cockrel had ascended to the mayoralty following the resignation of scandal tarred kwame kilpatrick the election is officially nonpartisan seattle aug 20 primary mike mcginn is seeking a second term the last straw there is no shortage of things that many find objectionable in the presidential nominating process on the republican side one bone of contention has for some been the iowa straw poll held the summer before the state s presidential caucuses in the college town of ames here s how i described it in the aug 1 2007 political junkie column ready ames fire it s a quadrennial effort by the state republican party to bring the gop candidates into the state to compete in a poll that has nothing to do with delegates but a lot to do with headlines and publicity it also says something about a candidate s organizational ability to get his or her supporters to turn out and take part in the poll but in addition to all that it s a fundraising gimmick by the iowa gop to participate each person must pay 35 it makes a lot of money for the iowa republican party what s to stop a well financed campaign from buying votes nothing and that s the rub and it doesn t necessarily indicate who is going to win the nomination let alone the iowa caucuses pat robertson 1987 phil gramm 1995 tie mitt romney 2007 and michele bachmann 2011 all won the straw poll but failed to triumph in the caucuses bachmann in fact finished last in the 2012 caucuses romney a disappointed suitor in 2007 08 skipped the straw poll completely in 2011 and yet nearly won the caucuses last january they won the iowa straw poll robertson in 87 romney in 07 and bachmann last year but failed to win the state s gop caucuses the following year ken rudin collection hide caption they won the iowa straw poll robertson in 87 romney in 07 and bachmann last year but failed to win the state s gop caucuses the following year but more importantly so many candidates put so much emphasis on it that sometimes when they lose their candidacies completely fall apart in 1999 lamar alexander and dan quayle ended their bids shortly after their poor showings in ames the day after the 2011 straw poll tim pawlenty exited the race it s too soon to tell whether changes will be made by 2015 but iowa gov terry branstad r shook things up recently when he said the straw poll had outlived its usefulness an editorial last week in the conservative national review agreed with branstad ames does more damage than justice to the nominating process and ensures that the country s first view of the grand old party s latest presidential crop is through a distorted lens what exactly is ames good for fundraising for one ames voters are literally bought and paid for candidates purchase tickets for their supporters and bus them into town for the straw poll but the ticket concessions line the pockets of the iowa republican party while the cash haul is nice for the iowa gop it hardly counts as an argument that the product is worth the price in fact the spotlight is part of the problem the media as much as anyone have imbued the story of ames with an import that the reality of ames has not justified and cannot justify and they help sell the fiction that the straw poll highlights the divergent preferences of the grass roots and the establishment and not the divergent preferences of a hand picked bused in sample and the republican electorate nationwide this fiction now infects the debate about ames future because the ames we read about is not the nonpredictive distortive ames of reality but a mythic creature in a story and like so many mythic creatures this one needs slaying to be continued house tally republican challenger david rouzer conceded to rep mike mcintyre d in north carolina s 7th congressional district which brings a close to the 2012 battle for the house while there is one more contest to come a dec 8 runoff in louisiana between gop incumbents charles boustany and jeff landry mcintyre s re election by just 663 votes means the democrats netted a total of eight house seats and as for that louisiana runoff necessitated by redistricting and the fact that no candidate got the required 50 percent on nov 6 boustany received 45 percent to landry s 30 percent boustany with greater finances and who represents a larger portion of the district is considered the favorite but the tea party is still putting its money behind landry il 02 update last week s column focused on the resignation of rep jesse jackson jr in the wake of health and ethics issues since then a bunch of candidates all democrats have jumped into the race including former rep debbie halvorson who served one term before losing in the 2010 gop sweep and who took on jackson in this year s dem primary and got clobbered napoleon harris the former nfl linebacker who just won a seat in the state senate chicago alderman anthony beale state sen toi hutchinson a former chief of staff to halvorson who took halvorson s seat in the state legislature when she was elected to congress in 2008 and jackson s predecessor ex rep mel reynolds who resigned in 1995 after being convicted of sexual assault and obstruction of justice among other charges for having sex with a 16 year old campaign volunteer reynolds is not expected to be a factor in the special election but race certainly is every candidate but halvorson is african american and black leaders openly fear that an election with multiple black candidates could elect halvorson who is white she is also the only candidate who comes from the suburban part of the district all of the others are from chicago s south side the democratic primary tantamount to deciding the winner in this overwhelmingly democratic district is feb 26 no republican has won a west virginia senate election

challenge sen jay rockefeller d in 2014 capito the daughter of former gov arch moore has long been urged by her party to seek statewide office but this is the first time she took the plunge it is not

party s longest drought in any state within hours of her announcement the conservative club for growth dismissed her as an establishment candidate who has a long record of support of bailouts pork and bigger government this was followed by a rebuttal from karl rove s american crossroads which said it s distasteful to see washington politicos clubbing get it republican candidates right out of the

power money and influence correspondent who responded with this here is a center for responsive politics chart on recent campaign totals cycle by cycle going back to 1998 you ll see that 2012 congressional spending is predicted to be down from 2010 which makes sense but also that 2012 presidential spending seems to be down from 2008 if that seems counterintuitive keep in mind that in 08
