politicians often claim that whatever election is coming up is the most important in our lifetime and the 2018 campaign has been no different but this time it s not just campaign hyperbole races on the ballot this year often far down the ballot could define thenational political landscape for the next decade or more that s because governors and state lawmakers elected in 2018and2020 will redothe congressional maps in 2021 the single greatest factor in determining who will control congress in the decade to come the tea party revolution of 2010 usheredrepublicans into control ofstatehouses across the country allowing the gop to draw much of the current map and to control the u s house for most of the last decade this year s electioncould determine whether republicansmaintain theiradvantage in congressional races through 2031 or if democrats can tip the scalesin their own favor democrats have been in the wilderness the past decade because they fell asleep on redistricting in 2010 saiddavid daley a senior fellow at fair voteand author of a book about the last redistricting that means they ll have to start even earlier this time around the key elections having influence on that process are almost entirely this year daley said in many ways it s going to be over after election day 2018 enter eric holder the former obamaattorney general heads the national democratic redistricting committee a one stop shop for democratic groups to coordinate their strategy its mission win a more favorable playing field for democrats by ensuring a complete count in the 2020 census removing barriers to voting supporting ballot initiatives for redistricting reform electing democrats and challenging republican drawn districts in court hesees all of these as related issues you see the greatest amountof voter suppression where you have the most gerrymandered states there s no comparable group on the republican side the national republican redistricting trust is focused more narrowly on giving state republican parties technical and legal support people have characterized the nrrt as a response to eric holder s group which it is not said adam kincaid thegroup s director the reason is because we don t do elections we re focused specifically on litigation and data he says other gopcommittees the republican governor s association and the republican state leadership committee worry about candidates where holder sees redistricting as fundamentally broken and in need of reform kincaid sees no easy fix the process isdirty as it is he said and i don t mean that in a negativeway it s just messy there s not a perfect process which is what the founders acknowledged when they designed it this way the 2018 battle for control over the next redistricting is being fought on at least four fronts governors mansions states use different methods of drawing congressional districts thirty four putthe state legislature in charge in 32 of those states the governor has veto power thirty sixstates will elect governors this year most of them will serve four year terms sothey llstill be in officethree years from now when the maps are to beredrawn not all states give their governors a role in the process and some low population states have only one congressional seat so they don t do redistricting but that still leaves 20states in which the governor elected this yearwillhave significant influence over congressional map drawing and they happen to include some ofthe most gerrymandered states in the union michigan north carolina ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin those five swing states go either way in presidential elections obama won them all in 2008 and trump won them in 2016 but in the house of representatives republicans have been able to hold a 27 seat advantage in those five states for a solid decade in states with one party control of the state legislature a governor of the opposite party can use his or her veto to force a compromise map that can also be important for republicans in blue states illinois maryland andmassachusettsall have democratic legislatures with incumbent republican governors running for re electionthis year but for democrats trying to compete in statesthat have been dominated by the gop that s a key part of the strategy we need to ensure that democrats are at least at the tablein a way that we were not in 2011 holder says but republicans say divided government more often leads to gridlock than compromise they re not looking at a seat at the table kincaid said they re looking at getting governors so they can kick these maps to the court they want a court drawn map state courtrooms with the confirmation of justice brett kavanaugh the u s supreme court already reluctant to weigh into partisan gerrymandering cases couldbestillmore hostile to redistricting challenges but there could be another path state courts the pennsylvania supreme court in januarystruck down a republican drawn map the court citeda provision in the state constitution that requireselections to be free and equal at least25other state constitutions require elections to be free and equal or free and open according to bernard grofman and jonathan cervas political scientists at the university of california irvine so you re likely to see more litigation at the state level cervas said that had never been the route until pennsylvania one exception florida where voters approved a constitutional amendment in 2010 explicitly banning partisan gerrymandering so nowholder s group is looking to elect more democratic judges he s endorsed anita earls a candidate for thenorth carolina supreme court though judicial canons prevent candidates for judge from discussing specific cases there s no doubt where the candidates there stand on gerrymandering earls represented the naacp in a challenge to the north carolina map in 2011 her opponent justice barbara jackson was part of the majority that upheld the maps the u s supreme court eventually struck down the districts in a 9 0 vote ballot initiatives four states colorado michigan missouri and utah have redistricting initiatives on the ballot in november they repart of a growing grassroots movement to take redistricting out of the hands of state legislatures or at least tocurb their more partisan impulses by requiring a super majority of lawmakers to agree on any new map in michigan a proposal on the ballot would put redistricting in the hands of a 13 member commission made up entirely of volunteers whose nameswouldbe drawn at random the only requirements they must be voters can t be politicians lobbyists or their relatives and have to be balanced by party four democrats four republicans and five independents eric lupher isdirector of the nonpartisan citizens research council ofmichigan people have really grown a healthy distrust of elected officials and not just our current elected officials but those who will come in the future hesaid but he says every state has to decide for itself what kind of redistricting process works best based on its unique history political culture and geography in may ohio voters approved a constitutional amendmentthat requires the approval of60 percent of each legislative chamber and a majority of each party to establish a map if they can t the task goes to a bipartisan commission in missouri a proposal on the ballot nov 6 would give map drawing powers for state legislative districts in the power of a non partisan state demographer subject to approval by a bipartisan commission the utah proposal would have an independentcommission propose boundaries to the legislature and colorado would give redistricting power to a commission made up of democrats republicans and independents under any of those systems lupher says expect more lawsuits this is something new he said somebody s ox is going to get gored and they re going to sue that s where we are as a culture these days if you don t like it litigate state legislatures in most state legislatures members of the lower chamber usually the house of representatives or house of delegates areelected to two year termssothere will be anotherelectionbefore redistricting in 2021 but for the upper chamber the state senate terms aretypicallyfour years that gives democrats a chance to become competitive in some states with big wins down the ballot in 2018 but because state legislatures often draw lines for their own members as well as for congress they re starting those contests at a disadvantage in many cases you will have elections that will be conducted that were drawn by republicans in 2011 and that s why turnout is so important holder said the blue wave has to overcome this gerrymandered seawall that was constructed in 2011 in wisconsin the battleground for a gerrymandering case that made it all the way to the supreme court this year republicansholda 18 15 advantage in the senate after democrats won two upsets in special elections this year but jenni dye director of the wisconsin state senate democratic committee says it s not redistricting that s going to drive voters to the polls the topic that you re hearing from either side in their television ads is not gerrymandering she said but it is impacting all of the things that are on voters minds issues likehealth care jobs and the economy those are all affected by what happens with gerrymandering
