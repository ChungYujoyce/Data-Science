there s nothing like an andrew yang campaign event nowhere else will fans show up wearing hats with math written across the top make america think harder if the mood is right chants of powerpoint break out as they did at a recent rally in seattle and at the center is yang an american flag patterned scarf tossed loosely around his neck the personified version of a meme you might ve seen on reddit yang is one of the democratic presidential candidates you ve probably never heard of but his long shot campaign has seen some surprising success the former entrepreneur is polling better than several more traditionally qualified candidates he s amassed a loyal online fan base and yes real life people show up at his events perhaps most importantly he s met the qualifications for the first democratic debate in late june where he s hoping to get noticed and become a competitive challenger for the nomination yang has built a loyal army of fans by pitching himself as a change agent he s talking about issues that no one else is focusing on from universal basic income he s for it to circumcision he s against it employing an outside the box style that comes across as refreshing to voters who crave an outsider candidate there s a real appetite for a different kind of political conversation yang told time i can t tell you how many times people have said to me you re the first political candidate i ve ever contributed to this is the first political event i ve ever attended that s a very consistent theme yang is vying to become the first asian american nominee of a major party and while he remains a rounding error in the polls his modest momentum reflects the enduring hunger for unconventional candidates if his campaign can catch fire he d be further evidence that it s no longer necessary to spend time serving in elected office or even to be conventionally good at retail politics what matters yang suggests is to think differently than washington does already his campaign suggests there s at least some truth to that if we activate a significant number of these people that right now are not conventionally interested in politics he says then we can contend on a rainy day in may yang sat down with time in a portsmouth n h coffee shop he walked in late because according to his campaign staff he wouldn t shut up at his last stop an editorial board interview with seacoast media group yang was wearing his signature american flag scarf and he offered me a high five which is something he likes to do a lot while he likes to tout the contrast he cuts with the president the opposite of donald trump is an asian man who likes math he says yang doesn t talk much about his identity as the first asian american presidential candidate when i asked about it yang said he often has people approach him to say how excited they are about that yang 44 was born in new york to two immigrants from taiwan he graduated from high school in exeter n h in 1992 got an undergraduate degree from brown and went to law school at columbia which he graduated from in 1999 his career got off to a tough start he spent mere months working as a corporate lawyer at davis polk and wardwell in new york before he says he quickly became bored with it next he launched a failed internet company called stargiving which raised money for charity by auctioning off celebrity experiences he worked for a mobile software company called crisp wireless as vice president of their business and legal department and at a health care start up called mmf systems then he ran a tutoring company that was acquired by test prep giant kaplan in 2009 for an undisclosed amount on the trail yang refers to it as a modest fortune in 2011 yang founded an organization called venture for america his vision was to train entrepreneurs and dispatch them around the country to help create job growth he was later named one of the obama white house s champions of change for that work along the way yang married and had two kids including an autistic son in a way yang credits the latter experience with fueling his campaign for president as first time parents you don t know what s normal versus what s not normal he recalls is it normal for a three year old to freak out when the texture of the ground changes it was a growing experience for him until then yang had suffered only minor adversity the idea that a single mother would have to care for an autistic child with no resources was heartbreaking he says and helped shape his belief in universal basic income the core of his platform and the idea that s helped him gain traction yang s path led him in early 2017 to the chelsea neighborhood in manhattan where he sat down to lunch with andy stern the former president of service employees international union he d read stern s book raising the floor which focuses on universal basic income and closes with the idea of someone running for president on the issue yang wanted to try it i was shocked stern says you know part of me thinks you re crazy and part of me thinks you re my hero yang set off on his uphill battle as a presidential candidate he took his first tentative steps toward raising money and spent time thinking about his platform which today includes dozens of ideas on anything from health care he s for medicare for all to taxes he d like to make tax day a federal holiday complete with celebrations to financial literacy if your government teacher ever asked you to invent policy from scratch for a school assignment the results might look something like his imaginative interesting and a little bit out there at campaign events yang often gestures with his free hand as though he were a claw from the old carnival machine lowering to pick up a stuffed animal his speeches focus on the challenges surrounding automation and he often rails against amazon blaming it for local stores closing the economy is being transformed faster than ever he says it has devastated many communities and ways of life and while we can t make everyone whole we can start sharing the bounty of these incredible innovations much more quickly and broadly the first major moment of yang s campaign came after his appearance on comedian joe rogan s podcast where he first introduced himself to a large audience after that he started gaining traction on twitter and reddit largely for his universal basic income proposal i think this policy of a universal basic income which was you know championed by martin luther king jr and many others is one that s going to help transform the capitalist economy into one that s more focused on people says edward levasseur 24 of somersworth n h yang knows giving people 1 000 a month sounds like a gimmick but he tells voters it s an old idea pointing to alaska s permanent fund dividend as an example of how this could work internationally there have been similar attempts in 2016 switzerland rejected a referendum on a similar proposal the first country to hold such a vote smaller scale trials and studies have also periodically popped up to explore the concept at events yang will often ask crowds what they d spend 1 000 a month on the audience tosses back a range of answers rent a babysitter marijuana by the end of the last fundraising quarter yang had raised nearly 1 8 million for his campaign and while he can draw crowds in the thousands yang s base is online on twitter his follower count is more than 282 000 and according to yang they re not all bots either his campaign tried to do an inventory and the results he said came up 97 human even if yang defies the long odds and became president it s not as though americans will magically start receiving 1 000 checks every month democratic congressional aides note that it would be easy for republicans to attack the idea as welfare and that congress and the american public have little familiarity with the concept democrats would likely be reluctant about the idea of changing existing social welfare programs triggering the kind of policy debate that typically requires political know how to navigate but yang s whole platform hinges on this idea and he s committed to it he even picked out two families one in iowa and one in new hampshire to send a monthly 1 000 check to test the policy that caused a recent hiccup after the des moines register inquired about the payments yang s campaign said it would amend its finance reports to reflect spending it had previously omitted so far yang s campaign has had the most success with younger voters and it s not just because of his habit of swearing on the trail f ck yeah yang responded when i pointed out this penchant i think it s because young people unfortunately have come of age in an era of institutional failure and erosion yang says and so when they sense that someone is speaking in an institutional voice they kind of tune out that he theorizes is why people are drawn to him authenticity is something that politicians struggle with out of fear of getting blasted on cable news for saying the wrong thing which in turn he says leads to conformity young people can sense that he isn t like that to win the nomination yang will have to convince democrats that he s got the best chance at beating trump he believes in reaching out to the president s voters democrats made a grievous error by not having one of their debates on fox he said how can you win a general election if half the country isn t watching your candidates debate yang s theory of the case is that once people get to know him through the debates they will realize his ceiling is much higher than most other candidates and begin to coalesce around him he often says that people tell him he s what they hoped for when they voted for trump i am the outsider who has a different sort of message he says between bites at the coffee shop and that s attracting many different people who want a different conversation a different voice in washington write to lissandra villa at lissandra villa time com
