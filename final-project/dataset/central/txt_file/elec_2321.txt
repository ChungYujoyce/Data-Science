harris has had by far the best launch of any candidate her speech declaring her candidacy was delivered powerfully before a large and appreciative crowd in oakland her appearances in early states have been well received as have her initial round of media interview more generally she has effectively presented herself as a fresh and charismatic presence harris has also rolled out some early endorsements including rep barbara leebarbara jean leeovernight defense pentagon memo warns pandemic could go until summer 2021 watchdog finds taliban violence is high despite us deal progressive dems demand defense cuts progressives demand defense budget cuts amid coronavirus pandemic cornell to launch new bipartisan publication led by former rep steve israel more d calif and on friday alone both california gov gavin newsom d and hispanic civil rights icon dolores huerta there are still plenty of questions that harris will have to answer including how her long record as a prosecutor will be scrutinized by a democratic base focused on questions of police misconduct and racial inequities early front runners can easily come unstuck but for now harris is the most formidable candidate in the race previous ranking on jan 1 4 2 former vice president joe bidenjoe bidenthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks biden set to make risky economic argument against trump hillicon valley tech companies lead way on wfh forever states and counties plead for cybersecurity assistance trump weighing anti conservative bias panel more for all the excitement around harris it is the former vice president who still heads every significant nationwide poll of democratic voters in an emerson poll released on saturday he was 10 points ahead of his closest rival sen bernie sandersbernie sandershillicon valley tech companies lead way on wfh forever states and counties plead for cybersecurity assistance trump weighing anti conservative bias panel biden wins hawaii primary warren to host high dollar fundraiser for biden more i vt with harris third a further2 points behind a morning consult poll earlier last week put biden7 points clear of sanders and 16 points ahead of harris in 2016 biden mulled a run for a long time before deciding against it his son beau had died from brain cancer in may 2015 and biden ultimately chose not to force himself thorough the rigors of a presidential campaign this time around the hill has reportedthat he is almost certain to declare a candidacy soon biden has weaknesses in the race including his age he would be 78 on inauguration day 2021 and past votes that sit uneasily with the current democratic base on everything from the iraq war to a 1994 crime bill but his skills as retail politician his experience and the loyal service he rendered for eight years to president obama would all stand in his favor previous ranking 3 3 sen bernie sanders i vt sanders entered the race early tuesday following weekend reports that he had recorded a video announcing his candidacy sanders will clearly be a top flight contender polls generally put him second behind biden he could end up being a victim of his own relative success in one sense however his stronger than expected challenge to eventual democratic presidential nominee hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more in 2016 showed there was an appetite in the party for more left wing policies now several other declared or likely candidates are running on progressive platforms that could blunt sanders s formerly unique appeal he has other problems as well including the enmity he earned among clinton supporters in 2016 in january he apologized to women who say they were harassed or mistreated by male staff during his 2016 campaign his decision to give his own rebuttal to president trumpdonald john trumpmulvaney we ve overreacted a little bit to coronavirus former cbs news president most major cable news outlets unrelentingly liberal in fear and loathing of trump an old man like me should be made more vulnerable to death by covid 19 more s state of the union speech aggravated some activists who believed he was taking the spotlight from the democrats official speaker of the night former georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams age is an issue for sanders too he is 77 previous ranking 2 4 former rep beto o rourke d texas will he or won t he that s the key question around o rourke who ignited enormous democratic enthusiasm in his ultimately unsuccessful challenge to sen ted cruzrafael ted edward cruzstate department scrutiny threatens pompeo s political ambitions 125 lawmakers urge trump administration to support national guard troops amid pandemic parties gear up for battle over texas state house more r texas last year o rourke s intentions are far from clear he embarked on a road trip in january earning some mockery from detractors for his introspective musings in an online diary on the other hand when trump held a rally in o rourke s home base of el paso recently the former texas congressman headlined his own event nearby which drew a crowd several thousand strong the longer o rourke stays out of the race the greater the danger that someone like harris could really catch fire on the other hand his prodigious fundraising ability he raised an eye popping 38 million in 2018 s third quarter during his senate bid ensures he would be a serious candidate previous ranking 1 5 sen elizabeth warrenelizabeth warrenpentagon charts its own course on covid 19 risking trump s ire warren to host high dollar fundraiser for biden it s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process more d mass it s been a largely uninspiring start to the campaign for warren who had been considered one of the leading candidates in the early running part of the problem is the issue that won t quit her prior self identification as a native american and her decision last year to take a dna test to prove that she was telling the truth the test affirmed that she had a native american ancestor six to 10 generations ago but even some democrats believe the whole episode played into the hands of trump who continues to deride warren whom he has long mocked as pocahontas warren is betting that there is a strong electoral market for someone who can combine her professorial in depth knowledge especially of financial regulation with a style that savors confrontation with trump but her initial poll ratings are average at best fueling suspicions that she is being overtaken by other figures particularly harris who may have a stronger personal magnetism previous ranking 5 6 sen cory bookercory anthony bookerstakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff it s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process booker introduces bill to create democracycorps for elections more d n j booker is one of the most recent entrants into the race he announced on feb 1 the new jersey senator divides opinion especially inside the beltway to his supporters he is a likable energetic candidate who speaks passionately and has the capacity to fire up young and nonwhite voters with particular vigor his detractors however assail him as an inauthentic lightweight who has long been more interested in promoting himself than anything else that critique stretches from his time as the twitter friendly mayor of newark to his self proclaimed spartacus moment during the confirmation hearings of supreme court justice brett kavanaughbrett michael kavanaughthe 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff juan williams justice thomas seizes his moment in the trump era more booker will likely need to show he can get traction fairly soon before the expected arrival of other big stars on the stage including biden threatens to push him toward the margins of the race previous ranking 7 7 sen amy klobucharamy klobucharpoll biden leads trump by 5 points in minnesota the hill s morning report presented by facebook us death toll nears 100 000 as country grapples with reopening it s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process more d minn klobuchar certainly had an eye catching campaign launch she gave a speech declaring her candidacy in the midst of a heavy snowstorm the visuals were memorable and underlined klobuchar s core message that she is a down to earth contender from the heartlands but that in itself won t assuage the doubts about klobuchar s ultimate chances of success do democrats really want someone who leans toward centrism as their standard bearer against trump recent allegations that she mistreated staff have further complicated klobuchar s chances some of the milder accusations against her carry more than a whiff of sexism but it is harder to make that case when it comes to the most dramatic allegations including one instance where she purportedly threw a binder that struck a staff member previous ranking 8 8 sen sherrod brownsherrod campbell brownsenators offer bill to prevent relief payments from being seized by private debt collectors congress headed toward unemployment showdown rollout of new anti redlining rules sparks confusion in banking industry more d ohio brown has long been a political curiosity a progressive democrat who continues to win reelection in the increasingly red state of ohio by wide margins brown has been building up some momentum with a tour of early voting states but it is not clear he is getting into the race and the likely entrance of biden who has a similar blue collar appeal would greatly complicate the ohioan s possible path to the nomination previous ranking 6 9 sen kirsten gillibrandkirsten gillibrandit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process hillicon valley uber to lay off thousands of employees facebook content moderation board announces members lawmakers introduce bill to cut down online child exploitation democrats introduce legislation to protect children from online exploitation more d n y gillibrand launched her campaign in mid january with an appearance on stephen colbert s late show on cbs sadly for the new york senator that s the most memorable thing she has done so far gillibrand always faced an uphill climb toward the nomination there is nothing to suggest the gradient has become any less steep previous ranking 10 10 former new york city mayor michael bloomberg bloomberg continues to toy with a bid but it is enormously difficult to see a credible route for the former new york city mayor despite his vast fortune bloomberg s business friendly centrism seems a poor fit for today s democratic party and he is far from a natural politician on the stump which would hinder him in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire previous ranking 9 updated at 7 18 a m view the discussion thread the hill 1625 k street nw suite
