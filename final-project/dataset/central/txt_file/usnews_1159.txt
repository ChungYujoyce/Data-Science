against them i have often observed that i am the luckiest person on earth i feel that way even now as i prepare for the end of my life i have loved my life all of it i have had experiences adventures and friendships enough for ten satisfying lives and i am so thankful like most people i have regrets but i would not trade a day of my life in good or bad times for the best day of anyone else s i owe that satisfaction to the love of my family no man ever had a more loving wife or children he was prouder of than i am of mine and i owe it to america to be connected to america s causes liberty equal
