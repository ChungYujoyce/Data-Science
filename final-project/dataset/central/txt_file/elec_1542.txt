the first time a new poll released on saturday showed him as the clear front runner the 37 year old mayor of south bend ind was a virtual unknown when he announced his campaign in april but he has recently surged in states that will be among the first to vote in the primary buttigieg an openly gay military veteran was the top choice of 25 percent of likely iowa caucus goers outpacing long standing frontrunners joe biden sen bernie sanders and sen elizabeth warren the poll shows major growth in his support in the past three months a poll taken in august had him at just 8 percent why there s debate though it s only two polls some political experts see it as evidence that buttigieg may have a chance at winning the democratic nomination and even the presidency buttigieg has staked a position where he can be seen as a reasonable alternative for voters who have doubts about the three leading candidates buttigieg s policy platform is progressive but not as far left as sanders s and warren s a key example is his medicare for all who want it plan which would be a major shift in how the u s health care system works but not as transformative as the medicare for all plans promoted by warren and sanders buttigieg is also an alternative choice for moderate voters who may be dissatisfied with biden still there are several reasons to question whether buttigieg can compete for the nomination his biggest shortcoming is low support among black voters he may perform well in the predominantly white states of iowa and new hampshire that open the primary but could fall off significantly as voting moves to south carolina and other demographically diverse states buttigieg s lack of experience relative to his competition which includes senators former governors and a former vice president could dampen his appeal some analysts argue there are also questions about whether his sexuality might limit support from religious voters what s next buttigieg will have a
