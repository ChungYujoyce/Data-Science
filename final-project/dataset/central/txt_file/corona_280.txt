madison elmer got the offer shortly after she and some friends startedorganizing a protest to oppose wisconsin s coronavirus stay at home order an outside group wanted to chip in some money to help pay for the rally she plans this week concerned about the strings that could be attached elmer turned it down we felt like it had a political agenda behind it said the wisconsin native who declined to name the group we didn t want to be pawns in somebody s else s game as protesters across the country plan to challenge statewide coronavirus orders they fiercely resist a growing narrative that they are aligned with or funded by national groups gun rights organizations or entities supporting president donald trump s reelection even as some of those groups take part in the events the protests focused on rolling back stay at home orders to slow the spread of coronavirus snarled traffic in michigan blocking a hospital entrance thousands of cheering flag waving drivers cruised

tentatively began reopening businesses and easing distancing guidelines more than 46 000 americans have died from the disease according to johns hopkins university trump encouraged states with fewer cases and deaths to begin bringing their economies back online wisconsin had more than 4 800 confirmed cases of the virus by wednesday and had recorded 246 deaths according to the state health department elmer said she started organizing a protest for friday after hearing from friends who were struggling not because they are sick but because they are running out of money friday was the day thatgov tony evers social distancing restrictionswere initially set to lift instead they have been extended to may 26 i was listening to all these concerns and i was sick of not doing anything about it she said there are people suffering on both sides of this much like the tea party movement that sprang up a decade ago the coronavirus protests are a culturaleddy of conservative ideologies from gun rights advocates to religious groups though many organizers insist the gridlock events and protestsare nonpartisan many have taken on the flavor of trump rallies including a smattering of campaign signs and the president s trademark red maga caps the events underscorehowefforts to contain the virus havedivided millions of americans along familiar political battle lines nearly 60 of the nation s voters say they are more concerned about additional deaths from the virus than they are about the economic impact according to an nbc news wall street journal poll this week that sentiment is more prevalent amongdemocratsthan republicans gop respondents are divided almost half are more concerned with the economy alvin tillery a political scientist at northwestern university sees the protests and trump s exhortations as an attempt to rally his base when he has faced intense criticism from democrats for his early handling of the crisis it s directed toward the blue states it s meant to distract from mr trump s incredibly poor performance in managing the crisis tillery said it distracts but also gives them an issue that activates their desire to vote against the democrats trump has encouraged the groups including from the podium of the white house briefing room friday in a series of tweets he suggested it was time to liberate michigan minnesota and virginia he has beenless clear about what he d like those states to do and he has batted away questions about whether the protesters flout social distancing guidelines he and his aides promoted liberate trump seeks to liberate states as protesters demand easing of orders the first item in those guidelines is to listen and follow directions from authorities the guidance goes on to encourageamericans to work from home cancel unnecessary travel and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people look people they want to get back to work they got to make a living trump said late tuesday they have to take care of their family georgia trump says he disagrees with georgia gov brian kemp s reopeningplan trump took a different approach a day later saying he disagreed strongly with georgia gov brian kemp s decision to move toward reopening parts of that state s economy kemp a republican and trump ally is pushing to reopen gyms barber shops and other businesses as soon as friday trump said wednesday he thought it was just too soon elmer stressed that she took no money or help from outside interests but she s aware that a group called wisconsinites against excessive quarantine plans an event friday at the same place and at roughly the same time as the rally she organized that entity is associated witha national gun rights group cool if they re supporting our mission which is reopening wisconsin she said similarly organizers reached by usa today in virginia tennessee indiana and several other states denied working with national groups but said they were inspired by protests elsewhere some tapped into guns rights or tea party organizations to help spread the wordbut claimed no formal affiliation with wider networks there is some overlap in addition to wisconsin rallies in pennsylvania ohio and minnesota were promoted by facebook pages started by brothers chris benand aaron dorr who have a network of gun advocacy organizations in multiple states pennsylvanians against excessive quarantine which was launched by the pennsylvania firearms association and led by chris dorr was among a trio of groups that helped organize monday s rally in harrisburg a government that is powerful enough to make unilateral decisions that close down the means of production well they re also then able in a future school shooting or another pittsburgh shooting to reinvoke that same power and say we re going to ban constitutional freedoms to bear arms said dorr the firearms association s director dorr downplayed the amount of money and coordination involved these facebook groups they are completely free dorr said all i did was start the page and then invited about 10 or 15 friends into it and it spiraled out of control from there there s not even 5 bucks behind this whole thing several national groupsthat fueled the tea party movement during president barack obama s administration said they are helping but not leading the groups many of the same charges about astroturf organizing were leveled against that movement which sprang up partly in response to the affordable care act there is no central person organizing everything said adam brandon president of freedomworks a conservative group that focuses on economic issues brandon said 25 000 people took his group s grassroots training program and many of them work withgroups to stage the demonstrations the training includes coaching organizers on how to promote their events such as through writing news releases and contacting reporters jenny beth martin co founder of the tea party patriots said the real organizers are people who are fed up martin described the events as an organic movement that relies on social media national groups such as hers she said blast out announcements posted to social media by local organizers to help spread the word we want to make sure our supporters are aware events are happening martin said organizers dismissed claims of national organization it s nonsense said robert hall a longtime conservative figure in indiana whohelped promote a protest in indianapolis it s all grassroots stephen moore an outside economic adviser to trump applauded the events but said he declined invitations to speak at them because he doesn t want organizers to be seen as swayed by national interests moore cautioned protesters against wearing maga hats and other trump merchandise arguing it could turn off some supporters it really has been a spontaneous combustion he told usa today in some cases the organization of the protests borders on chaotic teo de las heras created a reopen pa facebook page last week after spotting a similar effort in north carolina the tech company employeefrom langhorne pennsylvania told usa today that the pagequickly grew to more than 60 000 members within days other members of the grouporganized a protest he attended but didn t help to stage we re basically a grassroots thing right now said de las heras a registered republican who said he abstained from voting in the 2016 election all the admin and moderators are basically just small business owners and people impacted by this he said an individual reached out to him about having a conversation about some kind of national organization but he didn t know the specifics nor the person s group they re contacting all the different influencers out there on social media de las heras said he agreed to talk but the meeting was canceled de las herassaid his facebook group was initially filled with people looking to impeach gov tom wolf a democrat but he s sought to keep it focused on the economy keeping protesters on message and avoiding an association with some of the hate speech that hascropped up has been a challenge for organizers some protestershave reportedly flashed anti semitic signs organizers have rebuked that behavior which has been rare and said it distracts from the intended message in virginia david britt a spokesman for the reopen virginia gridlock rally said the support keeps getting exponentially bigger since the event was organized last thursday he said hisgroup is not getting a dime in outside fundingor other help a self described constitutional conservative and political big mouth on facebook britt said he was driven to action after watching last week s rally in lansing michigan he proposed on facebook that virginians do the same thing we re winging this and flying by the seat of our pants said britt a mental health counselor from fairfax virginia virginia organizers are particularly upset about the length of democratic gov ralph northam s stay at home order which is to runthrough june 10 they said it s too extreme and will lead to unemployment and other unintended consequences from homelessness to domestic violence virginia hadmore than 9 600 confirmed cases of the virus as of tuesdayand recorded 324deaths according to state health officials britt said organizers discouraged people from turning an event planned for wednesday into a trump rally or a protest over second amendment rights and instead urged them tostay laser focused on their message about getting virginians back to work we re trying to discourage that as much as possible britt said who described himself as a supporter of the president this isn t a trump rally this isn t a republican rally contributing jorge l ortiz usa today lansing state journal milwaukee
