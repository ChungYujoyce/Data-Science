the trick to staying competitive in the democratic presidential primary is money and lots of it so it s at the close of the third fundraising quarter that a couple of middle tier candidates have showcased a new fundraising strategy telling their supporters it ll be the end of their campaigns if they don t get the support they need sen cory booker and former hud secretary juli n castro both framed the end of september in stark terms booker s campaign argued that if he didn t raise 1 7 million by sept 30 he didn t see a viable path forward castro s campaign argued that if he didn t make the november debate stage he would have to end his campaign though his campaign has since walked back the rhetoric booker made his campaign goal castro according to his campaign has yet to reach the polling threshold for the fourth debate democrats have long been known to ring the alarms in an effort to fill their campaign coffers but the new strategy of being brutally and shamelessly honest with voters is new there s a difference between being straightforward and honest with your supporters and essentially bullshitting them like the sky is falling down final notice we are all doomed language is alarmist says matthew mcgregor a london based political strategist who worked on the obama campaign if it wasn t true it was fantastically well put together authenticity like content but i think it was true i think they did need that money mcgregor argues there is a generational factor at work with both booker and castro on the younger end of the spectrum of candidates running booker is 50 and castro is 45 they re young enough that they re closer to digital natives than the frontrunners in the race like former vice president joe biden sen elizabeth warren and sen bernie sanders booker in particular arrived on the national stage thanks in large part to twitter this is evidence that politics especially on the democratic side and especially among younger candidates is changing mcgregor says the willingness to be open and transparent is just a feature of how people are online nowadays it all started earlier this month with booker s campaign sending out a memo to supporters from his campaign manager addisu demissie saying that the campaign set a deadline of raising 1 7 million by the last day of the month the fundraising deadline for the third quarter otherwise we do not see a legitimate long term path forward the campaign pitched it as radical transparency castro followed suit last week with a fundraising email that said if i don t make the next debate stage it will be the end of my campaign making the debate stage matters because of all of the visibility that comes with it both candidates have already qualified for the october debate but the november debate requires candidates to either poll at 3 or higher in four national polls or 5 or higher in two early state polls as well as receiving donations from 165 000 unique donors castro s campaign at least is trying to straddle both transparency and the acknowledgment that his campaign email was just another fundraising call cbs news reported that maya rupert castro s campaign manager said the email from his campaign was unfortunately hyperbolic writing these emails we re definitely trying to convey a sense of urgency when we re fundraising sawyer hackett castro s national press secretary tells time that s not him saying he s going to drop out that s just conveying the sense of urgency that we get into at the end of this quarter asked if castro would drop out if he didn t make the debate stage hackett says the campaign has no plans for him to do that hackett also says this had been the campaign s most successful fundraising quarter yet i think it s a fundraising technique that can be a successful one people are paying more attention to the process more so than you would expect them to says jared leopold who served as an aide to gov jay inslee s campaign inslee dropped out of the race in august to me this is about trying to engage donors in the process and one of the things we ve seen this cycle is that people are hypervigilant about politics to the point where they re actually paying attention to the little insider stuff that used to be the subject of conference calls booker and castro s messaging has raised eyebrows among candidates in the field with beto o rourke sending out an email that taunted them maybe i could do a facebook live stream with a kitten in hand and say you know we wouldn t want anything to happen to this kitten now would we send your 5 now and miss whiskers will be fine south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg a leading fundraiser also made an apparent nod to them in one of his campaign emails albeit more subtly no alarm bells no falling sky just the truth to hear booker s camp tell it this is absolutely not just a gimmick just unprecedented honesty whatever it is it s apparently working the campaign announced that it reached the goal on sunday night if it was a tactic more like a gimmick i think you would see it more in the emails said a booker aide i just really can t overstress how much of a real leap of faith this was we did not know how this was going to play so like it could have been successful it could not have been the aide noted that typically campaign memos are written to show you re in a position of strength this change in approach also comes in the wake of the donald trump ukraine scandal that has led to a formal impeachment inquiry of the president it has become the dominating subject of the news cycle for candidates who are not in the top tier biden warren and sanders give or take a couple of the other candidates it could become increasingly difficult to break out write to lissandra villa at lissandra villa time com
