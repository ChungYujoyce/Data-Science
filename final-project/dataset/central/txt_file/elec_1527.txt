hide caption republican presidential candidate donald trump speaks during a campaign rally friday in altoona pa at the event he told voters to monitor polling locations for cheating politicians often urge supporters to get out and vote but donald trump wants them to go further get out and vote and then stake out polling places to watch for cheating at a friday campaign event in altoona pa the republican presidential nominee said voting might not be enough for him to win the only way we can lose in my opinion i really mean this in pennsylvania is if cheating goes on trump said we have to call up law enforcement and we have to have the sheriffs and the police chiefs and everybody watching he wanted the voters themselves to get involved as well i hope you people can sort of not just vote on the 8th go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that it s 100 percent fine trump said these weren t just off the cuff remarks for trump on his campaign website you can sign up to volunteer to be a trump election observer critics have decried his call to voters as voter intimidation which is illegal this looks like a sign up sheet for an election day goon squad our elders know about this kind of observation pic twitter com retwda4bhh if his remarks are found to be voter intimidation and if trump is deemed an agent of the republican national committee it would also violate a consent decree banning the rnc from such activity that decree which has been in place since 1982 was ordered in response to claims of voter intimidation against minorities in the 1970s and 80s according to politico s josh gerstein the consent decree states that the rnc must refrain from undertaking any ballot security activities in polling places or election districts where the racial or ethnic composition of such districts is a factor in the decision to monitor those areas it allows normal poll watching like rallying supporters to vote but not anything aimed at voter suppression like posting armed guards at polling locations or questioning people in an intimidating way before they vote it s possible trump is trying to use this as a fundraising ploy to get people s names says richard hasen a law professor at the university of california irvine if that s what this is i d be relieved but he s playing with fire here to be clear liberals love to throw out the voter intimidation card what we re advocating are open fair and honest elections trump spokesman jason miller in a statement the u s supreme court rejected the rnc s plea to remove the decree in 2013 but added an expiration date of dec 1 2017 if trump is violating the decree the dnc could ask for an extension of up to eight years according to hasen trump spokesman jason miller says claims that volunteer poll observers could be a form of voter intimidation are unfounded to be clear liberals love to throw out the voter intimidation card what we re advocating are open fair and honest elections miller said in a statement to npr s sarah mccammon he also added that poll watchers are standard for professional campaigns and pointed out poll watcher guides from around the country including new york and texas in his statement to npr miller echoed trump s concerns about a rigged system as we ve seen from crooked hillary s willingness to use and outright lie about government institutions for personal and political enrichment there s a lot of cheating going on miller said it s notable that trump made these remarks in pennsylvania it s a key state he ll need to win in november but hillary clinton has a big lead over trump there and according to a recent nbc news wall street journal poll trump is getting zero percent of the black vote in the state pennsylvania also notably struck down a voter id law in 2014 a fact that trump said was shocking in his friday speech voter id laws have long been criticized as a masked strategy to discourage minorities from voting last month a federal appeals court threw out a voter id law in north carolina that as judge diana gribbon motz wrote targets african americans with almost surgical precision trump s suggestion that the election will be rigged is one he keeps making even though proven cases of voter fraud are actually very rare as of 2014 a law professor at loyola law school in los angeles who has spent years tracking fraud allegations had found only 31 instances of voter fraud out of more than 1 billion votes cast in the absence of a pennsylvania id law that might deter certain voters trump s call to action could be seen as another strategy to deter voters voter intimidation and unlike voter fraud voter intimidation has been a problem historically it s what the rnc consent decree is trying to prevent and it s not restricted to the gop during the 2008 election in philadelphia two members of the new black panther movement were charged with voter intimidation after they stationed themselves outside of polling locations the department of justice later dropped the case which led to criticism that the obama administration was unwilling to prosecute the black men for civil rights violations npr thanks our
