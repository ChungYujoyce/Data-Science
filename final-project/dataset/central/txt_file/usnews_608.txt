protection bureau in 2007 while still teaching at harvard law school yang founded venture for america a nonprofit and fellowship focused on creating jobs in cities across america he is also known for advocating about the threat of automation yang who has no political experience has made it much further than other candidates that pundits had initially told voters to watch out for harris former texas rep beto o rourke and new york sen kristin gillibrand have all since dropped out of the race but yang is still qualifying for debates i think he s certainly appealing to a certain part of the electorate that wants someone new and fresh want someone younger doesn t necessarily want a politician wants someone who s coming from a different world and he seems to be checking those boxes says o mara new jersey sen cory booker hawaii rep tulsi gabbard and former hud secretary jul an castro each met the donor threshold but fell short of the polling requirements fivethirtyeight reports that fewer polls have been released in the past few weeks compared before previous debates which could have hurt their chances five other democratic candidates met none of the requirements colorado sen michael bennet mayor bloomberg former maryland rep john delaney former massachusetts governor deval patrick and self help author marianne williamson bloomberg has announced he won t accept any donations so he won t be able to qualify for any of the debates california sen kamala harris dropped out of the race on dec 3 surprising many the former california attorney general was once thought of as a leading candidate and had generated a huge amount of buzz when she first entered the race earlier this year in the weeks before dropping out she had struggled with poor polling and fundraising numbers miramar fla mayor wayne messam montana gov steve bullock and former pennsylvania rep joe sestak have all also dropped out since the november debate ten other candidates have dropped out of the race new york sen kirsten gillibrand former alaska sen mike gravel former west virginia state senator richard ojeda former colorado gov john hickenlooper washington gov jay inslee massachusetts rep seth moulton california rep eric swalwell ohio rep tim ryan new york city mayor bill de blasio and former texas rep beto o rourke pbs newshour and politico have announced four co moderators newshour anchor and managing editor judy woodruff politico chief political correspondent tim alberta pbs newshour white house correspondent yamiche alcindor and pbs newshour senior national correspondent amna nawaz woodruff has covered politics for more than four decades having moderated multiple presidential primary debates and as well as the famous 1988 vice presidential debate where senator lloyd bentsen said jack kennedy was a friend of mine senator you are no jack kennedy before serving as politico s chief political correspondent alberta previously wrote for the conservative magazine national review and covered the republican party according to nbc the dnce resisted the choice of alberta arguing he wouldn t be suited to moderate a democratic primary debate due to the labor dispute the importance of organized labor in the united states will likely be discussed former secretary of state hillary clinton won more union members than president trump did in 2016 but trump earned the best margin for a republican candidate since 1984 according to the washington post the 2020 democratic candidates will try to chip away at that support the house of representatives impeached president trump late wednesday night and the historic vote will almost definitely come up despite the candidates not having many differences of opinion on the issue you still have a fair number of senators on the stage who could very easily be in the middle of a trial of the president when they would otherwise be campaigning in iowa and new hampshire in january says seth masket a professor of political science at the university of denver so just some discussion about what they plan to do about that or what people need to know going into that might be useful the stages lack of diversity could also be a topic of conversation one of the most notable things will be the absence of kamala harris masket continues and her particular sets of issues that she s brought up including a number of issues related to race and poverty and talking about struggles of african american women and that could be a very noticeable absence booker castro and gabbard s absence might also draw attention to the dwindling amount of prominent voices of color on stage american university s barker tells time that the usual democratic issues health care reform taxes immigration reform and gun control will all likely come up again medicare for all has been an area where buttigieg has attacked warren and he might attempt to hit her on the topic again trade could also come up more than usual due to the house s debate over the usmca trump s replacement for nafta jaime dominguez a professor of political science at northwestern tells time that the house s recent passage of a bill to grant a path to citizenship to immigrant farmworkers might put more pressure on candidates to advocate for comprehensive immigration reform while he won t be on stage bloomberg may also be mentioned i could imagine his name coming up as part of a discussion of the influence of the mega wealthy on politics warren has been trying to use bloomberg as a foil kyle kondik the managing editor of political forecaster sabato s crystal ball at the university of virginia center for politics writes in an email steyer a billionaire who will be on stage might also take some heat for the same reason buttigieg and warren have come into clearer conflict and that may be a larger feature of this debate writes kondik the pair have recently fought over transparency each pushing the other to reveal more details of their previous corporate work also at this point only seven candidates will be on the stage kondik continues that gives all of the candidates more time to speak and could allow for more confrontations among the candidates one of the other more recent shifts is that we re seeing the candidates starting to go more negative on each other adds masket interestingly there s been not so much fire directed at biden which is surprising considering he continues to lead the pack but there s a pretty substantial fight for second place hans noel an associate professor at georgetown university s department of government says he thinks buttigieg sees himself as an alternative to biden and might try to differentiate himself from biden in the debate by continuing to go after warren and sanders buttigeg in turn might face more attack since he has risen in the polls more attacks will likely be directed at pete than previously barker adds i also expect klobuchar to be on the offensive since this is really her last shot there is a lot of evidence that most voters don t see the race in terms of an establishment vs a progressive wing noel writes in an email but the candidates do seem to see it that way and that may shape their strategy over the past few months joe biden has continued to lead in the polls while warren buttigieg and sanders have swapped around second and third place warren has declined a bit buttigieg has increased most of the shifts are minor i d say we still have a four or five person race writes noel in an email to time here are the polling averages of the candidates in the debate according to realclearpolitics polling average on dec 19 will thursday s debate even affect the polls per kondik it s hard to say there has been some movement in the race over the past several months but it s hard to tie these movements to the actual debates the one striking bit of movement was harris s growth after the first debate but she later declined and is not even a candidate anymore but for some lower polling candidates these debates could one of the last opportunities to pitch themselves to to the voters before the primary season heats up in 2020 they need these moments to make an impression and try to shift the trajectory of their campaigns kind of bring up boost up their support adds o mara and we always have the vice presidential primary that s going on simultaneously but she continues when voting actually starts that s when the action happens and the voters may surprise us who knows how this is going to play out write to madeleine carlisle at
