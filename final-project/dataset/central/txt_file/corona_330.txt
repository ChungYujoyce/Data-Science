you take precautions such as frequently cleaning your hands with soap orhand sanitizer and staying at least 3 feet away from anyone who is coughing or sneezing as things stand today based on the information we have from the centers for disease control and prevention and information from local and state public health officials i don t see any basis for recommendations that people not dine out says food safety expert benjamin chapman a professorat north carolina state university coronavirus is a respiratory illness spread through droplets from a cough or sneeze to someone else s nose or eyes there s no evidence that the illnessis transmitted through food says craig hedberg a university of minnesota professor and an expert on food borne illness one of the concerns that everybody has is if you are out in the public and you are in close proximity with other people are you going to be exposed to potential respiratory secretions he says taking precautions you can continue to dine out with fairly minimal risk hedberg says but that recommendation does not apply to people in high risk groups who are being advised by the cdc to avoid crowds older people and those with underlying conditions in areas where the virus is spreading should take steps to keep their distance from others and stay home as much as possible and that includes eating out says leana wen an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy and management at george washington university s milken school of public health and a former health commissioner for the city of baltimore young and healthy individuals can continue toeatout if they take the recommended precautions public health experts say if you are unsure whether it s safe to eat out consult the latest information from your local and state public health officials and from the cdc follow the advice of your local public health official we can t give blanket advice because communities and people are so different wen says the more we learn about the coronavirus and the farther it spreads the recommendations maychange public health experts urge everyone to stay tuned tothe latest information from local public health officials and the cdc recommendations will vary depending on the current conditions in your local community as cities and states experience more cases and cases that can t be linked to other known sources of exposure it increases the likelihood that we will see unrecognized chains of transmission hedberg says community spread of the virus may increase the need to reduce your exposure in public settings coronavirus is not known to be transmitted through food but hard surfaces utensils menus salt and pepper shakers condiments door handles tables can be contaminated by droplets so throughout your meal each time you touch something the menu while ordering or the ketchup bottle when loading upyour burger avoid touching your face or eating until you wash your hands or rub them with hand sanitizer one of the biggest benefits we have with this virus is that hand sanitizer is really effective against it and hand washing is a good protective measure chapman says public health experts say it s critical that anyone who is feeling sick should not set food in restaurantsto avoid exposing patrons and staff one of the main messages i want to send to people is ifyou are not well you should stay home hedberg says if you go out and there are people coughing and sneezing around you that would make youa little uncomfortable to be fair to the other people in the restaurant youshould not be there on tuesday mgm resorts international announced it would shut down buffets on thelas vegas stripstarting sunday the buffet closures at popular hotels including bellagio mgm grand mandalay bay the mirage luxor and excalibur are temporary and willbe evaluated on a weekly basis mgm resorts said to the extent that one of the features of a buffet is people are queuing up to get access to the food that means there are a lot more people you could be exposed to hedberg says if you re going to a buffet in a city that has had 100 cases of coronavirus that would pose potentially more of a risk than a buffet in a city that has had no cases chapman says restaurants don t have to put the kibosh on buffets but they should take precautions after all thoseprotective plexiglass shields are called sneeze guards for a reason i do think there are ways to manage buffets safely he says for example restaurants could staff buffets with food servers kind of like the cafeteria line in school instead of patrons serving themselves with tongs he says if you are nervous ask an employee to serve you or ask for protective gloves and don t handle serving utensils at a buffet and then touch your face until you wash your hands or use hand sanitizer the short answer is yes the cdc is advising people at high risk in outbreak areas to have food brought to the house by family members friends or delivery services a number of services including postmates and doordash are letting customers request that deliveries be left on the doorstep to limit exposure even more doordash driversare being advised to clean their cars and hot bags and urged tostay at home if they feel sick especially if they are suffering from respiratory symptoms larry lynch senior vice president of certification and operations for the national restaurant association said his group is advising restaurants to pay closer attention to drivers and make sure they aren t showing any symptoms before they go out on delivery runs i think contactless delivery is a good alternative chapman says but again be sure to wash your hands after handling the packaging though we don t really have a good sense that packaging is a good place to transfer this pathogen he says diners are understandably concerned about being exposed to ailing food service workers who prepare and serve so much of the food we eat every day as far as we know the coronavirus is not transmitted by a fecal or oral route and it s extremely unlikely to get the disease from someone with the infection who is preparing food wen says but it s still good to take precautions when dining out restaurant industry groups say they are advising members to make sure their staffers are not coming to work sick the cdc says 1 in 5 food service workers have admitted going to work at least once in the previous year with symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea if restaurants are doing their job the workers serving should be free of symptoms andthe kitchen staff should be free of symptoms hedberg says the top two ways that patrons want restaurants to respond to the coronavirus according to technomic give sick employees time off and follow proper sanitation procedures the food service industry is heavily regulated by health officials and has had protocols in place for decades to prevent food borne diseases such as norovirus which causes nearly 60 of all foodborne illness outbreaks the restaurant industry is really prepared for this because of influenza norovirus hepatitis a and other viruses they spend a lot of time thinking about this in the restaurant industry chapman says a lot of thought has been put into regulations and operating procedures restaurants across the country say they are doubling down on cleaning procedures and instituting new ones to keep customers and employees safe in san francisco word a cafe has rearranged its dining room to keep tables 5 feet apart wherever possible and it s encouraging diners to take food home or outside it s also waiving all charges for take out packaging order ahead and staff can deliver your food curbside we hope this is taken as a signal to our community that we value the health of everyone who comes through our doors owners carl hall and kat anderson said in an email many restaurants are increasing the number of hand sanitizer dispensers cleaning shared serving utensils more frequently wiping down chairs and tables after each use with fresh cleaning cloths or disposable towelsand disinfectants that the environmental protection agency says are effective against covid 19 and sanitizing other high touch surfaces more often lynch says the national restaurant association has suggested restaurants provide hand sanitizer and tissuesto patrons to add to their comfort level concerned patrons should also ask the restaurant manager what additional safety measures are being taken lynch said if you have any nagging doubts check the food safety ratings you
