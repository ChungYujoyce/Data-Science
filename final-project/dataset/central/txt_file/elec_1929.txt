implausible but jones did it becoming the first democrat to clinch a senate win in the state since 1992 the result clearly puts control of the senate in play in 2018 and even though moore had large and unique liabilities there are a lot of republicans who just became a lot more nervous about the political zeitgeist black voters african american voters were the key to jones s victory the democrat

d n j played their part in trying to maximize black turnout as did some celebrities including nba hall of famerand alabama native charles barkley jones s history was undoubtedly part of his appeal in 2001 and 2002 he successfully prosecuted two ku klux klan members for the infamous 1963 birmingham church bombing that killed fourblack girls but it seems certain that many african american voters were also keen to deliver a dual rebuke to moore and trump the pivotal nature of the black vote in the special election comes as a powerful rebuttal to those within democratic ranks who have argued that the party is too focused on identity politics jones thanked black voters during his victory speech and also alluded to alabama s anguished racial history we ve usually taken the wrong fork he said tonight ladies and gentlemen you ve taken the right road roy moore s accusers leigh corfman beverly young nelson and others the women who accused the republican nominee of molestation and sexual assault were apparently motivated by profound and personal concerns rather than a desire for political gain even so it would have been a fresh trauma for them if moore had become a u s senator in

republican national committee rnc and the gop s senate campaign arm the nrsc had said they would provide no backing for moore because of the accusations of sexually predatory behavior against him the rnc reversed itself after trump made plain his support for moore but gardner insisted that the nrsc which he chairs would not follow suit gardner told the weekly standard that his group would never endorse moore adding i won t let that happen that looks like a smart decision now sen cory booker d n j booker apotential 2020 presidential candidate visited the state in the closing days campaigning for jones and highlighting his own family s ties to alabama few would claim that booker s influence on its own made the difference but his visit has boosted his profile and he is now associated with a historic democratic victory that will do him no harm especially since the jockeying for position for 2020 is already underway the new york times s needle of prediction the needle graphic used by the times became the focus of much social media comment early in the evening especially from anguished liberals who recalled its wild and abrupt swing from clinton to trump during the night of the presidential election this time though the needle s early movement pointing toward an upset jones victory proved accurate losers president trump tuesdaywas a very bad night for trump capping a miserable involvement in alabama politics the president was first persuaded to endorse strange over moore during september s republican primary against his populist instincts he smarted over that misjudgment then backed moore with increasing vigor in the closing stretch of the race he penned tweets warning alabamians against voting for jones recorded a robocall for moore and held a rally just across the state line in pensacola fla on fridaynight moore s defeat is a startling slap in the face for the president from a state he won by almost 30 points over clinton the result could also accelerate the movement of republican lawmakers away from him as they seek to safeguard their own political futures stephenbannon bannon went all in on moore visiting the state to campaign for him breitbart the news organization helmed by bannon at times resembled an adjunct of the moore campaign now the result has buttressed the anti bannon case often heard among washington republicans in short that the president s former chief strategist promotes candidates who are unelectable and greatly exaggerates his own strategic skills before the results were knownon tuesdayevening a former chief of staff to mcconnell josh holmes tweeteda sarcastic thank you to bannon for showing us how to lose the reddest state in the union the pugnacious bannon will live to fight another day and he still has the president s ear but this was a major setback the republican national committee rnc the rnc s decision to come off the sidelines late in the race and get behind moore backfired spectacularly inside the beltway the organization s defenders argue that it had little choice but to back moore once trump had done so but the bigger picture is one in which the national party first refused to back an alleged child molester then decided to do so after all and then lost anyway that s a debacle by any standard the republican agenda once jones is seated the gop s thin majority in the senate will be reduced still further the party will control just 51 of the upper chamber s 100 seats the republican push for tax reform should not be affected since mcconnell had already indicated that the winner in alabama would not be seated before the end of the year but passing any further legislation just got significantly more complicated for the gop the religious right evangelicals had for the most part remained foursquare behind moore both in alabama and beyond billy graham s son franklin graham tweeted early on election day that he was praying for roy moore but religious conservatives weren t enough to bring moore over the finish line a reminder that the power of the religious right even in such a socially conservative state as alabama isn t guaranteed to carry all
