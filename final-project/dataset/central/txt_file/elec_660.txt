 elise hu this is the first of two 1988 debates between george h w bush and michael dukakis in the second debate the answer dukakis gave to a question about whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered was considered a huge blunder dennis cook ap hide caption this is the first of two 1988 debates between george h w bush and michael dukakis in the second debate the answer dukakis gave to a question about whether he would support the death penalty if his wife were raped and murdered was considered a huge blunder even before the final balloons fell on the republican and democratic conventions pundits were talking up the next big american political viewing experience the presidential debates these match ups in which candidates actually share a stage after months of bruising one another from far range can lead to moments of rhetorical brilliance or the opposite getting caught off guard and making a gaffe historically debates have been seen as potential game changers in tight races but political scientist john sides writing in the washington monthly claims that data tells another story writes sides that presidential debates can be game changers is a belief almost universally held by political pundits and strategists political scientists however aren t so sure indeed scholars who have looked most carefully at the data have found that when it comes to shifting enough votes to decide the outcome of the election presidential debates have rarely if ever mattered sides an associate professor of political science at george washington university continues the small or nonexistent movement in voters preferences is evident when comparing the polls before and after each debate or during the debate season as a whole political lore often glosses over or even ignores the polling data even those who do pay attention to polls often fail to separate real changes from random blips due to sampling error a more careful study by political scientist james stimson finds little evidence of game changers in the presidential campaigns between 1960 and 2000 stimson writes there is no case where we can trace a substantial shift to the debates at best debates provide a nudge in very close elections like 1960 1980 or 2000 a even more comprehensive study by political scientists robert erikson and christopher wlezien which includes every publicly available poll from the presidential elections between 1952 and 2008 comes to a similar conclusion excluding the 1976 election which saw president jimmy carter s lead drop steadily throughout the fall the best prediction from the debates is the initial verdict before the debates in other words in the average election year you can accurately predict where the race will stand after the debates by knowing the state of the race before the debates erikson and wlezien conclude that evidence of debate effects is fragile debates do help voters learn new information but what voters learn is unlikely to change many minds sides writes debates tend to draw the politically inclined who already favor one party or the other some political scientists argue and timing is also a factor the televised sparring happens so close to election day that in several states early in person voting will have started before even the first debate even so expect the three televised presidential debates and one vice presidential faceoff to draw millions of eyes each general election cycle the debates are among the most watched television programs of the campaign season and this year will certainly be no different latest polls show president obama and republican mitt romney continue to engage in a tight race less than eight weeks before the nov 6 election romney and obama are schedule to go head to head on oct 3 oct 16 and oct 22 that final debate is dedicated solely to foreign policy an issue that was all but dormant this cycle until the international events of this week the vice presidential debate between joe biden and paul ryan is set for oct 11 npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
