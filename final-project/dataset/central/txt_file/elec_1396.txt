the five most recent christian science articles with a spiritual perspective every monday donald trump is a singular political phenomenon hillary clintonseems coordinated and almost corporate at a time of political upheaval it s unclear which advantage is stronger loading july 28 2016 to anoint hillary clinton as the official 2016 democratic presidential nominee it takes a village in cleveland last week at the republican national convention donald trump s face was the dominant image it loomed from videos over the stage it stared out from t shirts outside the arena pointing a finger and saying stuff like hillary you re fired three of the four convention nights mr trump himself appeared on stage this week in philadelphia the democrats are using a much different more traditional approach the party s biggest names have marched to the podium one by one and praised mrs clinton while bashing trump except for a brief hug with president obama on wednesday night clinton herself has stayed more behind the scenes that will change somewhat with her acceptance speech thursday but this contrast in stagecraft is a symbol of the essential differences between the trump and clinton campaigns trump is in newt gingrich s word a pirate a master of reaching out across global media platforms to grab the world s attention with a sudden bold stroke sometimes the move misses witness yesterday s uproar about whether he should have urged russia to hack and release missing clinton emails but the action and resulting attention is the thing clinton is more of a communitarian heir and presumptive next leader of an existing political coalition she s guarded by nature her campaign seems a coordinated almost corporate effort of many people doing many things some visible surrogate speeches and some not microtargeted emails the result is a fascinating clash of new versus old approaches to media organized versus insurgent marketing and two personalities as different as july and december it s a race that scholars and political pros will be studying for years trump is consciously running an unrestrained and uncontrolled campaign while it is true that clinton s methodology creates distance between herself and voters says jeffrey engel director of the center for presidential history at southern methodist university in dallas clinton s approach is an attempt to dramatically cut down on mistakes engel adds it s a prevent defense in part this split is rooted in traditional differences between the parties it s a political truism that the republican party is more organized around ideology while the democratic party is more transactional the former involves what george h w bush called the vision thing and punchy presentations the latter means making democratic interest groups happy with targeted policies thus trump s campaign website is thin on policy details and long on assertions that it is only the gop nominee who can make america great again clinton s corresponding site is so numbingly detailed that it has a section on curtailing horse soring the use of chemicals to exaggerate gait as new york times columnist david brooks pointed out this week the differences are also personal trump has been a celebrity for years and is as comfortable making media appearances as he is taking a nap he obviously believes that there is no such thing as bad news coverage there are only chances for attention and possible votes missed in contrast clinton herself seems almost physically absent from the campaign trump has correctly pointed out that it has been more than 235 days since the democratic nominee last held a press conference she sits for personal interviews but not at trump s pace she s begun calling in to news shows but only since trump has demonstrated that s an efficient and effective way to control a media appearance in clinton s case that s probably a learned behavior the drama of clinton s decades in public life and the clintons perception that they have been badly treated by the media and political opponents has caused her to retreat behind a kind of gauzy curtain she s someone who s every word is very guarded publicly because she feels she s kind of been burned says brian rosenwald a political scientist at the university of pennsylvania and author of a forthcoming book on the political impact of talk radio she s also a policy wonk as much as a politician when she answers a question she ll often dance around it at first looking at all angles before concluding that essentially it s complicated asked about fracking she ll talk about its environmental dangers and energy benefits then outline when it is or isn t ok asked about immigration reform she ll talk about its history and ideals and then get into a multipoint program trump doesn t do such nuance in his own acceptance speech he flatly declared that nobody knows the system better than me which is why i alone can fix it in his surety and brevity he s the twitter candidate a fit for the new facebook age clinton may be not unlike most candidates in her desire for word control and image protection it s trump in this context who is unique the agent of disruption more and more our culture is headed towards quick sound bites donald trump fits that very well hillary clinton probably wants to give in depth policy answers and that stuff doesn t transfer as well to social media brian rosenwald says clinton knows that she has to up her communications game given her opponent s skills she or more likely an aide has sharpened her twitter approach in recent months for instance posts are punchier and less policy oriented her advantage is that she is not alone unlike trump she has inherited a strong party network that has been building voter lists and studying new targeting techniques for years in that sense she may be the candidate of the brave new electronic age while trump lags back in a traditional era to understand clinton s use of social media you have to go back and recognize she remains part of the broader obama coalition the obama people were really revolutionary in employing data metrics and new technology in order to micro target voters says professor engel of smu thus clinton or the clinton team may be good at communications efforts that are not readily apparent take video games the obama campaign went so far as to buy ads within popular games such as madden football in 2008 and 2012 a player scanning the virtual madden stadium would have seen a virtual obama billboard hanging over the field these ads were targeted to those playing madden online in 10 swing states more and more everything is targeted every ad is different everything is slicing and dicing the audience says professor rosenwald in that sense clinton versus trump might not be not an old media candidate versus a new media one as much as it is two competing versions of adapting to the changes wrought by the electronic age get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox it s not clear whether one is superior over the other there s not great data on whether microtargeting actually drives votes trump may find out that in the end there were days when not saying anything might have been preferable to saying something controversial in about 100 days we ll get a result that will shed some light on these questions link
