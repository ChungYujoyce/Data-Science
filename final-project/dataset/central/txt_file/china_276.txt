foreign minister loading march 18 2013 wang yi china s newly named foreign minister has a reputation as a brilliant and urbane diplomat he is also a wily negotiator with some tricks up his sleeve ten years ago he was trying to persuade the americans to sit down alone with the north koreans for talks on pyongyang s nuclear program as north korea wanted washington refused and insisted that the chinese be present after a day of fruitless to ing and fro ing in beijing mr wang hosted a banquet for the three negotiating teams halfway through the dinner he and his deputy stepped out to the toilet they said over the next 10 minutes one by one all the chinese diplomats slipped surreptitiously away from their banqueting tables before they knew it us negotiators found they were in ade factobilateral meeting with the north koreans the americans declined to talk about anything substantive and wang s ploy failed according to japanese author yoichi funabashi who recounts the incident in his book the peninsula question but the sly maneuver illustrates what one acquaintance calls the subtlety and flexibility of wang s approach to diplomacy his expertise his judgment and his style will lend him authority predicts paul evans a professor of international relations at the university of british columbia in canada he will be more than an implementer he will be a shaper unlike his two immediate predecessors at the head of the foreign ministry wang is not a us specialist although he spent six months at georgetown university in the late 1990s and speaks good english he speaks japanese however like a native according to people who know him well wang has spent his career in asia and is one of china s foremost experts on beijing s major regional rival japan with whom beijing is currently locked in a fierce territorial dispute over a group of islands in the east china sea it is a signal to the region that they are putting an asia specialist in the job says professor evans his knowledge of japan is deep but he is not necessarily soft on japan adds evans who once hosted wang at a dinner in his home and has met him often since he is a firm chinese nationalist like many of his generation now rising to the top of chinese politics wang was a sent down youth spending eight years during the cultural revolution working on a farm in northeastern china learning from the peasantry he did not waste his time recalls wang xiaoping a classmate of wang yi s at university in beijing where the two studied japanese he had studied literature and history by himself wang xiaoping no relation to the foreign minister remembers his classmate studying harder than most others and being quite open minded he did not just accept what he was told he had his own ideas on leaving university wang yi joined the foreign ministry he came from an unremarkable family but married into foreign policy aristocracy his father in law had been premier zhou enlai s top foreign affairs aide he has a reputation for modesty though at a recent chinese new year class reunion wang xiaoping says i thought we would talk about his next job but he didn t raise the issue and neither did anybody else wang is also said to be popular in the foreign ministry which he left five years ago to head the taiwan affairs office i think he will be welcomed back to the ministry says wang yusheng a former chinese ambassador to nigeria and colombia former classmates colleagues and others who have come across wang agree that the man is exceptionally intelligent he has an incisive intellect says evans probing and piercing with an ability to see an issue from two or three different angles wang has clearly been a high flyer from his early days in the foreign ministry appointed to the number three job in beijing s tokyo embassy within 10 years of leaving university and later becoming the youngest deputy minister on the roster he later became china s ambassador to japan where he further cultivated his contacts given the tense state of sino japanese relations he is the right man for the job of minister says wang xiaoping who does business in japan japanese politicians and officials know him he can get information directly if there are problems going forward between china and japan adds evans it will not be for lack of understanding of japanese signals get the monitor
