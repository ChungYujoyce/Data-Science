we found a mountain of false and misleading statements in the second meeting of the presidential nominees by robert farley eugene kiely brooks jackson lori robertson d angelo gore vanessa schipani zachary gross jenna wang and sydney schaedel posted on october 10 2016 st louis in a sometimes nasty second presidential debate there were again several calls by the candidates for fact checkers to referee competing statements which we are happy to oblige but even when republican donald trump and democrat hillary clinton weren t calling out each other on the facts we found many of their uncontested claims to be misleading or false and there were more claims that we ve heard before on trade foreign affairs and nuclear weapons note to readers deputy managing editor robert farley was at the debate at washington university this story was written by farley with the help of the entire staff based in the philadelphia region and washington d c an annotated transcript of the debate with our fact checks can be found here the second of three presidential debates was held on oct 9 at washington university in st louis the much anticipated town hall style matchup came as both candidates were facing renewed scrutiny republican nominee donald trump for lewd comments about women madein 2005 but just released on oct 7 and democratic nominee hillary clinton for the public release of hacked emails from her campaign as in the first debate we found plenty of distortions of fact clinton exaggerated when she said the u s was now energy independent clinton you know that we are now for the first time ever energy independent we are not dependent upon the middle east but the middle east still controls a lot of the prices we ve got to remain energy independent it gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the middle east wehaveenough worries over there without having to worry about that actually the u s imported 11 percent of the total energy it consumed in 2015 according to themost recent figures from the energy information administration and that percentage increased to 12 percent in the first six months of this year while it s correct to say that last year s dependence on imported energy from all sources not just petroleum was the lowest in a long time it doesn t represent total independence and it s not even the first time ever that the percentage has been so low it was below 11 percent every single year from 1949 the start of eia s figures through 1971 judging by her repeated mention of the middle east we suspect clinton was thinking specifically of oil imports and not total energy but looking only at petroleum she s even further off base to claim independence in 2015 the u s imported 24 percent of the petroleum and refined products that it consumed to be sure that was the lowest annual level of dependency on imports since 1970 however dependency on imports has begun creeping upward once again for the first eight months of 2016 imports have accounted for an average of 27 5 percent of consumption furthermore the u s is still importing a fair amount of oil from persian gulf states despite what clinton said about being not dependent upon the middle east the total imports of petroleum and petroleum products from persian gulf states averaged 1 5 million barrels per day last year that s 45 percent less than the u s imported from them in 2001 when the total hit an annual high but it s still a long way from zero trump said he never tweeted check out a sex tape in the wee hours of the morning a few days after the first presidential debate that s false he did debate moderator anderson cooper asked trump whether he had the discipline to be president given the fact that he sent out a series of tweets between 3 a m and 5 a m including one that told people to check out a sex tape in the days after the first presidential debate trump responded no there wasn t check out a sex tape it was just take a look at the person former miss universe alicia machado that clinton built up to be this wonderful girl scout who was no girl scout but trump did sayexactly that on sept 30 at 5 30 a m trump tweeted did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past alicia m become a u s citizen so she could use her in the debate did crooked hillary help disgusting check out sex tape and past alicia m become a u s citizen so she could use her in the debate donald j trump realdonaldtrump september 30 2016 as for the supposed sex tape trump may be referring to a grainy night vision scene in a spanish reality tv show in which machado could behaving sex under covers there were several claims about clinton s emails that were either wrong misleading or lacked context trump twisted the factswhen he directly addressed clinton about her use ofa private email system while secretary of state you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena you delete 33 000 emails and then you acid wash them or bleach them as you would say a very expensive process trump said trump is referring to 31 830 emails that clinton s lawyers had deemed personal and as a result did not have to be turned over to the government as we have written the department s policy allows its employees to determine which emails are work related and must be preserved messages that are not records may be deleted when no longer needed according to thestate department s foreign affairs manual 5 fam 443 5 so clinton was entitled to delete those nearly 32 000 emails it is true that the emails were deleted after clinton received a subpoena from a republican controlled house committee investigation into the 2012 deaths of four americans in benghazi but there is no evidence that clinton knew that the emails were deleted after the subpoena was issued a quick recap of what happened according to fbi notes of its investigation in december 2014 a clinton attorney told platte river networks which at the time was managing clinton s private server that clinton had preserved her work related emails and decided she no longer needed access to any of her e mails older than 60 days cheryl mills clinton s former chief of staff instructed the prn employee who was not identified to modify the e mail retention policy on clinton s server to reflect this change fbi notes show on march 9 2015 clinton s attorney informed prn of the committee s subpoena the prn employee who deleted the emails told the fbi that he had an oh shit moment sometime between march 25 and march 31 2015 and deleted the clinton emails from the prn server clinton told the fbi that she was not aware that they were deleted in late march 2015 see pages 17 19for the fbi s notes on the deleted emails the fbi did not say when clinton learned when the emails had been deleted trump went too far when he said after getting the subpoena you delete 33 000 emails since there is no evidence at this time that shows she had knowledge of when the emails were deleted also trump said the emails were acid washed calling it a very expensive process neither statement is true as we wrote thefbi said that prn used bleachbit which is a free software program that does not involve the use of chemicals as for clinton she glossed over the facts when she said that there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server i was using that is true but fbi director james comey said it was possible that her email system was hacked because she sent and received emails while in the territory of sophisticated adversaries comey july 5 with respect to potential computer intrusion by hostile actors we did not find direct evidence that secretary clinton s personal e mail domain in its various configurations since 2009 was successfully hacked but given the nature of the system and of the actors potentially involved we assess that we would be unlikely to see such direct evidence we do assess that hostile actors gained access to the private commercial e mail accounts of people with whom secretary clinton was in regular contact from her personal account we also assess that secretary clinton s use of a personal e mail domain was both known by a large number of people and readily apparent she also used her personal e mail extensively while outside the united states including sending and receiving work related e mails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries given that combination of factors we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton s personal e mail account clinton claimed intelligence officials said this week that russians werebehind political hacking attacks including of the democratic nationalcommittee but trump said she doesn t know if russia is doing thehacking clinton is tilting closer toward the truth on this one clinton our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the kremlin meaning putin and the russian government are directing the attacks the hacking on american accounts to influence our election trump i notice any time anything wrong happens they like to say the russians the russians she doesn t know it s the russians doing the hacking maybe there is no hacking but they always blame russia on oct 7 the department of homeland security and office of the director of national intelligence on election security issued a joint statement saying they were confident that recent hacks into the email systems of the democratic party were directed by the russian government joint statement oct 7 the u s intelligence community usic is confident that the russian government directed the recent compromises of e mails from us persons and institutions including from us political organizations the recent disclosures of alleged hacked e mails on sites like dcleaks com and wikileaks and by the guccifer 2 0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of russian directed efforts these thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the us election process such activity is not new to moscow the russians have used similar tactics and techniques across europe and eurasia for example to influence public opinion there we believe based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts that only russia s senior most officials could have authorized these activities russia has denied any involvement but nbc news reported that u s intelligence officials were able to determine russia s involvement based on the signature of the attacks which hackers may not have realized they left behind clinton invoked abraham lincoln in defending a comment she made in a paid speech to apartment building landlords about politicians needing a public position and a private position q y ou say you need both a public and private position on certain issues so is it okay for politicians to be two faced clinton t hat was something i said about abraham lincoln and after having seen the wonderful steven spielberg movie called lincoln working to get the congress to approve the 13th amendment which prohibits slavery it was principled and it was strategic that was a great i thought a great display of presidential leadership the question referred to a private email message posted by wikileaks outlining some possibly troublesome passages from clinton s paid speeches the transcripts of which she has not made public it included this passage supposedly from a transcript of a speech clinton made to the national multi family council a trade group for the apartment industry on april 24 2013 emphasis added clinton as quoted by wikileaks you just have to sort of figure out how to getting back to that word balance how to balance the public and the private efforts that are necessary to be successful politically and that s not just a comment about today that i think has probably been true for all of our history and if you saw the spielberg movie lincoln and how he was maneuvering and working to get the 13th amendment passed and he called one of my favorite predecessors secretary seward who had been the governor and senator from new york ran against lincoln for president and he told seward i need your help to get this done and seward called some of his lobbyist friends who knew how to make a deal and they just kept going at it i mean politics is like sausage being made it is unsavory and it always has been that way but we usually end up where we need to be but if everybody s watching you know all of the back room discussions and the deals you know then people get a little nervous to say the least so you need both a public and a private position so we find clinton was correct to this extent if the wikileaks quote is accurate and clinton did not dispute it she was indeed holding the great emancipator up as an example to justify taking one position in public and another in back room discussions but she also was conceding that she sometimes feels it politically necessary to be two faced to use the phrase posed by the questioner while talking about bill clinton being abusive to women trump distorted the facts about a rape case that hillary clinton was involved in as a legal aid lawyer in 1975 trumpaccused hillary clinton of laughing at a 12 year old girl who was raped and claimed that clinton got the accused rapist off but clinton did not laugh at the girl and her client pleaded to a lesser offense also the rape case has nothing to do with bill clinton although viewers may have been misled into thinking that it did because of how trump discussed the case trump bill clinton was abusive to women hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously four of them are here tonight one of the women who is a wonderful woman at 12 years old was raped at 12 her client she represented got him off and she s seen laughing on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped kathy shelton that young woman is here with us tonight as we have written before clinton defended an accused rapist in 1975 when she worked at theuniversity of arkansas school legal aid clinic in her book living history clinton recalled that mahlon gibson a washington county prosecutor told her that the accused rapist wanted a woman lawyer to defend him and that gibson had recommended clinton to judge maupin cummings in a taped interview in 1980 clinton recalled the rape case and she can be heard laughing three times beginning with a joke she makes about the accuracy of polygraphs she said he took a lie detector test i had him take a polygraph which he passed which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs at another point clinton said the prosecutor balked at turning over evidence forcing her to go to the judge to obtain it so i got an order to see the evidence and the prosecutor didn t want me to see the evidence i had to go to maupin cummings and convince maupin that yes indeed i had a right to see the evidence clinton laughs before it was presented clinton did get the evidence which turned out to be a pair of the accused s underwear with a hole in it which clinton laughed about as she retold the story of taking the underwear to a forensic expert in new york clinton said that the expert told her that there wasn t enough material on the underwear to test in recalling the incident clinton said she told the judge that the forensic expert is ready to come up from new york to prevent this miscarriage of justice it was at this point that clinton laughed we leave it for others to judge if her laughter was appropriate but clinton wasn t laughing at the victim clintonalso didn t get him off the defendant pleaded guilty to a lesser offense and served one year in county jail and four years of probation in dueling tax claims the candidates distorted the effects of each other s tax plans trump said of clinton s plan she is raising everybody s taxes massively everybody no analyses by the nonpartisantax policy center and the pro businesstax foundation both concluded that almost all of the tax increases proposed by clinton would fall on the top 10 percent of taxpayers hardest hit would be the less than 0 1 percent of taxpayers who earn more than 5 million per year nearly all of the tax increases would fall on the top 1 percent the bottom 95 percent of taxpayers would see little or no change in their taxes the tax policy center concluded clinton meanwhile claimed trump s plan would end up raising taxes on middle class families millions of middle class families an analysisby new york university school of law professor lily l batchelder found that trump s plan would actually significantly raise taxes for millions of low and middle income families with children with especially large tax increases for working single parents in all the reportestimated trump s plan would increase taxes for about 7 8 million families with children who are minors or roughly 25 million individuals but the tax foundation told us that while it was able to replicate those results its full analysis of trump s plan found that on average middle income taxpayers would get a tax cut as ourdistributional tables show the typical middle class family would get a net tax cutof several hundred dollars alan cole an economist with the tax foundation told us simply put the middle class as a whole would see a tax reduction but some middleclass families would see a tax increase the two also sparred over the so called carried interest loophole trump who proposes to close it incorrectly said clinton wants to keep it hillary clinton has friends that want all of these provisions including the carried interest provision which is very important to wall street people trump said but they really want the carried interest provision which i believe hillary clinton is leaving and it s very interesting why she is leaving carried interest according to her tax plan clinton wants to close the carried interest loophole that allows hedge fund private equity and other wall street money managers to avoid paying ordinary income rates on their earnings trump has also proposed this clinton noted that she has been in favor of getting rid of this loophole since she was a senator from new york while it is true that clinton came out against carried interest during her tenure in the senate she was the last of the democratic presidential candidates in 2007to do so trump again pushed the idea that clinton s 2008 presidential campaign had started the false rumor that obama was not born in the u s and was ineligible to be president trump wrongly claimed that clinton s campaign manager said exactly that on television recently trump well you owe the president an apology because as you know very well your campaign sidney blumenthal he s another real winner that you have and he s the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago she was saying exactly that trump is wrong about patti solis doyle clinton s 2008 campaign manager solis doyle has said that a rogue volunteer coordinator in iowa was immediately fired when the campaign found out that the aide forwarded an email promoting the birther conspiracy and solis doyle said that she did apologize to obama campaign manager david plouffe for the incident this was not the kind of campaign we wanted to run she said she told plouffe as for blumenthal he has denied a claim made by mcclatchy s former bureau chief james asher that blumenthal a senior adviser to clinton s 2008 campaign encouraged mcclatchy to chase the story of obama s birth shashank bengali who now works at the los angeles times said asher told him to look into everything about obama s family in kenya according to politico asher gave politico an email that he received from bengali that said i can t recall if we specifically discussed the birther claim but i m sure that was part of what i researched other than that there is no clear evidence to support asher s account trump used an old gop scare tactic wrongly claiming that clinton wanted to implement a government run single payer health care system like canada s he also cherry picked high proposed premium increases in the exchanges and he said that the law should be replaced with something absolutely much less expensive when repealing the law is expected to increase federal deficits we ll start with the single payer claim trump she wants to go to a single payer plan somewhat similar to canada but she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything clinton supports making medicare available to those over age 55 and creatinga public option ora federal insurance plan that would compete with private plans on the aca exchanges she hasn t called for a single payer system before the affordable care act was passed republicans repeatedly warned of a government takeover of health care but the aca didn t do that instead it built upon and expanded private insurance as well as medicaid earlier versions of the legislation contained a public option or a federal insurance plan that would be offered along with private insurance on the aca exchanges where people who buy their own insurance can get coverage republicans claimed this public option would eventually lead to a canadian or british style system of complete government funded universal health care as we wrote at the time the impact of the public option would depend on how it was structured but one of the final versions of the house bill would have led to about 6 million americans joining the public plan according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office the public option wasn t included in the final bill that president obama signed into law but what had been proposed before still wasn t anywhere near single payer a system in which everyone would have health coverage provided by the government during the democratic primary campaign it wassen bernie sanders not clinton who called for a single payer system clinton criticized that idea saying early this year i don t believe number one we should be starting over we had enough of a fight to get to the affordable care act trump also cherry picked high proposed premium increases on the aca exchanges as he has done before saying your health insurance is going up by numbers that are astronomical 68 percent 59 percent 71 percent it s true that some insurers have requested high rate increases for 2017 premiums on the exchanges any increase above 10 percent has to be submitted and approved by government regulators for the next open enrollment period which begins nov 1 but other plans have proposed decreases the kaiser family foundation analyzed preliminary rates in cities in 16 states and washington d c and found the second lowest cost silver plan would increase by a weighted average of 9 percent from this year if the rates hold the change in premiums would vary widely from a drop of 13 percent in providence rhode island to a hike of 25 percent in nashville that s higher than the increase for 2016 which was only 2 percent for those areas also 80 percent of those buying exchange plans get federal subsidies which lower premium contributions to a percentage of their income as for employer based insurance plans where most insured americans get their coverage those premiumshave been rising at historical low rates for the past several years finally trump said that the aca is unbelievably expensive for our country we have to repeal it and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive but the cbo and joint committee on taxation s latest estimates on the impact of repealing the law find doing away with it would likely increase federal deficits over the 2016 2025 time period while there is uncertainty in such estimates cbo and jct say their best estimate is that repealing the aca would increase federal budget deficits by 137 billion over that 10 year period clinton went too far in touting the benefits of the aca saying that a provision to allow young adults to stay on their parents plans until age 26 was something that didn t happen before in fact at least 31 states already had similarprovisions before the law was enacted clinton but everybody else the 170 million of us who get health insurance through our employers got big benefits number one insurance companies can t deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition number two no lifetime limits which is a big deal if you have serious health problems number three women can t be charged more than men for our health insurance which is the way it used to be before the affordable care act number four if you re under 26 and your parents have a policy you can be on that policy until the age of 26 something that didn t happen before all of the provisions she rattled off were indeed part of the aca and it s true that the law extended policies nationwide allowing young adults under age 26 to remain on their parents plans that provision took effect in september 2010 but 31 states had similar measures in effect before then according to the national conference of state legislatures beforeimplementation of the aca at least 31 states required carriers to extend coverage to young adults the ncsl states the age at which insurers were no longer required to provide coverage to young adults under their guardians plans varied by state additionally some states required certain conditions to be met by young adults in order to be eligible for coverage under their guardians plans for example a number of states required that young adults be unmarried in order to qualify some states went beyond age 26 in new york and pennsylvania unmarriedyoung adults could remain on theirparents policies until age 30 and new jersey extended that to age 31 clinton also said that insurance companies can t deny you coverage because of a preexisting condition to be clear before the aca employer provided plans could exclude coverage of the preexisting condition temporarily for up to a year if a new employee had continuous coverage previously with a gap in coverage no longer than 63 days that employee wasgranted a waiver for that exclusion period equal to the time spent on the previous plan trump saidthat ambassador chris stevens sent 600 requests for help before he was killed in an attack on the u s diplomatic post in benghazi libya in september 2012 but as the washington post fact checker reported not all 600 came from stevens nor were they all requests for security upgrades as it may have appeared to those watching or listening to the debate the total refers to the cumulative number of security requests concerns from benghazi 2012 according to a chart the house select committee on benghazi showed during a congressional hearing in october 2015 and requests and concerns are not the same thing the fact checker said from its report washington post fact checker jan 26 a request is made via email or cable for physical security equipment or something related to the compound itself lighting barriers wire etc a gop congressional staff member explained weeks or months later the same unresolved issue is brought up again in a discussion that s a request and a concern in general concerns followed requests however some concerns are independent of a request such concerns could for example be expressed about the delay of issuing visas to ds agents kept out of libya concerns could be expressed about security personnel needing to provide their own holsters or protective gear etc requests meanwhile were about any specific security related need in benghazi a request for hundreds of sandbags would count as one request however officials could not say how many of the 600 were security requests and how many were concerns also the state department accountability review board which did call u s security in benghazi inadequate prior to the attack noted in its report that the agency made several security upgrades in 2012 so at least some of the security issues raised by officials were addressed which may not have been clear from trump s statement trump and clinton had a disagreement over president obama s failure to back up his threat to use military force ifsyrian president bashar assad used chemical weapons against his own people trump saidclinton was there as secretary of state with the so called line in the sand referring to obama s threat that assad s use of chemical weapons would cross a red line for us obama made that remark in august 2012 in response to a question aboutwhether he envision ed using u s military in syria clinton interrupted trump and claimed that she was not in office trump first of all she was there as secretary of state with the so called line in the sand which clinton no i wasn t i was gone i hate to interrupt you but at some point trump ok but you were in contact excuse me you were clinton at some point we need to do some fact checking here trump you were in total contact with the white house and perhaps sadly obama probably still listened to you i don t think he would be listening to you very much anymore it s not really clear if trump was criticizing obama for making the threat or not following through on it because clinton interrupted him but the fact is clinton was in office when obama made his threat in august 2012 but not when the president defended his failure to back it up in september 2013 clinton was secretary of state from january 2009 to february 2013 obama has been criticized for not following through on his threat so perhaps clinton quickly interrupted trump to distance herself from obama s decision not to take action however she did publicly support that decision even though she was no longer in office on sept 9 2013 clinton said a political solution is in the best interests of the u s i will continue to support his efforts and i hope that the congress will as well she said clinton repeated a campaign talking point that overstates income inequality clinton it s been unfortunate but it s happened that since the great recession the gains have all gone to the top and we need to reverse that all of the income gains since the great recession haven t gone to the top clinton usually says that90 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent and that was the case at least according to the work of economist emmanuel saez of the university of california berkeley based on preliminary 2013 data but that talking point is now outdated saez s most recent figures show that the top 1 percent of families captured 52 percent of the income growth from 2009 to 2015 that s also the case for 1993 2015 he wrote in his june 30 2016 report in 2014 and especially in 2015 the incomes of bottom 99 families have finally started recovering in earnestfrom the losses of the great recession by 2015 real incomes of bottom 99 have now recovered about two thirds of the losses experienced during thegreat recession from 2007 to 2009 top 1 families still capture 52 oftotal real income growth per family from 2009 2015 table 1 but the recoveryfrom the great recession now looks much less lopsided than in previousyears in stressing that muslims need to notify the police of wrongdoing in their communities trump claimed without evidence that many people saw the bombs all over the apartment of the two people that killed 14and wounded many many people in san bernardino last year as we have written a neighbor reportedly had noticed packages being delivered to the san bernardino home of the shooters and told a friend that the couple was doing a lot of work in their garage the friend said the neighbor did not want to racially profile the couple so she did not report it another worker in the neighborhood reported seeing well dressed middle eastern men walking from the house to lunch several times which the worker said he thought was unusual but also did not report but in neither case did anyone report that they had seen bombs all over the floor of the couple s home and failed to report it to authorities trump made the same claim about the san bernardino case after a massshooting in june at a gay night club in orlando at that time trump said muslims are the ones that have to report him referring to the orlando shooter omar mateen however mohammed a malik contacted the fbi in 2014 after he learned that mateen had been watching videotapes of anwar al awlaki a radical yemen based imam the fbi confirmed malik s story the washington post wrote and it was groundhog day for fact checkers on several other topics nuclear weapons clinton exaggerated when she saidshe was responsible for getting a treaty with russia to lower nuclear weapons the new start agreement which clinton helped negotiate caps the number of nuclear weapons that russia and the u s can deploy on long range or strategic launchers at 1 550 but as we wrote it does not require either side to destroy any nuclear weapons or reduce their nuclear stockpile and it doesn t place limits on shorter range nuclear weapons also russia was below the limit for deployed strategic nuclear warheads when the treaty took effect in 2011 and it has increased them since then as of sept 1 russia had 1 796 deployed strategic nuclear warheads up from 1 537 deployed warheads in february 2011 according to the department of state libya iraq and isis trump once again criticized clinton for bad judgments on libya on syria on iraq i mean her and obama whether you like it or not the way they got out of iraq the vacuum they ve left that s why isis formed in the first place trump conveniently leaves out that he posted a youtube video in february 2011 voicing support foru s intervention in libya to remove moammar gadhafi from power and that he toldcnn in a 2007 interview that the u s should declare victory in iraq and leave t his is a total catastrophe and you might as well get out now because you just are wasting time and finally trump pins too much blame for the rise in isis whose origin dates back to the bush administration on the troop withdrawal an issue we explored in length in our story trump s false obama isis link libyan oil it s been half a year and trump is still making the false claim that isis has a good chunk of libyan oil fields we first flagged this statement in april when an expert on libya s oil operations told us there s no evidence that the islamic state has control of any oil fields in that country trade deficit as he did during the first presidential debate trump wrongly claimed that last year the u s had an almost 800 billion trade deficit trump is referring to the trade deficit for goods which was 762 6 billion in 2015 according to the u s census bureau but the u s had a 262 2 billion trade surplus inservices including intellectual property such as software for a net trade deficit in goods and services of 500 4 billion last year nafta trump saidthat the north american free trade agreementwas signed by her husband referring to president bill clinton as we have written nafta was negotiated and signed by president george h w bush clinton signed the implementing legislation trump also said thetrade agreement had stripped us of manufacturing jobs a 2015 report from the nonpartisan congressional research service called the net impact relatively modest saying nafta did not cause the huge job losses feared by the critics orthe large economic gains predicted by supporters iraq war trump repeated that he was against the war in iraq and claimed that this has not been debunked but we have found no evidence that he was against the iraq war before it began at the first debate trump cited as evidence numerous conversations that he privately had with sean hannity of fox news he also has cited a january 2003 tv interview with fox news neil cavuto in the tv interview trump told cavuto that president bush needed to make a decision on iraq either you attack or you don t attack he says but he offered no opinion on what bush should do there is simply no public record of trump opposing the war before it started clinton on coal trump claimed that clinton wants to put all the coal miners out of business at a cnn town hall forum in march clinton said shewants to move away from coal and that in the shift to renewable energy production we re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business but she added we don t want to forget those people and she promised to bring renewable energy jobs to coal country to replace lost coal jobs clinton reiterated that position in the debate saying she supports moving toward more clean renewable energy as quickly as we can but i also want to be sure we do not leave people behind that is why i am the only candidate from the very beginning of this campaign who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country auxier richard burman len nunns jim and rohaly jeff
