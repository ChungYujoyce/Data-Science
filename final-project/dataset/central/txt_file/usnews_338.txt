i joined the bush quayle presidential campaign in the summer of 1988 when i was 25 writing something called the line of the day a one page memo of catchy facts stats anecdotes on whatever the topic of the day was once we arrived at the white house i began ghostwriting magazine articles by the president i would send him questionnaires through intraoffice mail and he d handwrite his answers it was like having a pen pal i worked my way up to doing more junior speechwriting stuff like the turkey pardoning and statements of congratulations to spelling bee winners the more i wrote for him the more i learned his style he didn t like to talk about himself much if we used the word i too much he d circle it to mean too many he felt that in a democracy the president should use the word we that s probably why he was generally extremely reticent to talk about his world war ii experience the most memorable speechwriting experience i had with him was writing a speech to commemorate the 50th anniversary of pearl harbor on dec 7 1991 one night at about 6 o clock in the oval office before the anniversary we started talking about what his memories were of the day he heard about pearl harbor despite his father s objections he went to sign up for the navy and got turned away because he was only 17 he showed back up on june 9 1942 a few days before his 18th birthday and enlisted becoming the youngest navy pilot at the time pearl harbor had a huge effect on his life though he flew 58 combat missions he bristled at being called a war hero he thought the war heroes were the ones who didn t come home he told me about all of the buddies he had lost the circumstances of their deaths and him having to write to their parents but every time he would tell me one of these stories i d say that s an amazing story can i put that in the speech and he d say oh god no you can t use that i m just telling you that and he wouldn t let me use any of it i pleaded sir give me something here i think he knew he would get very emotional while talking about it and he didn t want that to happen so we ended up deciding that the message of the speech i was working on one of four speeches given that day was to convey to his fellow veterans that it was time to bury the hatchet with japan one of his first acts as president was to attend the funeral of emperor hirohito the same emperor who was on the throne when bush s plane got shot down over the japanese island of chichi jima on sept 2 1944 he survived but his two crewman died the president thought it was important to send the message to all of the veterans of pearl harbor who were still alive that he did not bear any grudge against the emperor because of his own personal experiences during the war he had forgiven the japanese and it was time for them to as well it was a uniquely appropriate speech for george bush to give having survived being shot down i would make the argument that survivor s guilt was what motivated him to public service and to build his amazing career he wanted to show that his life was in gratitude for surviving and to repay his colleagues who didn t make it he wanted to make his life worthy of their sacrifices and he did what a remarkable life he led as told to olivia b waxman as part of a presidential history partnership between time history and the university of virginia s miller center of public affairs mary kate cary is a former speechwriter for george h w bush s administration and a senior fellow at the miller center write to olivia b waxman at olivia waxman time com
