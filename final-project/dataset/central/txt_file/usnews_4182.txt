i have been attacked in recent days by president trump and others for my conviction that people who are incarcerated should be given the right to vote i make no apologies for that position our country has had a long and shameful history of voter suppression at our founding despite rhetoric to the contrary only land owning white males were given the right to participate in our democracy lower income people women native americans african americans and young people were excluded we have been engaged in an ongoing 243 year project to expand participation in our democracy thankfully we have made much progress in that struggle but our work is not done not even close if we are serious about calling ourselves a democracy we must firmly establish that the right to vote is an inalienable and universal principle that applies to all american citizens 18 years and older period as american citizens all of us are entitled to freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom of assembly and all the other freedoms enshrined in our bill of rights we are also entitled to vote yes even if trump s former campaign manager and personal lawyer end up in jail they should still be able to vote regardless of who they cast their vote for read more commentary voters finally found a way to get things done and now politicians are thwarting them voting problems are predictable and avoidable here s how to fix them before 2020 death blow to partisan gerrymandering supreme court has a chance to make all votes count this is not a radical idea vermont and maine allow inmates to vote and more than 30 nations including israel south africa and canada also understand that voting rights for all citizens is a basic principle of democracy when we look at the history of why our country has banned incarcerated people from voting we must understand that the efforts to rob citizens of their voting rights was a legacy of slavery and continuing racist attitudes post jim crow after the ratification of the 13th 14th and 15th amendments which extended civil and legal protections to formerly enslaved people many state governments rushed to create new felonies to put black people in jail and then institute lifetime disenfranchisement as a way to protect their own privilege and power indeed our present day crisis of mass incarceration has become a tool of voter suppression today over 4 5 million americans disproportionately people of color have lost their right to vote because they have served time in jail or prison for a felony conviction it goes without saying that someone who commits a serious crime must pay his or her debt to society but punishment for a crime or keeping dangerous people behind bars does not cause people to lose their rights to citizenship it should not cause them to lose their right to vote this should not devolve into a debate about whether certain people are good enough to have the right to vote voting is not a privilege it is a right in my view the crooks on wall street who caused the great recession of 2008 that hurt millions of americans are not good people but they have the right to vote and it should never be taken away the reason why this issue is so important right now is that trump and cowardly republican politicians all over this country are working overtime to suppress the vote instead of trying to increase voter turnout they are making it harder for people to participate in the political process in florida the republican legislature is trying to undermine the will of 64 percent of the people who voted to reenfranchise formerly incarcerated people in georgia we have a republican governor who took office by instituting barriers to voting for people of color in tennessee the republican legislature is trying to shut down groups who do voter registration work in new hampshire and iowa the republicans have tried to make it harder for college students to vote the point here is simple at a time when voting suppression is taking place all across the country we must make it clear that casting a ballot for american citizens is not a privilege it is a right if you re an american citizen who is 18 years or older you must be able to vote whether you re in jail or not bernie sanders is an independent senator from vermont and a candidate for the democratic nomination for president in 2020 follow him on twitter sensanders
