it is obvious to all that senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is still trying against all odds and with little prospect of success to keep the impeachment of president donald trump off his agenda for as long as possible this whole issue as far as i m concerned is a house issue mcconnell told reporters this week when asked about how he was preparing for impeachment s arrival in his chamber if the house does in fact act the senate will be in business with an impeachment trial in normal times mcconnell s to do list in the senate would be a challenge in the era of impeachment it s a high wire act of the first order the wily kentuckian has been tied up trying to push across the finish line a spending plan to keep the government s doors open through september a defense bill that would give the pentagon a pay raise and if the stars align perfectly a rewrite of the nafta trade deal each is a weighty endeavor that requires intense attention from its disparate backers and at least a few democratic votes democrats meanwhile are insisting the raft of measures also include money for election security to curb any potential interference on the russians behalf a move republicans say is extraneous to the pentagon budget and for his part trump is signaling that he might not sign some of those big ticket items unless he also is guaranteed funding for his wall along the u s mexico border a non starter for democrats but the i word looms over everything on capitol hill these days and it s become deeply personal to trump on wednesday senators who will serve as jurors in a trial if the house votes to impeach the president got the order they were expecting clear your calendars for january the directive came during a meeting of senate republicans where white house counsel pat cipollone congressional liaison eric ueland former florida attorney general pam bondi and ex treasury department spokesman tony saygeh updated lawmakers on trump s mindset preferences and flash points cipollone who took the lead during the meeting and is expected to helm the white house s defense repeated the administration s position that the impeachment lacks merit meanwhile lawmakers urgently need to move ahead with a spending plan or the government will run out of money next friday dec 20 unless congress and the white house can agree on a way forward that same urgency though works against mcconnell s ambitious agenda house and senate leaders alike anticipate the house will first pass a spending plan before the deadline and then move quickly into its articles of impeachment the one two punch may prove too much for trump if he lumps impeachment with other goals things will get ugly fast republicans are putting the onus on democrats to fall in line to avoid a crisis it s going to require cooperation from democrats to get through this year end agenda to get the spending bill done to get the united states mexico canada agreement done to get the defense authorization done said sen john thune the senate s number two republican i hope they ll see past impeachment but the senate s top democrat sen chuck schumer says it s on republicans to curb trump s demands he hasn t learned his lessons if president trump doesn t sit down with us and negotiate a bill we will have a second trump shutdown schumer said invoking last year s 35 day shutdown over wall funding that never came it s laughable that republicans can blame democrats when they know darned well that on the appropriations process it s president trump who is holding everything up and making the chances of a shutdown a little more real than anybody would like for his part mcconnell who has total control over the senate agenda and calendar is still publicly musing that perhaps the house will decide not to impeach trump after all we re going to have to decide once we get this matter from the house if we do how we re going to handle it mcconnell told reporters on tuesday mcconnell says he is weighing his options for how his chamber deals with the almost inevitable impeachment arrival the easiest path would be for mcconnell and his democratic counterpart schumer to privately agree to a set of rules to govern both sides so far according to mcconnell and schumer alike they haven t even begun those talks a second option for running the senate process would be adopting a rules package which requires 51 senators votes right now republicans have 53 seats meaning a party line vote could be sufficient to set the roadmap for a trial some republicans fret that starting the trial from such a partisan posture will sully its credibility others argue that members like susan collins and mitt romney are unlikely to join an effort to protect trump solely on partisan lines during bill clinton s impeachment trial in 1999 the senate adopted a unanimous rules package after closed door talks the third option to mcconnell s mind would be the most chaotic senators could decide in real time the rules through a series of motions offered from the floor of the senate senators don t expect supreme court chief justice john roberts who would preside over a senate trial to take an activist role mcconnell suggested roberts would be a passive participant and put the motions to votes among senators who would need 51 votes to adopt an idea put forward from the senate floor while this would presumably be the most democratic trial format it also is the most unpredictable and unwieldy and perhaps most importantly for trump dangerous for the president should things spiral out of control it s kind of a jump ball mcconnell said describing the motions option nevertheless it is drawing interest from the president and his advisers who believe the format would allow senators or white house lawyers to call witnesses who previously were not heard from in particular hunter and joe biden who trump believes without evidence are at heart of a corruption scheme in ukraine speaking to reporters in london on tuesday trump said this option may offer a chance for officials in his administration to testify in a fair environment given a republican majority asked about trump s statements that he wants to call witnesses such as acting chief of staff mick mulvaney secretary of state mike pompeo and energy secretary rick perry during the senate trial mcconnell was characteristically cool i don t have any advice to give the president about the way they want to handle the representation mcconnell said thus has been mcconnell s posture since trump took office asked repeatedly about impeachment mcconnell ducks with skill there is no answer at the moment mcconnell said when pressed for details about the senate s preparation this week i haven t answered your question because there is no answer at this point soon there may have to be write to philip elliott at philip elliott time com
