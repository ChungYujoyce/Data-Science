coronavirus originated last year has raised its official covid 19 death toll by 50 adding 1 290 fatalities wuhan officials attributed the new figure to updated reporting and deaths outside hospitals china has insisted there was no cover up it has been accused of downplaying the severity of its virus outbreak wuhan s 11 million residents spent months in strict lockdown conditions which have only recently been eased the latest official figures bring the death toll in the city in china s central hubei province to 3 869 increasing the national total to more than 4 600 china has confirmed nearly 84 000 coronavirus infections the seventh highest globally according to johns hopkins university data the virus has had a huge impact on the chinese economy which shrank for the first time in decades in the first quarter of the year in a statement released on friday officials in wuhan said the revised figures were the result of new data received from multiple sources including records kept by funeral homes and prisons deaths linked to the virus outside hospitals such as people who died at home had not previously been recorded the statistical verification followed efforts by authorities to ensure that information on the city s covid 19 epidemic is open transparent and the data is accurate the statement said it added that health systems were initially overwhelmed and cases were mistakenly reported in some instances counted more than once and in others missed entirely a shortage of testing capacity in the early stages meant that many infected patients were not accounted for it said a spokesman for china s national health commission mi feng said the new death count came from a comprehensive review of epidemic data in its daily news conference the foreign ministry said accusations of a cover up which have been made most stridently on the world stage by us president donald trump were unsubstantiated we ll never allow any concealment a spokesman said friday s revised figures come amid growing international concern that deaths in china have been under reported questions have also been raised about beijing s handling of the epidemic particularly in its early stages in december 2019 chinese authorities launched an investigation into a mysterious viral pneumonia after cases began circulating in wuhan china reported the cases to the world health organization who the un s global health agency on 31 december but who experts were only allowed to visit china and investigate the outbreak on 10 february by which time the country had more than 40 000 cases the mayor of wuhan has previously admitted there was a lack of action between the start of january when about 100 cases had been confirmed and 23 january when city wide restrictions were enacted around that time a doctor who tried to warn his colleagues about an outbreak of a sars like virus was silenced by the authorities dr li wenliang later died from covid 19 wuhan s death toll increase of almost exactly 50 has left some analysts wondering if this is all a bit too neat for months questions have been asked about the veracity of china s official coronavirus statistics the inference has been that some chinese officials may have deliberately under reported deaths and infections to give the impression that cities and towns were successfully managing the emergency if that was the case chinese officials were not to know just how bad this crisis would get in other countries making its own figures now seem implausibly small the authorities in wuhan where the first cluster of this disease was reported said there had been no deliberate misrepresentation of data rather that a stabilisation in the emergency had allowed them time to revisit the reported cases and to add any previously missed that the new death toll was released at the same time as a press conference announcing a total collapse in china s economic growth figures has led some to wonder whether this was a deliberate attempt to bury one or other of these stories then again it could also be a complete coincidence china has been pushing back against us suggestions that the coronavirus came from a laboratory studying infectious diseases in wuhan the bbc s barbara plett usher in washington dc reports us president donald trump and some of his officials have been flirting with the outlier theory in the midst of a propaganda war with china over the origin and handling of the pandemic our correspondent says mr trump this week halted funding for the world health organization who accusing it of making deadly mistakes and overly trusting china do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called china and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths does anybody really believe that mr trump said at the white house on wednesday french president emmanuel macron has also questioned china s handling of the coronavirus outbreak saying it was naive to suggest the country had dealt better with the crisis adding things happened that we don t know about on thursday uk foreign secretary dominic raab said we ll have to ask the hard questions about how coronavirus came about and how it couldn t have been stopped earlier but china has also been praised for its handling of the crisis and the unprecedented restrictions that it instituted to slow the spread of the virus who director general dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus has hailed china for the speed with which it detected the outbreak and its commitment to transparency this is the first time the social media giant has said president trump s tweet could be misleading have you been getting these songs wrong what happens to your body in extreme heat
