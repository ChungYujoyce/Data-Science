 domenico montanaro donald trump and ted cruz argue a point during a republican presidential primary debate in detroit earlier this month paul sancya ap hide caption donald trump and ted cruz argue a point during a republican presidential primary debate in detroit earlier this month this has been an unpredictable primary season but one thing is becoming increasingly clear this race on both sides is going to go on for a while for republicans because of how the vote has been split up no one will have the required delegates to be the nominee until at the earliest their very last nominating day june 7 that s true even if donald trump sweeps the big winner take all states tuesday although the direction will be very clear if that happens for democrats tuesday will be pivotal if bernie sanders wins at least two states and comes close in ohio though hillary clinton would undoubtedly have the advantage his campaign sees a path albeit very narrow to winning a majority of the pledged delegates it hinges on doing well almost running the table over the next six weeks including big wins in arizona washington state wisconsin new york new jersey and california scenario a trump wins both of the winner take all states of ohio and florida numbers as of march 15 2016 domenico montanaro npr ap hide caption if trump wins both he needs 49 percent of all remaining delegates it would almost certainly mean he goes into the convention with the most delegates that s because everyone else would need even more than he would ted cruz would need 69 percent marco rubio 85 percent and he would have almost certainly dropped out after losing his home state john kasich 93 percent rubio and kasich would all but be mathematically eliminated something that would happen in only a matter of weeks but because of all the vote that s been split up already this doesn t guarantee trump gets a majority heading into the convention ok let s assume he wins ohio and florida when could trump get a majority represents the percentage of remaining delegates needed if donald trump wins both ohio and florida tuesday domenico montanaro npr hide caption let s go even further give trump ohio florida and even missouri on tuesday which is a mix of winner take all statewide and by congressional district then give him half the delegates of every contest after tuesday mind you before tuesday he has won a majority in only six of the 26 contests that have taken place then there are three more purely winner take all contests before now and june totaling 116 delegates arizona delaware and nebraska give him all of those that would take him to roughly 1 100 delegates give or take that would still be short of the magic number of 1 237 he called this number very random at the most recent gop debate but it s not random at all it s a majority of the total voting number of republican delegates to the republican national convention in cleveland this july so all of this means the earliest trump would likely clinch is june 7 when california montana new jersey new mexico and south dakota vote he could go into that day 100 to 150 delegates or so short of the magic number and would need half of the 303 delegates up for grabs that day he would need some combination of the winner take all states of new jersey thanks chris christie south dakota and montana and or a significant share of california s scenario b trump loses both florida and ohio this scenario assumes that marco rubio and john kasich hold onto their home states of florida and ohio respectively domenico montanaro npr hide caption if he loses both he and the party are in a very precarious situation losing both states trump would need 62 percent of what s remaining but every other candidate would be even worse off unless cruz won both states which is unlikely if cruz did win both states he d vault into the lead but still would need 56 percent of all remaining delegates to get a majority before cleveland putting cruz aside if kasich and rubio split their respective home states trump would still be in the lead but would need a whopping 62 percent cruz 69 percent rubio 78 percent and kasich 88 percent rubio and kasich would only be weeks away from being mathematically eliminated and we d likely be headed to the first contested convention in 40 years on the republican side and possibly the first brokered in almost 70 scenario c trump wins florida but loses ohio this scenario assumes john kasich wins ohio domenico montanaro npr hide caption this is a very possible scenario out of tuesday given the current polling we would be basically right back where we started the day trump would need 54 percent of all remaining delegates cruz 69 percent rubio 85 percent and kasich 89 percent in this scenario rubio loses florida and his candidacy is likely over kasich would still have only a matter of weeks until he s mathematically eliminated bernie sanders and hillary clinton stand together wednesday before the start of the democratic presidential debate at miami dade college in miami wilfredo lee ap hide caption bernie sanders and hillary clinton stand together wednesday before the start of the democratic presidential debate at miami dade college in miami scenario a good day for clinton wins big in florida and north carolina ekes out ohio hillary clinton has a large lead in total delegates fueled by her enormous lead with superdelegates unpledged party elected leaders and officials who can vote at the convention however they want domenico montanaro npr hide caption clinton is favored in florida and north carolina and by big margins winning there with 60 percent of the vote and then losing in illinois and missouri 52 to 48 percent and winning in ohio by the same margin clinton would have a very good delegate day she would net nearly another 60 delegates and need just 43 percent of all remaining delegates for the pledged majority with just 29 contests to go sanders would need 57 percent of all remaining delegates though the calendar lines up for him well over the next several weeks that would be very difficult to overcome and none of that is counting superdelegates who are overwhelmingly with clinton for now delegate split 375 316 clinton needed clinton 43 sanders 57 when could clinton win a majority of delegates staying with her best outcome on mega tuesday with superdelegates factored in clinton likely wouldn t be able to wrap up the nomination until june 7 when california votes scenario b good day for sanders wins illinois missouri and ekes out ohio trims margins in florida north carolina welcome to a world in which the sanders campaign can plausibly make the case that he has a narrow path to win a majority of pledged delegates by the end of june in this scenario sanders wins the day by one delegate winning missouri 60 to 40 percent illinois 55 to 45 percent ohio 54 to 46 percent and holding clinton to 55 percent in florida and 59 percent in north carolina sanders would find himself further behind than when the day began needing 55 percent of all remaining delegates and this is where the race gets interesting his campaign believes it s come through the toughest stretch and the next several races line up sanders way delegate split 346 345 sanders needed 45 clinton 55 sanders ok so what s that path look like because democrats hand out delegates proportionally he would have to virtually run the table in every big state and small caucus starting with arizona on march 22 it s no mistake that sanders is in phoenix on tuesday night rather than in one of the places he might or might not win that night he would also have to win decisively in washington state march 26 wisconsin april 5 new york april 19 kentucky and oregon may 17 new jersey and california june 7 california could be key in one analysis run by npr sanders was down 92 delegates going into june 7 but with a 60 40 win in california which has 475 delegates sanders was able to pull ahead here s one estimate that has fairly narrow margins that shows sanders pulling off a two delegate win some might take issue with sanders winning maryland given its high share of black voters but it s one example realtrondump glennthrush thefix here s one chart which doesn t involve 30 or 40 point blowouts in big states pic twitter com psmjdppsvm some other contests to watch pennsylvania april 26 indiana may 3 and west virginia may 10 oh and remember those caucuses that don t really hand out delegates that night but at county and state conventions the sanders campaign is contesting each of those fighting for delegates hoping to pick up more delegates than election night media estimates one potentially dangerous scenario if superdelegates hang with clinton even in the most rosy sanders scenario she would surpass the magic number of 2 383 just on or before june 7 that s right when in this same scenario sanders would take the pledged delegate lead one thing s for sure with the coalitions both of these candidates have put together nothing will be easy npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
