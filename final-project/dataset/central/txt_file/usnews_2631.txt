president donald trump liked a painting of him having drinks with abraham lincoln richard nixon and teddy roosevelt so much that he called the artist on the phone and then put a print of it in the white house called the republican club the print of 10 republican presidents sitting around a table could be seen briefly in the background of trump s interview with 60 minutes sunday and an image of that moment went viral on social media as all this was playing out andy thomas was at his home in carthage mo watching the kansas city chiefs play the new england patriots on tv while working on a painting of a train robbery in the old west it s a favorite subject of his lots of horses lots of action thomas phone began to ring as friends reached out to tell him but he assumed they were just pollsters asking about the missouri senate race finally his wife came down to show him on the computer i was ecstatic he told time afterward a lot of times gifts aren t really hung up they re just pushed in a closet somewhere to find out it s actually hanging is really a treat read more there s a subtle feminist message in this new painting of trump it s unclear how the print made its way into the white house but thomas said republican rep darrell issa of california had told him recently that he d be showing it to trump thomas is not a very political person but he d done a portrait of issa a few years ago and the two have kept in touch but he was surprised two weeks ago when he came in from mowing the lawn and his wife and business partner dina told him that trump would be calling shortly he basically said most portraits of me i really don t like thomas said and he s right he s hard to paint there s some bad ones out there as he often does trump then asked thomas how he was doing as president and what his friends and neighbors think about him as well as how he thinks the heated senate race between democratic sen claire mccaskill and pro trump republican josh hawley will end thomas said he was a bit surprised at that turn in the conversation i m thinking i m a damn artist what is he asking me about this for he recalled as a cowboy painter who dabbles in presidential portraits thomas said it was nice to hear back from one of his subjects directly he d once met a cousin of bill clinton s who told him secondhand that he liked the portrait and richard nixon s niece once praised his painting but thomas was proud that trump had recognized the work he put into one of the toughest parts of the painting the president s smile he said he s found that some presidents have a natural smile ronald reagan dwight eisenhower john f kennedy barack obama but others like trump have more of a forced campaign smile that doesn t look right in a painting he found it particularly hard to get nixon right the first time he painted him to get trump s smile thomas said he looked at thousands of photos trump has that one thing where he sticks his chin up and smiles really big and it s great for a caricature but not necessarily flattering to him he said i had to find a photo where it looked like he s actually heard something funny so it looks like a genuine smile contact us at editors time com
