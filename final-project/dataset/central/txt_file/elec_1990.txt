nomination was just not there but sanders s failure to claim the big prize shouldn t blind anyone to his achievements it is almost exactly five years since sanders announced his first presidential run in that time his ideas have gone mainstream he has inspired a new generation of young progressives and he has revitalized the left as a force within the democratic party i think what he has done is of incredible significance said tad devine who worked as a senior adviser to sanders s 2016 campaign sanders has become such a mainstay of american life appearing on talk shows and being impersonated on

super tuesday and sanders lost altitude rapidly the failure of sanders s second presidential bid was inextricably tied to his difficulty in winning the support of black democrats who voted for biden in overwhelming numbers more broadly sanders never put to rest concerns about his electability in a general election nervousness about a self declared democratic socialist who was prone to saying positive things about figures like the late cuban leader fidel castro persisted far beyond the party establishment there are too those who complain that sanders and his supporters are more concerned with winning internal ideological arguments than building the kinds of coalitions that can prevail in national elections but the movement of the democratic party toward sanders over the past five years is undoubtedly real and the viewpoint he represents has found new respect biden responding to his rival s withdrawal issued a lengthy statement wednesday paying tribute to sanders and stating i

activism and the political process bernie s worldview has been adopted by so many voters including people who might not usually consider themselves democrats and certainly generationally said jonathan tasini a progressive strategist who supported sanders tasini also asserted that sanders had been able to bring progressive goals closer even if they have not yet been fully realized partly because he did bring a lot more young people into this movement sanders who is 78 and had a heart attack in the fall seems highly unlikely to submit to the rigors of a presidential campaign again but the stark
