joe biden had fun on his second campaign trip to new hampshire the same could not be said for his campaign staff nervously watching from the sidelines on several occasions the former vice president signaled that he was going to ignore the advice of his large and experienced staff make needlessly risky jokes and go on conversational detours far away from the message of the day onto any of a half dozen topics it was a technique at odds with the carefully laid out campaign strategy of maintaining the frontrunner s aura of invincibility avoiding contentious subjects and glossing over problem areas but it was the essence of joe biden himself the core of campaign instincts forged well before he became a national figure sometimes it meant telling a story that was not quite right despite aides reminder that no that s not entirely accurate other times it was citing statistics that he acknowledged might be wrong don t hold me to that was a favorite refrain and at still other times it seemed he hadn t quite learned the lessons from a pre campaign conversation about his frequent invasions of women s personal space biden was clearly aware of the sore spots when he was about to venture into a story filled with warning signs he would point to the press and say he was going to be very very intentional with the details and as president donald trump is prone to do imply they lacked credibility in this case because they were too young to have the full context i want to be very careful how i say this so the press doesn t go nuts on me he said tuesday in a concord n h town hall he said he was taking great care not to mimic an islander affect of someone he met in saint croix he immediately reversed that instincts 10 seconds later when he adopted a vaguely caribbean accent to share an electrician s side of a conversation i won t say exactly what he said because as you know a lot of folks down there speak creole biden told the crowd biden said he thanked the worker for helping restore power after storms hit the island where he and his wife rent a home during new year holidays he came down said some version of are you kidding me fella biden told his crowd then came the affected version are you serious man the man sounded more like mah n the scene was but one piece of an otherwise problematic tuesday for biden as he was traveling southward from new hampshire s vast and sparsely populated north country critics were charging that parts of a clean energy plan his campaign released that morning appeared to closely track the wording of other plans it was a minor story but the kind he can t afford given the allegations of plagiarism that sank his 1988 campaign aides quickly added links to biden s source material but it was an unnecessary headache for a candidate with a rolodex of experts at his command who had mapped out the release of the plan and visits to new hampshire green tech sites ahead of time at an evening town hall aimed at electrical workers who could benefit from such a green tech investment biden was slated to deliver a brief opening statement loaded onto teleprompters and then take voters questions he deviated from the script left the podium and then the stage altogether he started with what aides had hoped would have been his headline of the day the environmental policy but by the end of opening statement to his town hall biden had noted that his home state of delaware has more minorities than new hampshire mentioned that he wanted former new hampshire gov john lynch in his administration reminisced about how he enjoyed having a new car for the prom because his dad ran a dealership and recalled how barack obama often overstated biden s working class roots there was also loose talk about overtime regulations nato s future mitch mcconnell s deal making chinese xenophobia and gay rights eventually the teleprompter operator just gave up trying biden kept trying to wrap up but kept having another thought he said lastly at least three times in trying to nail his landing forty five minutes later biden then said he would take questions if you re willing to stick around some people left others stayed to hear the questions biden took four at which point he recognized he had wrongly said being lgbt was a decision one self described aclu voter asked biden if he would commit to reducing the prison population which many believe to have swelled because of a tough on crime law he helped pass in the 1990s biden rejected that to arbitrarily say i m just going to make a commitment i will cut arbitrarily in half or by a third or by 90 is not a rational way of going about it a staffer had announced it would be the last question then biden spotted someone in the audience he wanted to answer i know they said last question he said not at all sheepishly he then answered a fifth question about the social security system by saying immigrants in the united states were propping up a teetering system he then made a detour to tell a version of his visit with chinese leaders back when he was vice president at the time biden said he told his chinese counterparts that their country too was heading toward an imbalance between workers and retirees unless they either embrace newcomers or end their one child policy they re xenophobic they don t want anybody in he said when biden tried to take a sixth question his staff started playing music just as they do when an oscar speech goes long it was time to cut him off biden then met with voters and took selfies for the next 18 minutes during that time nervous aides kept reporters away from the former vice president music was blaring so that his conversations couldn t be heard to be fair other campaigns do that as well and as he was walking toward the door biden picked up on the one reporter driven question that wasn t necessarily about him what about trump s visit with the british royals god save the queen came his reply as he exited a side door finally it seemed biden was remembering the need for discipline write to philip elliott at philip elliott time com
