s experience is an asset and that he should enter the race about a third of respondents say his time has passed and he should not run he s got a lot of years of political experience being a senator for over 35 years being the vice president said travis underwood a 30 year old ottumwa resident and poll respondent who said biden is his first choice for president and he s very charismatic it seems like today we re in an era where it s all partisan politics there are not too many out there who are middle of the road biden is moderate and that means he actually talks about issues biden has spent months mulling whether to make a third run at the white house after failed bids in 1988 and 2008 setting deadlines for himself and then blowing past them but a decision now appears imminent according toa report from the new york times one biden strategist has been telling democrats that bidenis 95 percent committed to running feb 13 how long can joe biden bernie sanders and beto o rourke afford to wait to jump into 2020 race sanders formally announced his candidacy last month andvisited iowa for the first time as a declared 2020 candidate this month according to the poll 25 percent now say sanders is their first choice for president up 6percentage points since december right now the contest in iowa could be characterized as a two personrace the next closest challenger massachusetts sen elizabeth warren trails sanders by 16 percentage points support hasticked up slightly forwarren and california sen kamala harris isin fourth place warren is now at 9 percent up from 8 percent and harris is at 7 percent up from 5 percent next is former texas rep betoo rourke who has seen his support fall by about half since december as he continues weighing a possible run five percent of likely democraticcaucusgoersnow say he is their first choice for president down from 11 percent in december new jersey sen cory booker and minnesota sen amy klobuchar tie with 3 percent no other candidate gets more than 1 percent and some including new york city mayor bill de blasio new york sen kirsten gillibrand and california congressman eric swalwell were not named as a first choice by a single poll respondent the biden sanders rivalry embodies a key debate happening within the democratic party should democrats nominate a bold progressive who pushes the debate further left or should they elevate a more moderate centrist who could potentially appeal to independents and disaffected republicans sanders an independent senator who identifies as a democratic socialist is the furthest left of all the potential candidates forty four percent of likely democratic caucusgoers say he s too liberal more than for any other candidate tested forty eight percent say his political views are just right 2 percent say he s too conservative and 7 percent are unsure according to the poll he appeals most to those who do not identify with anyparticular religion 37 percent and those younger than age 35 34 percent dec 16 iowa poll trump has big fan base among iowa republicans but they welcome challengers but generally likely democratic caucusgoers say they are ok with candidates who think the country should be more socialist fifteen percent would be very satisfied with such a candidate and 41 percent would be mostly satisfied thirty three percent would be dissatisfied and 11 percent are not sure that s roughly comparable to a 2016 iowa poll in which 43 percent of likely democraticcaucusgoerssaid they identify as socialist that was more than the 38 percent who identified as capitalist and thoughsanders overall support has tickedup his favorability ratings fell slightly since december seventy one percent view him favorably now down 3points since december and 25 percent view him unfavorably up 3points since december biden who is expected to campaign as a left of center candidate and lean on his decades in politics does wellwith self described moderates 35 percent a catholic he also does well withthe poll s small constituency of catholics 44 percent even though biden and sanders represent opposite ends of the democratic ideological spectrum much of their support overlaps if biden decided not to run 30 percent of those who namehim as their first choice candidate would switch their allegiance to sanders whom they named as their second choice among those who saysanders is their first choice 40 percent say biden is their second choice second choices are important in the iowa democrats caucus night process if acaucusgoer sfirst choice fails to advance the attendee has an opportunity to recast support for a different candidate the only reason biden is my first choice is because i couldn t pick two said poll respondent madison jones an 18 year old waukee resident who likes both biden and sanders honestly they re both really great candidates i m drawn to them because even though they re older they have a better grasp of what the future is going to look like and they re obviously collaborative and open to change dec 15 iowa poll biden sanders top early look at possible democratic hopefuls in 2020 caucuses but both biden 76 and sanders 77 face criticism that their time has passed with some arguing they should step aside to make room for a new generation ofleaders a majority 54 percent agree that sanders 2016 candidacy has pushed the party in a good direction and he should be in the race again but 43 percent say the time for sanders as a candidate has passed and he should not be in the race more are open to a biden run nearly two thirds say he should get in the race and 31 percent say his time has passed as an old white man who s been active on the fringes of politics i think it s time to give a shot to younger people because they re going to be inheriting the earth that we re kind of messing with right now said poll respondent gordon dunn a 70 year old altoona resident who thinks the time for both sanders and biden has passed dunn said

favorable and unfavorable numbers in december 38 percent viewed her favorably andthat srisento 43 percent today butthe percentage of those who view her unfavorably also has risen from 8 percent to 15
