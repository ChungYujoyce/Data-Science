it was a less crowded stage for a still crowded field by eugene kiely brooks jackson lori robertson robert farley jessica mcdonald angelo fichera and d angelo gore posted on december 20 2019 we found several misleading and exaggerated claims in the last debate of 2019 seven democratic candidates debated on dec 19 biden warren buttigieg klobuchar sen bernie sanders and businessmen andrew yang and tom steyer the debate was hosted by pbs newshour and politico and held in los angeles warren and buttigieg got into a heated back and forth over how they raise money for their presidential campaigns a dispute that started when she criticized buttigieg for aglitzy fundraiserhe held on dec 15 at hall wines in napa valley in california the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served 900 a bottle wine he had promised that every fundraiser he would do would be open door but this one was closed door warren said buttigieg did hold the fundraiser in wine caves that boast a chandelier with 1 500 swarovski crystals an onyx banquet table to reflect its luminescence and bottles of cabernet sauvignon that sell for as much as 900 as reportedby the associated press on dec 13 a few days before the event the mayor alsosaidon dec 9 that he would allow the press to cover private fundraisers and a pool reporter was permitted to cover buttigieg s remarks at the event as evidenced bythe pool report posted on twitter by acnn video producer but warren s campaign pointed us to ahuff post reportthat noted most of the event was closed off to the press though reporters covering buttigieg s campaign could view his prepared remarks and a q a session the rest of the event was closed off to everyone but the invited donors the report said so the event was partly open door and partly closed another member of the press a writer for vox s recode found photosof the dinner in the wine cave on instagram andtweeted them in criticizing buttigieg the massachusetts senator boasted that in her presidential campaign i do not sell access to my time buttigieg shot back as of when senator it was in february that warrensent an emailto supporters that said she would not hold private fundraisers or one on one meetings with big donors that means no fancy receptions or big money fund raisers only with people who can write the big checks she wrote but as buttigieg pointed out warren s presidential campaign has benefited from money that she raised at fundraisers she held as a senate candidate warren has raised 60 million for her presidential campaign so far according to hercampaign reportsfiled with the federal election commission but that includes 10 4 millionshe transferred from her senate campaign elizabeth for ma to her presidential campaign in three large donations from january to march of this year prior to that her senate campaign receivednearly 4 millionfrom the elizabeth warren action fund ajoint fundraising committeethat can raise larger amounts than a candidate committee that money flowed from march 2017 to december 2018 according to fec records so despite swearing off big checks now warren s presidential campaign did benefit from her pre pledge fundraising the open secret of ms warren s campaign is that her big money fund raising through 2018 helped lay the foundation for her anti big money run for the presidency thenew york timeswrotein september klobuchar got the better of buttigieg on his claim that he is electable in republican leaning indiana buttigieg if you want to talk about the capacity to win try putting together a coalition to bring you back to office with 80 of the vote as a gay dude in mike pence s indiana klobuchar if you had won in indiana that would be one thing you tried and you lost by 20 points klobuchar is right it s true that buttigieg won reelection as mayor of south bend indiana in 2015 by a vote of 8 515 to 2 074 against his republican opponent kelly s jones getting 80 4 of the vote but south bend is just one city not the whole state klobuchar alluded to the thumping buttigieg received in his earlier statewide bid for office in 2010 when he ran at age 28 to be indiana s state treasurer buttigieg received 633 243 votes while his republican opponent richard e mourdock won with well over 1 million in percentage terms buttigieg lost by 24 9 percentage points so klobuchar was actually being charitable when she put the margin at 20 points as she has on the campaign trail and in thenovember debate warren said she has a two cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires but she neglected to mention that the annual tax rate on wealth over 1 billion would be triple that let s start with a wealth tax the idea of a two cent tax on the great fortunes in this country 50 million and above warren said later in the debate she said i have a two cent wealth tax proposed for millionaires and billionaires and that gives us enough money to invest in all our babies aged 0 to 5 to put in a historic 800 billion investment in public schools k through 12 and that will permit us to offer technical school two year college four year college for every single person who wants an education cancel student loan debt for 50 put a 50 billion investment in our historically black colleges and universities and cancel student loan debt for 43 million americans under warren s original wealth tax plan households would pay an annual 2 tax on all assets net worth above 50 million and a 3 tax on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion as we wrote in our story facts on warren s wealth tax plan university of california berkeley economists gabriel zucman and emmanuel saezestimated warren s taxwould fall on about 75 000 u s households less than 0 1 and would raise around 2 75 trillion over 10 years but since then warren unveiledher planto pay for medicare for all which included upping the wealth tax on assets over 1 billion to 6 in other words though warren talks about a 2 wealth tax for millionaires and billionaires the rate would actually be 6 on wealth over 1 billion every year whileforbesestimates there are less than 1 000 billionaires in the u s warren estimated the additional 3 annual wealth tax would raise an additional 1 trillion over 10 years aswe have written it is a matter of debate among economists and tax experts as to whether her plan would raise as much revenue as she expects indeed thepenn wharton budget model pwbm last week released a detailed analysis of warren s proposed wealth tax and projected that if implemented in 2021 it would raise between 2 3 trillion and 2 7 trillion over 10 years roughly 1 trillion to 1 4 trillion less than the warren campaign s estimate pwbm also estimated that the wealth tax would reduce gross domestic product in 2050 by about 1 2 depending on how the money is spent biden was right when he said china s leader is rated above trump in international opinion polls biden is it any wonder that if you look at the international polling that s been done that the chinese leader is rated above american american president polling conducted for the pew research center in 2018 asked people in 25 different countries if they had confidence in trump and four other world leaders to do the right thing regarding world affairs the median response only 27 had confidence in trump who came in at the bottom while 34 had confidence in xi jinping as for the other leaders 52 had confidence in germany s angela merkel and 46 had confidence in france s emmanuel macron even russia s vladimir putin edged out trump with a 30 confidence rating but it s worth noting that despite the international public s low opinion of trump most would still prefer the united states to lead the world pew asked whether people preferred a future in which the u s is the world s leading power or china is the world s leading power the median response 63 preferred the u s while only 19 said china buttigieg claimed trump has not made a peep in support of folks out there standing up for democracy in hong kong but while some have been critical of the president for not being outspoken enough in support of hong kong protesters trump last month signed two bills in support of them and over the objections of the chinese government buttigieg but when folks out there standing up for democracy hear not a peep from the president of the united states what message is that sending to the chinese communist party the message i will send is that if they perpetrate a repeat of anything like tiananmen square when it comes to hong kong they will be isolated from the free world and we will lead that isolation diplomatically and economically on oct 4 cnnreportedthat during a private phone call in june trump promised chinese president xi jinping that the us would remain quiet on pro democracy protests in hong kong while trade talks continued transcripts of the phone call have not been made public so we can t verify what trump may have promised but buttigieg goes too far with his claim that trump hasn t made a peep duringan interviewwith fox friends on nov 22 trump said the protesters would have been obliterated by chinese forces if he hadn t asked xi to not send them in later trump was asked if he would veto two bills from the senate that support the hong kong students look we have to stand with hong kong trump said but i m also standing with president xi he s a friend of mine he s an incredible guy we have to stand but i d like to see them work it out okay we have to see and work it out but i stand with hong kong i stand with freedom indeed trumpsigned the two billson nov 27 the first wass 1838 the hong kong human rights and democracy act of 2019 which requires the u s to every year assess whether political developments in hong kong justify changing hong kong s unique treatment under u s law including not being subject to tariffs levied upon china it also includes several human rights provisions the second bill s 2710 prohibits the sale of specified munitions including tear gas rubber bullets and handcuffs to the hong kong police force although chinastrenuouslyobjected to the bills trump tried to walk a diplomatic line and appease both sides saying i signed these bills out of respect for president xi china and the people of hong kong they are being enacted in the hope that leaders and representatives of china and hong kong will be able to amicably settle their differences leading to long term peace and prosperity for all according to cnbc the hong kong government expressed strong opposition to the bills and called them an obvious intervention of hong kong s internal affairs they are unnecessary and without grounds they will also harm the relationship and interests between hong kong and the u s in explaining why she supports a reworked version of trump s trade deal with mexico and canada klobuchar stated that 95 of our customers are outside of our borders the statistic accurately reflects basic demography but it could be misleading about the full potential of international trade as politifactexplained when biden made a similar claim back in july 2016 95 of the world s customers are indeed outside of the united states because americans account for a bit less than 5 of the global population according to the u s census bureau the u s population is 330 million or about 4 3 of the 7 6 billion total but vast swaths of the global population are in poverty and unlikely to be big buyers of american products in fact the u s chamber of commerce says on its website that nearly half of all american exports are sold to 20 countries that make up around 6 of the world s population outside the u s so while the statistic is used and even referencedelsewhereby the chamber of commerce it s not necessarily reflective of the actual percentage of people outside the u s who buy american products biden slightly inflated a statistic related to financial hardship you have most americans if they received a bill for 400 or more they d have to sell something or borrow the money biden said while it s true that many americans report being in that situation the term most isn t accurate the statistic comes from an annual federal reserve study on the economic well being of u s households the fed s may 2019 report found that i f faced with an unexpected expense of 400 27 percent of adults would borrow or sell something to pay for the expense and 12 percent would not be able to cover the expense at all that s nearly 40 of americans but not most the report instead found that 61 of adults said they would cover it with cash savings or a credit card paid off at the next statement up from 48 in the first survey released in 2014 pereira
