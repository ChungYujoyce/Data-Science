while president trump is not attending this year s white house correspondents dinner he has a history of being the butt of jokes at the annual event where journalists politicians and celebrities typically gather together for a night of levity the most scathing burn trump received at the dinner came in 2011 when he attended as a guest of the washington post at the time trump was in his heyday of promoting the birther conspiracy theory about president barack obama and hinting at a possible run for office the following year taking advantage of his attendance at the dinner obama dug in to trump to poke fun at the real estate mogul s business dealings and doubts about the president s place of birth here is what he said at the time donald trump is here tonight now i know that he s taken some flak lately but no one is happier no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the donald and that s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter like did we fake the moon landing what really happened in roswell and where are biggie and tupac all kidding aside obviously we all know about your credentials and breadth of experience for example no seriously just recently in an episode of celebrity apprentice at the steakhouse the men s cooking team did not impress the judges from omaha steaks and there was a lot of blame to go around but you mr trump recognized that the real problem was a lack of leadership and so ultimately you didn t blame lil jon or meat loaf you fired gary busey and these are the kinds of decisions that would keep me up at night well handled sir well handled say what you will about mr trump he certainly would bring some change to the white house let s see what we ve got up there the skewering of trump did not end with obama seth meyers host of the dinner that year took aim at the trump for several minutes complete with an imitation of the future president donald trump has been saying that he will run for president as a republican which is surprising since i just assumed that he was running as a joke meyers said amid several punchlines at trump s expense the scathing remarks did not sit well with trump who was filmed looking angry with his lips pursed and eyes staring ahead media and political pundits have since said that the white house correspondents dinner roasting was what spurred his run for the presidency in 2016 trump has denied the dinner had any influence on his 2016 campaign telling the washington post there are many reasons i m running but that s not one of them obama again addressed trump at the 2015 dinner although he cut right to the chase and donald trump is still here he said still as trump campaign for the presidency gained steam in 2016 obama again fired off jokes at the dinner that year both at the expense of trump and the press i hope you all are proud of yourselves he said addressing the media the guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we re praying that cleveland makes it through july this year trump has declined to attend the dinner and announced instead that he will hold a rally in harrisburg pennsylvania to mark the first 100 days of his presidency trump s break with precedent since its founding in 1921 the whcd has hosted every president at least once came after his several criticisms of the press as fake news and accusations that some news outlets are enemies of the people write to mahita gajanan at mahita gajanan time com
