he dominates our annual review of political falsehoods by factcheck org posted on december 21 2015 updated on december 21 2015 it s been a banner year for political whoppers and for one teller of tall tales in particular donald trump in the 12 years of factcheck org s existence we ve never seen his match he stands out not only for the sheer number of his factually false claims but also for his brazen refusals to admit error when proven wrong he is by no means the only one telling whoppers of course once again this year there are plenty of politicians in both parties who hope voters will swallow their deceptive claims hillary clinton for one said she was transparent about her use of a private email server when in fact she wasn t that was one of the bogus claims she made about her unusual email arrangement while secretary of state but trump topped them all when he claimed to have seen nonexistent television coverage of thousands and thousands of muslims in new jersey cheering the collapse of the world trade center towers on 9 11 and then topped himself by demanding that fact checkers apologize for exposing his claim as fantasy and that s only one example here we ve assembled as we do every year at this time a generous sampling of the most far fetched distorted or downright fallacious claims made during 2015 in past years we ve not singled out a single claim or a single person and have left it to readers to judge which whoppers they consider most egregious but this year the evidence is overwhelming and in our judgment conclusive so for the first time we confer the title king of whoppers note this week s video in our fact checking collaboration with cnn s jake tapper is on the whoppers of the year and can be found on cnn com we won t get into trump s controversial policy positions it s not a fact checker s role to offer opinions on whether it s a good idea or a bad idea for the federal government to bar muslims from entering the united states or to kill the families of terrorists for example what we focus on here are some of the many cases where he s just wrong on the facts we start with his nov 21 claim to have watched on television as thousands and thousands of muslims in new jersey were cheering the fall of the world trade center on sept 11 2001 multiple news organizations and the new jersey attorney general s office searched for evidence of public celebrations at the time of 9 11 and found none never happened former state attorney general john j farmer a republican appointee who later served as a senior counsel to the 9 11 commission wrote in response to trump in a tweet trumpdemanded an apology citing as evidence one news story about an alleged incident that was unattributed unverified and not televised one of the reporters on that story said he visited the jersey city building and neighborhood where the celebrations were purported to have happened but he could never verify that report and trump s false claim about thousands and thousands of muslims is just part of a pattern of inflammatory claims with little or no basis in fact here are some more and it s not an exhaustive list trump carson on 9 11 celebrations nov 24 trump s bin laden prediction dec 2 trump hears obama wants to take guns oct 22 trump gets refugee numbers wrong oct 4 facts about the syrian refugees nov 23 trump vs fiorina who

bogus boast on ford oct 26 trump s amnesia aug 11 trump tramples facts june 16 this is just a sampling of the falsehoods and exaggerations that lead us to award our king of whoppers title to trump see our full and up to the minute file on him for more but enough about the republican front runner democratic front runner hillary clinton has told some whoppers too her private email account several of them regard the former secretary of state s problematic use of a private email server for both her personal and official communication clinton spins immigration emails july 8 more spin on clinton emails sept 8 phantom isis videos clinton also made up a claim about terrorists using trump in recruiting videos during the dec 19 democratic debate she said that islamic state recruiters were going to people showing videos of donald trump insulting islam and muslims but her campaign could produce no evidence that any such videos exist the best that her campaign aides could do was to cite an nbc news article quoting an expert as predicting that trump s remarks would surely show up in islamic statesocial media the article however contained no evidence that it has happened and made no mention of any video spokeswoman jennifer palmieri later conceded that clinton was not referring to a specific video abc news quoted white house and national security council aides as saying they are unaware of any examples of the islamic state groupusing trump in videos factchecking the third democratic debate dec 20 benghazi on a subject intensely scrutinized by republicans clinton said in october that all of the government investigations into the terrorist attacks on u s diplomatic facilities in benghazi concluded that nobody did anything wrong not quite an accountability board that clinton herself appointed found systemic failures and leadership and management deficiencies at senior levels on the day the report came out four state department employees were placed on administrative leave and all four were later reassigned clinton and the benghazi reports oct 7 charter schools clinton said most charter schools don t take the hardest to teach kids or if they do they don t keep them but her campaign could not provide any evidence for such a sweeping claim in fact the campaign cited a washington postarticle aboutthe rate of expulsions in washington d c but the post wrote many charter schools 60 out of 97 campuses did not expel students in 2011 12 that not only doesn t support clinton s claim it is evidence that helps to refute it clinton s charter school exaggeration nov 12 clinton s democratic rivals for the 2016 presidential nomination weren t innocent either sanders on social security sen bernie sanders of vermont dusted off a shopworn democratic whopper when he insisted in october that social security hasn t contributed one penny or one nickel to the deficit in fact it contributed 73 billion to the deficit in 2014 sanders misleads on social security oct 12

exaggerates inequality may 28 sanders on climate link to terrorism sanders said climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism the department of defense has referred to climate change as a threat multiplier because it has the potential to exacerbate many of the challenges we are dealing with today from infectious disease to terrorism as for the current rise in terrorism one study concluded that climate change likely worsened a drought in syria and contributed to instability there but the report stopped short of drawing a direct causal link between climate change and the syrian civil war let alone between climate change and terrorism sanders on climate link to terrorism nov 17 o malley on wages in october former maryland gov martin o malley claimed that 70 percent of us are

vividdescription was shown to be false fiorina on job losses fiorinaclaimed that 92 percent of the job losses in president obama s first term belonged to women but women and men gained jobs by the end

rubio cosponsored would have dramatically expanded president obama s authority to admit syrian refugees with no background checks whatsoever not so the billwould have made it easier for members of
