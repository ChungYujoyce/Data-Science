the first time joe proposed he simply said i want us to get married it wasn t a big deal just an ordinary conversation on an ordinary day i already knew how he felt so it didn t come as a surprise i also knew i couldn t say yes but unbeknownst to me joe wasn t just asking on his own accord beau and hunter had recently cornered him in the bathroom one morning while he was shaving beau thinks we should get married six year old hunter told him with their father understandably confused by this pronouncement seven year old beau explained we think we should marry jill hearing that story later i had to laugh how often do our children understand the obvious answer before we do in the months prior to that conversation the boys and i had been spending a lot of time together when joe worked late i would go over to make dinner and keep them company i would help pick them up from school sometimes or we d pass an evening watching tv we started to build our own relationship separate from their dad even at a young age beau was a lot like joe he was incredibly articulate and would never hesitate to express how he was feeling he was kind and responsible hunt was more like me he didn t want to talk about his feelings as much and he didn t always know how to express them when he was a kid but he would always show you with his actions he was warm and loving if we were waiting in a lobby or watching tv he would throw his arms around my neck and rest his head on my shoulder he would look up at me with a twinkle of adventure in his eyes and i knew we were going to have fun i was surprised by how much i enjoyed getting to know them and though i had been a little hesitant about dating someone with kids i found myself excited when i got to see them i realized during those months how happy i was spending time with the boys but that didn t mean i was ready to get married i saw my mother cry only one time at my dad s funeral she didn t even cry when her own parents died i saw that stoicism as strength and that strength was what i wanted for myself more than anything i decided early that i would never let my emotions rule me i worked hard to live up to that with the kids always fighting to keep control of myself especially in times of hardship and adversity they never saw me cry when joe was lying near death at walter reed hospital after his two aneurysms in 1988 or when emts carried him down the steps of our house on a stretcher after he had a pulmonary embolism that same year i shed no tears in front of them when we pulled out of the 2008 presidential race after a disappointing finish in iowa even though inside i was crushed as a political spouse i ve found that my stoicism often serves me well in 1988 when joe s first presidential campaign started to look bleak people were constantly looking for cracks in our team we all felt scrutinized but i refused to show weakness and later when beau got sick we didn t want it to become a national conversation it was just too personal we were holding out hope that he would recover so we kept it to ourselves and with the exception of a select few people no one knew i continued teaching continued attending events i lived a double life smiling publicly but worrying constantly on the inside about my son to say it was difficult would be an understatement but i also knew i couldn t just put aside my jobs of second lady and college professor i compartmentalized the pain and my stoicism helped me keep going in many ways joe s temperament and mine complement each other he tends to pull me out of my shell and i help keep him grounded he s affectionate enough for both of us even now his staff members laugh about it joking that the answer to where s the vice president is always well where is she after the disappointment of my divorce i never wanted to feel so out of control of my heart again but in the months that joe and i were dating that desire ran up against a new reality i was falling in love still marriage meant something different to me by that point i knew that it was harder to unite two lives than i had imagined growing up i knew that relationships could be fragile i knew that no matter how much i tried there would be so much that i couldn t control if i gave joe my whole heart he had the power to break it what if he changed his mind what if it didn t work what if i took another chance and i was left humiliated what if i failed there were times when i actually prayed not to get married please i would beg god don t let me make that mistake again listen to an audio excerpt from the audible edition of where the light enters read by jill biden jill joe said to me a few months after his first proposal i love you i want to get married i want the boys to have a mother to make our family complete but i didn t feel any closer to saying yes than i had the first time he asked i was slowly learning to trust again because joe and the boys made me feel secure in their love but even as my fears of getting my heart broken began to lessen other fears took their place being joe s wife would mean a life in the spotlight that i had never wanted i was a college student when we d first met and i liked living under the radar joe lived with constant public visibility but it was more than just the pressures of public life i had always wanted my own career and a year after we started dating i finally landed a job i loved teaching ninth and tenth grade english at a private catholic high school in wilmington called saint mark s my students were smart and respectful and i loved hearing them come alive in the classroom during spirited discussions of shakespeare dickens and thoreau i was launching my career and planning for graduate school and then i had staff calling to schedule dates with my boyfriend around his insane senate schedule i was being pulled in so many directions i knew that if i married joe i d have to give up my apartment the only space that was just for me i d have to quit my job for the boys sake to give them the time to acclimate to having someone new in the house every day and not just on weekends and i d have to become jill biden senator s wife it was all too much after attending events and dinners with joe i d come home and throw myself on my bed in my sparse apartment exhausted i d stare at the divots in the ceiling and mentally check through all the things i had to do when i finally stopped my mind from racing only one thought was left what am i doing joe kept trying asking me a third time then a few months later a fourth my answer was still not yet but over almost two years of being together the reason had shifted again at this point i was no longer afraid of marriage i knew i could marry joe he was a good man and a caring partner and i was unquestionably in love with him he would make a great husband and in the unlikely event that something went wrong down the road i knew i could survive as time moved me further and further from the pain of my earlier relationship i realized that as bad as it felt i had survived i was resilient it was also no longer about my job or having my space i was happy spending most of my time with him and the boys and i could see joe would support my desire to have a career he was always encouraging as i studied to get my master s degree and we had talked about the fact that teaching was a part of who i was he even came to a student production of king lear to support me in my studies it was done in kabuki style and was absolutely unbearable but he sat through the entire thing we laughed the whole way home i knew that marrying joe wasn t just about him it was about hunter and beau as well they had endured the loss of one mother already and i couldn t risk having them lose another joe often drove the boys to school it was a big part of their day getting special alone time with their dad every morning their shared ritual was to sing along to songs on the radio and one of their favorites was the helen reddy hit you and me against the world it s a simple beautiful song in which a mother sings to her child that she ll always be there for her when all the others turn their backs and walk away you can count on me to stay that was their bond one of shared memories of grief of absolute trust it was them against the world and they were asking me to join that sacred circle they trusted me to step into their lives and give them the love and devotion that had been stolen from them they weren t afraid that i wouldn t measure up but i was after all they had been through i could never risk hurting them again i had to be 100 sure that if joe and i got married it would be forever for beau and hunter s sake one afternoon in the spring of 1977 joe stopped by my apartment on his way to the airport he was heading out on a congressional delegation to south africa which meant we wouldn t see each other for the next 10 days our longest time apart since we d started dating i hugged him and told him to be safe but something felt different as he was walking out the door he turned back to me look he said i ve been as patient as i know how to be but this has got my irish up either you decide to marry me or that s it i m out i m not asking again his blue eyes normally alight seemed clouded with gray i m too much in love with you to just be friends i had known this moment would come he d first proposed almost two years before of course he wouldn t wait forever we stood for a moment looking at each other and i nodded when i come back he said i need an answer yes or no you don t have to tell me when you just have to tell me if okay i told him and then he was gone over the next few days i thought about my life what it had been so far and what it could be i loved joe i adored the boys i couldn t bear the thought of losing them when joe told me this was the last time he would ask i was sure he meant it he was prepared to walk away forever the evening joe got back from south africa he didn t drive home from the airport but came straight to my apartment i was expecting him to pick me up so we could go to a big family dinner at his house with mom mom dada val and jack frank and the boys but he didn t seem to be in much of a party mood when i opened the door i invited him in but even after the long flight he had no intention of relaxing for a moment he stood firm in my foyer and fixed his eyes on me i want to know your answer he said i could see that he didn t want to lose me but he would walk away for his boys there was concern in the corners of his eyes a sternness and i wondered if the fears that were still nagging at the back of my mind were as visible but even in the tension of that small entryway i could feel his love and i knew it was forever unconditional i knew that he and the boys had my heart and we were too intertwined now to protect ourselves from each other marriage license or not we were already a family i looked at him and quietly said yes relief flooded his face as he wrapped me in a hug then he held my shoulders and looked me straight in the eye i promise you your life will never change he said in the years since i ve thought about joe s promise that night that life would never change it would turn out to be wildly untrue of course life is change and our lives would be more amazing and more unbearably difficult than we could have known as we smiled at each other over dinner that night there have been tragedies we have had our hearts wrung and broken but the only place we are safe from all the dangers of love is hell and one thing in my life has stayed the same joe and i have always had each other from where the light enters building a family discovering myself by jill biden
