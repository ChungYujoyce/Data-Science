the biggest falsehoods from the presidential campaign by lori robertson posted on october 31 2012 with only days to go until election day 2012 we look here at the most egregiously false and misleading claims from the entire presidential campaign some examples so many false and twisted claims were made in the early months that we issued an early edition of our annual wrap up of political whoppers in july we noted then that the campaign had been nasty brutish and long and it s only gotten longer not more truthful for example romney just claimed that the bailed out chrysler corp is thinking of moving all jeep production to china chrysler quickly denounced that as a falsehood romney s latest whopper is perhaps his payback for obama s earlier accusation that romney personally shipped jobs to china at a time when in reality romney was running the 2002 winter olympics not bain capital thus one whopper begets another it s been that sort of campaign filled from beginning to end with deceptive attacks and counterattacks and dubious claims for a generous sampling of the worst of a bad lot please read on to our analysis section when we issued our early edition of this annual wrap up we complained that neither candidate speaks candidly of what he would actually do if elected we also expressed a hope that the candidates will become less personal more substantive and more forthcoming about their plans but instead of a candid discussion of how to address pressing issues including trillion dollar annual deficits rising health care costs and the needs of an aging population we ve seen even more exaggerations distortions and falsehoods on both sides we offer them here in no particular order and with no attempt to judge which candidate strays furthest or most often from the facts readers may judge that for themselves and we make no claim that this list is comprehensive rather it represents a summary and sampling of our findings issued over the course of a long and not very illuminating campaign obama has claimed at various times that romney has proposed a 5 trillion tax cut or that he wants to raise taxes by 2 000 on the middle class neither claim is accurate obama oct 3 governor romney s central economic plan calls for a 5 trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the bush tax cuts obama sept 17 i am not going to ask middle class families with kids to pay over 2 000 more so that millionaires and billionaires get to pay less romney s plan is not a 5 trillion tax cut he has always said he d offset his rate cuts by eliminating deductions and taxing a wider base of income producing no net loss of revenue romney proposed cutting income tax rates by 20 percent eliminating the estate tax and eliminating taxes on interest capital gains and dividends for those earning under 200 000 a year that would indeed cost about 480 billion in 2015 according to the nonpartisan tax policy center or roughly 5 trillion if projected over a full decade but that s not all romney s plan entailed he has always said he d pay for his tax cuts by reducing tax deductions and preferences taxing more income so no revenue is lost if he delivers on that promise a big if to be sure it would be a 0 tax cut romney s plan doesn t call for raising taxes by 2 000 on middle income taxpayers either he has been most emphatic about that in recent debates in the second debate at hofstra university on oct 16 he said middle income people are going to get a tax break the president bases his claim on a twisted reading of the tax policy center s study which found that it was mathematically impossible for romney to cut rates and hold revenue constant without also shifting the tax burden onto the shoulders of families with children making under 200 000 a year tpc s director donald marron disputed obama s interpretation of the study saying i view it as showing that romney s plan can t accomplish all his stated objectives dubious denver debate declarations oct 4 obama s stump speech sept 19 factchecking obama and biden sept 7 romney six studies support tax plan romney on the other hand is wrong when he claims that six studies show he can do what he promises on taxes romney oct 3 there are six other studies that looked at the tax policy center study you describe and say it s completely wrong only one of the six items some of which are blog posts and one of which is a campaign white paper was done by someone not advising romney the princeton professor who wrote that study was on president george w bush s council of economic advisers and he uses an aggressive assumption for economic growth assuming an extra 3 percent economic growth from romney s tax rate cuts the average total year to year growth under president bush including any boost from his large tax cuts was just over 2 percent since we issued our findings cited below two new analyses have come out a paper by gerald prante of the pro business tax foundation concluded that what romney proposes is possible without raising taxes on middle income taxpayers if it produced at least an extra 1 percent annual growth in economic output leaving aside whether that s a likely outcome of a revenue neutral tax shift it wouldn t stack up against romney s statement at the hofstra debate when he said i m not looking to cut taxes for wealthy people i am looking to cut taxes for middle income people the tax foundation analysis found that assuming an extra 1 percent economic growth those making over 1 million would get a cut of 113 792 while middle income households making between 50 000 and 75 000 a year would see an average cut of 36 an even more recent analysis by economist michael r strain of the pro business american enterprise institute published in the atlantic magazine said flatly that romney s plan doesn t add up strain wrote t he underlying analysis in the tpc study is sound and it should be taken seriously i f you take mr romney s three promises literally then something has to give nevertheless strain sees merit in romney s general approach broadening the tax base while bringing down rates he suggests that romney would cut rates less than the promised 20 percent to keep revenues constant while holding middle income taxpayers harmless dubious denver debate declarations oct 4 romney s impossible tax promise aug 3 romney obama s 4 000 tax hike romney also has claimed that obama will raise taxes on the middle class by 4 000 but that s bogus the figure is an estimate of how much it would cost to service the debt incurred in obama s term and in later years as well if taxes were increased across the board obama isn t proposing to do that any more than romney is romney campaign ad october obama will raise taxes on the middle class by 4 000 romney oct 16 the middle class will see 4 000 per year in higher taxes the figure is based on a study by the conservative american enterprise institute which looked at servicing the debt incurred since obama took office plus future debt projected under obama s most recent budget one set of figures assumed all federal taxes would be increased across the board preserving the progressivity of the overall federal tax code that is with different income groups bearing the same share of the total burden as they do now based on that an aei blogger wrote an oct 2 post with the headline obama s big budget deficits could mean a 4 000 a year middle class tax hike that was an average figure over the next 10 years including the cost of servicing both the debt run up since obama took office and debt to be run up in the next four years under the president s budget projections one problem with this view is that debt will continue to rise for years no matter who wins the presidency by the same logic employed by romney we calculated that the house budget proposed by his running mate rep paul ryan would raise taxes on the middle class by 2 732 even assuming ryan s aggressive spending cuts could be accomplished the aei study makes a valid point debts being run up today and in the future will require future taxpayers to cover very large interest payments for years into the future especially when today s low interest rates return to historically higher levels as expected but that will be true no matter who s president and neither candidate is proposing an across the board personal income tax increase to cover those payments romney s 4 000 tax tale oct 10 factchecking the hofstra debate oct 17 obama romney would ban all abortion the obama campaign pushed a bogus claim in a tv ad that said romney backed a law that outlaws all abortions even in cases of rape and incest there was no such law at all instead the ad referred to a hypothetical question from an audience member during a 2007 debate the audience member asked if hypothetically roe versus wade was overturned and the congress passed a federal ban on all abortion and it came to your desk would you sign it yes or no romney said i d be delighted to sign that bill but added that a consensus for something like that didn t exist in the country now that s not where america is today during that exchange there was no mention or discussion of rape incest or the usual exceptions to abortion bans and the fact is romney has been clear both before and after that 2007 debate that he supports exceptions for rape incest and to save the life of the mother he has opposed abortion with those exceptions since 2005 the obama campaign also falsely claimed that the republican party s platform called for banning abortions even in cases of rape or incest but the 2012 platform is silent on exceptions just as it was in 2008 and in previous election years the obama camp made the claim on its website saying that romney also supports the republican party platform which includes a human life amendment that bans abortion without those exceptions that s baloney the plain fact is the only human life amendment that ever came to a vote in either house of congress allowed exceptions james bopp one of the authors of the gop abortion plank confirmed our own reading of its plain language bopp said it does not take a position on which version of a human life amendment should eventually be adopted we leave that decision to congress and the people of the united states at that time twisting romney s abortion stance july 9 another abortion falsehood from obama s truth team aug 23 romney obama dropping work requirements the romney campaign made false claims about an obama administration move to give states flexibility regarding welfare work requirements romney tv ad aug president obama quietly announced a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements under obama s plan you wouldn t have to work and wouldn t have to train for a job they just send you your welfare check there s no such plan and work requirements aren t being dropped the obama administration announced in july that states may apply for a waiver to revise or eliminate certain requirements in order to increase job placement as of sept 6 only eight states had expressed interest in such waivers and none had applied the claim that you wouldn t have to work and wouldn t have to train for a job is also misleading there was never a requirement for all welfare recipients to work in fact only 29 percent met the work requirement when obama took office romney s claim that the plan would gut welfare reform is very misleading said ron haskins a former republican house committee aide who was instrumental in the 1996 welfare law i do not think it ends welfare reform or strongly undermines welfare reform he told factcheck org the romney campaign continued to run this ad despite several fact checking organizations including ours finding it to be false the dust up over the ad led to romney pollster neil newhouse saying we re not going let our campaign be dictated by fact checkers in an interview with cnn romney also made a misleading claim that obama had caused a doubling of able bodied persons on food stamps by taking work out of the food stamps requirement obama s 2009 stimulus law did grant a temporary suspension of a work requirement for single working age adults without dependents but the bush administration had already granted such waivers covering all or some residents of 46 states and the district of columbia more waiver requests were pending too as the economy faltered these working age adults without kids still make up less than one in 10 on food stamps does obama s plan gut welfare reform aug 9 romney s food stamp stretch sept 27 romney obama robbed medicare we ve seen our share of senior scare in political campaigns and this one has been chock full of it the truth is that both campaigns want to cut medicare spending a necessary step to prolong the life of the program and neither proposes major changes that would impact current seniors the romney campaign claimed that obama was robbing the medicare piggy bank and that the money you paid for medicare was being used for the affordable care act but the law doesn t take money out of the existing trust fund and it can t take medicare s trust fund money in the future either romney aug 60 minutes interview there s only one president that i know of in history that robbed medicare 716 billion to pay for a new risky program of his own that we call obamacare romney tv ad aug now when you need it obama has cut 716 billion from medicare so now the money that you paid for your guaranteed health care is going to a massive new government program that s not for you paul ryan aug 21 what they will not tell you is that they turned medicare into a piggy bank to fund obamacare they took 716 billion from medicare to pay for their obamacare program obama s affordable care act cuts an estimated 716 billion over 10 years in the future growth in spending primarily by reducing the future growth of payments to hospitals spending less money than was otherwise expected is a good thing for medicare s finances as it is for most people on a budget by reducing the growth of spending the health care law stretches out the budget for medicare part a which pays hospitals and is funded by payroll taxes romney s claim about obama taking money you paid is wrong because taxes paid in the past don t come close to paying for projected costs in the future it s misleading to tell medicare beneficiaries that they ve already paid for medicare because in the future that s going to be less and less true says alice rivlin founding director of the congressional budget office and now an economist with the brookings institution seniors will be getting more benefits than they paid for and medicare doesn t have a piggy bank that can be robbed or raided payroll money that goes into the trust fund is medicare s money the program gets a trust fund bond for whatever money it doesn t need right away and treasury has to honor that bond whenever medicare needs to cash it in medicare s piggy bank aug 24 a campaign full of mediscare aug 22 obama ryan plan would raise seniors costs 6 400 but the obama campaign was in on mediscare too misleading seniors into thinking they d pay 6 400 more under romney and ryan s plan to have private insurers compete for seniors business that figure came from an analysis by the congressional budget office of an old plan from ryan that has now been discarded his latest plan which romney has adopted is more generous in how subsidies or premium support payments for seniors grow obama aug 15 it was estimated that governor romney s running mate his original plan would force seniors to pay an extra 6 400 a year obama campaign tv ad experts say ryan s voucher plan could raise future retirees costs more than 6 000 the romney ryan plan wouldn t change anything for those age 55 and older for future beneficiaries they d have their pick of private plans or traditional medicare they d buy them with the help of a subsidy that would be tied to the cost of the second cheapest plan and that plan can t rise faster than gdp plus 0 5 percent the cbo said that under the new plan beneficiaries might face higher costs but it didn t analyze how much a campaign full of mediscare aug 22 tragic misquoting the obama campaign has claimed that romney called ending the war in iraq tragic not true romney called the pace of withdrawal tragic not the ending of the war in general obama sept 6 my opponent said it was tragic to end the war in iraq obama campaign website mitt romney criticized the end of the iraq war as tragic the real quote from romney made during a veterans roundtable in south carolina on nov 11 2011 clearly shows that he was criticizing the pace at which obama withdrew the troops here s the full quote as reported by the new york times romney nov 11 2011 it is my view that the withdrawal of all of our troops from iraq by the end of this year is an enormous mistake and failing by the obama administration the precipitous withdrawal is unfortunate it s more than unfortunate i think it s tragic it puts at risk many of the victories that were hard won by the men and women who served there vice president joe biden also misrepresented romney s words at the convention and at the vice presidential debate when he claimed that romney said of osama bin laden it s not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollars just to catch one person that s taking his words out of context romney made the comment back in 2007 when bin laden was alive and he went on to say he favored a broader strategy against global violent jihad here s the transcript of romney s 2007 interview with the associated press the conservative website townhall obtained the transcript from the romney campaign ap reporter liz sidoti why haven t we caught bin laden in your opinion romney i think i wouldn t want to over concentrate on binladen he s one of many many people who are involved in this globaljihadist effort he s by no means the only leader it s a very diverse group hamas hezbollah al qaeda muslim brotherhood and of course different namesthroughout the world it s not worth moving heaven and earth and spending billions of dollarsjust trying to catch one person it is worth fashioning and executing aneffective strategy to defeat global violent jihad and i have a plan fordoing that factchecking obama and biden sept 7 obama s inflated jobs claim oct 23 veep debate violations oct 12 romney jeep production to china romney falsely told voters in the key swing state of ohio on oct 25 that chrysler s jeep division is thinking of moving all production to china not true chrysler says it may add new production sites in china to meet rising demand in that market and states u s jeep assembly lines will continue to stay in operation but despite chrysler s admonition romney made a similar claim in a new tv ad that said obama took gm and chrysler into bankruptcy and sold chrysler to italians who are going to build jeeps in china that s a lot of misinformation in a single sentence romney has struggled to undercut the success of obama s bailout of gm and chrysler especially in key auto making states in the midwest that account for crucial votes in the electoral college romney s running mate ryan made one such attempt in his acceptance speech at the republican convention ryan cited the closing of a general motors plant in his hometown of janesville wis as evidence of obama failing to live up to his campaign promises but the car plant closed before obama became president ryan aug 29 a lot of guys i went to high school with worked at that gm plant right there at that plant candidate obama said i believe that if our government is there to support you this plant will be here for another hundred years that s what he said in 2008 well as it turned out that plant didn t last another year the plant didn t last but it essentially closed on dec 23 2008 according to the business journal in milwaukee a month before obama was sworn in the associated press reported that about 100 workers were kept on into 2009 to help shut down the plant and finish a truck order gm s website states that the main production line ceased operations in december 2008 and the last remaining line closed april 23 2009 barely three months after obama took office romney distorts facts on jeep auto bailout oct 29 ryan s vp spin aug 30 baffling benghazi claims the deadly terrorist attack on the u s consulate in benghazi libya spawned some baffling claims by both candidates immediately after the attack in september on u s embassies in libya and egypt romney wrongly claimed that the obama administration had issued an apology for american values after the attacks romney referred to a statement issued in response to an anti muslim video and before mobs attacked either embassy and the statement doesn t contain the word sorry or apology instead the u s embassy in cairo put out a statement several hours before the attack it said that the embassy condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of muslims as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of american democracy we firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others that was a reference to an anti islamic movie that was garnering attention in the middle east for its part the obama administration initially rejected and then played down the notion that it was a premeditated terrorist attack instead it focused on the anti muslim video as the root cause claiming extremists took advantage of a spontaneous protest to the film in benghazi to attack the consulate libyan president mohamed magariaf said on sept 16 five days after the attack that the idea that the benghazi attack was a spontaneous protest that just spun out of control is completely unfounded and preposterous yet obama and others continued to describe the incident in exactly those terms including during the president s sept 18 appearance on the late show with david letterman the next day matt olsen director of the national counterterrorism center called it a terrorist attack at a congressional hearing becoming the first administration official to do so on oct 9 nearly a month after the attack the state department disclosed that there weren t any protesters in benghazi before the terrorist attack romney gets it backward sept 12 benghazi timeline oct 26 obama romney shipped jobs overseas the obama campaign launched various attacks on romney for how he became wealthy at the venture capital firm bain capital television ads claimed that romney was a corporate raider who shipped jobs to china and mexico obama campaign tv ad june a s a corporate raider romney shipped jobs to china and mexico obama campaign tv ad june romney s never stood up to china all he s ever done is send them our jobs bain capital did invest in companies that outsourced work to others both overseas and here in the u s and in companies that manufactured goods abroad but the obama campaign has failed to show that romney was in charge of bain when outsourcing decisions were made the obama camp s examples pertain to companies in which bain invested after romney left the company in february 1999 to run the 2002 winter olympics official filings and contemporary news accounts show romney was in charge in name only and never returned to bain while he negotiated the financial terms of his severance it s also false to call romney a corporate raider bain capital did make money while loading some companies with debt but a corporate raider is one who mounts an unwelcome takeover bid by buying up shares usu discreetly on the stock market bain didn t engage in hostile takeovers under romney rather it invested in new companies or in struggling businesses that it attempted to turn around and sell at a profit with mixed success obama s outsourcer overreach june 29 factcheck org to obama camp your complaint is all wet july 2 romney s bain years new evidence same conclusion july 12 beyond bain bashing a pro obama super pac made the shocking implication that romney is responsible for the death of a steelworker s wife who had cancer the priorities usa action tv spot which aired only twice on aug 14 but garnered plenty of media attention features joe soptic who says his wife died of cancer a short time after romney closed the steel plant where he worked and left him and his wife without health insurance but that s misleading soptic s wife ranae died five years after the plant closed she also still had her own employer sponsored insurance through a job at a thrift store for a year or two longer after the plant shut down soptic told cnn joe soptic in priorities usa ad when mitt romney and bain closed the plant i lost my health care and my family lost their health care and a short time after that my wife became ill and then one day she became ill and i took her up to the jackson county hospital and admitted her for pneumonia and she passed away in 22 days i do not think mitt romney realizes what he s done to anyone and furthermore i do not think mitt romney is concerned it s fair to argue that romney bears some responsibility for the plant shutting down bain capital did buy it and saddle it with debt while romney was head of bain but romney was running the 2002 winter olympics when the plant actually shut down priorities usa action claimed that it would be overstating the point of the ad to suggest that the steelworker was blaming romney for his wife s death but we disagree soptic says in the ad i do not think mitt romney realizes what he s done to anyone and furthermore i do not think mitt romney is concerned is romney to blame for cancer death aug 8 romney obama went on an apology tour romney has repeatedly claimed that obama embarked on an apology tour after he became president but we have found no evidence of that romney oct 22 and then the president began what i ve called an apology tour of going to to various nations in the middle east and and criticizing america romney aug 30 i will begin my presidency with a jobs tour president obama began with an apology tour we went through obama s speeches that romney points to in his book no apology and we didn t see anything that rose to the level of an apology for instance romney points to obama s june 4 2009 speech in cairo egypt but there s no apology there instead obama talked about tension between the u s and the muslim world and called for a new beginning obama june 4 2009 violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of muslims the attacks of september 11 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view islam as inevitably hostile not only to america and western countries but also to human rights all this has bred more fear and more mistrust so long as our relationship is defined by our differences we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity and this cycle of suspicion and discord must end i ve come here to cairo to seek a new beginning between the united states and muslims around the world one based on mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth that america and islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition false claims in final debate oct 23 romney s sorry apology dig aug 31 romney stimulus rife with cronyism and waste the romney campaign has claimed the stimulus program was filled with cronyism and waste and even spent money in finland romney campaign tv ad may more than 16 billion have gone to companies like solyndra that are linked to big obama and democrat donors the inspector general said contracts were steered to friends and family ryan oct 11 was it a good idea to spend taxpayer dollars on electric cars in finland gregory friedman the inspector general for the department of energy did not say that contracts were steered to friends and family he said the office was investigating that but no charges have been made and it s not true that stimulus money went for electric cars in finland as ryan said at the vice presidential debate fisker automotive which received about 500 million in government backed loans does build cars in finland but the loan money went for engineering sales and design and marketing in the u s all of the doe loan money that we got for the karma project the first line of cars had to be spent in america fisker spokesman roger ormisher told us back in may most of the 840 billion in stimulus funds went for tax credits to individuals a total of 236 billion and grants to states for medicare medicaid and education furthermore 80 percent of economic experts surveyed by the university of chicago booth school of business agreed that the unemployment rate was lower at the end of 2010 than it would have been without the stimulus while only 4 percent disagreed romney s solar flareout june 1 veep debate violations oct 12 and there s more we also found whoppers on popular topics such as the federal health care law jobs and the debt lori robertson q are hospitals inflating the number of covid 19 cases and deaths so they can be paid more a recent legislation pays hospitals higher medicare rates for covid 19 patients and treatment but there is no evidence of fraudulent reporting
