no automatic recount provision for down ballot races only for statewide races but voters can petition for one if they show cause a likely scenario considering the tight margin at the lamb campaign watch party alleghenycounty executive rich fitzgerald thanked supporters on behalf of the candidate and urged them to hang in there republicans have been fretting in recent days that saccone could lose the 18th district race thanks to high democratic enthusiasm in the year since trump took office as well as lackluster fundraising by the gop candidate saccone has a lengthy r sum as a former air force intelligence officer and current state legislator but lamb outraised him by a factor of more than four that gap prompted gop outside groups to flood the district with more than 10 million to try to save saccone by tuesday many republicans were pessimistic about saccone s chances a monday poll by monmouth university found lamb leading no matter the turnout projection which appeared to be confirmation of what many in the gop had feared he has a good bio he s just not a good candidate one republican member of congress told the hill shortly after the poll came out the fundraising charisma ideologically the issues are working against him there are candidate flaws other republicans began publicly attempting to lower expectations for saccone by playing up the democratic registration advantage here even though republicans regularly clean up in federal elections the rust belt district became a flash point in the battle for the house majority with democrats looking for a symbolic victory in a deep red district to send a warning sign to republicans lamb ran a moderate campaign as he looked to navigate a reliably gop district he vowed to vote against pelosi as the party s leader steered away from his party s calls for gun control and said he s personally opposed to abortion though he supports abortion rights that statement against pelosi neutralized one of the gop s strongest attacks lumping a candidate in with the well known liberal standard bearer he also focused heavily on mobilizing union workers a critical part of tuesday s electorate that includes many registered democrats that backed trump in 2016 labor leaders both nationally and in the area ferociously worked to boost lamb criticizing saccone for his support for right to work legislation that hurts unions but even as lamb gained ground republicans flooded the zone in hopes of avoiding an embarrassing loss in the final stretch of the race the white house and its allies came out in
