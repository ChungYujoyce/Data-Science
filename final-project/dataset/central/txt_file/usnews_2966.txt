mcdonald s has suspended locations across five cities in hubei province and starbucks has also shut some cafes in the country bloomberg news reports it s important to distinguish between travel advisories and bans in responding to the novel coronavirus experts say travel advisories to avoid outbreak zones and non essential travel to at risk areas make a lot of sense says amesh a adalja an infectious disease expert at johns hopkins center for health security adalja notes that a widespread outbreak in which people cannot freely move crosses a threshold where you want to tell people that they need to know if they re considering travel to the region there may be difficulties getting back out of there there may be issues with exposure to infection and then getting health care in that area adalja says but travel bans can make situations worse adalja notes it s going to isolate a population it s going to create public animosity it s going to create stigma and it s going to make it much harder to get resources to an outbreak zone or to allow people to get to those zones as well as out of those zones countries may initiate travel bans for political reasons as opposed to scientific ones he says adding that it is something that people often clamor for any time there s any type of outbreak vincent racaniello a virologist and professor of microbiology immunology at columbia university agrees that a travel ban in this case is uncalled for based on the severity of the virus racaniello adds that travel restrictions probably played a big role in eventually stopping the sars outbreak but is skeptical about how useful they can be in relation to this new coronavirus outbreak in which infected people with little to no symptoms appear to be passing on the disease with sars most cases were more easily diagnosed as symptoms were more severe he explains racaniello is unsure about whether travel restrictions will have much of an effect on the new coronavirus as people are still moving around the virus may end up entrenched as another respiratory virus in the human population kind of like influenza is racaniello says if it gets in every country of the world in significant numbers then we might not be able to get rid of it like we did with sars as countries independently started issuing advisories and a range of travel restrictions the world health organization has said international coordination may be necessary to contain the outbreak while also minimizing the impact on international trade and travel 194 countries implementing unilateral measures based on their own individual risk assessment is a potential recipe for disaster said michael ryan executive director of who s health emergencies programme at a press conference on wednesday on thursday the who declared the outbreak a global public health emergency although there is currently no vaccine to prevent infection from the coronavirus individuals can take precautions to avoid exposure to the virus according to the cdc they include washing your hands thoroughly with soap and water avoiding close contact with people who are sick staying home when you are sick avoiding touching your eyes nose and mouth with unwashed hands covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue and cleaning frequently touched objects and surfaces the cdc also lays out extra precautions for commercial airline crews advising that they frequently wash their hands and treat all body fluids as if they are infectious when managing a sick traveler the agency says that employees should minimize contact with any sick person and offer a face mask to the infected person if possible the cdc recommends avoiding non essential travel to china but for those who choose to go the agency recommends avoiding contact with sick people discussing the trip with their healthcare provider and avoiding animals animal markets and raw meat adalja says there is nothing specific a person needs to do when flying besides practicing the same hygiene they would to protect themselves from influenza and other respiratory viruses which are more likely to be present than the new coronavirus i do not recommend people wear masks routinely he says adding that it would be unnecessary and unproductive for people in countries not facing a significant risk of community spread like the u s to do so write to sanya
