c americans are generally positive in their evaluations of how each of nine leaders and institutions has handled the response to the coronavirus situation eight of the nine receive majority positive ratings led by u s hospitals at 88 approval only the news media gets a more negative than positive review these data are from a march 13 22 gallup poll with the field period starting on the same day president donald trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and spanning sharp increases in the number of documented cases in the u s as well as the number of deaths about four in five americans approve of the way their state government and government agencies such as the centers for disease control and prevention and the national institutes of health are handling the coronavirus outbreak similarly 83 of parents of children younger than 18 rate their children s school or daycare positively for its handling of the situation and 82 of u s workers rate their employer s response positively meanwhile about six in 10 u s adults approve of the response by their elected leaders in washington president donald trump vice president mike pence and the u s congress as a whole trump s 60 approval rating for his handling of the coronavirus is higher than his 49 overall job rating meaning that a substantial percentage of americans approve of his handling of the current health crisis while disapproving of his performance more generally republicans and republican leaning independents rate their state government s response to the coronavirus as highly as democrats and democratic leaning independents do majorities of both groups also approve of the job that hospitals government health agencies and congress are doing although republicans approval is higher than democrats in each case by contrast nearly all republicans 93 compared with 29 of democrats approve of trump s performance although democrats approval on this measure well exceeds their overall 13 rating for trump in the same poll in addition to partisanship the lower ratings among democrats also appear to be a function of higher levels of worry among this group only on the news media s handling of the coronavirus are democrats more approving than republicans 61 vs 25 respectively gallup has consistently found that democrats have more confidence than republicans in mass media americans are largely approving of how u s institutions and leaders are responding to the coronavirus situation hospitals are held in the highest regard during this health crisis consistent with the high trust and ethical ratings medical and health workers receive in normal times the global health pandemic is far from over and many more challenging decisions on how to handle it will need to be made both in the near and the long term how leaders from washington to state capitals to everyday workplaces act in the coming months will greatly affect people s lives and will likely shape americans
