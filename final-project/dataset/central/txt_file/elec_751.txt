washington while many races have yet to be called it is clear after tuesday s election that the predicted blue wave in the 2018 midterms turned out to be more of a democratic swell democrats did gain a clear majority in the houseand flipped some governorships although fewer than they had hoped butrepublicans added more seats than expected in the senate and scored victories in nearly all of the most high profile races both sidesare claiming the results as a victory so who really came out on top here is a look at the winners and losers from tuesday before tuesday liberal leaning commentators gushed about three democratic candidates who appeared to be winning over voters in southern states with unapologeticallyliberal platforms beto o rourke in the texas senate race andrew gillum in the florida governor race and stacey abrams in the georgia governor race their campaigns became the focus of national media attention heading into the election and democrats poured money into the races many said those three candidates could represent a new forward for liberals in republican territory abrams gillum and o rourke performed well and made their races tight but all three appear to have been defeated on the other hand alexandria ocasio cortez a self described democratic socialist won in deeply blue new york to become theyoungest woman ever elected to congress at age 29 more elections 2018 results from every state heading into election day most pollsters and pundits predicted that republicans would retain controlof the senate but few thought they would add more than one maybe two seats some said a true democratic wave could even sweep away a couple of gop incumbents to hand democrats a majority but the republicans did much more than hold onto the senate they flipped at least three senate seats defeating democratic incumbent sens heidi heitkamp joe donnelly and claire mccaskill and they may not be done there florida gov rick scott ledsen bill nelson although a mandatory recount could be triggeredif the current margin holds more arizona s mcsally sinema senate race is too close to call now what happens nevada sincumbent sen dean heller was defeated and krysten sinema took a late lead in arizona s senate race cutting into gop gains buthowever the undeclared races shake out majority leader mitch mcconnell can rest easy at a minimum he will have a 52 48 majority assuming democrats don t pull off a major upset in mississippi s senate runoff later this month if scott goes on to victory the republicans win in mississippi and sinema holds her lead that margin will widen to 53 47 a net gain of two seats more republicans make history by growing senate majority while losing house perhaps the biggest outcome of the election divided government has returned to capitol hill the winners of more than 20 house races have not yet been projected but democrats have already won more than the 218 seats required to gain amajority and they are expected to pad their lead as the remaining races are called house democrats will now have to decide if minority leader nancy pelosi d calif will return to her role as speaker more than two dozen democratic house candidatesran on pledges not to support pelosi who has become a lightning rod for conservatives if they won more democrats seize control of house power to investigate president trump with democrats in control of the house the barks of opposition that have hounded trump since he took office will now have some bite democrats are all but certain to use their new authority to launch investigations the current republican leadership didn t wish to pursue and the president may very well see a subpoena for those tax returns he has been reluctant to share pelosi made it clear tuesday that she opposes impeachment but that doesn t mean the liberal wing of the party won t be pushing for it he might have lost the house but the president was celebrating on his twitter feed tuesday night and wednesday morning that s because of the republicans strong performance in several senate races that polls had painted as democratic leaning toss ups trump has always thrilled at besting his predecessor former president barack obama and on tuesday republicans were victorious in many places where both men campaigned hard for their parties candidates for that reason the president even found some silver lining in the republican defeats tweeting wednesday that those who worked with me in this incredible midterm election embracing certain policies and principles did very well while those that did not stick with him now must say goodbye and trump who loves a good foil will now have house democrats to blame for just about every obstacle facing his agenda many republicans who distanced themselves from the president did so because they were in competitive districts where trump s low popularity numbers and divisive politics made him more of a liability than an asset for the most part those were moderate republicans such as florida rep carlos curbelo and new jersey rep leonard lance with the moderates getting knocked out the remaining republican minority will likely move even closer to the president and adhere closely to his agenda the next congress will include a record number of female members with at least 113 women winning seats tuesday the previous high was 107 women made up about two thirds of the districts that democrats managed to flip in order to gain control of the house and 11 women were elected to the senate and another nine won governors races candidates from the lgbtq community also won historic victories tuesday colorado s jared polis became the first openly gay man to win a governor s race in kansas sharice davids an lgbtqnative american defeated incumbent republican rep
