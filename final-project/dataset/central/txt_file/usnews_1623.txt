on both sides of the atlantic authorities are grappling with what to do with people linked to islamic state isis returning home from the war in syria president donald trump has said hoda muthana who left the u s to become a propagandist for isis is not a u s citizen and will not be admitted into the united states while shamima begum who left london four years ago with two friends to join up with isis in syria has been stripped of her u k citizenship other foreign citizens who fought for isis are facing justice in their home countries the british government has prosecuted at least 40 people who have returned to the u k having fought in iraq or syria on feb 16 trump called on britain france germany and other european allies to take back over 800 isis fighters that we captured in syria and put them on trial begum and muthana were not combatants but each pledged allegiance to isis and for now at least they will not be allowed back to what they consider their home countries their cases have raised some difficult questions what does it mean to be a citizen of britain or the u s and how easily can that citizenship be removed here we try to explain to not be a legal citizen of any country despite the universal declaration of human rights affirming that everyone has the right to a nationality the u n estimates there are roughly 12 million people around the world who are not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law what this means in practice for example is that if begum s human rights were violated in syria there would be no state that would be able to take up her claim or protect her because it claims she is a dual citizen of bangladesh britain s home secretary or interior minister sajid javid says he was legally entitled to strip begum of her british citizenship because she already has bangladeshi citizenship via her bangladeshi born mother however bangladesh s ministry of foreign affairs insists she is not a citizen and that there is no question of her being allowed into the country she has never lived in bangladesh lawyers for begum say it is illegal under international law for her to have had her british citizenship removed something that can only legally be done if begum is also a citizen of another country if in the future it is found that begum is a bangladeshi citizen javid s decision will likely stand if it s found that she is not his decision could be annulled dr katherine e brown head of the department of theology and religion at birmingham university said begum has been denied due process we haven t allowed her the rule of law or a fair trial to determine what crimes she may or may not have committed but that may not matter under british law the home secretary can revoke a dual national of their british citizenship if he believes it would be conducive to the public good it s a low and loose test says dapo akande professor of public international law at the university of oxford sajid javid doesn t need any evidence of criminality or evidence that begum is about to commit a crime to strip her of her british citizenship it s not clear muthana s lawyer claims she was born in 1994 in hackensack new jersey yet according to secretary of state mike pompeo she has no legal basis no valid u s passport no right to a passport nor any visa to travel to the united states in other words pompeo believes muthana has never been a citizen of the united states hassan shibly an attorney for the muthana family told the associated press the trump administration s position was based on an incorrect interpretation of a law surrounding the rights of children born to foreign diplomats muthana s father was a yemeni diplomat working in the states and according to u s law the children of active diplomats are not granted birthright citizenship since diplomats live under the jurisdiction of their home countries muthana s lawyers maintain however that she was born a month after her father was discharged from his position as a diplomat and that muthana therefore qualifies for standard birthright citizenship under the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment both muthana and begum have said they are willing to co operate with authorities but until either of them are allowed back home they will remain in the refugee camp in syria in which they were found begum is entitled to challenge the decision either by tribunal or judicial review but to be successful she would have to demonstrate that the government acted disproportionately in deciding to remove her british nationality contact us at editors time com
