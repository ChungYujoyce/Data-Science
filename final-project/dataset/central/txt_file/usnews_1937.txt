not explore allegations of collusion between russia and the trump campaign in this case in september manafort is slated to face a second trial in washington d c on separate charges of money laundering and failure to register as a foreign agent he has pled not guilty to all of the charges here s what you need to know paul manafort is a veteran republican lobbyist and lawyer who later worked in eastern europe before becoming trump s campaign chairman he spent several years doing consulting work for the party of regions in pro russia ukraine and for viktor yanukovych ukraine s former president manafort has said his firm received over 17 million for their work for the party between 2012 and 2014 yanukovych was eventually ousted in a violent revolution in 2014 after which he fled to russia special counsel robert mueller s team is investigating manafort s ties to yanukovych and other eastern european oligarchs and allegations of tax and bank fraud were raised in the process manafort will be the first of trump s former aides to stand trial manafort was trump s campaign chairman from may 2016 to august 2016 he was hired in march after pointing to his experience advising presidential election campaigns in the past he was involved in the campaigns of republicans gerald ford ronald reagan george h w bush and bob dole however he also presented himself as a washington outsider saying he will not bring washington baggage something that appealed to trump and he initially offered to work for free manafort s ties to trump began before the 2016 election in the 1980s trump hired manafort s lobbying firm to help the trump organization and in 2006 manafort and his wife bought a trump tower apartment as part of the election team manafort initially took the lead in securing votes from delegates at the republican national convention after a power struggle with corey lewandowski manafort was promoted to campaign chairman and chief strategist in may he controlled day to day operations as well as managing the budget advising hiring decisions and shaping media strategy he was a major presence during the republican national convention and at the time denied inquiries about the campaign s possible ties to russia on aug 17 2016 trump reorganized his staff in a way that minimized manafort s role on the team after news reports documented his dealings with russia two days later manafort resigned from the campaign and his roles were replaced by steve bannon and kellyanne conway ever since manafort has been implicated in his dealings with russian and ukrainian operatives the white house has attempted to distance him from the campaign former white house press secretary sean spicer said in 2017 that manafort played a limited role for a very limited amount of time in the campaign mueller has been investigating russian interference in the 2016 presidential election as part of his work he scrutinized manafort s ties to russia and discovered violations of the law in the process manafort was charged with bank and tax fraud after allegedly failing to pay taxes on money that he made in ukraine and lying about having offshore bank accounts mueller s critics claim that his prosecution of manafort is outside the scope of his russia investigation claiming that mueller is exceeding his authority by prosecuting this case the judge t s ellis iii has repeatedly suggested that mueller is only pursuing the case to pressure manafort into implicating trump you don t really care about mr manafort s bank fraud he said in a hearing you really care about what information mr manafort can give you that would reflect on mr trump or lead to his prosecution or impeachment or whatever however the judge ultimately allowed the case to proceed determining that mueller s team had followed proper protocol ellis concluded that as mueller investigated indirect links between the trump campaign and the russian government he was permitted to prosecute federal crimes that arise out of his authorized investigation trump has distanced himself from manafort but he s also defended him and argued the prosecution is politically motivated trump told reporters paul manafort worked for me for a very short period of time in june his staff has echoed these claims white house press secretary sarah sanders told reporters manafort was brought in to lead the delegate process which he did and was dismissed not too long after that in june trump tweeted the pursuit of manafort is very unfair after citing that his former campaign chair played instrumental roles in the campaigns of other republican presidential nominees like ronald reagan during a recent interview with fox trump has likened the investigation into manafort to prohibition era gangster al capone who was brought down on tax evasion charges with paul manafort who really is a nice man you look at what s going on it s like al capone trump said it s just a sad thing he added manafort s alexandria trial will delve into allegations of tax evasion prosecutors are expected to argue that manafort s expensive homes and other luxury items don t add up to the incomes he declared on previous tax returns court documents allege that manafort with the assistance of rick gates his former top aide engaged in a scheme to hide income from united states authorities while enjoying the use of the money documents also include allegations that manafort failed to pay taxes on his income by disguising it as loans and that he used offshore accounts to purchase real estate in the united states mueller s office said it plans to call 35 witnesses including gates who has already pleaded guilty in mueller s investigation jury selection begins tuesday manafort s first trial won t be focusing on collusion according to prosecutors it will be focused specifically on manafort s supposed financial crimes relating to his work in ukraine ellis warned the prosecutors to refrain from dwelling on russia citing the current antipathy toward russians and noting that most people in this country don t distinguish between ukrainians and russians mueller s team assured him that they will not raise issues of russian involvement in the u s elections i don t anticipate the word russia will be uttered by a government witness responded one member of the special counsel team during a pre trial hearing the trial will only touch briefly on the trump campaign mueller s team plans to bring up evidence that a banking executive approved a fraudulent loan application from manafort in exchange for a role on the campaign which he received and the promise of a job in the trump administration which never materialized the judge allowed trump to be mentioned specifically in that capacity nevertheless the trial will provide more insight into the depth and breadth of the mueller probe manafort will later face a second trial in d c in september where he faces separate and more serious charges of conspiracy to launder money failure to register as a foreign agent for his lobbying efforts in ukraine and obstruction of justice for attempted witness tampering correction july 31
