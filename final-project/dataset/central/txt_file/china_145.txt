breakthrough in embracing common values for china this is a huge change from not accepting the universality of values loading november 12 2014 who will shape global values in the 21st century one answer may lie in a set of extraordinary pacts signed by china and the united states at a summit this week in beijing these two giant nations so often at odds over clashing interests were able to find a common vision for curbing climate emissions improving military conduct in the air and sky opening more trade and granting generous visas that would be valid for 10 years each pact by itself marks specific progress notably on the environment peace prosperity and people exchanges taken together however they are based on common principles applicable to all they also put to the test china s claim that there are no universal values but rather only the overlapping interests of countries based on their own culture and politics relations between nations in china s view are determined by power distribution and order not shared values before the summit between president obama and chinese president xi jinping american officials warned of difficulties in negotiating with china over common

practicing them are less than fully legitimate still the west is currently confronted by three countries russia china and iran that claim values unique to their specific civilization or in iran s case an islamic past that included a unified muslim superstate or caliphate all three have also extended their militaries into other countries in recent years such as russia into crimea despite a world made closer by jets media and the internet warns jos manuel barroso the recent president of the european commission globalization has not guaranteed the acceptance of universal values get the monitor
