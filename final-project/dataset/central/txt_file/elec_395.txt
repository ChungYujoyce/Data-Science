advertisement supported by by peter baker and trip gabriel west palm beach fla president obama opened a two day campaign swing through florida on thursday as he tried to build support in this deadlocked battleground state by presenting his opponent mitt romney as a bad choice for older americans after weeks of focusing on mr romney s private sector business deals mr obama turned to another front by attacking republican plans to repeal his health care law and transform medicare into a voucher program democrats have long used medicare as an issue to galvanize older voters in florida against republicans he plans to turn medicare into a voucher program mr obama told supporters at a retirement community here if the voucher isn t worth what it takes to buy health insurance in the private marketplace you re out of luck you ve got to make up the difference you re on your own mr obama continued how many people think that s a good idea to finance tax cuts for folks who don t need them and weren t even asking for them so florida that is wrong it s wrong to ask you to pay more for medicare so people who are doing well right now get even more mr romney s campaign called the president s statements dishonest attacks that mischaracterized his plans for medicare the republican candidate gave three interviews to florida radio stations to counter the president s visit the president is extraordinarily out of touch with how america s economy works and with how individuals pursuing their dreams in this country have built america he told a tampa station the president thinks that it s government that should take responsibility for all the successful businesses in this country mr obama s trip to florida is his seventh of the year he stopped in jacksonville and west palm beach on thursday and travels to fort myers and orlando on friday the obama campaign is so intent on winning florida and its electoral votes that it began opening offices here more than a year ago and in recent weeks showed millions of dollars of advertisements in the state but while mr obama won florida in 2008 he remains effectively tied with mr romney a poll conducted for the miami herald the tampa bay times and other news organizations last week found that 46 percent of likely florida voters support mr obama and 45 percent support mr romney particularly worrisome for the president more florida voters than not believe his policies have made the economy worse and want his health care law repealed matthew t corrigan a political scientist at the university of north florida said mr obama has the advantages of incumbency and early organization while mr romney has momentum from the economy it s conceivable for the president to lose florida and have other ways to go he said but i think for romney it s a must win state mr obama s focus on older americans reflects both their power in florida and the president s troubles attracting them voters 65 and over represented 22 percent of the florida electorate in 2008 compared with 16 percent nationally but many are skeptical of mr obama s health care law and plans for medicare after republicans have attacked democrats for shifting money from the program to pay for the new health law democrats are focusing on that because republicans have made inroads with seniors in florida and it s not the reliably democratic voting bloc it used to be mr corrigan said democrats insisted mr obama will prevail what s unique about florida said representative debbie wasserman schultz of florida the democratic national committee chairwoman is we have demographic groups that i think are going to be particularly moved by the dramatic contrast between mitt romney s record and his proposals and president obama s record and the direction he wants to continue to move this country in at both stops thursday mr obama pressed the argument that mr romney s plans would hurt older americans older floridians saved an average of 600 last year on prescription drug costs because the obama health care law helped close the so called doughnut hole in coverage according to the obama campaign the law also helped seniors with free preventive care and annual wellness visits the president took aim at mr romney s support for a plan to overhaul medicare by providing recipients vouchers to obtain health care insurance on the private market mr obama argued vouchers would never cover the full price costing older americans more than 6 000 a year the romney campaign called that a distortion and pointed to politifact an independent fact checking operation that has deemed mr obama s claim mostly false mr romney s aides also noted mr obama used 500 billion in medicare savings to pay for his health care law for his part mr romney spent the day in massachusetts where he visited middlesex truck and coach in boston to attack mr obama again for saying that successful business owners did not get there without government help now i know that some people think what the president said was just a gaffe mr romney said it wasn t a gaffe it was instead his ideology brian maloney 69 who has been in business since 1980 was an ideal embodiment of mr romney s message i take umbrage at the suggestion that people don t start and build businesses he said i started out with 50 bucks and worked with my hands to afford grad school at night government he added brought only complicated regulations it s overbearing two local politicians showed up to undercut mr romney s message i m very happy that former governor romney found his way here said tito jackson a city councilman from the area which is largely black and hispanic but you know what he didn t create jobs when he was governor he didn t find himself in this community that often mr romney whose campaign mastered such tactics during the republican primaries brushed off the protest oh that s the nature of politics he told the business owner there are always two teams we re always bothering each other s teams advertisement
