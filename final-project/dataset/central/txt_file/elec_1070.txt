a fire burning others are sensing they may have to battle a weary resignation for the past three years democrats have drawn fuel from a collective sense of outrage but as new hampshire prepares to register its choice for the democratic nominee on tuesday there are signs that some of that anger may be fading into something more like weary resignation so many people myself included have gotten to the point where it s like trump did this and i m just like yeah whatever says emily hay an energy efficiency coordinator from tilton new hampshire last week in particular was a kind of dispiriting exercise in futility for democrats president donald trump s impeachment trial ended with his long expected acquittal by the senate the iowa caucus fiasco raised serious doubts about the democratic

joe biden should be the democratic party s nominee mr biden she tells the crowd gathered at the rex theater in manchester is the only candidate who can beat you know who there s a pause and then a feeble smattering of applause beating you know who has been a defining theme of this democratic primary contest with candidates and voters alike describing donald trump s presidency as a kind of national emergency for three years democrats have predicted that feelings of outrage and urgency on their side would drive massive numbers of voters to the polls next november as happened during the 2018 midterm elections but as new hampshire prepares to register its choice for the democratic nominee on tuesday there are signs that some of that anger may be fading into something more like weary resignation last week in particular was a kind of dispiriting exercise in futility for democrats president trump s impeachment trial ended with his long expected acquittal by the senate and his gallup approval rating reached a new high the iowa caucus fiasco raised serious doubts about the democratic party s competence and did little to winnow its unwieldy field of candidates notably turnout among iowa democrats was far lower than in 2008 despite predictions that it would smash records leading many to wonder if the party may suddenly have an enthusiasm problem i think there s a malaise settling in on the democratic party says andrew smith director of the university of new hampshire survey center you can only stay angry for so long over plastic foam plates of lo mein in the mall of new hampshire s food court emily hay says she plans to vote for vermont sen bernie sanders on tuesday but she s feeling pessimistic about the democrats chances of beating the president in november so many people myself included have gotten to the point where it s like trump did this and i m just like yeah whatever says ms hay an energy efficiency coordinator from tilton new hampshire her mother polly hayden agrees saying the senate s recent acquittal of the president only discouraged her further it s hard to be optimistic with everything we ve seen concurs ms hay s husband russel still he views recent events as more of a temporary setback and he doesn t see a widespread apathy among democrats i think there are enough young people who are angry says mr hay i think there is still a fire burning certainly the fire was there in 2018 the midterm elections saw the highest voter turnout in four decades helping democrats win back control of the u s house of representatives with the largest margin of victory for a midterm in modern history but replicating that playbook again given four years of a trump presidency that included nonstop controversies from a special counsel investigation to an impeachment may prove more difficult not only has mr trump emerged from all those events largely unscathed but many voters are also expressing a sense of fatigue at the same time the all consuming focus on mr trump has made it hard for any of the democratic candidates to gain traction and while elections involving sitting presidents often play out as referendums on the incumbent the president is already working to define his opponents in negative terms just a few tables away in the food court two women eating auntie anne s pretzels describe president trump as the best of the worst when asked if they would support any of the democratic candidates they throw their heads back and laugh no way says one of the women as her friend vigorously shakes her head not a chance while an app malfunction and other irregularities delayed the final results in iowa about 176 000 iowans participated in last week s caucus a slight increase from 2016 but still 62 000 voters short of 2008 s record breaking numbers republicans on the other hand saw more than 30 000 iowans turn out in a largely symbolic show of support for the president smashing turnout records for an incumbent according to the iowa gop brian snyder reuters sen elizabeth warren a democratic 2020 presidential candidate greets patrons at the sweet maple cafe in conway new hampshire feb 10 2020 many democrats admit to feeling particularly apprehensive as mr trump s prospects for winning reelection appear to be improving waiting in a snaking line to see sen amy klobuchar in salem new hampshire on sunday denise ouellette a voter from massachusetts who plans to support pete buttigieg says she keeps hoping something will come out about the president to undermine his support leaders embody our nation she says her voice beginning to quaver and her eyes filling with tears they re supposed to embody our value system ms ouellette s husband tom believes the democrats best chances of winning in november would be with senator klobuchar or mr buttigieg but he s not overly optimistic i think it s a toss up says mr ouellette i think it s entirely possible that even with everything trump s done that he s still there in 2021 to be sure some argue the events of the past week may have actually helped to fan the flames for democrats although new hampshire s secretary of state cut his initial turnout projection by 80 000 votes he is still predicting a historic turnout of 420 000 on tuesday carlos cardona chairman of the laconia democrats says democratic enthusiasm in his town which voted for mr trump in 2016 before voting for a democratic congressman in 2018 surpasses anything he saw ahead of the 2018 midterms or even the 2008 election i m feeling the energy on the ground a lot more than ever says mr cardona he knows people who have taken a week off from work to canvass for candidates and says his own door has been knocked at least 17 times mr cardona expects record turnout on tuesday and is anticipating a big victory for senator sanders who won the state in 2016 and is currently leading in most polls there in the run up to the iowa caucuses mr sanders predicted the largest caucus turnout in iowa history would propel him to victory and although he appears to have won iowa s popular vote he lags mr buttigieg in state delegate equivalents and he later admitted the turnout was a disappointment i think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters he saidin friday s debate iowans under the age of 30 made up 24 of all caucusgoers compared with 22 in 2008 with the majority of them backing mr sanders but the overall number of young people who caucused was still down from 2008 of course caucuses which require showing up at a specific time and committing several hours tend to have much lower turnout than primaries and many sanders supporters are predicting a much bigger show of strength in new hampshire on tuesday after hosting a debate watch party on friday night david robin got on a midnight greyhound bus in new york city to canvass for the vermont senator by dinnertime on saturday mr robin still hadn t checked in to his room at the nearby econo lodge it s going to take a movement like ours to beat a movement like trump s he says at other candidates events many rallygoers a high percentage of whom appear to have traveled here from other states say they re similarly determined i am not one of the people who are worried that this is all chaos and disaster says chris bastian a transportation planner from the new york city borough of brooklyn waiting in line to see mr biden in manchester but mary aarons a book publisher from massachusetts admits to feeling apprehensive about november before getting in line to see mr biden she was chatting with the owner of a nearby pastry shop noting how empty manchester seemed the saturday before the primary at this time in 2008 the pastry shop owner told ms aarons the place was buzzing the streets were packed i have to remain optimistic though because we have to have hope right says ms aarons i can t even conceive of the alternative staff writer christa case bryant contributed to this report how do you define political strength it could come with a heavy hand or some might argue revenge against opponents is justified at times this story looks at the complex factors that can come into play president donald trump s retribution against those he may believe share blame for his impeachment predicament began in earnest friday as he fired two of the most prominent impeachment witnesses lt col alexander vindman of the national security council and ambassador to the european union gordon sondland at the prayer breakfast thursday president trump had heard conservative thinker arthur brooks stress the idea of love for one s enemies arthur i don t know if i agree with you the president said like richard nixon and other chief executives before him mr trump may see retribution as a deterrent to future enemies and a sign of political strength but history shows the line between strength and politically damaging vindictiveness is a fine one and the notion that the u s government and its officials should be open to fierce criticism dates from the founding fathers after president george washington suggested that critics of the government should be reined in james madison said in our system it is not the government that acts as censor over the people but the other way around says chris edelson a political scientist at american university the president was raging in his office under pressure from external events and angry at his perceived enemies revenge was on his mind don t worry about divisiveness having drawn the sword don t take it out stick it in hard president richard nixon told aides in the tense spring of 1970 hit them in the gut half a century later president donald trump is perhaps feeling those same emotions with his impeachment drama over he is pummeling prominent opponents with the powers of his office firing some who testified in the house against his wishes and lashing out at others he believes have betrayed him such as republican sen mitt romney of utah who voted for president trump s removal from office like other chief executives before him president trump may see retribution as a deterrent to future enemies and a sign of political strength but history shows the line between strength and politically damaging vindictiveness is a fine one and the notion that the u s government and its officials should be open to fierce criticism dates from the founding fathers after president george washington suggested that critics of the government should be reined in james madison said in our system it is not the government that acts as censor over the people but the other way around says chris edelson a fellow at the center for congressional and presidential studies at american university in an email president trump s retribution against those he may believe share blame for his impeachment predicament began in earnest last friday leading democrats to dub it the friday night massacre echoing the famous saturday night massacre of oct 20 1973 which ended with president nixon dismissing watergate special prosecutor archibald cox on friday president trump fired two of the most prominent impeachment witnesses within hours of each other lt col alexander vindman was removed from his post at the national security council along with his twin brother also an army officer who worked at the nsc then gordon sondland the ambassador to the european union and a republican who donated 1 million to the trump inaugural committee was informed of mr trump s intention to recall him both colonel vindman and ambassador sondland were already planning to move on from their positions within months if not weeks but president trump apparently chose to make a public point by forcing them out early the moves came a day after the president had celebrated the end of impeachment with a raw vindictive hour long address in the white house east room and an appearance at the national prayer breakfast at which he questioned the religious faith of house speaker nancy pelosi and senator romney at the prayer breakfast president trump followed conservative thinker arthur brooks who echoing the sermon on the mount had stressed the need to love our enemies arthur i don t know if i agree with you the president said as he rose to speak following the firings some trump supporters said it was only natural that the president should move aside officials he no longer trusted the dismissals were entirely within his power they pointed out white house spokeswoman stephanie grisham said thursday that mr trump was glad impeachment was now over and maybe people should pay for that the president himself claimed that colonel vindman was insubordinate and had received a poor report from his superior at the nsc colonel vindman s lawyers disputed those allegations and some former members of the armed forces say they are not happy about the way he was treated including the president s use of quote marks to describe him as lt col vindman as if the purple heart recipient s rank were arbitrary or he were an imposter for instance the public manner in which colonel vindman lost his post bothers joe baringer a former army staff sergeant who deployed early in the afghanistan war that began in 2001 and took part in the u s invasion of iraq two years later you can understand the need to reassign someone if you re claiming you ve lost confidence in their ability to fully support the mission that s nothing unusual says mr baringer who lives in seminole florida and works as a data developer for an insurance distributor but the way they decided to go about it was wrong he adds and my fear is it will erode confidence in whistleblower protections and make people think twice about coming forward joe fuentes a former staff sergeant with the marine reserves and an afghanistan war veteran holds similar concerns about colonel vindman s dismissal and the collateral damage to his brother s career you wonder about the chilling effect that could have on recruiting people into national security jobs says mr fuentes who is pursuing a master s degree in public policy at columbia university in new york if you re looking to hire people who only have the same perspective as you that s going to discourage some people from applying for those jobs he says and without those different perspectives you could end up with overly simplistic solutions applied to our interactions with our adversaries as for ambassador sondland a number of gop senators warned president trump against firing him saying such overt retaliation would look bad and was unnecessary considering mr sondland s plans to leave but the president went ahead anyway president trump has also turned up the dial on democratic sen joe manchin of west virginia senator manchin votes with republicans more than any other senate democrat and some thought he might vote for mr trump s acquittal he didn t and has since become a regular target of the trump twitter account the president has labeled him a puppet and joe munchkin and more impeachment related dismissals may be in the offing white house counselor kellyanne conway said monday on fox news presidential enemy lists aren t new of course president nixon compiled a famous one in september 1972 with watergate news dripping into the public domain presidential attorney john dean told his boss he d been keeping notes on people who had acted as nixon adversaries good the president said the administration had not yet used the fbi the justice department and the internal revenue service as instruments of reprisal but things are going to change president nixon told mr dean during the john f kennedy presidency attorney general robert f kennedy was the administration enforcer even president jimmy carter had a mean streak that leaned toward reprisals according to his white house counsel lloyd cutler this was perhaps a holdover from president carter s days as governor of georgia where political payback was common there were some petty revenges that were taken mr cutler said in an oral history at the university of virginia s miller center as for the founding fathers in general their concern was that government as a whole not respond to criticism with tyranny before the revolution the english law that governed the american colonies recognized seditious libel criticism of government or officials such as royal governors as a crime points out american university s dr edelson truth was no defense in other words even if the royal governor were a crook you could be prosecuted for saying so under the u s constitution freedom of speech is protected including the freedom to criticize government actions and officials that legal heritage today has led to laws protecting whistleblowers in our system it is not the government that acts as censor over the people but the other way around says dr edelson when our correspondent visited the tunisian town of gahr el melh he found ancient ottoman defenses acting as bulwarks against a very modern foe a rising sea that s demanding an urgent response north africa is emerging on the front lines of the climate crisis and it s doing so with little attention or support according to one projection sea levels here could rise by 1 meter by 2100 affecting 16 000 square miles of coastline and displacing up to 37 million people in the tunisian coastal town of ghar el melh the number of fishing days a year has dwindled from six months to 60 days this same time of year a few years ago we would be wearing winter coats sweaters and gloves said yas bara head of the local fishermen council motioning to his t shirt and shorts on a day in late october over in morocco where 40 of the people rely on farming a series of record droughts over the past five years has devastated crops it is impossible to make a profit says azziz hassine who has seen legume production on his farm outside casablanca drop 70 over two years ancient history is at stake too ten unesco world heritage sites in north africa are threatened by rising sea levels this is not just our national interests says carthage site curator moaz achour we must preserve these sites for humankind two thousand years after the romans burned it to the ground the ancient state of carthage once again faces destruction this time from the sea across north africa climate change is threatening heritage both ancient and modern as lives are being transformed across communities that date back centuries as it emerges on the front lines of the climate crisis north africa s residents are racing to adapt with little support resources or attention in tunisia the fishermen of ghar el melh are where you can always find them these days at the cafe down by the docks this town 30 miles north of tunis the tunisian capital was once a bustling fishing hub famous for its bountiful deep water delicacies and freshwater species from the town s lagoon but with warmer temperatures and with it higher winds and surging storms the number of fishing days per year has dwindled from six months to just 60 days instead fishermen are resigned to the same routine check the boats unfurl the nets and sit for hours in the cafe repeat as the fishermen sip espresso shots they reminisce and list the names of big species that once thrived in the area that haven t been seen for years the mediterranean sea bass swordfish octopus future generations here will only see these fish in the history books says captain yas bara a fisherman of 44 years and the head of the local fishermen council although 60 types of fish and crustaceans used to thrive in the area residents now count 25 marine specialists believe many of these species have left the area for deeper and colder waters as local sea temperatures have risen this same time of year a few years ago we would be wearing winter coats sweaters and gloves mr bara says motioning to his t shirt and shorts on this sunny day in late october but these changes are affecting more than just the sea with rising sea levels the land barrier separating the ocean and the lagoon is rapidly receding only a couple of yards of land separate the sea from the 10 square mile lagoon and its ecosystem of freshwater eels and fish the coastline is becoming thinner each day says mustapha jebril former mayor and environmental consultant looking to the sea beyond the mediterranean can cross into the lagoon any day and alter the ecosystem forever we are one storm away should the lagoon be breached by rising seawater up to 200 homes could be flooded and a single storm could submerge the entire town ghar el melh is a warning sign for tunisia due to its geographic position this town historically served as the first line of defense for the rest of tunisia its capture was critical in the romans campaign to carthage here in the 16th century ottoman forces placed barracks and fortresses and stationed 10 000 soldiers to prevent the spanish armada from reaching tunis now these ottoman defenses protect the tunisian capital from rising sea levels should the sea break the lagoon and submerge ghar el melh a major storm or flooding could submerge the lowlands all the way to ariana in the northwest suburbs of tunis destroying countless farms and properties along the way these aren t predictions mr jebril says we have seen it happen climate change has posed a particular challenge to north african farmers many of whom have been using agricultural practices and techniques passed down through the generations dating back to the spanish inquisition ali garci s farm near bizerte tunisia uses these techniques at his approximately 2 acre farm a fence of reed shafts is carefully placed between the plots the distance between each reed is the width of three fingers allowing a temperate breeze to reach the crops but preventing heavy sea winds or sand laden gusts from breaking or shattering the crops with his farm sitting only about 20 inches above sea level he relies on cement pillars submerged some 2 feet deep into the water table to soak up salt from any potential seawater intrusion another centuries old technique still seawater has flooded the water table and wreaked havoc the fig trees haven t borne fruit in three years in order to save his crop of fava beans mr garci is adding about 8 to 12 inches of soil to his farm on a regular basis to make sure roots do not drop into the rising water table yards of his farm s northern edge have been reclaimed by the sea other tunisian farms are dotted with sinkholes my farm is disappearing says mr garci who retired from teaching to tend to his family farm while tunisian farmers are battling to keep water out farms in nearby morocco are running dry with record shattering temperatures and dwindling rainfall morocco has endured a series of record droughts over the past five years devastating crops and the national economy farmers have felt particularly vulnerable more than 40 of moroccans rely on farming and more than 90 of farms are family owned and measure less than about 12 acres taylor luck ali garci demonstrates how he raises the soil level each week at his farm near bizerte tunisia to cope with climate change on oct 22 2019 raising the soil level helps ensure that roots do not drop into a rising water table for azziz hassine drops in rainfall over the past two years have resulted in a 70 decrease in legume production on his 2 1 2 acre farm outside casablanca it is impossible to make a profit my children will be worse off than i was says mr hassine who is battling both soil salinization and creeping desertification we don t know what to do the farmers had local knowledge and could read seasons and know how and when to grow and how to prepare for drier years says abderrahim ksiri a moroccan environmental expert and leader of the morocco climate change alliance now farmers in morocco do not know when to plant and when to cultivate or how according to the union for the mediterranean ufm the temperature rise limit of 1 5 degrees celsiusset by the paris accords has already been surpassed in the mediterranean region under current trends if climate policies worldwide are not altered the region could see a 2 2 c rise in temperature within the next 20 years across the mediterranean sea levels are already rising an average 3 millimeters per year in some coastal areas communities have seen as much as a 10 centimeter rise scientists and researchers working under the auspices of the ufm and european union project that sea levels in north africa could rise by 1 meter by 2100 affecting 16 000 square miles of coastline and displacing up to 37 million people also endangered the third largest city state of the ancient world before the punic wars with rome carthage was home to 300 000 people and until recently it was the most visited archaeological site in tunisia the site s punic port an island within a lagoon that was the site of the third punic war is now eroding into the sea that collapse over there just happened says carthage site curator moaz achour pointing to a cliffside of the port island that had recently crumbled into the lagoon and it is happening more and more frequently the effects of a rapidly shifting climate are even more visible at carthage s seaside antoninus baths the largest roman baths outside mainland italy increased evaporation of seawater due to rising summer temperatures has led to high winds picking up salt other minerals and sand and slamming them into the seaside statues columns and monuments at a record pace with most of the monuments made from sandstone or limestone these winds are dimpling and eroding away their corinthian designs like waves of tiny bullet holes in the rock unesco urged tunisian authorities to come up with a strategy to better protect the site back in 2012 but due to the post 2011 revolution political upheaval the tunisian government was only able to turn its sights on carthage last year current intervention proposals include a stone wall barrier to break the waves farther off the coast before they reach the site while geological experts are developing protective coatings to place on monuments to help them withstand the increased weathering it is not just carthage 40 unesco world heritage sites in the mediterranean area are threatened by rising sea levels 10 in north africa hundreds of other archaeological sites are also threatened on north african coastlines this is not just our national interests says mr achour we must preserve these sites for humankind few countries are working faster on climate change than egypt it has incorporated climate action into each ministry s portfolio built a 1 650 megawatt solar plant and worked on a series of biofuel and waste management projects egyptian authorities have built storm barriers to help save alexandria and are even preparing 13 new urban centers near the nile delta to relocate communities that could be affected by flooding but with the country just emerging from an economic crisis it like other north african states is limited in what it can undertake you cannot ask countries that are in economic transition and pursuing their development goals especially here in north africa to fulfill their climate commitment when other parties did not fulfill theirs says egypt environment minister yasmine fouad perceived inequities in national climate commitments have been a major roadblock in hashing out a rulebook for the paris climate agreement the role of wealthy nations in funding energy transition and climate mitigation efforts in developing nations has been a particular sticking point efforts to codify such plans at the 2019 united nations climate change conference in madrid failed a smattering of ad hoc programs is beginning to emerge in the absence of a coordinated global plan climamed a project launched by the ufm and eu is working to link international financing to 100 climate related projects across the mediterranean area the ufm is also gathering money to establish a 250 million mediterranean area climate adaptation fund to finance projects across the southern mediterranean where the threats are more urgent and resources at the state level are lacking the fund will support projects at the regional city and local levels working directly with north african innovators and community leaders to tailor solutions to their community needs and make them financially feasible if this fund works the replicability and scalability of this initiative is limitless says nasser kamel ufm secretary general until then north africans are left waiting and scrambling for short term solutions owners of seaside restaurants and homes at the sidi ali el mekki beach near ghar el melh look on as teenage workers rush down the shoreline with sandbags over their shoulders to prop up against structures half submerged by the encroaching sea sandbags won t save the buildings it is not a real solution says oathman ben guara municipal environmental adviser shaking his head disapprovingly but it buys them time if the reemergence of the equal rights amendment has puzzled you a bit you wouldn t be alone we ve addressed some of the issues thatwe ve heard raised most often when virginia became the 38th state to ratify the equal rights amendment in january many believed that the decadeslong wait for the era to join the u s constitution was finally over but not everyone agrees on whether the requirements have been met lawsuits are pending on disputes over issues such as whether a 1982 ratification deadline set by congress invalidates the amendment on feb 13 the u s house voted to remove that deadline though the ultimate decision may rest in the supreme court since the 1970s a majority of americans have supported an amendment for equal rights between men and women but some republican members of the house are among those who have raised concerns about how the era could prompt courts to overturn abortion limits era proponents say that without a constitutional guarantee women have faced limits as they ve sought redress for gender based violence and discrimination it would give congress more scope of authority to pass legislation to protect women in various ways says jessica neuwirth co founder and co president of the era coalition she says there s value in sending a clear message to all americans that at the highest level of the law women are now equal citizens when an effort to enshrine a new principle within the u s constitution stretches on for generations it offers up a past meets present twist on democratic deliberation now the federal government is trying to determine what the next steps are after the required three quarters of the states have ratified the equal rights amendment era which affirms equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex in january virginia became the 38th state to ratify the era but people disagree on whether it has now met the requirements to become the 28th amendment by 1977 35 states had approved the amendment but then momentum stalled not until 2017 did an additional state nevada ratify the era illinois joined the list the following year era supporters declare victory saying virginia s ratification means the era has fulfilled the conditions laid out in article 5 of the constitution but the national archives and records administration refuses to certify the era citing an opinion from the u s department of justice that because the final ratifications happened after a deadline set by congress the amendment is invalid congress extended a 1979 deadline to 1982 but there are lawsuits pending over the legitimacy of those deadlines meanwhile the u s house of representatives voted on feb 13 to remove the deadline era supporters are now watching to see if a similar bipartisan resolution in the senate will be allowed to move forward for a vote if the era does become the 28th amendment it wouldn t be the first time the constitution changed at a snail s pace it took nearly 203 years for enough states to ratify the 27th amendment proposed in 1789 to restrict when congress can raise its pay another debate whether to count five states that voted to rescind or sunset their ratification of the era other amendments including the 14th and 15th have made it into the constitution with states that were counted despite attempts to backtrack on ratifying says vivian hamilton a professor at william mary law school in williamsburg virginia these questions are expected to make their way to the u s supreme court since the 1970s many laws that discriminated against women have been struck down through the 14th amendment s equal protection clause today s era proponents applaud such progress but say that without a constitutional guarantee women have bumped up against limits as they ve sought redress for gender based violence and discrimination the era in the constitution would give congress more scope of authority to pass legislation to protect women in various ways says jessica neuwirth author of equal means equal why the time for an equal rights amendment is now and co founder and co president of the era coalition there s also value in sending a clear message to all americans that at the highest level of the law women are now equal citizens ms neuwirth says but some advocates for women s rights say the era could be interpreted by conservative leaning courts in a way that would strike down important protections for women and they d rather start fresh with a new amendment these scholars argue that it would be more robust if it contained explicit language authorizing policies that would affirmatively promote women s equality professor hamilton says citing examples from such countries as france and germany some republican members of the house are among those who have raised concerns about how the era could prompt courts to overturn abortion limits twenty four states have their own eras or other constitutional guarantees of equality on the basis of sex and the effect on abortion rules has been mixed the new mexico supreme court for example cited the state s era when it struck down a regulation that restricted public funds for abortions within medicaid in pennsylvania on the other hand which also has a state era a variety of restrictions on abortion have been upheld opponents also say the federal amendment could be used to offer constitutional protection to fluid notions of gender identity and to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation how the courts would interpret the word sex in the era is an unsettled issue professor hamilton says in surveys since the 1970s a majority of americans have consistently supported an amendment for equal rights between men and women editor s note this story was updated on feb 13 to include the results of the house vote investigative journalist ivan golunov says he s still surprised that his brief incarceration caused public protests it s given him hope about teaching other journalists to do work that like his holds officials accountable ivan golunov a russian investigative journalist exploded into the public eye when he was arrested and clumsily framed by moscow narcotics police last june he became a symbol of how pushback against a corrupt russian system was possible after protesters rallied to his defense he was freed and his police persecutors were eventually charged mr golunov realized early on that being an investigative journalist mattered he was just 16 when he was given the job of checking official military casualty statistics from the then raging second chechen war against the actual number of coffins being recorded in russia s far flung regions he found massive discrepancies that created quite a stir he says the ministry of defense which had been releasing figures just once a month began publishing them every three days and they were much more accurate we realized that our efforts had made the difference and forced them to react to provide better information his arrest has not dimmed his desire to help russia change people tell me they don t believe that top ranking officials will ever be punished for abusing their power he says that s bad i want to live in a country where people have confidence that perpetrators will be brought to justice ivan golunov spent the bulk of his career toiling in obscurity but now people often stop him in the street to ask him how he s holding up or to engage him on politics this kind of face recognition is all new for the 30 something investigative journalist who has worked mostly for critical news outlets on the opposition leaning fringes of russia s media spectrum but he exploded into the public eye when he was arrested and clumsily framed by moscow narcotics police last june and inadvertently created a teachable moment for politically aware russians and his fellow journalists to most russia observers it looked drearily familiar an uncompromising reporter being removed by corrupt authorities wielding fake criminal charges but then something unusual happened his incarceration was met by a huge and rapid outpouring of popular support for him including from many of his more mainstream colleagues in the russian media three leading moscow newspapers ran identical front pages declaring we are ivan golunov then the case against him swiftly unraveled police dropped charges and within five days he was back on the job free to publish the article about corruption in the moscow funeral business that had gotten him into trouble in the first place last month five officers involved in setting mr golunov up were arrested and charged with abuse of power falsification of evidence and drug trafficking the whole thing shocked him i really only learned about the public support for me after i was released says a relaxed looking mr golunov drinking tea in a central moscow restaurant recently when i was at my court hearing i heard the commotion outside and wondered what all the shouting was about but the idea that over a thousand people had come out to protest for me well that was just amazing i never imagined the reaction could be that big galina arapova head of a civil society group that works for journalists rights in the central russian city of voronezh says that mr golunov s freedom is something to celebrate in itself but even more important is the inspiration it has given to russian journalists who need to tread the line between truth telling and irritating the authorities every day and the expectations of russia s fairly sophisticated news reading public i think ivan s case has stirred up the journalist community which has been gradually maturing over many years ms arapova says the basic lesson here is that every journalist needs to work with the secure knowledge that he or she can depend on the solidarity of colleagues in a moment of trouble this is essential for all journalists who want to do their jobs honestly mr golunov is a child of russia s turbulent 1990s when russian society imploded old value systems were utterly discredited and almost everyone was struggling to reinvent himself his parents moscow professionals kept changing his school at one point he found himself in one of the new experimental schools that cropped up amid the post soviet wasteland where teachers encouraged him to concentrate on self development that s how he discovered journalism he says at the age of 13 he went to work for a local free paper aimed at youth where in the wake of russia s devastating 1998 financial crisis he wrote about counterculture educational affairs and other news from his own district later he joined a municipal paper put out by local authorities where he covered the news from the point of view of his bosses i was happily writing about successes how great our local authorities were he says i believe my last story for them was something about how by the efforts of our local authorities a war veteran had his bathroom replaced that was the sort of thing i did he gradually became interested in issues that fell a bit outside the box such as the rights of disabled people and the dismal level of moscow s public accessibility for them he wrote a piece about that and took it to the opposition newspaper novaya gazeta which is partly owned by former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev they gave him a full time job novaya gazeta always took in young people and gave them a chance to work and learn he says his first introduction to investigative journalism came when he was given the job of checking official military casualty statistics from the then raging second chechen war against the actual number of coffins being recorded in russia s far flung regions by the committees of soldiers mothers a grassroots anti military group he found massive discrepancies we compiled lists based on what the soldiers mothers committees around the country told us and published them alongside the official statistics he says that created quite a stir the ministry of defense which had been releasing figures just once a month began publishing them every three days and they were much more accurate we realized that our efforts had made the difference and forced them to react to provide better information i was just 16 then and at this moment i understood the importance of the job i was doing mr golunov says military prosecutors would call to exchange information and he was sometimes summoned to court to provide evidence in war related cases i was not just informing my readers i was also informing the authorities of things that were going on and that was leading to changes mr golunov went on to work for a string of critical news outlets including gazeta the tv station dozhd russian forbes rbk and the online magazine slon ru in some cases he was forced to leave by ownership changes that narrowed the scope for independent reporting at other times he moved on driven by his own restlessness about three years ago he found a home with the latvia based news agency meduza which he says encouraged him to do the stories he felt were most needed that s the short version of how he found himself one day last june shoved up against a wall handcuffed by moscow narcotics police outside a cafe where he had gone to meet a source and shouting to passersby to please phone his editor as he was bundled into a police van after more than six months of freedom and newfound fame he is still deeply dissatisfied i know there is a struggle within the system he says i know there are good cops who only want to do their jobs properly because i have met them but they aren t making the difference this thing happened to me it attracted public attention it caused a big commotion but to this day no one is punished people tell me they don t believe that top ranking officials will ever be punished for abusing their power that s bad i want to live in a country where people have confidence that perpetrators will be brought to justice many people i know say they see no point in going into the streets to protest i tell them that there can be results i want people to believe in the possibility of change and the value of taking personal action kirill martynov the political editor of novaya gazeta says that mr golunov s case was almost unprecedented and its outcome was a clarion call for everyone who wants to push the envelope of freedom in russia s tightly managed political system whose leaders are nevertheless sensitive to public pressure the case of golunov shows that if people shout loudly enough there are people at the top who are willing to listen says mr martynov this is an important lesson for everyone who wants to live in russia over the next few years there are lots of reasons to shout and to demand dialogue with the authorities as for mr golunov he is planning to start a school for investigative journalists and take it on the road to educate a new generation in russia s diverse regions i have found that many journalists out there have never learned to work methodically to use sources and databases as their basic tools mr golunov says i ve talked to a lot of people about setting up classes to teach journalists to improve their game i get positive responses from state journalists as well as independent ones i hope we ll start this project up in the spring i m really enthused about this idea on feb 5 germany s governing party the christian democratic union broke a taboo in german politics and worked with the far right alternative for germany afd party to install a regional premier in the small state of thuringia the collusion of local cdu leaders with a party viewed as fascist was seen as a sudden reversal of decades of moral cleansing among germans it was a bad day for democracy said chancellor angela merkel indeed the reaction to this event also reveals just how far germany will go to avoid slipping back into a dark past across the country protests were held to oppose the cdu s action the new premier of thuringia was forced to resign and the crisis led to the resignation of the head of the cdu annegret kramp karrenbauer both the cdu and its junior coalition partner the center left social democratic party are now asking themselves how mainstream politicians can better respond to the rise of the afd according to polls most germans do not want ms merkel to leave office in 2021 as she desires such a view implies a wide preference for centrist and anti fascist politics to persist during her 15 years as germany s leader angela merkel has put out many fires to save europe she stopped russia s advance in ukraine for example forced greece to end its financial profligacy and halted poland s assault on judicial independence she sees protecting the european union and its values as part of germany s work in reconciling with its neighbors after the nazi era now 75 years after world war ii and as chancellor merkel prepares to step down next year she is being forced to put out one more big fire this time in germany itself on feb 5 her governing party the christian democratic union broke a big taboo in german politics and worked with the far right alternative for germany afd party to install a regional premier in the small state of thuringia the collusion of local cdu leaders with a party widely viewed as fascist and xenophobic was seen as a sudden reversal of decades of moral cleansing among germans it was a bad day for democracy said ms merkel she added that the taboo breaking event was unforgivable indeed the reaction to this event also reveals just how far germany will go to avoid slipping back into a dark past across the country protests were held to oppose the cdu s action the new premier of thuringia thomas kemmerich was forced to resign soon after taking office a liberal he also promised elections to remove the stain of the afd s support for the office of the premiership in addition the crisis led to the resignation of head of the cdu annegret kramp karrenbauer who was the chancellor s chosen successor she blamed her downfall on the unresolved issue of how her conservative party deals with germany s extremist parties both the cdu and its junior coalition partner the center left social democratic party are now asking themselves how mainstream politicians can better respond to the rise of the afd started in 2013 that party has gained seats in the parliaments of all 16 states especially after ms merkel s decision in 2015 to allow more than 1 million largely middle eastern refugees into germany the anti immigrant backlash as well as slow economic growth in germany s former communist east has driven many people to vote for extremist parties afd s popularity is about 14 according to polls most germans do not want ms merkel to leave office in 2021 as she desires such a view implies a wide preference for centrist and anti fascist politics to persist if the chancellor can put out this latest big fire the work of reconciliation with the rest of europe can continue with a renewed focus on germans themselves each weekday the monitor includes one clearly labeled religious article offering spiritual insight on contemporary issues including the news the publication in its various forms is produced for anyone who cares about the progress of the human endeavor around the world and seeks news reported with compassion intelligence and an essentially constructive lens for many that caring has religious roots for many it does not the monitor has always embraced both audiences the monitor is owned by a church the first church of christ scientist in boston whose founder was concerned with both the state of the world and the quality of available news experience often argues that manhood and womanhood are in conflict but there s a spiritual basis for understanding the unity of manhood and womanhood that shines through the bible and it can be demonstrated today there s much talk these days about the need for a more positive masculinity many yearn to see the day when violence bullying and sexism aren t treated by anyone as a normal or natural part of manhood ted bunch activist educator and co founder of the organization a call to men is making efforts to nourish a healthy respectful manhood in a pbs interview he said we are going to lift manhood up this is not an indictment on manhood it s actually an invitation to men i ve been grateful for a more inspired spiritual sense of the bible s message that i have found to be a source of guidance for uplifting anything including the nature of masculinity and femininity this understanding of the bible is brought to light in a book that always helps to illuminate the deeper spiritual meaning of its precious content for me science and health with key to the scriptures by the discoverer of christian science mary baker eddy this book points to the nature of god as divine spirit and all men and women as truly god s purely spiritual creation the spiritual sense of the scriptures it provides has shown me clearly and simply how a unity of qualities we think of as masculine and feminine makes up the nature of god for instance a poignant verse in psalm 91 speaks of the all embracing gentleness and solid strength of god divine love it says like a bird protecting its young god will cover you with his feathers will protect you under his great wings as the voice renders it fortifying this image it continues his faithfulness will form a shield around you a rock solid wall to protect you verse 4 in a similar fashion science and health says tenderness accompanies all the might imparted by spirit p 514 the bible has also taught me that the masculine and feminine qualities of god are expressed in each individual man and woman as we are actually made by god in spirit s image and likeness divine spirit is the source of each of us and understanding this naturally lifts up our concept of manhood to a spiritual basis that also lifts up womanhood and vice versa one bible story in the old testament is particularly helpful as an example of how any character trait that doesn t come from god including destructive behavior aggression falls away in the light of recognizing the spirituality that constitutes our real being in the account abigail a woman of good understanding is the wife of a wealthy man nabal described as churlish or mean spirited even though david who would later become king of israel had shown kindness to his shepherds nabal decides to refuse david s request for food for himself and his men david is affronted by this and swears he will kill every man in nabal s household while he is on his way with sword in hand abigail having been told of david s intentions fearlessly seeks him out with humility and meekness instead of reacting to the violent intent that seems to be consuming david she appears to speak to his higher nature of mercifulness and pure love of good she reminds him that evil hasn t been found in him all his life david s heart is touched and he blesses her for stopping him from angry retaliation see i samuel 25 1 35 it s clear that the pure christliness and spirituality abigail expressed had a profound effect bringing out the same qualities in david a statement in science and health deepens this beautiful story for me the masculine mind reaches a higher tone through certain elements of the feminine while the feminine mind gains courage and strength through masculine qualities p 57 all of these qualities are embraced in the christ the full expression of god s nature that jesus embodied to the utmost and through which he healed and uplifted the lives of both men and women while there might not be someone as faithful and earnest as abigail at hand to awaken everyone struggling with some willful or evil thoughts the christ is speaking to everyone and we can know it is always at hand to break through the darkness of material beliefs with spiritual understanding the action of christ restores our spiritual sense and inspires within us more love and humility false character traits can be disposed of as we see ourselves as god s child because in reality they are without divine power or permission to parade themselves as the nature of anyone as the dearly loved children of spirit we are each capable of grasping what s inherent in every man and woman understanding the spiritual basis of true manhood and womanhood both including the full spectrum of feminine and masculine qualities helps bring more of these qualities to light in practice too thanks for starting your week with us
