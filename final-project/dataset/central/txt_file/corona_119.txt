correctly an ar guide to flattening the curve the cdc also recommends taking commonsense health precautions older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions might be at higher risk for severe illness from covid 19 according to the cdc that includes people aged 65 years and older and those who live in a nursing home or long term care facility according to the cdc other high risk conditions include among more than 4 000 confirmed cases in the u s asof march 16 80 of deaths associated with covid 19 were among adults aged 65 and older with the highest percentage of severe outcomes among people85 and older according to the cdc at the same time americans of all ages have faced serious health complications data published by the cdc found that among the roughly 12 of covid 19 cases in the u s known to need hospitalizations about 1 in 5 were among people ages 20 to 44 despite widespread rumors social media reports and optimism surrounding the effectiveness of several existing drugs so far there are no proven treatments for covid 19 according to the cdc and who treatment consists of supportive care to help relieve symptoms and for severe cases care to support vital organ functions about 80 of people recover from the disease without needing special treatment according to the who for most patients that means drinking plenty of fluids and resting just as you would for the cold or flu no and it will be at least a year to 18 months before any vaccine is ready for large scale use according to most estimates thousands of scientists worldwide are on the case as of last week the who had posted a list of 41 possible vaccine candidates on its site the first vaccine trial got underway this week in seattle when four volunteers received a version of a vaccine to prevent the disease information about how long symptoms lastis still evolving but a february who studymay give us some preliminary clues while pregnant womenhave had a higher risk of developing severe illness with the flu and viruses from the same family as covid 19 it is not yet clear if pregnant women are more likely to get sick from the new virus or what if any risk infants face if their mom has covid 19 to stop the potential spread of the virus from an infected mother to achild the cdc and the american college of obstetricians and gynecology recommend that facilities should consider temporarily separating the mother who has confirmed covid 19 or is a pui person under investigation from her baby separation guidance varies from 72 hours to seven days and in some cases up to 14 days depending on time since symptoms and recovery the cdc recommendation notes the health risks and benefits of separation should be discussed with the mother and she should be involved in decision making hospitals including massachusetts general hospital and johns hopkins are following the guidelines the coronavirus is not known to be transmitted in breast milk or from the mother to a fetusin the womb no infants born to mothers with covid 19 have tested positive for the virus according to the cdc read more moms could be separated from newborns under virus guidelines children are not at higher risk for covid 19 than adults according to the cdc among the more than 4 000 cases in the u s as of march 16 only 5 were people aged 0 19 years according to the cdc just 2 3 of cases in that age group had to be hospitalized and none were in the icu last week however health officials reported that an infant coronavirus patient younger than one year old in chicago and a17 year old teen in new orleansdied after contracting the virus and2 month old in nashville who tested positive for the virus could be the youngest patient in the nation officials say in china at least one two day old infant had been infected according to a who study it s unclear according to the cdc for many viruses including the mers virus patients are unlikely to be re infected shortly after they recover because a protective antibody is generated in those who are infected but scientists still need to do more researchto determine if this is also the case with covid 19 and how long those antibodies may last isolation and quarantine are effective ways to help prevent the spread of disease according to the cdc isolation separates sick people with a contagious disease from people who are not sick quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick scientists think the virus spreads mainly from person to person throughrespiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes people are thought to be the most contagious when they are the sickest but some spread might be possible before people show symptoms according to the cdc a person can get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth noseor eyes according to the cdc research on how long the virus can survive on surfaces is ongoing and estimates are preliminary a study published in the new england journal of medicine this month found that viable virus could be detected up to three hours later in the air up to four hours on copper up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel however a subsequent report from the cdc found that genetic material from the virus can live on surfaces for more than two weeks the cdc found traces of the virus rna not the coronavirus itself on surfaces in the cabins of both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected passengers on the diamond princess cruise ship 17 days after passengers had left the cabins if you have symptomsand want to get tested the cdc recommends calling your state or local health department or a medical provider at this time the cdc recommends that clinicians prioritize testing hospitalized patients and symptomatic healthcare workers second level priority includes patients in long term care facilities with symptoms patients 65 years of age and older with symptoms patients with underlying conditions with symptoms and first responders with symptoms not sure if you should get tested
