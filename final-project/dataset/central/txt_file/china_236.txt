after an ethiopian airlines 737 crash on sunday killed all 157 people on board it was the second crash in five months involving a 737 max 8 and comparisons are being drawn with a lion air accident in indonesia last october in response a number of airlines have now grounded all planes of the same model however experts warn it is too early to say what caused the latest disaster ethiopian airlines says the plane flight et302 crashed at 08 44 local time 05 44 gmt just six minutes after it left addis ababa the aircraft bound for nairobi came down near the town of bishoftu 60km 37 miles south east of the capital the pilot had reported difficulties and had asked to return to addis ababa the airline said at this stage we cannot rule out anything ethiopian airlines ceo tewolde gebremariam told reporters at bole international airport in the capital visibility was said to be good but air traffic monitor flightradar24 reported that the plane s vertical speed was unstable after take off the pilot was named as senior captain yared getachew who had a commendable performance with more than 8 000 hours in the air the airline said passengers from more than 30 countries were on board the flight including 32 kenyans 18 canadians and seven britons at least 19 victims were affiliated with the united nations according to a un official some passengers were heading to a session of the un environment assembly in nairobi which began with a minute s silence on monday slovak mp anton hrnko also confirmed via facebook that his wife and two children were on the plane meanwhile a greek man has said that he was due to board the flight but arrived at the gate two minutes late in a facebook post antonis mavropoulos shared an image of his ticket and said it was his lucky day i was angry because nobody helped me to reach the gate on time he wrote i m grateful to be alive in ethiopia monday has been declared as a national day of mourning the 737 max 8 aircraft has only been in commercial use since 2017 the plane that crashed was among six of 30 that ethiopian airlines had ordered as part of its expansion it underwent a rigorous first check maintenance on 4 february the airline tweeted boeing said it was deeply saddened by the crash and is sending a team to provide technical assistance following the lion air crash last october investigators said the pilots had appeared to struggle with an automated system designed to keep the plane from stalling a new feature of the boeing 737 max the anti stall system repeatedly forced the plane s nose down despite efforts by pilots to correct this preliminary findings suggest the crash killed 189 people the lion air plane was also new and the accident happened soon after take off it s highly suspicious mary schiavo former inspector general of the us transportation department told cnn here we have a brand new aircraft that s gone down twice in a year that rings alarm bells in the aviation industry because that just doesn t happen after last october s crash boeing sent an emergency notice to airlines warning them of a problem with the anti stall system boeing is expected to release a software patch to the system to deal with this issue according to reuters however with the ethiopian airlines investigation at an early stage it is not clear whether the anti stall system was the cause of sunday s crash aviation experts say other technical issues or human error cannot be discounted ethiopian airlines has a good safety reputation although in 2010 one of the company s aeroplanes crashed in the mediterranean sea shortly after leaving beirut the investigation will be led by ethiopian authorities co ordinating with teams of experts from boeing and the us national transportation safety board an urgent priority for investigators will be to find the plane s two cockpit recorders one for data and another for pilots voice recordings ethiopian airlines said in a tweet on monday morning that it had grounded all of its 737 max 8s until further notice although we don t know the cause of the accident we had to decide to ground the particular fleet as an extra safety precaution the airline used a different model of plane for its first flight to kenya since the crash which landed at 10 25 local time on monday china s aviation regulator has also ordered local airlines to halt the flights of 737 max 8s more than 90 are in use by chinese carriers including air china china eastern airlines and china southern airlines cayman airways also grounded its two boeings of the same type but a spokeswoman for flydubai which operates a number of 737 max 8s told reuters that the company continues to have confidence in the aircraft several north american airlines operate the same aircraft and have said they are monitoring the investigation southwest airlines flies 31 while american airlines and air canada each have 24 in their fleet this is the first time the social media giant has said
