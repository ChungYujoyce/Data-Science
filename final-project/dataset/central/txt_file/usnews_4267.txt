in 2016 donald trump fueled his improbable presidential victory with an arsenal of catch phrases designed to incite and excite the fox news and breitbart audience wholivein fear of america s diversity and inevitable demographic changes make america great again and build the wall were staples of trump s road show as the 2020 campaign comes into focus trump is looking to recreate hissuccess by refreshing his xenophobic rhetoric and channeling it towardchina the coronavirus has presented the president with an adversary unlike any other he has confronted it cannot be intimidated by angry tweets it cannot be dismissed with a nickname it cannot be diminished by calling it a hoax as he did in february and as the death toll rises while trump s pollnumbers fall a new old strategy is taking shape candidate trump declared that mexico was sending people that have lots of problems to the united states they re bringing drugs they re bringing crime they re rapists he claimed he declared that they re taking our jobs they re taking our money creating an us vs them dynamic to justify hisforay into anti immigrant hate speech trump and his republican enablers are now offering the country what amounts to a remix of 2016 this time replacing mexico with china on april 18 the president tweeted china wants sleepy joe sooo badly they want all of those billions of dollars that they have been paying to the u s back and much more joe is an easy mark their dream candidate hotline share your coronavirus story following trump s lead the campaign arm forsenate republicanscirculated a 57 page memo that instructed gop candidates to attack china and to attack democrats for being soft on china the memo pointedly says china caused this pandemic by covering it up lying and hoarding the world s supply of medical equipment during her first white house newsbriefing spokeswomankayleigh mcenany reiterated the president s displeasure with china and defendedhis statements that he has a high degree of confidence that the coronavirus originated in a laboratory in wuhan china directly contradicting an on the record statement from his own intelligence community what republicans don t get donald trump is our biggest obstacle to coronavirus recovery the trump campaign has even started referring to the presumptive democratic nominee as beijing biden trump s china rhetoric went to the extreme during his fox news town hall event sunday evening where he falsely attacked biden sson hunter china just had a field day with our country and then you look at his son walking out with 1 5 billion give me a break on that to date there is noevidence hunter biden accepting money from china the republican playbook for 2020 can be summed up in two words blame and fear it s the same playbook as2016 the message then mexico is to blame for taking jobs and flooding our country with drug dealers and rapists they believed this message would create enough anger and fear to gettrump elected president of the united states and it did the message now china has stolen millions of american jobs and is to blame for creating the coronavirus pandemic if former vice president biden and the democratic party are going to avoid a repeat of 2016 they need to understand that the republican messaging machine is simple ruthlessand disciplined this election like the one before it will not be won or lost on who has the best plan for education climate change debt housing social injustice income inequality affordable housing national securityor any other importantpolicy issues discussedin the democratic primary if the general election were about substance qualificationsand details trump would not be in the oval office right now much to the agitation and exasperation of the political punditclass trump s appetite for lying and espousing utter nonsense has only intensified throughout his first term i can t tell you how many times i ve heard my fellow commentators ask aloud when are people going to figure it out and dump this guy the answer is they won t unless democrats are willing to become as aggressive viciousand consistent as the republicans are core values trump s science denial is un american just ask benjamin franklin and thomas jefferson let me be clear i am not suggesting that democrats adopt the trumpian tactic of outright lying to the american people about everything what i am saying is democrats need to hone a message that is as easy to communicate as build the wall or blame china being thoughtful deliberateand measured is nice but we tried that in 2016and look what happened if we are going to ask the american people to change the channel in 2020 we need a direct and succinct appeal that cuts through the noise and reaches them on a human personal level say what you want about the politics of fear and anger more often than not they work what is our counter to that kurt bardella a former republican communications strategist who became a democrat is a member of
