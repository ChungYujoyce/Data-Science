republican senator joni ernst says that she was raped in college by someone she knew and that her ex husband physically abused her making her one of the highest profile women in her party to allege assaults in the era of the metoo movement ernst publicly disclosed the rape in an interview with bloomberg news which she decided to do after details of her divorce from husband gail ernst were reported this week i didn t want to share it with anybody and in the era of hashtag metoo survivors i always believed that every person is different and they will confront their demons when they re ready the iowa senator said in the interview her voice broke and i was not ready ernst who faces re election in 2020 is the fourth highest ranking republican in the u s senate and one of the most powerful women in the country she s an ally of president donald trump who has been accused of sexual misconduct or assault by multiple women but she drew a sharp distinction between her personal experience and her political decisions it s outrageous to suggest that anyone who has been the victim of sexual assault should therefore be a hillary clinton supporter ernst said ernst may face fresh criticism for her vote to confirm supreme court justice brett kavanaugh whom christine blasey ford accused of sexual assault at a riveting senate judiciary committee hearing last year ernst who has partnered with new york democrat kirsten gillibrand to combat sexual assault in the military and pressure the fbi to collect more data on stalking and domestic violence publicly defended kavanaugh after ford s testimony i do believe she experienced trauma but the evidence and witnesses presented by her contradicted her story ernst told bloomberg i don t believe justice kavanaugh was the source of her trauma the senator s allegation that her husband abused her became public after details from affidavits joni and gail ernst filed in their divorce were first published monday by cityview in des moines iowa the affidavits were supposed to be sealed but were inadvertently made public in a court filing after the divorce was finalized earlier this month out of respect for his family gail is
