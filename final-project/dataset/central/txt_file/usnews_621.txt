elizabeth warren has her own way of doing things and iowans have to adapt accordingly at the massachusetts senator s events each attendee gets a raffle style ticket then after her rousing personal monologue she takes questions from audience members who gets to ask a question is determined by which number is randomly drawn this works very well in massachusetts i m told the emcee at her speech in des moines grumbled as he waited for the lucky winner to come forward the idea is that everybody gets to ask a question warren explained not just whoever runs up to the front is this a metaphor for warren s egalitarian philosophy perhaps but it s also an illustration of what the potential democratic presidential contender was doing here in iowa last weekend a full 13 months before the state will host the party s first 2020 nominating contest she s headed to new hampshire this weekend the warren campaign technically an exploratory committee at this point allowing her to raise money hold events and hire staff has calculated that getting in early and emphasizing iowa is her best chance for the nomination if her first campaign swing was any indication it is a good wager large enthusiastic crowds flocked to her five campaign appearances in des moines they packed the venue and filled a nearby parking lot interviews revealed a mix of former bernie sanders and former hillary clinton supporters some were warren superfans others simply curious she s refreshing said linda mcfarlane a 69 year old realtor from west des moines she cares about people she s passionate about her causes and she has been for many years but what i want more than anything is the person who can beat trump in 2020 mcfarlane a former sanders supporter worried that warren might suffer from clinton s charisma deficit and wondered if she d be able to draw moderate voters the way that warren campaigned in iowa was also revealing from the locations to the format her tour focused on the western half of the state which is conservative and sparsely populated it s represented in congress by the controversial republican steve king these rural areas get a disproportionate amount of caucus delegates and warren s boosters think her brand of prairie populism plays well in the same sort of declining regions battered by the modern economy that gravitated to sanders and trump iowa tends to reward candidates who are strong on conviction and personal narrative warren s two great strengths over candidates who emphasize competence and credentials like mitt romney and clinton warren s stump speech starts with her life story from working class oklahoma roots to single motherhood pointing out the opportunities america gave her that are less accessible today especially she consistently notes to people of color she can credibly portray herself as an accidental politician driven by a cause she was an academic studying people s economic struggles until the 2008 recession drew her into policymaking and then elected office her message was policy driven with a bullet pointed agenda for ending corruption and making government more responsive warren called for big structural change in government and the economy from more limits on money in politics to strengthening unions to universal health care she said she would push to expand social security and enshrine voting rights in the constitution except when asked directly she didn t mention trump in iowa warren also gained a stage to rebut and reset some of the negative narratives that have risen about her her october rollout of a dna test that showed an infinitesimal amount of native american ancestry was widely viewed as a blunder at one of her first iowa appearances one of those picked at random voters asked her why she did something that would give donald trump more fodder to be a bully warren replied that she wanted to put it all out there and then moved on hher final iowa event in ankeny was a roundtable of recent female candidates for state office a slate of energetic and personable women who talked about how women had powered the 2018 democratic wave the message at a time when pundits and voters alike were rumbling about whether a woman candidate can win after clinton s defeat was not subtle once it would have been a no brainer to camp out in the caucus state in previous presidential cycles there s almost always been a candidate who went all in on iowa from republican rick santorum in 2012 whose shoestring campaign nearly toppled romney to democrat chris dodd in 2008 who moved his family to the state from connecticut only to come in sixth and drop out iowans pride themselves on taking a careful look at all the candidates and rewarding deep personal engagement over flashy ads but in 2020 the calculation isn t as clear a combination of factors have called the traditional early state s clout into question since it helped propel barack obama to the presidency in 2008 first there s the calendar big states like california have moved their primaries up to within a few weeks of iowa and new hampshire tempting candidates to seek big delegate hauls on their big stage second the democratic party is more diverse than ever giving more clout to the black and brown voters in the party base and draining some power from the verdict rendered by lily white iowa most of all donald trump s 2016 victory with a campaign that consisted of little more than an airplane and a twitter account plus maybe some russian grassroots organizing threw the old rules of politics out the window in a world where trump who lost iowa coming in second to ted cruz can win strategists have to admit no one really knows what makes an effective presidential campaign anymore iowans naturally resist this suggestion people say iowa doesn t matter anymore i say not so fast says ann selzer the state s top nonpartisan pollster and steward of the long running iowa poll her initial iowa test heat taken in december had warren coming in fourth out of 20 hypothetical candidates after joe biden sanders and beto o rourke as a candidate the most important thing you can do is win selzer says and iowa is still the first place you can win write to molly ball at molly ball time com
