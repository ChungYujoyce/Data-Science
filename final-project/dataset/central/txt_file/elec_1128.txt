the old cliche holds that republicans fall in line and democrats fall in love when it comes to selecting presidential nominees if that s true it is good news for o rourke who excited democrats

the point he proved to be a magnetic presence on the campaign trail and a fundraising juggernaut heraised an astonishing 38 millionin the third quarter of 2018 alone a number of aides to former president obama have also talked up o rourke drawing comparisons between his appeal and that of the former president obama himself told his former aide david axelrod that o rourke exhibited a similar sense of authenticity the reason i was able to make a connection with a sizable portion of the country was because people had a sense that i said what i meant obama told axelrod adding of o rourke it felt as if he based his statements and his positions on what he believed there are still plenty of skeptics chicago mayor rahm emanuel himself a former obama chief of staff complained in a late

off o rourke in recent weeks questioning the texan s progressive credentials but those attacks show just how much of a threat o rourke poses to the rest of the field 2 sen bernie sanders i vt sanders is a divisive figure in the democratic party not least because he is not a member of it but the vermont independent has won a hugely devoted following with the democratic socialist ideas that he had been pushing for decades before they became fashionable he also has the organizational advantages that come from his much stronger than expected 2016 showing against eventual nominee hillary

primaries there were plenty of republicans implacably opposed to trump but their votes were split among a large field that allowed trump to roll up victory after victory with a plurality of the vote there are dangers for sanders warren s all but inevitable candidacy could split the progressive vote while o rourke could draw the young voters who flocked to sanders in 2016 sanders would also be 79 by inauguration day 2021 but make no mistake sanders is a real contender if he runs 3 former vice president joe bidenjoe bidenthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks biden set to make risky economic argument against trump hillicon valley tech companies lead way on wfh forever states and counties plead for cybersecurity assistance trump weighing anti conservative bias panel more biden leads almost all opinion polls at this stage and how you rate his chances depends largely on how much you think that matters a cnn poll earlier this month showed him with 30 percent support more than double the level of the second place sanders who grabbed 14 percent a suffolk university usa today poll suggested democrats were more excited about a run by biden than anyone else the case for biden is straightforward he can connect with the rust belt voters who carried trump to victory in 2016 he was a loyal vice president to obama and he is generally well liked within the party but the case for biden skepticism is just as easily made his strong polling numbers are a consequence of name recognition more than anything else the doubters say and an establishment democrat first elected to the senate in 1972 is hardly what the party wants in the current insurgent friendly political moment biden first ran for president in 1988 and did so again in 2008 could he climb the mountain in one final effort 4 sen kamala harriskamala devi harristrump retweets personal attacks on clinton pelosi abrams it s as if a trump operative infiltrated the

a powerful orator and the strongest non white candidate in the field something that could be important given not just the importance of the black vote but a more general acceptance among liberals that democrats need to demonstrate their diversity harris could also conceivably bridge the span of the party between progressives and centrists drawing some support from both wings in a way that sanders from the left or biden toward the center might struggle to do at the same time parts of her record including on criminal justice give liberals a degree of heartburn still she is clearly a top tier candidate if as is widely expected she runs 5 sen elizabeth warren d mass the video warren released to mark the formation of her exploratory committee on monday was slick and effective it emphasized her role in pushing back against malfeasance on the part of financial institutions but also framed that as part of a bigger story portraying her as a fighter for fairness she also made specific reference to racial inequities warren has been a progressive hero since her days pushing for the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau she is a strong and fiery platform speaker and it s possible that she could outflank sanders on the left but democrats who are lukewarm about warren question her political instincts highlighting the curious recent episode where she claimed via dna evidence that she had a native american ancestorsix to 10 generations ago the intention was to defang trump s attack on her as pocahontas but the effort backfired even drawing criticism from the cherokee nation more broadly some democrats worry that trump s visceral appeal to some white working class voters will not be best countered by an erstwhile harvard law school professor from a deep blue state 6 sen sherrod brownsherrod campbell brownsenators offer bill to prevent relief payments from being seized by private debt collectors congress headed toward unemployment showdown rollout of

is the core of his appeal to democrats as a potential 2020 candidate he is someone who understands the industrial midwest in his marrow and he can carve out a path to victory in that electorally vital region brown may not have the glitz of some other contenders but his rumpled authenticity could play to his advantage his boosters say a heartland progressive he has long enjoyed strong support from labor unions two questions loom large whether brown really wants to run and whether he can quickly get enough traction if he does so 7 sen cory bookercory anthony bookerstakes high for collins in

sen amy klobucharamy klobucharpoll biden leads trump by 5 points in minnesota the hill s morning report presented by facebook us death toll nears 100 000 as country grapples with reopening it s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process more d minn klobuchar s political abilities are often underrated something she could prove one more time if she presses forward with a presidential run klobuchar s platform would in essence be based on an ability to connect with voters in the american heartland while committing no real sins of liberal heresy her legislative record involves work on issues that have appeal to democrats and beyond them lowering the costs of prescription drugs and protecting online privacy for example her public persona is affable and good humored but one question is whether democrats want a nominee to take the fight to trump in a more aggressive way 9 former new york city mayor michael bloomberg bloomberg the media billionaire who served three terms as new york city s mayor has given strong indications that he is considering a run for the white house do i think i could be a good president yes he told chuck todd on nbc s meet the press in an interview that aired sunday he said he would make a decision by february bloomberg s pathto the democratic nomination is anything but clear however it would presumably involve winning over centrists and perhaps even disaffected republicans with the promise of a candidacy that steers a middle ground and doesn t pander to partisan or hard left interests but that is likely to be a hard sell in a party where the energy is increasingly with progressives bloomberg who twice ran for mayor as a republican before changing his party affiliation seems an uneasy fit for the democratic spirit of the times 10 sen kirsten gillibrandkirsten gillibrandit s as if a trump operative infiltrated the democratic primary process hillicon valley uber to lay off thousands of employees facebook content

made women s issues a key part of her appeal as a senator representing new york she is well known in the nation s largest media market and one of the epicenters of democratic fundraising gillibrand also got an opportunity to display her guts when trump took aim at her with what was widely interpreted as a sexual innuendo a year ago she doubled down on her call for him to resign afterward still as with booker there is a distrust of gillibrand in some quarters rooted in her perceived penchant for self publicity her willingness to buck the party line as when she suggested former president clinton should have resigned over his affair with monica lewinsky has created enemies as well as friends more generally the answer to how gillibrand overtakes several of the names higher on this list
