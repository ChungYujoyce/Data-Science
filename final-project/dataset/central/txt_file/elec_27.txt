2016 during a press conference in new york afp kena betancur photo credit should read kena betancur afp getty images mike pence full disclosure i served as head of the super pac seeking to draft pence into the 2012 presidential race having long been persuaded of pence s superior leadership qualities i m even less objective than usual we called pence the conservative champion and for good reason then in 2012 pence made the right decision to run for governor of indiana that was an opportunity for distinguished public service as it happened it was also a perfect boot camp for the vice presidency the honorable david mcintosh now president of the powerful club for growth was the one who encouraged pence to come back into electoral politics mcintosh later served as the guru of the draft pence for president super pac in my recent exclusive interview mcintosh recalled when i was vacating my congressional seat to pursue an ultimately unsuccessful gubernatorial run in 2000 i wanted my seat to be occupied by a true conservative and someone of high integrity and commitment to public service i turned to mike pence he had run unsuccessfully in 1988 and 1990 and by 2000 had achieved considerable success and affluence as a syndicated talk radio host mike replied that he no longer aspired to public office but would together with his wife karen pray on my request and determine whether they sensed a calling several months later i encountered mike at the indiana state fair i asked him about whether he had reached a conclusion he replied that he and karen recognized that he could not shirk the duty pence went on to run and win and serve america with distinction in the congress and then to serve splendidly as governor of indiana if elected to the vice presidency he will again serve america magnificently one of the reasons that pence showed himself extraordinary may have faded from general memory it has not faded from mine nor has it been forgotten or forgiven by the left who are now highlighting this much to my delight in 2010 pence gave a major speech at the detroit economic club as the center left thinkprogress org then reported the first item of pence s five point for the economy is a sound monetary policy pence elaborated that he believes a return to the gold standard could create such a policy pence before i move on i d like to note in the midst of all that s happened recently massive borrowing and spending qe2 a debate has started anew over an anchor to our global monetary system my dear friend the late jack kemp probably would have urged me to adopt the gold standard right here and now in detroit robert zoellick the president of the world bank encouraged that we rethink the international currency system including the role of gold and i agree i think the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nations monetary affairs a pro growth agenda begins with sound monetary policy emphasis supplied by thinkprogress the elitist left is misguidedly neurotic about the gold standard properly designed the gold standard favors labor and debtors slightly over capital and creditors and hence carries majority rank and file support among the labor and ethnic left timothy b lee wrote at the elite left vox on july 15th trump should ignore his running mate s bad ideas about monetary policy with reference to the same speech pence also flirted with returning to the gold standard the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nation s monetary affairs he said many economists including free market thinkers like milton friedman believe the gold standard played a central role in worsening the great depression it is perverse how the left has reviled friedman when he was as he most often was right while being deferential to him when he was demonstrably wrong the international gold standard had ceased operations in 1914 in 1922 it was replaced in the immortal words of the great french economist jacques rueff by a grotesque caricature the economist described that system quite correctly as a mess it called itself a gold standard without playing by the rules of the gold standard the interwar so called gold standard was a hybrid between jabberwocky and calvinball the true gold standard was but a dim memory by the onset of the great depression for which it was framed the misguided fixation of many economists deluded by the eichengreen fallacy on the role of the gold standard in worsening the great depression is contradicted by history conservative apostate david frum writing in the wall street journal also stubbornly continues to misunderstand the gold standard frum does however astutely observe some similarities between william jennings bryan and donald trump both men championed constituencies that formerly occupied a position of cultural and political dominance small farmers in bryan s case the white working class in trump s both of those constituencies had been economically ravaged for years beforehand by 20 years of price deflation for the small farmers by a generation of declining wages for the white working class this is a similarity previously noted by david klinghard in us news and world report and by tim reuter at forbes com it is apt in some ways but not in others bryan by prescribing depreciation through free coinage of silver lost three presidential races trump provides a counsel of general prosperity and has thus far gone from victory to victory and is on track to astound the frums of this world in the general election it is disappointing that the erudite but curiously tone deaf frum fails to note that the ravaging of small farmers was caused by the post civil war restoration of the gold standard at pre war parity this forced a painful secular deflation we are back in the jaws of deflation this time fed induced trump twice has stated his appreciation for the gold standard the very platform on which mckinley soundly beat bryan and the gold standard properly done is not an instrument of deflation paul krugman and his plovers will rave on against the gold standard let them to adapt a tweet by neo keynesian economist austan goolsbee roses are red violets are pink don t listen to aurophobes no one cares what they think to wit people suffering from aurophobia usually develop panic attacks when uncovered to gold or when they see gold different folks suffer from totally different symptoms of the panic assault like irregular heartbeat nausea sweating fast breathing and shortness of breath and a feeling of dread on seeing gold being a victim of aurophobia proves to be very uncomfortable because the victim cannot do things normal people do pity the left s rampant aurophobia the right s thought leaders such as steve forbes have solid evidence for the beneficence of the gold standard properly done and the new york sun astutely noted in a recent unsigned editorial mike pence s prescience donald trump s choice of mike pence for vice president would be a promising pick for those of us who see a restoration of sound money as the essential precondition for returning america s economy to a trajectory of jobs and growth no doubt he has lots of other virtues in that he has experience and success as both a congressman and governor were he ever called to the presidency he would be prepared but the feature of his political agenda that we have been watching for years is that in respect of monetary reform what are the building blocks of an incentive based growth agenda he asked in his detroit speech the first of his five building blocks was sound monetary policy that to us was significant mr pence s other four building blocks were terrific too including as they did tax relief and reform access to american energy regulatory reform and trade it was particularly newsworthy we felt that he had marked monetary first and that he was at the van of the leading republicans on this head he quoted lawrence kudlow s line about how the fed can print money but it can t print jobs we d like to think that it s no coincidence that mr kudlow is advising mr trump as he did president reagan mr trump himself has already stated that in principle he favors sound money bringing back the gold standard would be very hard to do but boy would it be wonderful he s said we d have a standard on which to base our money donald trump s signature promise is to make america great again trump knows that it would be wonderful to restore the gold standard he has a firm intuitive grasp of why we d have a standard on which to base our money america is struggling through 16 years of economic sluggishness at only maybe half the growth rate of our gold standard eras since president nixon closed the gold window on august 15 1971 a window cynically smashed by president johnson median family incomes have stagnated the rich have disproportionately prospered the american dream requires prosperity and justice for all the loss of one or two or to hark back to kennedy three percent of annual economic growth may not seem like much but thanks to the power of compounding which albert einstein famously never called the strongest force in the universe the american economy now is only two thirds as big it would have been if it had remained on trend line this is a big deal the american dream lies buried in these ruins let s resurrect it had gold standard equitable growth rates continued we d all on average be making 50 more and be worth 50 more america s gdp would be 26 t rather than 18 5t year the congressional budget office once estimated that every one tenth of one percent of gdp adds 314b to federal revenues over 10 years without raising taxes true gold standard growth rates would have transformed our hundreds of billions of dollars in annual federal deficits into hundreds of billions in surpluses that money would rebuild a lot of roads and bridges and a whole lot more trump laudably has committed himself to defending social security and medicare good for him at gold standard growth rates our social insurance programs can be made solvent for the indefinite future without cutting benefits or raising taxes restoring gold standard rates of job creation upward economic mobility and equitable prosperity is the most plausible easiest and requisite means of making america great again more easily done than said how why by restoring the gold standard of course let donald trump consult donald trump bringing back the gold standard would be wonderful we d have a standard on which to base our money spot on then if trump orone of his trusted associates such as mike pence newt gingrich chris christie larry kudlow or sam clovis wishes to know just how to make this happen just pick up the phone and invite one lewis e lehrman whose eponymous institute i once professionally served in for a chat lehrman was jack kemp s minence grise of his gold standard act of 1984 the ideal vehicle lehrman was called by public intellectual james grant our modern alexander hamilton invite steve forbes a heroic champion of the gold standard during its long dark age and eminent treasury secretary candidate to participate in that gold standard caucus while at it invite mike pence who got it long before most others did time to bring back the gold standard for its equitable prosperity inducing properties mike pence will make a great partner in making america great again grand slam i am the editor in chief of the committee to unleash prosperity
