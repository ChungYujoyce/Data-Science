on wednesday dnc chairman tom perez released the following statement recent reporting in the new yorker on the inappropriate relationship between president trump his administration and fox news has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates therefore fox news will not serve as a media partner for the 2020 democratic primary debates reutersfox news senior vice president bill sammon stated in response we hope the dnc will reconsider its decision to bar chris wallace bret baier and martha maccallum all of whom embody the ultimate journalistic integrity and professionalism from moderating a democratic presidential debate they re the best debate team in the business and they offer candidates an important opportunity to make their case to the largest tv news audience in america which includes many persuadable voters foxhere is the new yorker article for your reference new yorker the left is highly critical of fox and generally thinks that the dnc made the right decision the statement by sammon is an interesting display of television statecraft it highlights the work of the straight news crew of fox news omitting any such endorsement of the opinion folks yet when it came time to expand the fox news offerings into a stand alone streaming service under the banner of fox nation the network chose the opinion route in full awareness that they provide the audience convening heart of fox news despite wallace baier and maccallum s hard work and many very good interviews none of them is the face of fox news that s hannity or carlson or doocy erik wemple washington post some of the messaging from fox personalities in response no longer has anything in common with good faith conservative opinion it sounds nothing like healthy skepticism much of it is plainly about deceiving millions of voters into believing that core functionings of our government whether it is law enforcement or congressional oversight no longer have any legitimacy it s rank propaganda pure and simple directed at insulating trump from any measure of accountability and at fortifying the ranks of the base in preparation for the wars over trump s intensifying oversight and legal travails to come in advance of his reelection campaign greg sargent washington post haven t mainstream outlets carried water for presidents for decades absolutely yet the relationship between donald trump and fox news is distinctly different bringing the channel closer to state television than anything the united states has ever known trump s tweets both echo fox news stories and shape them the white house and fox news are each other s programming directors and perhaps most shocking and unprecedented the cable channel is a direct line of communication to the white house just one example repeated poundings on fox prompted trump to reverse course on a budget deal leading to the longest government shutdown in american history nicole hemmer cnn you don t need to take mayer s reporting as gospel to see that fox has a vested interest in keeping trump in the white house where he routinely receives formal and informal advice from fox veterans past and present likewise you can believe that chris wallace and bret baier are respectable journalists and still have serious doubts whether as debate moderators they would have been the ones truly running the show and you can also think democrats should make a more concerted effort to reach new audiences and still believe there are better ways to do that than through fox off the top of my head travel to wisconsin josh voorhees slate some however posit that in rejecting fox the dnc gave up a shot at reaching cable news largest audience for a night of live unedited pitches on how the crowded and experienced field of candidates would fix the country s problems philip elliott time others claim that the argument for dnc having a debate on fox to reach voters where they are seems to me among other things to truly misunderstand how audiences work for this kind of thing by and large people don t just turn on a network and then they re pleasantly surprised oh look a debate audience data from 2016 suggests that audiences go to the network that has the debate to watch them chris hayes twitter the right defends fox s news anchors and argues that this will ultimately harm the democratic party the right defends fox s news anchors and argues that this will ultimately harm the democratic party if you re a democratic white house hopeful the road goes ultimately through the midwest the rust belt and states like florida north carolina arizona and nevada therefore appearing on fox news and doing interviews with other outlets outside what is perceived largely as comfort zones will be a necessity if capturing the same independent and blue dog voters trump swayed in 2016 is the goal joe concha the hill no matter your view of fox or thenew yorker s view of fox the party s avoidance of the network reveals a shameful political gutlessness especially considering that fox intended to assign tame newsers bret baier and chris wallace to the debate not feral opinionators tucker carlson and sean hannity being president involves making unpalatable decisions and confronting tough customers on a daily basis it means learning how to tell voters what they don t want to hear and convince them they should like it so any politician who can t hold his own against a journalist from the other team should be disqualified from running jack shafer politico i completely understand why many progressives dislike fox and while there s much i can t defend on the opinion side of fox it s easy for me to defend the work of people like bret baier and chris wallace and the fox news division if you go back and look at any of the debates hosted by fox democrat or republican you will be hard pressed to find any evidence that they were anything other than professional but this isn t about defending fox fox is the most watched cable news network and if you think there are zero voters out there that democrats need to reach out to then this isn t a big deal but that s simply not the case in a world where millions of people voted for both obama and trump the idea that the democrats don t need to speak to audiences outside of their base is just dumb even if democrats feel they don t get a fair shake from fox jonah goldberg national review some however are less critical of the dnc s decision fox is a network that often operates in primetime as an arm of the white house comms team the 9 p m guy talks to trump regularly has been described as his shadow of chief staff and campaigned with him at a rally shortly before the midterms even if you had every assurance from fox that wallace and baier would be fair and they would be the decision to hand a debate to trump tv would infuriate many dem voters it s not a matter of dems fearing that wallace and baier would turn a primary debate into some hannityesque attack segment but rather not wanting to reward an operation that s effectively in a partnership with the man they ll be facing next fall allahpundit hot air others note that the dnc seems to have a rather unique view of what constitutes fair and neutral during the 2016 primary leaked emails from the organization indicated that the power brokers there had already decided in advance that clinton would be the nominee and essentially rigged the contest to make sure that sanders would lose the leaked emails showed furthermore that donna brazille a cnn contributor at the time fed clinton questions ahead of a town hall debate hosted by the network i m not sure that constitutes what anyone might call fair and neutral behavior marc giller the resurgent
