and first generation students i feel like we don t get a lot of recognition they kind of looked at as second tier compared to ivy league schools or predominately white institutions said harris so i m just glad that celebrities are taking the chance to embrace our young african american graduates there are so many statistics that we have overcome just graduating for college harris left hampton s campus nine weeks ago and went home to st louis assuming she d be back on campus in a matter of weeks at first people were excited it was like a little break harris said but as soon as i got back home
