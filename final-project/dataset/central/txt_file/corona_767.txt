accidental experiment showing what happens to air pollution when millions of people stop driving the air is clearer but the pollution declines aren t nearly as large as early indications suggested according to an npr analysis of six years of environmental protection agency data in some cities the amount of one pollutant ozone has barely decreased compared with levels over the past five years despite traffic reductions of more than 40 ground level ozone or smog occurs when the chemicals emitted by cars trucks factories and other sources react with sunlight and heat npr analyzed more than half a million air pollution measurements reported to the epa from more than 900 air monitoring sites around the country we compared the median ozone levels detected this spring with levels found during the comparable period over the past five years our analysis revealed that in the vast majority of places ozone pollution decreased by 15 or less a clear indication that improving air quality will take much more than cleaning up tailpipes of passenger cars in cities such as los angeles stubbornly poor air quality during the coronavirus lockdown underscored how vast fleets of trucks are a dominant source of pollution in industrial cities like houston refineries and petrochemical plants spew considerable air pollution and in pittsburgh and across a swath of the eastern u s much of the air pollution still comes from burning coal scientists say those cities where air pollution often exceeds federal health standards will likely have to change the way they generate power manufacture goods and move those goods around if they hope to have healthy air i think it s a really important question to think about what can we learn from decreases in traffic pollution says jenna krall a statistician and air pollution expert at george mason university it will give us more information about what these pollution mixtures could look like with fewer people driving freeway traffic was light and the air was relatively clear in los angeles on april 6 mario tama getty images hide caption los angeles trucks overtake cars initially the virtually nationwide lockdown appeared to have dramatically positive results in early april nasa published satellite images of pollution disappearing over new york city after california issued a stay at home order in mid march greater los angeles saw the longest stretch of clean air that had been documented in decades in los angeles the skies seemed to clear just as rarely seen images of nearly empty freeways began to make headlines it was welcome news for an area with some of the highest levels of ozone in the country often exceeding federal health standards breathing polluted air for long periods of time can damage the lungs and make it more difficult to fight respiratory disease ozone pollution is especially detrimental to children and elderly people and those with asthma emphysema and other respiratory illnesses the covid 19 pandemic adds another respiratory disease to that list but the cleaner air wasn t just about reduced traffic loading don t see the graphic above click here a series of rainstorms swept through southern california in march which helped remove pollutants from the air but as the weather warmed up in late april and early may the air quality worsened even hitting the very unhealthy warning category from the epa there was a lot of pressure on us to come up with the answer that everyone wanted to hear which is that the covid 19 measures have cleaned the air in southern california says philip fine deputy executive officer at the south coast air quality management district which regulates air quality in greater la overall ozone levels were down only 14 in late march and april compared with the same period over the previous five years according to npr s analysis the modest drop points to a fact air regulators have long emphasized cars are not the biggest air pollution problem in los angeles i ve read a lot of newspaper articles over the past couple weeks that have said if only we can have people telecommute one day a week across the entire basin our air quality problems will be solved says fine and unfortunately it s not that simple as passenger cars have gotten cleaner they ve become a relatively smaller source of pollution heavy duty transportation such as trucks and buses now accounts for the largest source of nitrogen oxides which form ozone in the area major ports in los angeles and long beach handle more than 30 of the nation s shipping container traffic requiring a vast network of ships trucks and trains coming in and out of the region loading don t see the graphic above click here emissions from those sources combined with hot and stagnant weather cause air pollution to hit dangerous levels during the summer which puts the region out of compliance with federal air standards low income communities are hit the hardest while activity at the region s ports has slowed with the pandemic trucks have largely stayed on the roads to ensure that goods are arriving in stores at the end of april truck activity was down only about 8 across california according to the american transportation research institute in a strange wrinkle the reduction of one pollutant can also make ozone slightly worse cars and trucks produce nitrogen oxides also known as nox while that pollutant helps form ozone under some conditions it can temporarily break down ozone molecules so with less nox being emitted recently ozone hasn t been suppressed as much small reductions in nox actually increase ozone says cesunica ivey assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering at the university of california riverside so we re just going to have to be more aggressive with our sustainable transportation solutions severe los angeles smog in the 1950s and 60s prompted california to ultimately pass some of the most aggressive air quality regulations in the country the state still sets its own tailpipe emissions standards for cars apart from the federal government the trump administration is now seeking to revoke california s legal authority to do so california also has an ambitious target for putting 5 million electric cars on the road by 2030 that could help lower emissions because instead of burning gasoline those cars would run on electricity largely generated by solar wind and hydropower in the state now california is crafting a similar policy for trucks state regulators are expected to vote on rules in june that would require truck manufacturers to sell all electric or fuel cell trucks in the state from delivery trucks all the way to tractor trailers the policy would begin in 2024 requiring that 5 to 9 of sales be electric depending on the type of truck by 2035 it would be up to 40 to 75 of sales some truck manufacturers have pushed back against the proposal saying the market for selling electric trucks hasn t developed yet supporters say higher sticker prices would be offset by fuel savings over time and when paired with california s other efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could potentially save thousands of lives by improving the air we don t need a pandemic to breathe cleaner air says yifang zhu professor at the fielding school of public health at the university of california los angeles there is a sustainable way for a society to achieve a cleaner world in the future we need to do more than we re doing right now water vapor rises from a coal powered power plant stack pollution from burning coal affects a larger area than vehicle emissions luke sharrett bloomberg getty images hide caption water vapor rises from a coal powered power plant stack pollution from burning coal affects a larger area than vehicle emissions pittsburgh coal on display less car traffic makes pollution from coal more obvious in the broad swath of midwestern and eastern states where the majority of coal fired power plants are still operating compared to passenger cars burning coal releases large amounts of air pollution including nitrogen oxides and small particulate matter or soot nowhere is the role of coal in air pollution more evident than in allegheny county pa where pittsburgh is located the county is home to a major coking plant that uses coal to make the fuel for the blast furnaces in steel factories as well as a coal fired power plant both continued to operate during the lockdown along with other steel facilities clustered in and around the county between march 15 and the end of april npr s analysis found ozone levels in the pittsburgh area dropped about 9 compared with 14 in los angeles across the coal intensive ohio river valley the analysis concluded that in major cities ozone dropped only between 3 and 8 scientists say that s not surprising because coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels unlike a lot of the eastern part of the united states there s not much if any coal fired power plant production in california says emily elliott a geochemist at the university of pittsburgh who studies nitrogen oxides pollution from burning coal also affects a larger area than vehicle emissions which means modest air pollution reductions in east coast states may partly be because of their location downwind of coal fired facilities if you think about a power plant that has a tall smokestack those emissions are going high aloft in the air and they re going to travel long long distances compared to a vehicle tailpipe that s close to the ground elliott says the houston metro area is home to the largest concentration of petrochemical facilities in the country residents of houston despite a 40 reduction in local traffic did not breathe significantly cleaner air during the lockdown mark felix afp via getty images hide caption the houston metro area is home to the largest concentration of petrochemical facilities in the country residents of houston despite a 40 reduction in local traffic did not breathe significantly cleaner air during the lockdown houston the petrochemical industry s role coal is not the only industry culprit for poor air npr s investigation found that residents of houston did not breathe significantly cleaner air during the lockdown despite a 40 reduction in local traffic houston experienced an 11 decrease in ozone daily ozone levels in houston were still high enough to trigger an air quality warning in the city in mid april the houston metro area is home to the largest concentration of petrochemical facilities in the country refineries and chemical plants are major emitters of not only nitrogen oxide but sulfur dioxide which also contributes to smog and haze npr s analysis also found only modest decreases in houston s soot pollution during the lockdown the median amount of soot in the air decreased by just 13 in houston compared with the previous five years according to air monitoring sites that reported data between march 15 and the end of april air monitoring sites that reported comparable data in greater los angeles showed a 30 decrease there was not adequate data to compare soot levels in pittsburgh chronic exposure to soot is associated with shorter life expectancies lung cancer diabetes and low birth weight and can exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses regulatory rollbacks could make industrial pollution more severe in the future the trump administration announced this spring that it will not strengthen limits on soot despite an assessment published earlier this year by epa scientists that found that a stronger standard would save lives an accidental experiment scientists around the country say reduced car traffic offers them an unexpected opportunity to study how cars trucks factories and power plants contribute to air pollution and to test the assumptions that go into pollution models one such study is already underway at texas a m university where atmospheric scientist gunnar schade examined preliminary air data for the city of houston and found that levels of particulate matter increased slightly in at least one location in houston during the lockdown that was a somewhat surprising result that particulate matter is not going down at all he says we assume that car traffic does contribute to small particulate pollution it has in the past schade s analysis which has not been peer reviewed and is still being updated as more data becomes available also suggests that particulate pollution decreased more in residential parts of houston than it did in industrial areas schade says it s too soon to be sure whether that means the pollution came from the industrial sites he needs more data despite decades of research and a relatively robust set of satellites and ground based air monitors there are still sizable holes in our understanding of how different sources of air pollution contribute to overall air quality according to elena craft the director of climate and health at the environmental defense fund in texas the pandemic could help make scientific models of what are called emissions inventories more accurate if you take all the cars off the road and it doesn t put a dent in your emissions inventory then probably cars are not making up a lot of that inventory explains craft but if on the other hand you take all the cars off the road and air quality is great then you may tweak the models npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
