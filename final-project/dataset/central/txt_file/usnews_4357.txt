become the trump administration s latest punching bag with republicans reviving his past controversies and demanding his ouster president donald trump has blasted the who s handling of the pandemic as china centric and halted u s funding for the global health organization on wednesday john barsa trump s acting administrator for the us agency for international development usaid said the state department was reviewing the who s actions during the current pause in funding which could last 90 days but he also said usaid is looking for different health programs and organizations the us could

challenges barsa said during a briefing at the state department we re going with existing programs outside of the world health organization and we re looking for different partners at that same briefing secretary of state mike pompeo did not directly mention tedros but he sharply criticized who s leadership and suggested the organization failed to enforce its own rules dictating quick and transparent reporting from member countries on disease outbreaks trump s gop allies have gone even further casting tedros as propagandist for the chinese communist party who bungled the who s coronavirus response and needs to step down director general tedros is a puppet of the chinese communist party rep michael mccaul the top republican on the house foreign affairs committee said in a statement to usa today tedros was the ccp s chosen candidate for the role and their support for him has paid off he used the who to trumpet their lies about the virus mccaul and 16 other house gop lawmakers have urged trump to condition future u s funding for the who on tedros resignation arguing that hedelayed declaring the novel coronavirus a public health emergency ignored warnings about human to human transmission and heaped praise on the chinese government despite evidence it was hiding the scope and severity of its outbreak tedros supporterssay the accusations an unfounded and outrageous effort to deflect from the trump administration s own missteps they say tedros is a visionary public health leader and savvy diplomat who has navigated the deadly pandemic and its

has known tedros for 30 years as he confronts a once in a century public health calamity morrison said he s getting slammed by president trump and who isbeing singled out and scapegoated morrison and others credited tedros with acting quickly to facilitate the development and distribution of tests for covid 19 the disease caused by the novel virus and negotiating with china for information and access he coaxed china into letting a small team of who experts on the ground in china which was no easy task saidlawrence gostin director of georgetown university s o neill institute for national and

all over ethiopia as a key element of transforming the delivery of services to the most impoverished pockets of the country if tedros is passionate about public health it s perhaps no wonder when he
