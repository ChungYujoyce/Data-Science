abu bakr al baghdadi the fugitive emir of isis the man who transformed a breakaway al qaeda group into a transnational terrorist franchise that brutalized and killed civilians in more than a dozen countries and who threatened to rewrite the map of the middle east by luring foreign recruits to wage jihad in iraq and syria is dead so what happens to the terror organization that he painstakingly assembled in many ways the group is already evolving isis leadership ranks have proved resilient despite more than five years of war the group has been quick to adapt to new circumstances no longer capable of seizing and holding territory the surviving foot soldiers have instead gone back to their guerrilla roots carrying out ambushes bombings and assassinations and despite the loss of its territorial caliphate in iraq and syria isis has expanded its reach to include 14 separate affiliates in countries across asia and africa in the long term analysts say what may be most significant about saturday s special operations commando raid is not al baghdadi s decapitation from isis shadowy hierarchy but the ease with which he will be replaced the group like its predecessor organization al qaeda in iraq routinely taps new commanders to fill the vacuum left by those who are assassinated the replacements occur with such regularity that the u s special operations community jokingly refers to removing leaders as mowing the grass abu bakr al baghdadi s death welcome and important though it may be is not a catastrophic blow to the quality of leadership in isis says michael nagata who retired as army lieutenant general and strategy director from the national counterterrorism center in august nagata who served in the middle east as a special operations commander in 2014 when the counter isis campaign began says isis now has a cadre of young battle hardened leaders who are climbing toward the top echelons and establishing themselves in the terror group s global network isis isn t a crippled organization because baghdadi s gone he says the depth and breadth of isis leadership in my judgment is unprecedented for this type of terrorist group since the first days of u s involvement in the war against isis special operations forces and intelligence agencies hunted and killed the group s leaders one by one but they ve always regrouped as we ve seen over the last several years the group also has a strategy to carry on operations into the next decade says aki peritz a former cia counterterrorism analyst and co author of find fix finish inside the counterterrorism campaigns that killed bin laden and devastated al qaeda it s good to take out the leader but it s not just a terrorist group it s an ideology as well stamping out the idea of the islamic state will prove to be much more difficult than one successful military intelligence operation after all al qaeda endured after founder osama bin laden was killed in a 2011 navy seal raid and al qaeda in iraq lived on as isis after its founder abu musab al zarqawi was killed in a 2006 u s airstrike it s good to take out the leader but it s not just a terrorist group it s an ideology as well u s counterterrorism officials expect isis to name a successor in the coming days or weeks a likely candidate is al baghdadi s defense chief iyad al obaidi but regardless of who leads the sunni extremist group it is now a shadow of the organization that launched a lightning offensive in iraq and syria that resulted in the seizure of territory the size of britain and raked in millions of dollars a day the seeds for resurgence however are there according to a recent defense department inspector general s report isis has between 14 000 and 18 000 members who ve pledged allegiance to al baghdadi in addition there are more than 30 detention camps that hold about 11 000 isis fighters sympathizers and other associated detainees across northern syria another camp for internally displaced persons known as al hol in northeastern syria holds nearly 70 000 people including thousands of isis family members the u s military reported in february that absent sustained pressure the terrorist group would re emerge in syria within six to 12 months moreover isis remains a worldwide threat because the group has a constellation of affiliates in places as far flung as nigeria and pakistan according to a report from the institute for the study of war in washington isis global presence provides footholds from which to further metastasize launch attacks and gain resources to fund its resurgence in iraq and syria the report said documenting recent plans for attacks on the west that emanated from affiliates in libya somalia and the philippines the death of militant leaders however frequently leads to fractures within terror organizations and new directions in strategy says norman t roule a former senior cia officer with experience in middle east issues in the wake of baghdadi s death isis groups abroad could go in a number of directions he says some may decide to reconcile with al qaeda some may decide to undertake revenge operations to demonstrate that isis remains potent some planned operations could be accelerated if the isis planners believe the intelligence found with baghdadi might identify them colin p clarke a fellow at the soufan center and author of after the caliphate the islamic state and the future of the terrorist diaspora says there have already been signs of an isis 2 0 emerging it s unclear what baghdadi s death could do to exacerbate the changes underway he says baghdadi was the face of the isis brand he had a cult of personality born into a religiously devout lower middle class sunni muslim family in iraq in 1971 ibrahim awwad ibrahim al badri who years later adopted the nom de guerre al baghdadi was an unexceptional shy child according to recent biographies based on interviews with those who knew him he never excelled at religious scholarship but was talented at the recitation of quranic verse in college and graduate school he studied the style and technique of reciting the quran and he wrote a master s thesis on a medieval commentary on the subject al baghdadi s finishing school in radicalism was unwittingly provided by the u s in february 2004 after the invasion of iraq he was visiting a friend in fallujah when u s army intelligence officers burst in and arrested them both al baghdadi was taken to the notorious prison at camp bucca which inadvertently came to serve as an incubator for sunni jihadism according to former camp officials there he was a skilled networker courting radical factions and building a reputation as a religious leader based on his islamic studies these talents didn t register on his captors though who judged al baghdadi to be a low risk prisoner released at the end of 2004 he returned to the iraqi capital where he pursued a doctorate and joined a series of jihadi groups invigorated by the fall of saddam hussein and the u s occupation in early 2006 he found his ultimate home in the iraqi al qaeda offshoot led by zarqawi a former violent criminal from jordan whom u s forces killed that june al baghdadi s nominal religious qualifications and rigid dogmatism carried him quickly through the ranks and in may 2010 after the u s killed the only two men above him he emerged as the emir along with his ambitious territorial goals in the middle east al baghdadi elaborated an apocalyptic vision of a final battle between the forces of radical islam and the west in a ramadan sermon in mid 2014 he declared slavery the universal human condition muslim believers are indentured to allah while nonbelievers are the rightful property of muslims he also said the time of death for each man and woman is preordained implying that all killings must be the will of allah this teaching paved the way for his chief spokesman to deliver the following message to isis supporters everywhere a few months later if you can kill a disbelieving american or european the spokesman said kill the disbeliever whether he is civilian or military the bloodthirsty rhetoric often relayed on slickly produced videos that pin balled around social media proved an innovative tactic that resonated with disaffected youth isis recruited around 43 000 fighters from 120 countries to the caliphate in iraq and syria some acted in al baghdadi s name at home killing hundreds of innocents at hotels mosques and concert halls from paris to the sinai beirut to san bernardino calif the widespread violence earned al baghdadi a 25 million u s bounty on his head and enemies across the world he went underground for years there were erroneous reports that he was seriously wounded or killed after the collapse of his self proclaimed caliphate al baghdadi had been shuttling back and forth in the desert between western iraq and eastern syria traveling mostly in cars and toyota pickup trucks with a small entourage that included heavily armed bodyguards according to a u s intelligence official he rarely stayed more than one night in the same place and like bin laden communicated by courier rather than using phones or computers the official said al baghdadi was located when iraqi forces picked up two members of his entourage in an unrelated operation and passed the intelligence they collected to the cia after a five year absence from public view al baghdadi had appeared april 29 in an 18 minute propaganda video in a black tunic with a kalashnikov rifle at his side he stated that isis s fight against the west was far from over our battle today is a war of attrition to harm the enemy and they should know that jihad will continue until doomsday he told a roomful of followers seated cross legged on the floor a u s counterterrorism official who was not authorized to speak publicly on al baghdadi s death told time that danger still looms from al baghdadi s call for followers to shift from larger attacks to more small actions outside iraq and syria even so the official said that al baghdadi s death while partly symbolic would silence maybe the most inspirational terrorist
