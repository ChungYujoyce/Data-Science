what a difference a few weeks can make since the last democratic presidential debate on feb 25 former vice president joe biden has emerged as the party s presidential primary front runner cementing a clear path towards his nomination only vermont sen bernie sanders remains a viable opponent to the former delaware senator and his candidacy took a major hit when biden won the delegate rich michigan primary on tuesday on march 15 biden and sanders will face off in a one on one debate unlike any this election cycle because of the spread of covid 19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus the eleventh and penultimate democratic presidential debate won t have an audience and will take place in washington d c and instead of the usual packed stage it will feature just two men each making the case for their ideological wing of the democratic primary the debate was supposed take place on sunday in phoenix ariz just days before the arizona primary on march 17 but on thursday the democratic national committee dnc announced that they were moving the debate to washington d c out of an abundance of caution and in order to reduce cross country travel cnn and univision will still co host the debate in partnership with chc bold the political action committee linked to the congressional hispanic caucus it will air live from 8 to 10 p m et from cnn s studios in washington d c biden will come into the debate with momentum his winning streak continued on tuesday when he won the idaho mississippi and missouri nominating contests as well as the michigan primary which sanders won in 2016 on wednesday sanders said he did not plan to drop out the race and would debate biden on sunday as scheduled to qualify for the debate candidates had to receive at least 20 of the total pledged delegates allocated by 9 a m et on march 15 this will be the first debate where candidates don t need to reach certain polling numbers the new requirement will likely exclude hawaii rep tulsi gabbard who has 2 delegates to biden s 864 and sanders 710 as of thursday cnn s dana bash cnn s jake tapper and univision s ilia calder n will co moderate the debate univision s jorge ramos was also scheduled to co moderate but on thursday the dnc announced that he was in proximity with someone who was in direct contact with a person that tested positive for coronavirus and out of an abundance of caution he decided to not participate ilia calder n will represent univision in his stead while our campaign has won the ideological debate we are losing the debate over electability sanders said during a press conference on wednesday some people on social media have theorized that sanders may take sunday as a last chance to advocate for progressive policies on a national platform before dropping out of the race lonna r atkeson a professor of political science at the university of new mexico also points out to time that as long as sanders stays in the race he forces biden towards more left policies atkeson adds that things just change so quickly these days she wouldn t say a sanders comeback is entirely impossible it s not over until it s over here s what to know about the march democratic debate the march democratic debate will take place at cnn s studios in washington d c on march 15 just days before the delegate rich states of arizona florida illinois and ohio hold their primaries the debate will air live from 8 to 10 p m et on cnn cnn en espa ol cnn international and univision it will also air live on cnn com s homepage without requiring a cable login as well as cnn s mobile app smart tv apps and univision s digital properties univision s ilia calder n cnn s jake tapper and cnn s dana bash will moderate the debate tapper and bash co moderated the second democratic debate together back in july what began as the most diverse presidential primary in u s history has narrowed to a contest between two white men in their late seventies however if he wins sanders would be the first jewish presidential nominee of a major american political party to make the debate stage candidates have to be allocated at least 20 of the total pledged delegates available by 9 a m et on march 15 hawaii rep tulsi gabbard the final woman and person of color in the race could technically still qualify but it will be impossible for her to get enough delegates by the march 15 deadline she only has two delegates so far to biden s 864 and sanders 710 as of thursday here are the two contenders biden served as president barack obama s vice president from 2009 to 2017 and represented delaware in the senate from 1973 to 2009 he also ran for the democratic presidential nomination in 2008 and 1988 sanders served as vermont s sole congressional representative from 1991 to 2007 and has represented vermont in the senate since 2007 the self described democratic socialist ran for the 2016 democratic nomination and lost to former secretary of state hillary clinton just a month ago many thought biden s run was almost over after he came in fifth in the new hampshire primary but not everyone foresaw how swiftly the democratic establishment would rally around him some propelled by their fear that a sanders ticket could hand the race to president donald trump leading into the last debate the race was very fluid sanders had emerged as the candidate on the left wing of the party but democratic voters had not settled on a moderate candidate stephen ansolabehere a professor of government at harvard university writes time in an email former new york city mayor mike bloomberg had seemed like a viable option and has certainly spent enough money to not be discounted but multiple bad debate performances halted any momentum bloomberg was gaining through february ansolabehere explains then on feb 29 the former vice president swept the south carolina primary earning 39 delegates and recharging his campaign this resounding win spelled the end of the campaigns for two of his main rivals former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg and minnesota sen amy klobuchar ansolabehere writes they both dropped out and endorsed biden as did former candidate and former texas rep beto o rourke biden rode that momentum into super tuesday and performed surprisingly well taking states like texas and minnesota that some expected to go to sanders the last minute endorsements from klobuchar and o rourke likely helped sanders still won the delegate rich state of california as well as colorado utah and vermont bloomberg dropped out of the race after his super tuesday loss and endorsed biden on march 5 massachusetts sen elizabeth warren who most viewed as the last viable female candidate also dropped out of the campaign she has yet to endorse anyone new jersey sen cory booker and california sen kamala harris two of the most prominent african american candidates from the primary endorsed biden on monday and sunday respectively without another debate before or immediately after super tuesday to change the media focus sanders has been forced to watch his support wither while biden has been accumulating accolades and endorsements barry burden a professor of political science at university of wisconsin madison writes time in an email sanders for his part has received a number of progressive endorsements on sunday civil rights activist and former presidential candidate rev jesse jackson endorsed the vermont senator a number of progressive groups that had previously endorsed warren including the working families party also switched their endorsement to sanders once she dropped out as the primaries have ticked forward the bases of the two candidates have also come into focus biden s appeal among african american moderate and older voters has become clear as has his popularity with the democratic establishment sanders grassroots campaign energized by young people across the u s has expanded to include a large number of latino voters on sunday they ll each make their case for why they re best suited to assemble a broad enough coalition to defeat trump come november since there ll be only two candidates the moderators will have more time than in the past to raise a variety of topics the two men also effectively represent the opposing wings of the democratic party and will have plenty to debate give the spread of the coronavirus throughout the u s lonna atkinson predicts that their differences on health care sanders supports medicare for all while biden does not may get extra attention health care is one of the most important issues for democratic voters and sanders and biden have sparred over it in previous debates atkinson adds that the threat of the novel coronavirus could also move the discussion away from individual health and turn focus onto public health brooks simpson a professor of political history at arizona state university predicts that sanders will try to pin biden down on a largely domestic agenda with global implications wealth and income inequality healthcare climate change criminal justice reform and free tuition for college he predicts biden will counter with more moderate proposals as he begins to pivot towards the general election simpson adds that immigration is a key issue in arizona which will still be a crucial primary even though it s no longer the location of the debate and voters will want to hear what both men have to say on that issue sanders comments on wednesday also suggest that the two men may not get as combative as they have in previous debates i very much look forward to the debate with my friend joe biden sanders said at a press conference on wednesday before listing a series of questions that he plans to ask the former vice president as mia costa a professor of government at dartmouth college tells time sanders appears to view sunday s debate as a last ditch effort to highlight the ideological differences between him and biden ansolabehere of harvard also theorizes that their discussion could begin to shift towards trump since biden s wins in michigan and missouri suggest he s close to securing the nomination on march 14 guam and northern marianas will hold their nominating contests then two days after the debate the delegate rich arizona florida illinois and ohio primaries will take place on march 17 that could be a tough day for sanders according to realclearpolitics polling average on wednesday biden has a 42 5 point lead over sanders in florida polls fivethirtyeight s polling averages as of wednesday also found that biden had 54 support to sanders 36 6 in ohio 51 6 to sanders 32 4 in arizona and 53 5 to sanders 31 2 in illinois but sunday s debate could have an impact on how march 17 turns out lonna atkeson points to the impact of previous debates in 2020 klobuchar performed surprisingly well in new hampshire after a strong debate performance and bloomberg s poor showing helped kill his chances on super tuesday debate ratings have also risen in 2020 nearly 20 million people tuned in to watch the debate on feb 19 if someone makes a gaffe or makes a particularly strong case for their candidacy it could sway voters biden has shot up in the polls since the last debate propelled by his wins and positive media narrative the rapid exit of multiple candidates who then endorsed him could also have helped shift support in his favor here s how the candidates are polling according realclearpolitics national polling average as of wednesday write to madeleine carlisle at madeleine carlisle time com
