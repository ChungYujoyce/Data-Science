coronavirus antibody testing in the u s is starting toramp up as government officials discuss when they can reopen communities andhealth experts survey hotspots from coast to coast epidemiologists are usingsome of the many antibody tests that have entered the market recentlyto determine how muchcovid 19 has spread the importance of these tests are not lost on americans who are itching to go back to work see loved ones and find out if they have been infected with thevirus many havequestions about where to find antibody tests how they work and ifthey can even be trusted there aren t easy answers with little public data about the tests accuracy experts questionwhether they willgive people false reassurances byindicating they have immunity to the disease testing to see if people haveantibodies in their blood isn t the same as testing to see if they are infected withthe coronavirus that causes covid 19 an antibody test can determine if someone has been infectedand recovered whereas a moleculartest a pcr test that usually usesa nose or throat swab shows whether that person was infected with the virus at the time the test was taken antibodies are the body s way of remembering how it responded to an infection so theycan attack again if exposed to the same pathogen if a person has antibodies in her blood that means she has immune cells available to fight the virus which lowers therisk of getting sick the blood tests for covid 19 look for antibodies specific to this coronavirus health care workers take a sample of a patient s blood and isolate the partscontaining the antibodies into a serum if someone has coronavirus antibodies theywould be found in the blood along with other antibodies some tests use a simple finger prick to draw a blood sample which is collected with a thin straw and deposited in a small cartridge along with a special solution of liquids that will cause a reaction ten minutes later the test promises to tell you whether you ve had covid 19 explainer antibody tests could be key to reopening the country here s how they work in theory antibody tests canreveal who is immune to a disease theycan also determine how widely it has spread and how deadly it is broad testing of even a portion of the population in the coming months could give researchers a sense of how many americans have been infected they could use that to predict who might be immune if covid 19 cases spike againthisfall opinion why coronavirus antibody test will not be a panacea antibodies for similar coronavirusescan be present in the body for a couple of years said dr liise anne pirofski professor of biomedical research at the albert einstein college of medicine however scientists don t know how long antibodies for the new coronavirus remain in the body and how much is required to be immune antibody testing is also important because people with the antibodies may qualify to donate blood that can be used to manufacture convalescent plasma an experimental treatment for people who are seriously ill from covid 19 but there are many questions about the tests now available the food and drug administration has issued emergency use authorization to justfour serological testsdeveloped by cellex chembio diagnostic systems ortho clinical diagnostics and mount sinai laboratory the fda saidit expects to authorize more in the coming weeks emergency use authorization allows unapproved medical products to be used during a public health crisis without the benefit of the validated testing that would normally take place more than 100 tests are coming on the market but the vast majorityhas not been authorized by the fda in march the fda allowed companies to sell antibody tests if theyconductinternal evaluations of the tests and notifythe fda the fda did not review those tests as it typically would in an effort to put them in use as quickly as possible there s even more concern there they ve had even less regulatory control said dr greg poland director of the mayo clinic s vaccine research group how are manufacturers testing these are they rushing these out prematurely that economic motive is what requires regulatory oversight under the fda s updated policy dozens of new antibody tests are being marketed without emergency use authorization so while tests are becoming available to the public they haven t received much scrutiny dr stephen hahn who heads the food and drug administration said earlier this week that his agency and others are examining some of the antibody tests offered by manufacturers depending on where you live you maynothave access to antibody testing most people can t drive up to their local pharmacy lab or hospital and ask for an antibody test however some private labs are offering antibody tests to the public with or without a doctor s referral for a fee these include labs such as arcpoint labs in greenville north carolina 75 national jewish health in denver colorado 94 andinnovative express care in chicago 250 some states have set up antibody testing sites for a limited number of people the new york state department of health recently conducted a statewide survey that tested 3 000 people in 20 different grocery stores finding that 13 9 tested positive for the antibodies that would mean2 7 million residents could have had the virus already the studysuggestsa death rate of about 0 5 of those infected because about 15 500 new yorkers have died of confirmed covid 19 cases and there areabout 19 5 million people in the state gov andrew cuomo said the results are an important indicator of the spread of the virus though the death rate is probably higher than the results showed it s still preliminary and when we say there are 15 000 deaths those numbers are going to go up cuomo said these are only hospitalization or nursing home deaths it does not include so called at home deaths epidemiological experts don t know enough to makesweeping generalizations on the study pirofski said during a teleconference hosted by the infectious diseases society of america we need to slow our roll these tests have not been available for that long she said this is our first dive into understandingwhat s coming and the deeper dive is coming the red crossannounced thursday itis seeking people who have fully recovered from covid 19 to sign up to donate plasma which contains antibodies to treat current covid 19 patients u s hits 50 000 deaths from coronavirus just as many states announce plans to ease social distancing will the curve hold steady the coronavirus curve bends toward reopening in hard hit counties donors must meet certain requirements to donate including having aprior verified diagnosis of covid 19 pirofski said the donor must have documentation such as a positive pcr testor an official isolation order and can donate up to 28 days after the resolution of their symptoms this is not a diagnostic test to determine if you had the virus in the past researchers have raised many questions about the accuracy of antibody or serology tests nobody s done what i would call a thorough head to head comparison with a validated gold standard poland said i m actually surprised that some of these kits can be used clinically poland said he s concerned about the tests giving false positives one of the things i m afraid of is that people are going to go to drive thru testing who have not had the disease and are going to be told that they re protected because the test shows they have antibodies and they re going to act and react according to that misinformation that s a problem unproven tests inaccurate results public health labs worry bad data could taint us recovery from coronavirus crisis for instance a positive result could mean a test detected antibodies developed from exposure to other coronaviruses not covid 19 we want to make sure you re not having any cross reactivity to other viruses said kelly wroblewski the director for infectious diseases at the association of public health laboratories a key question is the specificity or the false positive rate for instance a specificity rate of 98 suggests a test would report just two false positives out of 100 however biochemists and infectious disease experts say the false positive rate should be considered in relation to the prevalence of the virus in the community if few people have actually contracted the virus there will be more false positives those people may think they re immune when they re not another issue is thattesting positive for the presence of antibodies doesn t mean you have enough antibodies to be immune researchers don t know how many antibodies would confer immunity assuming it does our moon shot vaccine makers go ahead with unproven candidates to meet 2021 goal that experts say may when you say positive what does that mean the lower limit of detection or a high enough level that you re protected what they don t say and they should is does this result mean i m protected poland said it s a difficult discussion because people leap to the idea oh i have antibodies so i m safe but by some of these tests the odds are a flip of a coin that s inherently dangerous many larger institutions including the mayo clinic are now creating their own antibody tests because they ve found others to be unreliable poland said the science has not kept up with the test said dr mary hayden professor of internal medicine and pathology at rush university medical center the tests are out there but we need to do research to understand what the tests mean the world health organization issued a warning friday saying that antibody tests need further validation to determine their accuracy and reliability there is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from covid 19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection the statement said dozens of serology tests have not received fda emergency use authorization and some are falsely marketing themselves as having received authorization according to the fda be aware that not all marketed serological tests have been evaluated by the fda the agency said in a letter to health care providers some firms are falsely claiming that their serological tests are fda approved or authorized or falsely claiming that these tests can diagnose covid 19 the fda said it s working with the national institutes of healthand the centers for disease control and preventionon a validation project to help identify the most promising serological tests on friday a house subcommittee issuedpreliminary findingsof a review of antibody tests and government oversight it said the white house s plans to reopen the u s economy are flawed by their dependence on coronavirus antibody tests which face unanswered scientific questions of utility and accuracy the findings sent to the democratic staff of the subcommittee oneconomic and consumer policy said the fda did not review any coronavirus rapid antibody test kits before they went on the market the oversight gap has allowed manufacturers to make fraudulent claims about their efficacy the memorandum said several companies appeared to have violated fda regulations by offering at home antibody tests and tests outside the purview of certified high complexity labs hahn did not offer a detailed response when asked about the memorandum during a friday evening news conference of the white house coronavirus task force if we re able to test people for antibodies the theory goes we can figure out who is immune and can go back to work or for health care professionals and first responders we can figure out who canstay at work but the questions aboutantibody testing meanwe re not close to that being reality the whole presupposition around the testing is on the one hand they have central importance in reopening and on the other hand there are complete unknowns polandsaid among them is the test accurate what does it mean how long might someone be protected that has a positive test this is all resting on a very shaky foundation he said if antibody tests reveal a communityhas developed herd immunity that s when a large portion of the population becomes immune to a disease or virus inhibiting its spread then states may be able to lift lockdownsand more americans could return to work some argue tolbert g nyenswah senior research associate at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health believes achieving herd immunity in the u s isn t realistic given the size of the population and the relatively small number ofpeople who have recovered from the coronavirus there are about 330 million people in the u s and about 885 000 people have contracted the coronavirus as of friday afternoon according to johns hopkins university some criticize relying on herd immunity because they believe it s a passive solution to the pandemic that could cost more lives and overload the health care system john c welch director of partnerships operations for the massachusetts covid response at partners in health leads astatewide contact tracing effort and has firsthand experience combatting infectious disease such as the ebola epidemic in west africa to talk about herd immunity is sensationally offensive he said herd immunity assumes you re okay with people dying at chicago s innovative express care on the north side dozens of people had lined up in cars and on footby 9 a m to get an antibody test it was 40 degrees and many wore hats and gloves i want to know if i had it because i was sick from november to mid january and so was my entire family said lincoln park resident amber david if it s like most viruses if you get it again it s not as bad that s my thought process i won t be as concerned if i know that i had it i already know what i dealt with so i know my kids didn t end up on a ventilator fellow lincoln park residentnatalie pattersonsaid she had experienced chest pains and a cough at the beginning of march i m hoping that i already had it and recovered put my mind at ease i would have known how my body reacted to it that i already had it and it wasn t terrible she said patterson said she hoped her three kids already contracted the disease too my youngest son has asthma so at this point i kind of hope that he was exposed but had no reaction she said skokie residentken rzepecki said he hopedto get proof of immunity so he could visit his grandchildren i figure it s a walk up test i ll come and get tested and see if that helps me go see the kids he said chicago resident tony unruh said he and his girlfriend were sick in february while visiting colorado they sought the test so they could donate plasma many of the people lined up to get an antibody test were aware of the uncertainties for most apotentially flawed answer was better than nothing at all i figure that it s early and if this test ends up being the one that everybody wants it s better that i got it sooner rather than later patterson said the clinic began offering tests wednesday the online booking system immediately filled up within a day we were booked till may 31st saiddr rahul khare founder and ceo of innovative care the website crashed the clinic completed 150 tests wednesday followed by another 250 thursday khare said innovative care initially said it was using a test by perkinelmer and that it had receivedfda emergency use authorization when usa today pointed out the fda hadn t authorized that test innovative care said it would update its website the lab later said it was actually using a test by abbott labs the fda has not given emergency use authorization to an antibody test made by abbott later friday the company removed any reference to what test it was using contributing kevin
