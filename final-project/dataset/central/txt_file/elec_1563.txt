democratic fundraising dinner on saturday buttigieg is coming under attack from rival candidates for his relative lack of experience updated at 11 42 a m et in the final sprint before tuesday s new hampshire primary democratic presidential candidates are taking a more sharply negative tone about their rivals than they have up until now the top target is former south bend ind mayor pete buttigieg he faced a barrage of attacks as the other democratic candidates seek to blunt his momentum from a strong showing in iowa former vice president joe biden launched the most pointed attacks biden had mostly avoided criticizing his rivals by name before his disappointing fourth place finish in iowa a digital ad launched by biden saturday juxtaposes the former vice president s record with buttigieg s as mayor we re electing a president a narrator says what you ve done matters the ad touts biden s work on the iran nuclear agreement paired with buttigieg loosening regulations on microchips for pets the narrator highlights biden passing the auto bailout and then buttigieg s revitalization of the sidewalks of south bend with decorative brick later during a rare gaggle with reporters biden emphasized the point i do not believe we re a party at risk if they nominate me and i do believe we re a party at risk if we nominate someone who s never held a higher office than mayor of south bend indiana he said when asked whether it was fair to compare his spat with buttigieg with hillary clinton s similar criticism of barack obama in 2008 biden said oh come on man this guy s not barack obama he s right i m not and neither is he pete buttigieg tells jaketapper when asked to respond to joe biden s comment that this guy s not barack obama https t co h9i18w6f1h cnnsotu pic twitter com weqm5sbqdi buttigieg shot back on cnn s state of the union on sunday well he s right buttigieg said i m not obama and neither is he neither is any of us running for president and this isn t 2008 it s 2020 we are in a new moment calling for a different kind of leadership buttigieg s national press secretary chris meagher added in a statement the vice president s decision to run this ad speaks more to where he currently stands in this race than it does about pete s perspective as a mayor and a veteran minnesota sen amy klobuchar who s eager to gain support from the kind of moderate voters who back buttigieg also piled on with criticisms of buttigieg s experience we have a newcomer in the white house and look where it got us she said on the debate stage friday night i think having some experience is a good thing buttigieg didn t shy away from his own criticisms of other candidates taking subtle digs at sen bernie sanders with whom he s locked in a virtual tie for first place in iowa i don t think we can take the risk of excluding anybody from this effort of saying that if you re not either for a revolution or a status quo then you don t fit i think we re going to defeat this president by inviting everybody to be at our side and get this done together buttigieg said sanders swiped back at buttigieg during a rally in dover on saturday billionaires by the dozen are contributing to pete buttigieg s campaign sanders said now i like pete he s a smart guy he s a nice guy but if we are serious about political change in america that change is not going to be coming from somebody who gets a lot of money from the ceos of the pharmaceutical industry buttigieg defended himself on this charge as well during the cnn interview saying i m not a fan of the current campaign finance system but i m also insistent that we ve got to go into this with all the support we can get to help make his point buttigieg cited how much money president trump s re election campaign has raised biden has also gone after sanders saying the vermont senator s self avowed democratic socialism would make it hard to expand his base of support sanders responded on fox news sunday pivoting to discuss the tax breaks trump himself got as a businessman and the corporate subsidies the federal government hands out to big companies bernie sanders reacts to jabs from president trump and joe biden on his self proclaimed label of democratic socialist fns foxnews pic twitter com y5obzwdcag the difference between my socialism and trump s socialism sanders said is i believe the government should help working families not billionaires sen elizabeth warren is looking to improve on her third place finish in iowa but unlike some of her rivals she s mainly stuck with a positive message so far and stayed out of the fray seeking to position herself as a unifying candidate she did respond though when asked on abc s this week about buttigieg s fundraising she like sanders is not accepting big money contributions sen elizabeth warren responds to pete buttigieg who defended taking money from billionaires saying you need to build the biggest coalition you can the coalition of
