after a tense start on tuesday to the senate judiciary committee s confirmation hearing for supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh utah senator mike lee used his introductory remarks to offer a history lesson as he explained the inquisition to which nominees are now subjected is a result of a process that has evolved over many decades there s nothing in the constitution that says nominees must testify at their hearings or that hearings have to take place at all the senate could just vote but these days they don t and there are several important reasons why the only thing the constitution is clear about is that the public shouldn t have the final vote on these nominees for the people at large to hold the power of appointment would be impracticable alexander hamilton wrote in federalist paper 76 so article ii section ii of constitution says the president shall nominate the justices by and with the advice and consent of the senate at the time state legislatures chose u s senators so the selection process was even further removed from the passions of the people but for a long time that advice and consent took place largely without any grilling of nominees if you were uncontroversial you didn t get a hearing says paul m collins jr co author of supreme court confirmation hearings and constitutional change hearings were held behind closed doors and only outside witnesses would testify according to research by collins and law professor lori ringhand the first hearing of a nominee took place in 1873 and forced president ulysses s grant to withdraw a nominee attorney general george h williams over a probe into his use of department of justice funds for household expenses the first hearing that was open to the public took place in 1916 over president woodrow wilson s nominee louis brandeis prompted both by anti semitism and brandeis reputation as the people s lawyer for his public interest work brandeis refused to testify and the committee deliberated for four months before he was confirmed 47 22 there was also a hearing in 1922 over pierce butler who was also confirmed 61 8 without testifying over allegations of professional misconduct in 1925 harlan fiske stone became the first nominee to testify before the judiciary committee which had been established in 1816 and was questioned about his role in the teapot dome scandal that hearing was closed to the public and the senate swiftly confirmed him 71 6 by the mid 30s it was still seen as a courtesy to a nominee often a rather august personage already to spare him from a hearing after all hearings were tied to scandals even when a hearing did happen the nominees did not always appear in person the situation began to change after a different kind of scandal reshaped many americans thinking about the process this time the confirmation itself was the problem about a month after the senate voted to confirm supreme court justice hugo black 63 16 after five days of deliberation and no public hearings on the nomination the pittsburgh post gazette broke the news that he was a member of the ku klux klan it was what time called the prize political scandal of the year president franklin delano roosevelt who had nominated black claimed this was news to him as well when felix frankfurter was nominated in 1939 the senate was trying to avoid another hugo black controversy as sen lee pointed out on tuesday they were also concerned because frankfurter was born outside the u s and had written about the treatment of anarchists in the court system the senate opened up frankfurter s hearing to the public so that frankfurter would be scrutinized thoroughly in light of criticism of the senate s speedy confirmation of black according to the jan 8 1939 edition of the new york times small well brushed and jaunty his pince nez sparkling in 40 flashlights he appeared time noted that week after the senate decided to summon him in person the audience could not have been bigger or more enthusiastic had he been shirley temple with some acerbity he questioned the propriety of senators publicly examining a nominee for the nation s highest court frankfurter responded fiercely to doubts about his patriotism and was quickly confirmed and yet the idea that public questioning was an insult clearly remained not long after however many americans would realize to a new extent just how much the make up of the supreme court could affect their own lives at the heart of that realization was one important case the landmark 1954 brown v board of education case in which the supreme court ruled against school segregation when john marshall harlan ii was being considered for the supreme court in 1955 it was already clear that the nation was split over the court concern over who sat on the nation s highest court and what future justices might rule skyrocketed especially in the south that s when people really began to notice the supreme court playing a larger role in americans lives says justin wedeking co author of supreme court confirmation hearings in the u s senate reconsidering the charade ever since harlan confirmation hearings have been a key part of the process in harlan s case as time argued there was an extra layer to that interest his grandfather had been the sole dissenter in plessy v ferguson the 1896 case that upheld the constitutionality of separate but equal facilities the logic of which was overturned by brown but the brown decision and its backlash would also play a central role in the confirmation process for potter stewart in 1959 in their frequent irritation at supreme court decisions some senators cannot resist the temptation to make court appointees squirm time noted though this predated ruth bader ginsburg s time on the bench stewart evoked the so called ginsburg rule and refused to answer questions that might affect future cases the senate confirmed stewart 70 17 race would also play a role though differently in the 69 11 confirmation of thurgood marshall who would in 1967 become the court s first african american justice marshall was peppered with hundreds of questions on arcane facts to the extent that time compared the hearing to a scene that might have been a southern county courthouse in the bad old days with a white registrar administering a literacy test designed to confound even the best educated negro as tv news coverage of nominations increased these fraught hearings rose to a new level of spectacle congressional inquiries were starting to be nationally televised at this time says barbara perry the director of presidential studies at the university of virginia s miller center of public affairs speaking to time as part of a presidential history partnership between time history and the miller center as events such as the 1954 army mccarthy hearings drew national attention to what could be seen of washington on television that interest eventually spread to television an trend that reached fruition in 1981 when sandra day o connor s hearings were broadcast klieg lights and cameras bring out the senatorial urge to hear the satisfying sound of one s own voice time reported back then the rambling inquiries directed at o connor often seemed designed less to elucidate her judicial philosophy and qualifications than to give the questioner an opportunity to state one of his own pet political positions that opportunity was one senators didn t want to pass up and the national spotlight raised the stakes for them and as a result changed the tone of the hearings i think most americans would be shocked to learn that prior to 1981 it was rare to get half of the committee to show up and ask questions says wedeking tv gave them a huge incentive to show up you have almost 100 participation in hearings from o connor onward and while the founders may not have wanted to give the people the power to directly confirm supreme court justices citizens have found ways to influence the nomination selection and confirmation process from the outside liberal interest groups played a key role in the rejection of reagan s nominee robert bork while setting a precedent for future exchanges over ideology in future hearings conservative interest groups provided a lists of possible nominees including kavanaugh to president trump since before he was even elected tensions were high back then because bork would be playing a historic role in the court filling what had been a swing seat and kavanaugh is in the same position today in the 21st century as the polarized political climate is amplified by live cable tv and social media it s hard to imagine a time without confirmation hearings as the senate s power to vote on supreme court nominees is deemed especially vital so there s no question about the senate s role in checking presidential power but lots of questions about how kavanaugh would rule on cases involving checks on presidential power write to olivia b waxman at olivia waxman time com
