5 min read new york reuters the democratic party will officially nominate a 2020 presidential candidate at its convention next july but not before a long primary season that kicks off with the iowa caucuses in february and ends with the puerto rican primary in june the goal for candidates amass on a state by state basis the 1 885 delegates needed to be nominated on the first ballot at the convention in milwaukee a candidate must get at least 15 of the vote statewide or in an individual congressional district to be awarded delegates the nominating contest will be much different this time around after democrats made changes aimed at increasing participation and ensuring transparency here are some key changes explained for a graphic on the delegate race see tmsnrt rs 37bdd2f in 2020 democrats will hold caucuses in iowa nevada north dakota and wyoming far fewer than the 18 conducted in states and territories in the 2016 campaign caucuses require voters to attend a meeting for several hours and vote in the open by raising their hand or gathering with fellow supporters the process has been criticized as undemocratic because it can dampen participation and is subject to intimidation the caucus system favors candidates with a strong active base instead of broader support u s senator bernie sanders of vermont for example significantly outperformed his rival hillary clinton in caucuses in the 2016 campaign the remaining states will hold primaries this cycle in primaries voters show up to their polling place and check the box for the candidate of their choice traditionally candidates focused on iowa and new hampshire in the early parts of the campaign season hoping a victory in either of those two states or both would jumpstart their campaign and clear the field but california has moved its 2020 primary from early june to super tuesday on march 3 with texas already on the super tuesday calendar the switch means the nation s two most populous states both with large hispanic populations will vote on the same day under mail in voting provisions california voters can begin casting their ballots on feb 3 the same day as iowa s first in the nation caucuses texas voters can begin voting under new rules meant to increase access on feb 18 early voting and a reshuffling of the primary calendar will diminish the power of tiny and homogeneous early states in favor of much larger and more diverse battlefields now candidates will need to spend more money on political advertising and make more trips to big ticket states as a result campaigns with deeper resources have begun organizing operations in california much sooner than normal when can we expect a clear front runner in past elections success in iowa and new hampshire was a good predictor of success in the primary conversely a poor showing in those states forced candidates to bow out of the campaign but maybe not in 2020 the large field of candidates combined with the new front loaded calendar means more candidates are likely to hang around if they can afford it at least until march 3 when california and texas weigh in on super tuesday six of the 16 most populous states will be among the nine to hold primaries on super tuesday meaning nearly 30 of the u s population will have a chance to get in on picking the presidential candidates by the end of march elections covering well over 50 of the party s delegates will have taken place the large pool of candidates could also mean the primary stays competitive into the early summer potentially forcing a contested convention superdelegates are elected democratic officeholders who are part of each state s delegation but are not committed to vote based on the outcome of the state s nominating contest all democratic members of congress and state governors are superdelegates in 2016 many superdelegates announced early support for clinton drawing criticism that the party was tipping the scales in her favor superdelegateshaven t been eliminated in 2020 but new rules limit their influence this cycle they will likely not vote on the first ballot at the convention to win on the first ballot the front runner must secure the majority of the party s 3 768 pledged delegates available during the nominating contests leading up to the democratic convention if the front runner has fewer than 1 885 delegates the convention will hold a second vote on subsequent ballots all delegates become unpledged and superdelegates can also vote then a majority of all 4 532 delegates will be needed to secure the nomination if a candidate wins a supermajority of pledged delegates or about 2 267 then superdelegates are permitted to vote on the first ballot reporting by jarrett renshaw editing by colleen jenkins and nick zieminski all quotes delayed a minimum of 15 minutes see here for a complete list of exchanges and delays 2020 reuters all rights reserved
