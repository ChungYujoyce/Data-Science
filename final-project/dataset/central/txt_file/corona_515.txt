 ro nguyen thought it would play out differently the 30 year old had just watched a movie at a streeterville cinema with a friend on march 12 and was strolling down east grand avenue around 8 p m the two of them marveling at the deserted streets as they headed toward the red line station nguyen said a man walking nearby saw them and yelled out f china then the man spat on nguyen he said the saliva splattered on his jacket nguyen who is of vietnamese and filipino descent had imagined this moment having read news stories about harassment and attacks against asians as coronavirus cases rose he wondered if he would be next if he was he thought he would take a stand on behalf of himself and other asians but as he wiped the spit off with his sleeve he and his friend of south asian descent hurried away without a word to the assailant in that instance i was just kind of shocked or dumbfounded of what occurred nguyen said nguyen worries that east asians in the united states will face even more harassment and attacks as coronavirus cases continue to rise he said he believes president donald trump stoked such hate filled reaction during a news briefing last week when he defended his use of chinese virus it s not racist at all trump said i think they probably would agree with it 100 it comes from china he also said he was using the expression to fight back against beijing officials who were blaming the u s military for the introduction of the disease the world health organization has recommended people use coronavirus or covid 19 stating that other characterizations spread negative stereotypes on monday trump appeared to walk back his earlier position using the word coronavirus and stressing it was important to totally protect our asian american community yes it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the asian americans in our country he admitted i don t like that at all these are incredible people they love our country and i m not going to let it happen but nguyen fears it s too late since the president and other politicians first used the term nguyen and other asians in chicago said they have felt growing apprehension that people take the president s comments as a license for racism elsewhere in the u s reports of hate crimes have cropped up from new york to san francisco some caught on video and circulated through social media in california s san fernando valley a 16 year old was sent to the emergency room after being beat up and accused of having the coronavirus at his high school cbs news reported it s outrageous said state rep theresa mah from the 2nd district which includes chicago s chinatown chinese americans and constituents of mine understand this is a situation in which they could potentially be scapegoats for the uncertainty people feel mabel menard was sitting alone at her favorite neighborhood tavern in old town earlier this month when she noticed an unfamiliar face a man very intoxicated made eye contact with her and said do you have the corona menard a 58 year old chinese american said she didn t think twice before quipping i m having a wine the bar s staff kicked the man out i kind of thought he was an idiot menard said that s the kind of mentality that you walk around with thinking that you re better than anybody else and the way to make you feel better is to be nasty to other people i think that s pretty sad tuyet anh 20 said she was sitting alone on a red line train one day late in february headed south from lakeview to depaul university where she is a junior when she noticed two men whispering got to get our masks on one of them said tuyet anh who did not want her last name used looked away one of the men wondered aloud oh do you think she heard us i felt at first just very shocked tuyet anh said really someone would say that but then processing it more i just felt a little nervous and that feeling of being under surveillance almost tuyet anh who is of vietnamese descent has since been saddened to read social media comments from her fellow classmates using the terms chinese virus and wu flu she wasn t surprised given that the first phrase was picked up by trump it makes me and other asian americans feel as if we are the virus tuyet anh said we are labeled and demonized as this threat to white american safety menard president of chicago s chapter of the advocacy group oca asian pacific american advocates said the tense environment reminds her of the 1882 chinese exclusion act barring chinese immigrants from entering the country the first immigration law to exclude an ethnic group as well as the world war ii japanese internment camps forcing japanese americans into incarceration history is repeating itself menard said if we looked at the history of asian americans in the u s we ve always been either held up as a model minority that despite the discrimination we re still doing well or we re demonized because when something like this happens it s all our fault asian american organizations last week launched the washthehate campaign on social media highlighting stories of coronavirus related racism the asian pacific policy and planning council and chinese for affirmative action groups also started collecting reports of incidents of hostility against asians in less than a week more than 400 reports surfaced said the council s executive director manjusha kulkarni but chicago police say they have not seen an increase in hate crimes against people of asian descent there is absolutely no place in chicago for hatred or bigotry of any kind police spokesman anthony guglielmi said we strongly urge anyone who may be a victim of threatening or harassing behavior to contact chicago police as we will investigate and work with our partners to prosecute these acts the last hour before illinois statewide stay at home order mandating the closure of nonessential stores the dongs were in their family owned bonsai and restaurant supply store q ideas at 1134 w argyle st like many shops on the colorful street known as little vietnam q ideas had its doors open on saturday ready for customers but they did not come oh my god it s been nothing said ellen dong 29 dong who is chinese and vietnamese wonders whether the rhetoric against china has curbed business on argyle and in chinatown i m really concerned that people are going to lose their jobs though chicagoans led efforts to draw customers through a restaurant crawl in chinatown business owners saw steep declines the past few months compounded by the governor s order to close all restaurants for dining in for the dongs this year has encapsulated the long standing paradox of being asian american of both being invisible blending in the background and still being alien in the eyes of others asian americans are forgotten until and i don t know why until there s something to blame ellen dong said then we remember them ayin chicagotribune com
