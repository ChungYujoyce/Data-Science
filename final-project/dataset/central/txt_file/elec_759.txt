ferocious attacks against the 76 year old s record on civil rights immigration and health care portends the fights ahead biden s rivals view him as a rickety front runner who will at some point collapse under pressure but that hasn t happened yet and team biden feels the former vice president weathered a major test this week steadying his candidacy after a poor first debate performance raised questions about whether he could rise to the challenge biden is dominating the field with older voters and black democrats two constituencies critical to the primary and general election the

reporters in the street on thursday projecting confidence and expressing surprise at what he characterized as attacks on president obama s record biden has tied himself closely to obama and the media

ease in public on thursday was in contrast to his occasional struggles on the debate stage in getting his sentences out his age betrayed him last night said brad bannon a democratic strategist biden s backers acknowledge that his performance was choppy at times but they say his fumbling such as an awkward closing remark in which he gave the wrong numbers for supporters to text were driven more by his aides seeking to keep him tightly scripted allies say that biden even if he s prone to gaffes during moments of loquaciousness is far more resonant when he s speaking from the heart you could tell that every stuttering moment or flubbed line came when he was thinking about the canned lines one of his advisers fed him said one democratic strategist who supports biden the version of biden that wins and becomes the nominee is the one who shoots from the hip supporters noted that some of his best moments from wednesday s debate came when he reacted instinctively pointing to his dismissal of

see one of their own take him down joe biden is failing and his inability to take responsibility for his past actions puts him out of step with where the party is today said neil sroka a strategist for the progressive group democracy for america hands down bernie sanders and elizabeth warren won the debate series in detroit their growth and strength of support is more the story for me than the degree to which biden s is hanging on to his status as a weakened front runner several democrats reached by the hill mentioned warren as a real potential threat to him down the stretch and there are some fears among biden s supporters that the sustained attacks against him will at some point wear him down but there are no signs yet that anyone is making a serious run at biden it is hard to see a 3 way race between biden warren and sanders if liberals are splitting their support as they are now those dynamics have helped biden maintain a healthy lead over the field and weather the rocky days in between the first two debates there was relief among biden s supporters that the centrist candidates defended him and his policies and hope that when some of those candidates drop out they ll become effective surrogates for the biden campaign biden didn t put everyone else out of the game but he steadied the ship after the first debate said democratic strategist eddie vale shows he was ready to fight and mix it up so i think it remains to be seen what that translates into the polls but he definitely steadied himself and now needs to keep having good performances out on the trail and
