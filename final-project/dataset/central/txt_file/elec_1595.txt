republican side pence has been governor of indiana since 2013 before that he served six terms in the u s house of representatives house speaker paul ryan has called pence a good movement conservative and considers him a good friend i ve very high regard for him ryan said when pence was chosen as trump s running mate an indicator that putting pence on the ticket might have been an olive branch from the trump campaign to more traditional conservatives here are five other things to know about gov pence ahead of tuesday s debate pence is a born again christian he became one in college and has put his religion in the foreground of his political persona for me it all begins with faith it begins with what matters most and i try and put what i believe to be moral truth first my philosophy of government second and my politics third pence said in a 2010 appearance on the christian broadcasting network and religion has indeed played a large part in his policy decisions one notable example is his strong opposition to abortion while serving in the house in 2011 he introduced an amendment to defund planned parenthood because the women s health organization provides abortion services this march as governor of indiana pence signed one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country the law bans abortions due to fetal abnormalities and also requires aborted fetuses and those from miscarriage to be buried or cremated women in indiana protested the law by calling or tweeting at the governor s office to tell him about their periods in an effort dubbed periods for pence trump and pence while different in temperament have something in common both men have hosted tv shows in the 1990s pence hosted a sunday tv show in indianapolis and also had a radio talk show called the mike pence show he described himself as rush limbaugh on decaf meaning while a conservative he was not as bombastic as the popular limbaugh who hosts his own talk show on his show pence discussed the week s news and also his conservative values in a video from 1997 published this year by politico pence discussed kelly flinn who was the country s first female b 52 pilot she had just been discharged from the air force for disobeying an order to end an affair and for lying under oath about doing so on the show pence discussed the normalization of adultery and whether or not it was time to rethink this whole business of women in the military after losing early campaigns for congress pence wrote an essay apologizing for running negative ads against an opponent rep phillip sharp the indianapolis star has reported pence swore off harsh political tactics in the essay pence called for basic human decency in july pence and trump sat down for a joint interview on cbs 60 minutes interviewer lesley stahl asked pence how he felt about some of trump s attacks on his opponents specifically referencing lyin ted trump s nickname for his last standing primary opponent texas sen ted cruz pence replied in the essay that i wrote a long time ago i said campaigns ought to be about something more important than just one candidate s election and and this campaign and donald trump s candidacy has been about the issues the american people care about trump added that the two men are different people and he doesn t ask pence to be negative it s probably obvious to people that our styles are different but i promise you our vision is exactly the same pence added in 2015 he signed into law a controversial religious freedom bill which spurred wide backlash critics said the bill could allow business owners to ban lgbt customers based on a claim of religious freedom after business civic and sports leaders strongly called for a fix to the legislation usa today noted pence later signed a revised version of the law but pence appeared to back the bill in an interview on fox in march 2015 well let me say first and foremost i stand by this law he said but i understand that the way that some on the left and frankly some in the national media have mischaracterized this law over the last week might make it necessary for us to clarify the law through legislation and we were working through the day and into the night last night with legislative leaders to consider ways to do that although his running mate has denied his own early support of the iraq war pence was in congress at the time and voted in favor of authorizing the use of force in iraq in a 2002 interview with cnn leading up to the vote pence emphasized that there was overwhelming evidence to suggest a connection between iraq and al qaeda which ended up not being the case when trump was asked for his opinion on pence s 2002 vote on 60 minutes he answered he s entitled to make a mistake every once in awhile when pence was asked on fox news this year about the vote he said i think that s for historians to debate i supported president bush s decision to go into iraq as well as to go into afghanistan i traveled downrange for 10 years in a row to visit our soldiers in operation enduring freedom and operation iraqi freedom i stood strongly through both of them npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
