when someone has been in public life as long as joe biden critics and challengers on the campaign trail have ample material to pick apart for political advantage there is no doubt that during his nearly half century in congress and the white house biden has made his share of blunders and faux pas the majority of which were relatively minor or even humorous however recent allegations that biden bears responsibility for the nation s mass incarceration problem is not only inaccurate but downright insulting to a man who has distinguished himself as one of the most progressive federal lawmakers in terms of criminal justice policy the years leading up to the much discussed 1994 crime bill were challenging to say the least with violent crime rates soaring to record levels from 1990 through 1993 for example nearly 100 000americans were murdered two thirds by guns more thanin any other similar time span before or after something had to be done and biden had the political will and skill to translate good ideas into effective policy read more commentary don t underestimate joe biden he knows what america needs and how to get it done trump era america needs biden s campaign even if he doesn t win the democratic nomination joe biden s 2020 nightmare he could be the democratic reincarnation of jeb bush as early as 1990 biden as chair of the senate judiciary committee recognized and responded to the growing crisis by holding hearings on the nation s homicide epidemic in his introductory remarks he talked of the 3 ds deadly weapons drugs and demographics biden s observations were spot on the surge in homicide at that time was exclusively among teens and young adults completely gun related and linked to the emerging crack cocaine markets in major cities from new york to los angeles while the subsequent concern for sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine was legitimate it was crack not powder that drove the crime surge some three decades ago biden s approach was clearly more preventative than punitive at the 1990 hearing for example he called for investing in drug education for youth and drug treatment for addicts in contrast sen alan spector the ranking republican on the judiciary committee argued instead for tougher prosecution and expanding the death penalty while it is true that biden had a major hand in crafting the crime bill his was not the only one as passage of the massive piece of legislation required bipartisan support and thus much compromise reflecting biden s influence the final version of the crime bill included over 7 billionfora basket of prevention programs however once republicans took control of congress in the 1994 midterms it became more like a trash basket of prevention the republican contract with america set a new path shifting the emphasis from early prevention to harsh punishment the contract promised an anti crime package including stronger truth in sentencing good faith exclusionary rule exemptions effective death penalty provisions and cuts in social spending from this summer s crime bill to fund prison construction and additional law enforcement to keep people secure in their neighborhoods and kids safe in their schools it had become a political liability to advocate prevention whatever share of responsibility that biden may own for the growth in prison populations over the next decade or more he should be praised for hiscentral role in pushing legislation that saved thousands of lives he was instrumental in helping to get the brady law through congress after which the nation s rate of gun homicide started its long term slide he was the chief proponent and author of the violence against women act an initiative that helpedlower the rateof womenmurdered by their intimate partners by more than 25 in subsequent years the streets of american cities are much safer today than a quarter century ago before wide ranging changes in federal crime control policy were enacted taken together joe biden deserves credit not criticism for all that he has done throughout this career to reduce the number of crime victims and for providing assistance to those unfortunate to become one james alan fox is the lipman professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university a member of usa today s board of contributors and co author of the will to kill making sense of senseless murder follow him on twitter jamesalanfox
