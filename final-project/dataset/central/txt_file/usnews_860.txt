joe biden has hit his stride after a stumbling start to the democratic presidential contest the former vice president is heading into saturday s south carolina primary loose scrappy and running in front polls show him ahead fundraising is suddenly coming easily and his crowds are matching those of his rivals the difference is showing in biden himself he is enjoying the day to day grind of a campaign and has shed worries that he would disappoint his longtime advisers and family watching him on the ground here in first in the south contest two questions jump out what changed and is it too late biden s rebound wasn t plotted on conference calls or in focus groups most of the turnaround has taken place in his head he is on familiar ground both physically and politically he has spent so much time in south carolina over the years aides don t need to tell him the distance to the next stop that familiarity has led biden to relax and stop fretting about the tiny details of his performances last year for example complaints about his non sexual physicality were a dull hum in the back of his mind every time someone approached for an embrace by the time entertainer vivica a fox went in for a hug on stage here in conway s c on thursday evening biden just went for it and held her close but time is short absent a convincing win saturday in south carolina biden limps into the march 3 contests on super tuesday still struggling to look like his party s leader last weekend s second place finish in nevada s caucuses followed a fourth in iowa and a fifth in new hampshire even a victory here would leave mere days to translate momentum into super tuesday s races having gone all in for south carolina it s not clear his campaign can pivot elsewhere and after tuesday almost 40 of the delegates will have been claimed aides say they have a plan they are hoping a media driven comeback narrative will give him a boost everywhere on super tuesday they then hope to build an on the ground effort for states that vote on march 10 and say that volunteers have finally figured out how to harness the power of the democratic national committee supported organizing tools but the fact is just getting to this point has been a struggle biden had staked his fortunes on african american voters here in a state where two thirds of the democratic primary electorate is expected to be black he campaigned as barack obama s faithful understudy and suggested that the only reason obama won the white house in 2008 was because biden delivered the white working class voters of pennsylvania biden dinged sanders as insufficiently pro obama and said he was ready to mount a primary against them in 2012 in his appearances biden credited the civil rights movement as his gateway into politics and a gig as a public defender as more rewarding than the white shoe law firm he left to do it at the same time the money rolled in a solid debate performance on tuesday let him cash in a 1 million day of fundraising on wednesday and after an unscripted and genuine cnn town hall that evening donations continued to flow overall the pro biden super pac has pocketed more than 3 million this week and has started booking a little airtime in north carolina and alabama for super tuesday d tente has taken hold among the democrats who fear sen bernie sanders could win the nomination allowing biden to avoid criticism from his peers who instead have trained their aggression on sanders on wednesday james clyburn the top black democrat in the house and south carolina s most important kingmaker threw his backing biden s way and cemented a likely insurmountable leg up recognizing the potency of the clyburn endorsement the biden political hands started to roll out endorsements that were expected to resonate with black and brown voters in north carolina the biden team announced the backing of reps g k butterfield and alma adams in texas biden picked up support from rep sylvia garcia sen tim kaine of virginia the democrats vice presidential nominee in 2016 also joined the biden efforts that s not to say biden is suddenly flawless he still is a meandering storyteller who has his verbal ticks that help him power through a lifelong stutter he wanders around stages like a las vegas headliner and knows his answers go too long at the town hall on wednesday he apologized to his host for aimlessly engaging in free association observations still though he managed to win over at least two members of that audience who walked into the theater undecided asked questions and left as members of team joe the question is whether it will be enough to derail sanders who has the steam at this point sanders won more voters but not delegates than anyone in iowa the vermonter then handily won neighboring new hampshire s primary and nevada s caucuses most anticipate a strong second place showing in south carolina and starting tuesday billionaire mike bloomberg starts appearing on the ballots and as helpful as the 3 8 million the biden super pac spent in january was it s impossible to go dollar for dollar with bloomberg s fortune biden is hoping momentum can blunt money polls do show biden with a safe and perhaps widening advantage in south carolina on the eve of the primary biden had held onto the top spot in all 34 of south carolina polls tracked by real clear politics one of them emerson college s survey released thursday showed biden up by 16 points numbers aside the results are a joyful biden sure he sometimes shouts into the microphone but that s mostly in disgust about president donald trump unlike a campaign that felt like dutiful chores in iowa and his eat your vegetables sequel in new hampshire biden in south carolina seems to be fully engaged in the task at hand and more comfortable here among old friends for the first time in this campaign appears to be sincerely happy that he decided to run whatever the result on saturday at least he has that write
