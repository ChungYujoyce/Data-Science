lists vary from place to place with some surprising businesses being allowed to remain open two of the most debated businesses that have been deemed essential in some places are marijuana dispensaries and gun shops several states have allowed all pot retailers to stay open while others are allowing sales only for medicinal use gun stores have been shuttered in a handful of states and in others they

themselves should police forces experience any disruption because of the pandemic like marijuana there are also concerns that shutting down legal retailers could lead to guns being sold on the black
