and drug administration fda approved drugs for covid 19 however an array of drugs approved for other indications as well as multiple investigational agents are being studied for the treatment of covid 19 in several hundred clinical trials around the globe these trials can be accessed at clinicaltrials gov in addition providers can access and prescribe investigational drugs or agents approved or licensed for other indications through various mechanisms including emergency use authorizations eua emergency investigational new drug eind applications compassionate use or expanded access programs with drug manufacturers and or off label use for this reason whenever possible the panel recommends that promising unapproved or unlicensed treatments for covid 19 be studied in well designed controlled clinical trials this includes drugs that have been approved or licensed for other indications the panel recognizes the critical importance of clinical research in generating evidence to address unanswered questions regarding the safety and efficacy of potential treatments for covid 19 however the panel also realizes that many patients and providers who cannot access such trials are still seeking guidance about whether to use these agents finally it is important to stress that the rated treatment recommendations in these guidelines should not be considered mandates the choice of
