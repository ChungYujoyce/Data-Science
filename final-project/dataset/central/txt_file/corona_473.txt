state and give them to harder hit areas amid a deepening crisis top health official dr anthony fauci has said he believes all states should issue stay at home orders i don t understand why that s not happening dr fauci told cnn on thursday if you look at what s going on in this country i just don t understand why we re not doing that you ve got to put your foot on the accelerator to bring that number down he added referring to infection and death rates the comments from dr fauci who heads the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases appeared to contradict those of president trump who has consistently dismissed the notion of a nationwide lockdown it s awfully tough to say close it down we have to have a little bit of flexibility mr trump said on wednesday new york state remains the epicentre of the us coronavirus outbreak with at least 102 863 positive cases the more than 500 person spike in deaths state wide over the past day is more than half of that reported in a single day in both spain and italy the countries with greatest fatalities new york city is the worst hit area of the state with 1 562 deaths johns hopkins university reports mr cuomo warned on friday that people would die unnecessarily because of a lack of equipment in the areas most devastated by the outbreak the governor said he would deploy the national guard to enforce a new executive order

either receive their supplies back or be reimbursed he said i m not going to let people die mr cuomo said of the order mr cuomo said this week that new york will need nearly 37 000 ventilators for the apex of the state s outbreak expected to hit at the end of april bill de blasio the new york city mayor said the metropolis needs 400 additional ventilators by sunday both the us centers for disease control cdc and the world health organization who are reassessing their guidance on face masks as experts race to find ways to fight the highly contagious virus covid 19 is carried in airborne droplets from people coughing or sneezing but there is some dispute over how far people should distance themselves from each other and whether masks are useful when used by the public the who advises that ordinary face masks are only effective if combined with careful hand washing and social distancing and so far it does not recommend them generally for healthy people however more and more health experts now say there are benefits they argue that the public use of masks can primarily help by preventing asymptomatic patients people who have been infected with covid 19 but are not aware and not displaying any symptoms from unknowingly spreading the virus to others masks may also help lower the risk of individuals catching the virus through the droplets from another person s sneeze or a cough and people can be taught how put masks on and take them off correctly they argue on thursday new york mayor bill de blasio urged all new yorkers to cover their faces when outside and near others but not to use surgical masks which are in short supply it could be a scarf it could be something you create yourself at home it could be a bandana he said governor cuomo weighed in on friday saying i think it s fair to say that the masks couldn t hurt unless they gave you a false sense of security meanwhile residents in laredo texas will now face a 1 000 816 fine if they fail to cover their noses and mouths while outside after city officials issued an emergency ordinance to its approximately 250 000 residents this week dr deborah birx one of president trump s coronavirus advisers expressed caution about general mask wearing we don t want people to get an artificial sense of protection she said they re an additive there is also disagreement among experts over the benefits of using cloth masks european advisers say reusable cloth masks are not recommended and may even increase the chance of infection at least 297 million americans in 38 states the district of columbia and puerto rico have been told to stay home but the governors of 10 states have so far stopped short of asking all residents to remain indoors north dakota south dakota arkansas iowa and nebraska so far have no state wide order urging people inside a targeted approach is what is working for us in arkansas said governor asa hutchinson this week people are misled by this idea that this stay at home order is magical iowa governor kim reynolds has argued i can t lock the state down i can t lock everybody in their home other states have left the decision to local officials while still refraining from any state wide action residents in parts of alabama missouri oklahoma south carolina texas utah and wyoming face some degree of stay home orders issued by local authorities our state is so diverse every segment of the state is different said missouri governor mike parsons this week defending his reticence to take such action it s very difficult sometimes to just put a blanket order in place y all we are not
