getty images hide caption jeb bush reacts as he announces the suspension of his presidential campaign during an election night party at the hilton columbia center on feb 20 in columbia south carolina saturday night was a great time for victory speeches the winners in nevada and south carolina each gave one some of the losers did too two candidates who had been fading in the latest polls came back to win and crow about it several others who fell short of their hopes still claimed to have exceeded expectations and on the republican side even the fifth and sixth place finishers claimed to find encouragement to continue their quests but after many months of campaigning led up to the first three voting events the next 10 days will bring more than a dozen states where candidates have not been able to spend extensive time campaigning those next 10 days may well decide which of these confident saturday night pronouncements were specious and which lead on to success at the party conventions in july who really won donald trump was the only candidate over 30 percent in south carolina the state where the gop primary has picked eight of the party s last nine nominees although trump s huge lead in the polls shrank a bit in the late going he still won by double digits over the last two senators in the race marco rubio and ted cruz who were locked in a virtual tie republican donald trump won in south carolina by double digits over sens marco rubio and ted cruz who were locked in a virtual tie spencer platt getty images hide caption republican donald trump won in south carolina by double digits over sens marco rubio and ted cruz who were locked in a virtual tie trump gave an expansive and triumphant speech even passing the mic around to family members and why not trump has now erased memories of the speed bump he hit in iowa on feb 1 and in his victory speech he returned to his theme of winning and to the immigration issue that has been his lodestar since entering the race we will build a wall and who s gonna pay for it trump shouted mexico screamed the crowd trump said he had met with a delegation from mexico who said their country was not at all interested in paying for any wall guess what trump shot back that wall just got 10 feet higher the crowd loved it on the democratic side hillary clinton finished about 5 5 points ahead of bernie sanders it was an underwhelming margin when compared with her big edge in the polls here last year on the other hand it was a most welcome relief after the drubbing clinton took in new hampshire on feb 9 winning on saturday was also a relief because nevada experts had refused to pick a winner here as the caucuses began on saturday the uncertainty on caucus day made her eventual win and modest margin look a lot better democratic presidential candidate former secretary of state hillary clinton greets supporters during a caucus day event at caesers palace on february 20 in las vegas nevada justin sullivan getty images hide caption democratic presidential candidate former secretary of state hillary clinton greets supporters during a caucus day event at caesers palace on february 20 in las vegas nevada you could say clinton benefited from her lowered expectations here and she herself hit that note at the start in her remarks some may have doubted us but we never doubted each other she said and she proceeded to detail her appeals and plans for the voters who had largely rejected her in the voting in three states so far white working class males and young voters of all races and both genders we re going to build ladders of opportunity in their place so every american can go as far as your hard work can take you clinton said this is your campaign and it is a campaign to break down every barrier that holds you back who acted like winners anyway but if trump and clinton spoke to the winning occasion others did as well after losing by a hair s breadth in iowa this month sanders took the stage to talk about how far he had been behind in that state last summer after a smashing win in new hampshire sanders took the stage to assay the same theme and he did so a third time in las vegas saturday night democratic presidential candidate sen bernie sanders reacts to the crowd as he arrives at the henderson pavilion to give a concession speech on feb 20 in henderson nevada ethan miller getty images hide caption democratic presidential candidate sen bernie sanders reacts to the crowd as he arrives at the henderson pavilion to give a concession speech on feb 20 in henderson nevada we have come a very long way in nine months it is clear to me and i think most observers that the wind is on at our backs sanders said we have the momentum and i believe i believe that when democrats assemble in philadelphia in july at that convention we are going to see the results of one of the great political upsets in the history of the united states cynics may ask how long sanders can make a mantra of comparing his vote totals to his awful poll numbers from last year but his message about rising inequality still has much of its magic and it has greater force when one notes sanders reported raising 21 million in the most recent filing period clinton managed only 15 million in the same period on saturday sanders reprised his eye popping performance among millennials who again gave him more than 80 percent of their votes but the younger voters were outpolled in nevada by those over 45 the middle aged and older voters preferred clinton especially those over 65 clinton also tallied nearly 60 percent among those who identified as democrats sanders won the voters who said they were independents or republicans that distinction could begin to pinch in states that only let the democrats vote in the democratic primary rubio cruz in dead heat much like sanders rubio has been turning a mixed bag of results into a victory speech on a weekly basis saturday night was no exception as he finished second or tied for second with cruz falling 10 points behind the winner put no damper on rubio s post action summation after tonight this has become a three person race and we will win the nomination said rubio taking the stage with his wife and children and his brace of backers sen tim scott and gov nikki haley cruz was the last of the major candidates to speak he came to the stage with a posse of conservative members of congress and religious leaders as well as his wife and two daughters friends once again we have made history cruz said you the good people of south carolina and our incredible volunteers all over the country continue to defy the pundits and to produce extraordinary results candidates out of money three candidates wound up with little to show for the immense investment in south carolina one john kasich echoed rubio saying the contest was now a three person race but in kasich s formulation there was still room for four including himself kasich will probably campaign through march 15 when his home state of ohio votes he can also claim now to be the last survivor of a half dozen current or former governors who were part of the original field also on the ropes but vowing to carry on was dr ben carson the pediatric neurosurgeon who emerged from early debates as a fascinating first time candidate and political neophyte his poll numbers dwindled after the nov 13 terror attacks in paris refocused the campaign issue mix that left the man who had begun the process last summer with the biggest war chest and the fullest resume of government service former florida gov jeb bush scion of the nation s leading republican dynasty bush seemed to need only to acquiesce and watch him stroll to the nomination he easily outraised all other candidates in 2015 but bush descended in the polls after a series of lackluster showings in the televised candidate debates by the time the voting came in iowa new hampshire and south carolina bush was off the a list i respect their decisions and tonight i am suspending my campaign said jeb the man some once thought the premier political talent in his famous family the last time the republican party won the white house without someone named bush on their ticket was 1972 this year it appears they will get to try again where do we go from here next week sanders can expect to take a beating in south carolina where clinton remains in the driver s seat she benefits there from the predominance of the african american vote which she won 3 1 in nevada that should set up a super tuesday in which clinton rides a steady dominance among black voters to win in the south sanders will be better positioned in minnesota massachusetts and his own home state of vermont after commanding performances in new hampshire and south carolina trump can expect to dominate the rather small scale gop caucus in nevada next week and sweep his earnings into the 12 state extravaganza on march 1 that s called super tuesday it s difficult to see how either cruz or rubio can overtake him so long as they re locked in a mutual chokehold rubio can of course claim now to be the establishment candidate of choice his last rival for this lane john kasich will not likely be viable in the southern states on super tuesday but he should compete in the four or five primaries outside the region but even if kasich were to drop would rubio inherit bush s entire vote perhaps and the florida connection helps but rubio has made no friends in the bush clan during this contest and his rather condescending salute to his former mentor on saturday night may not be enough to heal that wound cruz for his part is still the top choice for those who tell exit pollsters they are very conservative but as he mines this rich vein he finds himself sharing it with trump who ran strong among both the very conservative and the self described born again evangelical voters in south carolina npr thanks
