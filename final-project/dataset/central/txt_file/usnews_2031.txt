rep john dingell who was the longest serving member of u s congress when he died feb 7 at the age of 92 dictated a letter to his wife in the hours before his death in the letter published in the washington post dingell a michigan democrat reflects on several challenges that congress acted upon during his time in office from environmental cleanup to civil rights he thanks his friends and his wife deborah dingell also a representative from michigan and as dingell puts it the woman who has essentially supported me for almost 40 years finally he offers some parting thoughts on the role of elected representatives in an democratic government in my life and career i have often heard it said that so and so has real power as in the powerful wile e coyote chairman of the capture the road runner committee it s an expression that has always grated on me in democratic government elected officials do not have power they hold power in trust for the people who elected them if they misuse or abuse that public trust it is quite properly revoked the quicker the better read rep john dingell s full letter below as published in the post one of the advantages to knowing that your demise is imminent and that reports of it will not be greatly exaggerated is that you have a few moments to compose some parting thoughts in our modern political age the presidential bully pulpit seems dedicated to sowing division and denigrating often in the most irrelevant and infantile personal terms the political opposition and much as i have found twitter to be a useful means of expression some occasions merit more than 280 characters my personal and political character was formed in a different era that was kinder if not necessarily gentler we observed modicums of respect even as we fought often bitterly and savagely over issues that were literally life and death to a degree that fortunately we see much less of today think about it impoverishment of the elderly because of medical expenses was a common and often accepted occurrence opponents of the medicare program that saved the elderly from that cruel fate called it socialized medicine remember that slander if there s a sustained revival of silly red baiting today not five decades ago much of the largest group of freshwater lakes on earth our own great lakes were closed to swimming and fishing and other recreational pursuits because of chemical and bacteriological contamination from untreated industrial and wastewater disposal today the great lakes are so hospitable to marine life that one of our biggest challenges is controlling the invasive species that have made them their new home we regularly used and consumed foods drugs chemicals and other things cigarettes that were legal promoted and actively harmful hazardous wastes were dumped on empty plots in the dead of night there were few if any restrictions on industrial emissions we had only the barest scientific knowledge of the long term consequences of any of this and there was a great stain on america in the form of our legacy of racial discrimination there were good people of all colors who banded together risking and even losing their lives to erase the legal and other barriers that held americans down in their time they were often demonized and targeted much like other vulnerable men and women today please note all of these challenges were addressed by congress maybe not as fast as we wanted or as perfectly as hoped the work is certainly not finished but we ve made progress and in every case from the passage of medicare through the passage of civil rights we did it with the support of democrats and republicans who considered themselves first and foremost to be americans i m immensely proud and eternally grateful for having had the opportunity to play a part in all of these efforts during my service in congress and it s simply not possible for me to adequately repay the love that my friends neighbors and family have given me and shown me during my public service and retirement but i would be remiss in not acknowledging the forgiveness and sweetness of the woman who has essentially supported me for almost 40 years my wife deborah and it is a source of great satisfaction to know that she is among the largest group of women to have ever served in the congress as she busily recruits more in my life and career i have often heard it said that so and so has real power as in the powerful wile e coyote chairman of the capture the road runner committee it s an expression that has always grated on me in democratic government elected officials do not have power they hold power in trust for the people who elected them if they misuse or abuse that public trust it is quite properly revoked the quicker the better i never forgot the people who gave me the privilege of representing them it was a lesson learned at home from my father and mother and one i have tried to impart to the people i ve served with and employed over the years as i prepare to leave this all behind i now leave you in control of the greatest nation of mankind and pray god gives you the wisdom to understand the responsibility you hold in your hands may god bless you all and may god bless america write to alex fitzpatrick at alex fitzpatrick time com
