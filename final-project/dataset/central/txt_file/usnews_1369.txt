prime minister of israel benjamin netanyahu hasn t had an easy time of it lately israeli police have recommended bribery charges against him in two cases in one he s accused of accepting cigars and champagne in exchange for political favors in another he s accused of pushing legislation to undermine a newspaper in order to gain more favorable coverage from one if its commercial rivals several of his aides have been arrested in june prosecutors indicted his wife a frequent media target for her alleged mistreatment of staff on fraud charges so far netanyahu has kept his head above water it seems he s learned a trick or two from relative political newcomer donald trump netanyahu has long relied on a confrontational style to antagonize the left and beat back challenges from the right but a move by his coalition on july 19 to declare israel the nation state of the jewish people takes trump s give your people what they want most tactic and never apologize personal style to a whole new level the law states that the right to exercise national self determination in the state of israel is unique to the jewish people jews will have democracy and arab israelis will be forced to accept a downgrade critics point out that israel s founding declaration of independence guaranteed complete equality of social and political rights for all its inhabitants no matter their religion it was of no avail to lawmakers those who oppose the law are left to speculate on how it might be used to boost settlement and other policies the law is just the latest sign that netanyahu believes israel stands in a strong position when his closest foreign ally trump carried out a fait accompli by ignoring naysayers to move the u s embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem it seemed to represent a form of unconditional backing that netanyahu never got from former u s presidents in the middle east the saudis are too busy antagonizing iran to make trouble for israel iran israel s most consistent foe is isolated and under economic pressure the russians and americans are only too happy to elbow the iranians from their footholds in syria and to remain silent as israel pounds iranian positions there turkish president recep tayyip erdogan a frequent critic of israel has sharply denounced the law but is too busy at home to cause more mischief and while egypt s military dominated government also criticized the law it won t do much to help palestinians who follow hamas a group it sees as an extension of the muslim brotherhood which it hates palestinians themselves are bitterly divided over their future hamas has continued to launch attacks from gaza that can only bring more suffering and the palestinian authority in charge of palestinians elsewhere has steadily lost public support at home netanyahu hopes to tighten his grip like the right wing government in poland he is working to undermine the authority of his country s supreme court like the right wing regime in hungary he has cracked down on civil society groups like vladimir putin s russia he has expanded his country s territory with de facto annexation of parts of the west bank like trump he attacks critics in the media to divert attention from investigations of misconduct meanwhile israel s attorney general has never brought charges against a politician running for office during a campaign if netanyahu is indicted he will probably try to buy time by calling elections this fall or early next year that s what political street fighters do this appears in the august 06 2018 issue of time contact us at editors time com
