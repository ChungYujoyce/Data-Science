beneath the partisan posturing and fiery monologues a house hearing thursday on fbi agent peter strzok s conduct delved into some key factual questions in a hearing jointly conducted by the oversight and judiciary committees republican lawmakers sharply questioned the embattled agent who oversaw the hillary clinton email server investigation as well as the beginning of the investigation into russian meddling in the election while democrats defended him and criticized their gop colleagues it was the first chance that strzok has had to publicly respond to criticism of his work both from the justice department s inspector general who looked into texts that strzok sent to a colleague he was having an affair with and from president donald trump who has attempted to use those texts to discredit the russia investigation the hearing became particularly heated at points with republicans threatening to hold strzok in contempt for refusing to answer a question about the ongoing investigation due to fbi policy republican rep louie gohmert criticizing strzok in starkly personal terms wondering how many times did you look innocently into your wife s eyes and lie to her about his affair and strzok arguing that he sent one controversial text because he was upset by trump s unconscionable and disgusting and cruel treatment of the parents of fallen soldier humayun khan but there were also several moments in the hearing in which strzok and lawmakers discussed substantive questions about the two key investigations into clinton and trump here s a closer look at three moments in the hearing that mattered republican rep james sensenbrenner grilled strzok about how the wording of a statement criticizing clinton for her use of a private email server was changed before it was issued what we know in july 2016 strzok who was leading the f b i s investigation into hillary clinton s use of a private email server rephrased his description of clinton s decisions from grossly negligent to extremely careless in a draft of a statement to be issued publicly by james comey who then headed the f b i how strzok responded he argued that the revision was introduced by the f b i s internal legal counsel who noted that the phrase gross negligence carried a specific legal meaning and would carry legal implications key moment sensenbrenner asked strzok to confirm that the revision to the draft was made on strzok s computer on june 6 strzok said he believe d it to be true why was the change made sensenbrenner asked my recollection is and i m not an attorney that attorneys within the f b i raised concern that the use of gross negligence triggered a very specific legal meaning yeah criminal sensenbrenner said he then asked if the change was hillary s get out of jail free card absolutely not sir strzok replied he then expounded on the f b i s desire to avoid using a term with specific legal implications with regard to that decision there was concern within the perspective of a legal definition of that term that people would draw an inference based on that use that it was necessarily talking a specific subset of a statute he said that rates four pinnochios sensenbrenner replied republican rep trey gowdy questioned strzok about his removal from special counsel robert mueller s investigation into russian meddling which occurred after the inspector general began looking into his texts what we know strzok was removed from mueller s team last summer after an internal investigation uncovered his text exchanges with page which criticized then candidate trump peter carr a spokesperson for the special counsel s office said immediately upon learning of the allegations the special counsel s office removed peter strzok from the investigation although people speculated about why strzok was dismissed mueller s team never publicly gave an official reason strzok was then abruptly reassigned to a position at the fbi s human resources division how did strzok respond strzok claimed that to his knowledge he was removed from the probe for reasons related to public perception presumably to maintain trust in the integrity of mueller s team rather than any concern about bias on his part key moment gowdy asked strzok to explain the timing behind his dismissal from the investigation team no wonder bob mueller kicked you off of the investigation agent strzok my question is if you were kicked off when he read the texts shouldn t you have been kicked off when you wrote them no not at all strzok responded gowdy questioned why he was kicked off and strzok explained that he was removed based on the understanding of those texts and the perception that they might create strzok testified that the meeting was short somewhere around 15 minutes when further questioned by gowdy he reiterated that it is not my understanding that he kicked me off because of any bias that it was done based on the appearance if you want to represent what you said accurately i m happy to answer that question but i don t appreciate what was originally said being changed gowdy responded i don t give a damn what you appreciate agent strzok i don t appreciate having an fbi agent with an unprecedented level of animus working on two major investigations during 2016 republican rep trey gowdy questioned strzok over perhaps the most controversial text that he sent page in which he said that trump would not become president because we ll stop it what we know in the summer of 2016 page sent a text to strzok writing trump s not ever going to become president right right strzok responded no no he won t we ll stop it the inspector general s report reviewing clinton s email investigation found that the texts damaged the fbi s reputation for impartiality but ultimately concluded there was no evidence that this affected the investigations speaking publicly about the text during the hearing strzok explained that it was sent the night that trump disparaged khizr khan a gold star father who lost his son in iraq and that it was off the cuff comment sent late at night that he didn t even recall he gave an impassioned defense arguing that his beliefs never impeded the investigation into russian meddling because his fbi colleagues wouldn t have allowed it key moment strzok gave a long explanation for the text sir i think it s important when you look at those texts that you understand the context in which they were made and the things that were going on across america in terms of the texts that we will stop it you need to understand that that was written late at night off the cuff and it was in response to a series of events that included then candidate trump insulting the immigrant family of a fallen war hero and my presumption based on that horrible disgusting behavior that the american population would not elect somebody demonstrating that behavior to be president of the united states it was in no way unequivocally any suggestion that me the fbi would take any action whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate so i i take great offense and i take great disagreement to your assertion of what that was or wasn t as to the 100 million to one that was clearly a statement made in jest and using hyperbole i of course recognize that millions of americans were likely to vote for candidate trump i acknowledge that is absolutely their right that is what makes our democracy such a vibrant process that it is but to suggest somehow that we can parse down the words of shorthand textual conversation like they re some contract for a car is is simply not consistent with my or most people s use of text messaging write to alana abramson at alana abramson time com and
