his prepared statement kavanaugh denies ford s accusation immediately unequivocally and categorically and calls ramirez s accusation false and uncorroborated he says that the accusations are an effort to block his nomination kavanaugh also says he will not be intimidated into withdrawing and says he has never sexually assaulted anyone not in high school not in college not ever kavanaugh also admits that he was not a perfect person in high school but the misconduct he is being accused of is inconsistent with the rest of his life i spent most of my time in high school focused on academics sports church and service he says in the statement but i was not perfect in those days just as i am not perfect today i drank beer with my friends usually on weekends sometimes i had too many in retrospect i said and did things in high school that make me cringe now below is kavanaugh s full prepared written testimony prepared written testimony of judge brett m kavanaugh nomination hearing to serve as an associate justice of the supreme court september 27 2018 submitted september 26 2018 mr chairman ranking member feinstein and members of the committee eleven days ago dr ford publicly accused me of committing a serious wrong more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school i denied the allegation immediately unequivocally and categorically the next day i told this committee that i wanted to testify as soon as possible under oath to clear my name over the past few days other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired there has been a frenzy to come up with something anything no matter how far fetched or odious that will block a vote on my nomination these are last minute smears pure and simple they debase our public discourse and the consequences extend beyond any one nomination such grotesque and obvious character assassination if allowed to succeed will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country as i told this committee the last time i appeared before you a federal judge must be independent not swayed by public or political pressure that is the kind of judge i am and will always be i will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process this effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out the vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out i am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth and the truth is that i have never sexually assaulted anyone not in high school not in college not ever sexual assault is horrific it is morally wrong it is illegal it is contrary to my religious faith and it contradicts the core promise of this nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously those who make allegations deserve to be heard the subject of allegations also deserves to be heard due process is a foundation of the american rule of law dr ford s allegation dates back more than 36 years to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school i spent most of my time in high school focused on academics sports church and service but i was not perfect in those days just as i am not perfect today i drank beer with my friends usually on weekends sometimes i had too many in retrospect i said and did things in high school that make me cringe now but that s not why we are here today what i ve been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior i never did anything remotely resembling what dr ford describes the allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life the record of my life from my days in grade school through the present day shows that i have always promoted the equality and dignity of women i categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by dr ford i never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with dr ford i am not questioning that dr ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time but i have never done that to her or to anyone i am innocent of this charge additional testimony to follow write to gina martinez at
