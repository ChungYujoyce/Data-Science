media attention on the eve of the iowa caucuses and causing a kind of existential crisis for democratic voters loading january 30 2020 since the day donald trump announced his first presidential campaign in june 2015 he has transfixed supporters and critics alike in that nomination race the other candidates in the historically large republican field struggled for media attention the lifeblood of a campaign now it can be argued an even larger democratic field is suffering from a similar challenge president trump is casting a gigantic shadow over the democratic contest with his ongoing impeachment trial only exacerbating the eclipse it s no accident that the president is holding a rally tonight in des moines iowa just days before next monday s democratic caucuses and another in manchester new hampshire on feb 10 the night before that state s primary both events threaten to suck local media oxygen away from democrats trying to break through right as undecided voters are making choices one result of the trump effect can be seen in iowa where polling which often makes big swings in the closing days of the campaign has been relatively stable media mentions of iowa caucuses are way down compared with previous cycles as are google searches donald trump is making it difficult for any candidate to monopolize the various media platforms says matthew dickinson a political scientist at vermont s middlebury college since the day donald trump announced his first presidential campaign in june 2015 he has transfixed the nation supporters and critics alike in that nomination race the other candidates in the historically large republican field struggled for media attention the lifeblood of a campaign in the 2020 race it can be argued the even larger democratic field is suffering from a similar challenge now president trump unparalleled in the art of grabbing and holding the spotlight has cast a gigantic shadow over the democratic nomination contest and his

caucuses and another in manchester new hampshire on feb 10 the night before that state s primary both events threaten to suck local media oxygen away from democrats trying to break through right as undecided voters are making choices one result of the trump effect can be seen in iowa where polling which often makes big swings in the closing days of the campaign has been relatively stable media mentions of iowa caucuses are way down compared with previous cycles as are google searches although i disagree with mr trump on everything he does know how to manipulate the media and get attention says nancy bowden of humboldt iowa she s speaking in fort dodge iowa as voters line up to see pete buttigieg the former mayor of south bend indiana it s like a train wreck if you provide something terrible for people to look at they re going to focus on that says ms bowden a precinct captain for mr buttigieg referring to mr trump s time in office the trump effect is multilayered democrats fervent desire to defeat mr trump and the lack of an establishment favorite led to a historically large field at one point topping 20 candidates now at 12 and with mr trump looming over the race many democrats have emphasized that above all else they are looking for a candidate who can beat him for some voters a kind of mental gridlock has set in as they consider the array of choices for democrats there s really a sense of existential crisis that donald trump must be beaten at all costs says david redlawsk a political scientist at the university of delaware who has attended some 125 candidate events in iowa while on a six month sabbatical but there s little agreement on what it will take to beat trump in his latest academic survey of likely iowa caucusgoers taken in late december and early january mr redlawsk found that only 16 were considering just one candidate many voters he says are torn between head and heart who they d like to see go up against mr trump versus who they think can actually beat him the democratic candidate who has perhaps suffered the most from the trump induced media eclipse is moderate sen amy klobuchar of minnesota recent iowa polling has shown a bit of movement for senator klobuchar the kind of momentum that in previous cycles has often presaged a surprise showing but for the past week the trump impeachment trial has mostly trapped her in washington ms klobuchar grabbed a last minute flight to iowa wednesday evening after the impeachment trial had finished for the day just to spend precious minutes with voters then flew back to washington the next morning other senate democrats running for president bernie sanders elizabeth warren are stuck in washington too but for ms klobuchar the iowa caucuses could be do or die she s in fifth place at 9 6 in thereal clear politics averageof polls to be viable for convention delegates a candidate must garner at least 15 of caucusgoers whether the senators running for president are harmed by having to attend the impeachment trial rather than spending those days campaigning remains to be seen democratic sen tim kaine of virginia suggests they won t be i don t think voters are going to hold it against people that they were here doing the most important thing the constitution asks them to do he says not all iowa political experts see a trump effect diverting attention from the caucuses at least among likely caucusgoers dianne bystrom a professor emeritus of political science at iowa state university points to studies that show political advertising in iowa doesn t have as big an impact on voters as it does in other states iowans can go to rallies and see candidates in person she says the caucuses which require being at a designated place at a designated time favor committed voters not casual observers who are easily swayed by media hype but in new hampshire where the iowa results often significantly affect how the primary goes political scientist matthew dickinson sees a trump effect at work donald trump is making it difficult for any candidate to monopolize the various media platforms says mr dickinson a professor at vermont s middlebury college who travels frequently to campaign events in neighboring new hampshire the democrats themselves have compounded that problem with a second factor he adds there are just so many democrats occupying these ideological lanes that all seem to a certain extent plausible and all of them seem flawed more often than not the winner of the iowa democratic caucuses wins the nomination but given the unusual nature of the 2020 cycle there are no guarantees some iowans are frustrated by the media s penchant for conflict in its campaign coverage at an event for democratic candidate andrew yang on the university of iowa campus in iowa city several supporters partially attribute mr yang s lagging media coverage to the way the entrepreneur has chosen to run his campaign most of the media s current airtime is given to the warren sanders he said she said debate and yang is not a drama candidate says alexandra petrucci a neuroscience ph d student who plans to caucus for mr yang we re told by the campaign to talk about yang to other people rather than bringing down other candidates another democratic candidate who emphasized the positive new jersey sen cory booker dropped out jan 13 amid lackluster fundraising some iowa democrats see an upside to having mr trump as the republican standard bearer trump s galvanizing people to get involved who wouldn t normally it s the whole reason i m caucusing says connie twining a small business owner in dubuque who just registered as a democrat so she can caucus for mr buttigieg she was an independent for years but she also bemoans the lack of attention to major issues amid
