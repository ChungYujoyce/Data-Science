obama romney take turns twisting the facts in florida on foreign policy by eugene kiely posted on october 23 2012 in the third and final obama romney debate the candidates again contradicted each other while each offered incorrect or twisted factual claims one issue on which the two men no longer seem to disagree is pulling out all u s combat troops from afghanistan by the end of 2014 romney had previously criticized the president for setting a date and later modified his position to say he agreed with the president s timeline but would be guided by military commanders and events on the ground this time he dropped all qualifiers and said flatly w hen i m president we ll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014 the third and final presidential debate between barack obama and mitt romney took place oct 22 at lynn university in boca raton fla the focus was to be foreign policy although both candidates slipped in some references to domestic issues pakistan permission obama claimed that during the 2008 campaign romney said we should ask pakistan for permission before going into that country to kill or capture terrorists that s not true romney said taking unilateral action in pakistan should be an option but criticized obama for publicly talking about it saying we keep our options quiet obama when it comes to going after osama bin laden you said well any president would make that call but when you were a candidate in 2008 as i was and i said if i got bin laden in our sights i would take that shot you said we shouldn t move heaven and earth to get one man and you said we should ask pakistan for permission and if we had asked pakistan for permission we would not have gotten him and it was worth moving heaven and earth to get him obama distorted two facts here we ll first address the one about pakistan as a senator and candidate for president obama said he would attack high value terrorists in pakistan with or without the approval of its then president pervez musharraf obama aug 1 2007 if we have actionable intelligence about high value terrorist targets and president musharraf won t act we will in a radio interview two days later romney called obama s comment ill considered he went on to say i do not concur in the words of barack obama in a plan to enter an ally of ours i don t think those kinds of comments help in this effort to draw more friends to our effort the obama campaign cites this as evidence that romney would seek permission to attack terrorists in pakistan but it s not the whole story a couple of days later romney was asked at a republican debate in iowa what he would do if the cia came to him and said it had osama bin laden in its sights but musharraf said the u s could not enter pakistan romney said going into pakistan without permission would be an option but criticized obama for saying so romney aug 5 2007 it s wrong for a person running for the president of the united states to get on tv and say we re going to go into your country unilaterally of course america always maintains our option to do whatever we think is in the best interests of america but we don t go out and say ladies and gentlemen of germany if ever there was a problem in your country we didn t think you were doing the right thing we reserve the right to come in and get them out we don t say those things we keep our options quiet we do not go out and say to a nation which is working with us where we have collaborated and they are our friend and we re trying to support musharraf and strengthen him and his nation that instead that we intend to go in there and potentially bring out a unilateral attack obama also fails to tell the whole story when he remarked that romney once said we shouldn t move heaven and earth to get one man referring to bin laden as we wrote after the vice presidential debate romney said in 2007 that the u s shouldn t focus on one man but rather needed a broader strategy to defeat the islamic jihad movement u s troops in iraq the president went too far when he accused romney of not telling the truth about obama s position on leaving a residual force of u s troops in iraq romney w ith regards to iraq you and i agreed i believe that there should have been a status of forces agreement did you obama that s not true w hat i would not have done is left 10 000 troops in iraq that would tie us down that certainly would not help us in the middle east obama did indeed seek to leave several thousand u s troops in iraq and disagreed with romney only over the size of the residual force the administration tried to negotiate a status of forces agreement with the iraqi government to leave 3 000 to 4 000 troops there at the time that negotiations broke down over the iraqis refusal to grant legal immunity to remaining u s troops as the last troops were leaving in december 2011 romney said on fox news w e should have left 10 20 30 thousand personnel there to help transition to the iraqis own military capabilities smallest navy since 1917 romney repeated the claim that our navy is smaller now than any time since 1917 which isn t technically true there were 342 total active ships as of april 6 1917 when the u s entered world war i there were 282 active duty ships as of april 2012 according to a congressional research service report in august that s down from the naval history and heritage command s count of 285 as of september 2011 however 282 ships is the same number in service during george w bush s last year in office and a slight increase over the number in 2007 when the size of the fleet was actually at its lowest more important ships today can do more than they used to so having fewer doesn t necessarily translate to a weaker navy in april navy secretary ray mabus said that comparing today s ships to those of years past is like comparing the telegraph to the smartphone navy officials presented a plan to congress back in march projecting that the size of the naval fleet could increase to 300 ships by 2019 that s the amount that mabus said the navy needs to meet its defense needs veterans unemployment obama claimed that unemployment among veterans is lower now than it is among the general population which is correct but that s only true for all veterans the rate among veterans of america s most recent wars in iraq and afghanistan is currently higher than that of the general population the president also may have misled some listeners when he said the veterans rate was higher when i took office higher than what the rate for veterans was higher then than it is now but it was lower than the rate for the general population both then and now obama the first lady has done great work with an organization called joining forces putting our veterans back to work and as a consequence veterans unemployment is actually now lower than general population it was higher when i came into office figures for veterans aren t available on a seasonally adjusted basis so to compare like to like we ve looked at unadjusted figures for both the unemployment rate of the general population was 8 5 percent not seasonally adjusted in january 2009 the month of obama s inauguration the unemployment rate among veterans was lower at7 4 percent that month not higher as obama said both rates increased and peaked during obama s term the unadjusted rate topped out among the general population at 10 6 percent in january 2010 and for veterans at 9 9 percent in january 2011 as of september the unadjusted rates shrunk to 7 6 percent for the general population and 6 7 percent for veterans but the rate among veterans of america s most recent wars in iraq and afghanistan remains higher than that of the general population at 9 7 percent it had peaked at 15 2 percent in january 2011 leaving afghanistan one issue on which romney no longer seems to disagree with obama is pulling u s troops out of afghanistan by the end of 2014 romney w e re going to be finished by 2014 and when i m president we ll make sure we bring our troops out by the end of 2014 later romney added that the afghans will be ready by the end of 2014 to take over their own security that s a change in the past romney had said that announcing a specific date for the withdrawal of u s combat troops was among obama s biggest mistakes he later told abc news that he also would adhere to the same time frame the president is speaking of for turning over responsibility to afghan forces by the end of 2014 but qualified that by saying withdrawal depended on what military commanders tell him and on circumstances on the ground this time there were no such qualifiers romney said flatly w e re going to be able to make that transition by the end of of 2014 so our troops ll come home at that point and for the record both obama and romney have left the door open for leaving a residual force of support troops behind if the afghans agree bankruptcy back and forth obama got it wrong when he insisted over and over that romney never advocated help or government assistance for automakers if they went through bankruptcy in fact romney called for a managed bankruptcy that would include federal guarantees for post bankruptcy financing which qualifies as indirect government assistance by any definition what romney opposed was the direct federal aid obama implemented here s an edited version of the candidates long and contentious disagreement romney i said they need these companies need to go through a managed bankruptcy and in that process they can get government help and government guarantees but they need to go through bankruptcy to get rid of excess cost and the debt burden that they d they d built up obama governor romney that s not what you said romney you can take a look at the op ed obama you did not say that you would provide governor help romney you know i m i m still speaking i said that we would provide guarantees and and that was what was able to allow these companies to go through bankruptcy to come out of bankruptcy under no circumstances would i do anything other than to help this industry get on its feet and the idea that has been suggested that i would liquidate the industry of course not of course not obama the look i think anybody out there can check the record governor romney you keep on trying to you know airbrush history here you were very clear that you would not provide government assistance to the u s auto companies even if they went through bankruptcy you said that they could get it in the private marketplace that wasn t true they would have gone through a romney you re wrong you re wrong mr president obama i no i am not wrong romney you re wrong obama i am not wrong and romney people can look it up you re right obama people will look it up romney good in fact people can easily look it up romney s 2008 op ed published in the new york times with the well known headline let detroit go bankrupt said he was against the government bailout but romney wrote a managed bankruptcy may be the only path to the fundamental restructuring the industry needs it would permit the companies to shed excess labor pension and real estate costs the federal government should provide guarantees for post bankruptcy financing and assure car buyers that their warranties are not at risk apology tour again what night of presidential foreign policy debate would be complete without the rehashed claim from romney that obama embarked on an apology tour of the world soon after being elected president romney and then the president began what i ve called an apology tour of going to to various nations in the middle east and and criticizing america i think they looked at that and saw weakness and i think that when the president said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and israel that they noticed that as well obama retorted that n othing gov romney just said is true starting with this notion of me apologizing this has been probably the biggest whopper that s been told during the course of this campaign and every fact checker and every reporter that s looked at it has said this is not true obama is certainly right about the assessment of fact checkers including factcheck org we pored over the speeches that romney cited in his book no apology to back up his claim that obama went on an apology tour and we concluded that we didn t see that any of them rise to the level of an actual apology our fact checking colleagues at politifact and the washington post fact checker reached the same conclusion obama never apologized during the debate romney defended his apology claim romney mr president the reason i call it an apology tour is because you went to the middle east and you flew to egypt and to saudi arabia and to turkey and iraq and by the way you skipped israel our closest friend in the region but you went to the other nations and by the way they noticed that you skipped israel and then in those nations and on arabic tv you said that america had been dismissive and derisive you said that on occasion america had dictated to other nations mr president america has not dictated to other nations we have freed other nations from dictators obama s dismissive and derisive comments were not actually made in the middle east as romney said but rather during a speech obama gave in strasbourg france in april 2009 here s the fuller context of those remarks again made to a european audience not middle eastern obama april 3 2009 i know that there have been honest disagreements over policy but we also know that there s something more that has crept into our relationship in america there s a failure to appreciate europe s leading role in the world instead of celebrating your dynamic union and seeking to partner with you to meet common challenges there have been times where america has shown arrogance and been dismissive even derisive but in europe there is an anti americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious instead of recognizing the good that america so often does in the world there have been times where europeans choose to blame america for much of what s bad on both sides of the atlantic these attitudes have become all too common they are not wise they do not represent the truth they threaten to widen the divide across the atlantic and leave us both more isolated here s what obama said in a speech in cairo egypt on june 4 2009 obama june 4 2009 the relationship between islam and the west includes centuries of coexistence and cooperation but also conflict and religious wars more recently tension has been fed by colonialism that denied rights and opportunities to many muslims and a cold war in which muslim majority countries were too often treated as proxies without regard to their own aspirations moreover the sweeping change brought by modernity and globalization led many muslims to view the west as hostile to the traditions of islam violent extremists have exploited these tensions in a small but potent minority of muslims the attacks of september 11 2001 and the continued efforts of these extremists to engage in violence against civilians has led some in my country to view islam as inevitably hostile not only to america and western countries but also to human rights all this has bred more fear and more mistrust so long as our relationship is defined by our differences we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace those who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity and this cycle of suspicion and discord must end i ve come here to cairo to seek a new beginning between the united states and muslims around the world one based on mutual interest and mutual respect and one based upon the truth that america and islam are not exclusive and need not be in competition as the fuller context shows obama spoke about tensions between the u s and the muslim world and placed blame on both sides and then he called for a new beginning that s not an apology romney s claim that obama said he was going to create daylight between ourselves and israel is also not as clear cut as romney suggests the source of this quote is a washington post story in july that reconstructed a private meeting between obama and a dozen jewish leaders on july 13 2009 according to people at the meeting the post reported obama talked about the relationship between israel and the u s under the george w bush administration and said during those eight years there was no space between us and israel and what did we get from that when there is no daylight israel just sits on the sidelines and that erodes our credibility with the arab states the story goes on to say that obama told the jewish leaders that he wanted to restore the united states reputation as a credible mediator to do so he believed that he needed to regain arab trust and talk tough to israel publicly and privately the post story later quotes deputy national security adviser ben rhodes explaining obama s motivation the case he was trying to make was that the united states will be a better partner to israel if it has more credibility with the arab states that we will be a better more useful friend to israel if we have more friends in the arab world the obama administration has neither confirmed nor denied the veracity of the daylight quote nonetheless it is a second hand quote from an anonymous source and the context of its meaning explained in the same post story was distorted by romney during the debate we re no 1 romney boasted that massachusetts fourth and eighth graders tested first in the nation in reading and math after he became governor but massachusetts students had tested at the top or near it before romney took office obama countered that it was a policy put in place a decade earlier that caused the high scores the state did pass a landmark 1993 law that emphasized testing and new curriculum and increased school funding romney while i was governor i was proud that our fourth graders came out number one of all 50 states in english and then also in math and our eighth graders number one in english and also in math first time one state had been number one in all four measures how did we do that well republicans and democrats came together on a bipartisan basis to put in place education that focused on having great teachers in the classroom and that was obama ten years earlier romney that was that was what allowed us to become the number one state in the nation and this is and we were obama but that was 10 years before you took office romney was governor of massachusetts from january 2003 to january 2007 the 2003 test scores from the national assessment of educational progress known as the nation s report card put massachusetts students in first place for reading and math in fourth grade and reading in eighth grade it was second for eighth grade math and it tied with several other states in all categories in 2005 eighth grade math scores moved up to first and as romney said the state was ranked first in all categories tied with a few other states in the math categories the state s 2002 reading scores and 2000 math scores were also at or near the top of the nation and on par with several other states romney said it was a bipartisan effort that focused on having great teachers that boosted test scores but scores were already high in massachusetts compared with other states and they ve remained there since romney left office obama said it was an effort 10 years before you took office and there s evidence for that the boston globe said a 1993 education law is largely credited for the high scores the christian science monitor also recently looked at massachusetts success in education and pointed to the 1993 law that emphasized testing christian science monitor sept 5 2012 leaders from state government education and business came together to form the massachusetts education reform act of 1993 creating high standards and curriculum frameworks in math reading social studies and science as well as related tests for fourth eighth and 10th graders the massachusetts comprehensive assessment system mcas the emphasis on high stakes testing led some teachers and parents to protest worried that it would nudge borderline students into dropping out a debate that later resonated nationally because of the testing regimen established by the federal no child left behind act of 2001 after the new system took hold significant learning gains among massachusetts students were reflected in both state and national tests obama also claimed that romney cut education spending when you came into office that s true though it s worth pointing out that the state faced a budget gap and the democratic legislature proposed cuts too our colleagues at politifact documented a similar obama claim on this point no 1 threat in one of his first zingers of the night obama mocked romney s foreign policy chops saying that romney once called russia not al qaeda the biggest geopolitical threat facing america we score this one for romney obama governor romney i m glad that you recognize that al qaeda s a threat because a few months ago when you were asked what s the biggest geopolitical threat facing america you said russia not al qaeda you said russia and the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know the cold war s been over for 20 years romney responded by saying that his words had been twisted romney first of all russia i indicated is a geopolitical foe not obama number one romney excuse me it s a geopolitical foe and i said in the same paragraph i said and iran is the greatest national security threat we face russia does continue to battle us in the u n time and time again i have clear eyes on this and so to the transcript of an interview with cnn s wolf blitzer earlier this year romney march 26 2012 t his is to russia this is without question our no 1 geopolitical foe blitzer but you think russia is a bigger foe right now than let s say iran or china or north korea is that is that what you re suggesting governor romney well i m saying in terms of a geopolitical opponent the nation that lines up with the world s worst actors of course the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear iran a nuclear north korea is already troubling enough so this debate kerfuffle comes down to a distinction between biggest foe and biggest threat obama said romney called russia the biggest geopolitical threat facing america not al qaeda romney called russia our no 1 geopolitical foe and romney is correct that he quickly noted in the same interview that the greatest threat that the world faces is a nuclear iran debt to other people romney overstated the size of the federal debt held by the public in talking about china romney said we owe them a trillion dollars and owe other people 16 trillion in total including them it s true that we owe china 1 2 trillion but the u s owes other people a total of 11 3 trillion including china romney mixed up his numbers the 16 trillion refers to total federal debt including how much the government owes itself for such things as the social security trust funds terrorism in 2000 debates romney also was a bit off when he claimed in the 2000 debates there was no mention of terrorism actually al gore made one glancing mention during the third presidential debate with george w bush on oct 17 2000 a member of the audience asked the candidates what would make you the best candidate in office during the middle east crisis and gore responded by saying that as a member of the house intelligence committee he d become familiar with how we can diffuse these tensions and deal with non proliferation and deal with the problems of terrorism and these new
