 president elect donald trump is a narrative arsonist a firebug who puts tweets to tinder and ignites flaming controversies that lure our eyes from things he doesn t want us to see and it seems our presidential pyromaniac has struck again on sunday the man who will soon lead this country tweeted a lie a big fiery one it read in addition to winning the electoral college in a landslide i won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally that statement is based on nothing actually it s based on less than nothing its origin is roughly this a nobody republican with zero credibility or evidence tweeted that 3 million people voted illegally a conspiracy theory website reported on that tweet taking it as fact the president elect in need of a distraction tweeted that information as fact with no citation not that a citation would have made it any less false let s pause for a moment and consider the staggering level of irresponsibility trump showed in tweeting that lie it s akin to my crazy uncle told me the world is flat i reported that on my blog the president of the united states then declared the world flat and banned boats so nobody would sail off the edge of the earth troublesome right yes but don t get distracted let s ignore that extremely stupid fire and look at the things trump the twitter arsonist was trying to get us to ignore 1 he won the electoral college not by a landslide but lost the popular vote by more than 2 million votes and counting that s painful for him because he never lets himself believe he has lost anything and that vote disparity is now being highlighted by state ballot recounts spearheaded oddly enough by green party candidate jill stein the man who spent a good part of the presidential campaign claiming the election was rigged is now appalled at the idea of people checking to make sure it wasn t and to distract us from his popular vote loss and the possibility a recount could lessen the scope of his victory he s saying recounts are a waste of time and claiming that millions of people voted illegally one would think that claim about illegal voters would necessitate a nationwide recount but we no longer inhabit a country where things make sense the takeaway here is this ignore trump s illegal voter tweet and remind him at every turn that he lost the popular vote and by no means enters office with a mandate 2 evidence continues to mount of global business ties that create conflicts of interest for trump as president a sweeping new york times investigation published sunday found mr trump s companies have business operations in at least 20 countries with a particular focus on the developing world including outposts in nations like india indonesia and uruguay according to a new york times analysis of his presidential campaign financial disclosures what s more the true extent of mr trump s global financial entanglements is unclear since he has refused to release his tax returns and has not made public a list of his lenders this web of potential conflicts could create a running source of controversy for mr trump as well as tensions between his priorities as president and the needs and objectives of his companies beyond that trump s new hotel in washington d c is already highlighting itself as a destination for foreign diplomats and trump s daughter ivanka who helps run the trump organization sat in on several recent meetings with trump and foreign leaders there are also reports that the secret service may spend several million dollars a year renting space in trump tower taxpayer money that would go straight into trump s business add it up and you have conflicts and the potential for self enrichment out the wazoo so don t look at the tweets look at the compounding concerns about this president s ability to use the office for cash generation and brand enhancement 3 as trump continues to fill out his cabinet concerns abound aside from picking as his right hand man a guy who ran a white nationalist website trump has chosen an anti public education activist whose family has contributed sizably to anti lgbt organizations as his secretary of education and he is according to various reports torn between choosing mitt romney or rudy giuliani for secretary of state that s a bit like choosing between someone who might be a statesman and someone who might have rabies if trump cares about the country he ll swallow his pride and choose romney who was an outspoken critic of trump during the campaign but that trump ego is fragile so he may dismiss concerns about the country and go with giuliani the unhinged toady those three items are just a few of the things trump doesn t want you to focus on and that s why he took to twitter on sunday and tweeted a lie that would easily irritate people who think it s important to discern between truth and absurdity there is reason to be irritated and maybe even terrified by the soon to be president of the most powerful country in the world sharing false information that draws the legitimacy of our electoral process into question but sadly that s the least of our concerns it s just a fire lit to hypnotize us set by an arsonist who knows how to burn a narrative to the ground rhuppke chicagotribune com
