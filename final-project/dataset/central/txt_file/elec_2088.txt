in person voter fraud and fraudulent activity involving absentee or mail ballots and can occur at different points of the election process from registration to the tallying of ballots there is debate surrounding the extent to which various types of electoral fraud occur john fund and hans von spakovsky with the heritage foundation a conservative think tank wrote that the media aren t doing our democracy any favors by summarily dismissing the existence of voter fraud like the almost 1 200 proven cases in the heritage foundation s election fraud database while questioning the very need for accurate voter rolls 1 according to the brennan center for justice a progressive law and policy institute the consensus from credible research and investigation is that the rate of illegal voting is extremely rare and the incidence of certain types of fraud such as impersonating another voter is virtually nonexistent 2 this and other pages on ballotpedia cover types of electoral fraud for which there are documented cases and around which there is debate concerning the frequency of instances and proposed responses the following are the common types of alleged electoral fraud 1 2 various studies reports and investigations have yielded different conclusions regarding the frequency of electoral fraud below is a sampling as of december 2019 the heritage foundation s voter fraud database contained what the group identified as 1 241 cases of proven voter fraud and 1 071 criminal convictions heritage said the database presents a sampling of proven instances of election fraud from across the country this database is not an exhaustive or comprehensive list but is intended to demonstrate the many ways in which fraud is committed preventing deterring and prosecuting election fraud is essential to protecting the integrity of our voting process the group also said that each of the instances in the database resulted in either a criminal conviction or an overturned election 3 the database categorized instances of fraud into the following in 2013 the new york city department of investigation doi sent 63 people to polls to attempt to vote under ineligible voters names as part of an investigation doi reported that 61 people were able to do so 4 doi s website describes the department as the city s independent inspector general ig with oversight of city agencies and commissions elected officials employees contractors and those who receive benefits from the city 5 the report stated the following about the investigation after receiving an allegation from a former boe employee that ineligible voters remained on the voter rolls doi checked multiple databases at random to generate a list of approximately 175 individuals who had either died become a convicted felon or had moved outside the city using that list doi ascertained that they had each at one time been registered voters in the city during doi s citywide 2013 election day investigative operations doi sought to determine whether any of them remained in boe s registration books and to test whether investigators using the names of those ineligible individuals would be permitted to vote doi found that 63 of the ineligible individuals or 36 were still listed as eligible voters in the registration books at poll sites the majority of those 63 ineligible individuals remained on the rolls nearly two years or longer since a death felony conviction or move outside of the city doi investigators posed as the 63 ineligible individuals still on the voter rolls and were permitted to obtain mark and submit ballots in the scanners or the lever booths in 61 instances or approximately 97 2 in five instances doi investigators in their twenties and thirties posed as individuals whose ages as recorded in the registration books ranged from 82 to 94 and despite the obvious disparity the investigators were given ballots or access to lever booths without question by the boe poll workers boe personnel explained that ineligible individuals might remain on the rolls pending receipt and verification of various notifications that boe receives from the new york state board of elections state boe and other sources including for example verbal reports from voters of changes in residence or from family members about the death of a voter 6 justin levitt professor at loyola law school in 2014 published results of his research into in person voter fraud allegations between 2000 and 2014 levitt wrote that he found about 31 different incidents some of which involve multiple ballots since 2000 anywhere in the country he said those 31 instances come in the context of general primary special and municipal elections from 2000 through 2014 in general and primary elections alone more than 1 billion ballots were cast in that period 7 in 2007 levitt wrote a report with the brennan center that included 24 examples of what it called exaggerated or unfounded allegations of fraud related to double voting votes cast under names of deceased people people ineligible due to felony convictions and other types of fraud the report stated that fraud by individual voters is a singularly foolish and ineffective way to attempt to win an election each act of voter fraud in connection with a federal election risks five years in prison and a 10 000 fine in addition to any state penalties in return it yields at most one incremental vote that single extra vote is simply not worth the price 8 the report which argued against using fraud as a reason to implement voter id laws included the following case study summaries missouri in some ways the recent hunt for voter fraud began in missouri in the 2000 election the crucible that proved formative for attorney general john ashcroft and senator kit bond among others yet despite all the frenzy the allegations yielded only six substantiated cases of missouri votes cast by ineligible voters knowingly or unknowingly except for those votes permitted by court order the six cases were double votes by four voters two across state lines and two within missouri amounting to an overall rate of 0 0003 new jersey just before the 2005 election partisan actors attempted to probe the accuracy of new jersey s voter rolls by comparing election records for 2004 with death records and with the rolls of other states the allegations yielded only eight substantiated cases of individuals knowingly casting invalid votes that counted eight voters who voted twice given the number of votes cast in these elections this amounts to a rate of 0 0004 wisconsin the 2004 election was hotly contested in wisconsin and various irregularities led to inflated claims of widespread fraud the allegations yielded only seven substantiated cases of individuals knowingly casting invalid votes that counted all persons with felony convictions this amounts to a rate of 0 0025 within milwaukee and 0 0002 within the state as a whole none of these problems could have been resolved by requiring photo id at the polls 6 in 2014 u s district judge lynn adelman found that wisconsin s voter identification law violated the united states constitution in her opinion adelman stated that evidence at trial established that virtually no voter impersonation occurs in wisconsin the defendants could not point to a single instance of known voter impersonation occurring in wisconsin at any time in the recent past adelman also said that the vast majority of these cases approximately 10 each election have innocent explanations such as a poll
