we found false and misleading claims from clinton sanders and o malley in a saturday night showdown by factcheck org posted on november 15 2015 the three democratic presidential candidates faced off on a saturday night and made several inaccurateclaims clinton sanders and o malley met at drake university in iowafor the debate which was hosted bycbs news kcci tv in des moines and the des moines register o malley said that in president ronald reagan s first term the highest marginal income tax rate was 70 percent that was true only briefly in reagan s first year in office he signed a bill reducing the top rate to 50 percent and in his second term he reduced it again to 28 percent o malley cited the top marginal tax rate during the debate to make the point that upper income taxpayers should be paying more and historically have o malley and may i point out that under ronald reagan s first term the highest marginal rate was 70 percent and in talking to a lot of our neighbors who are in that super wealthy millionaire and billionaire category a great number of them love their country enough to do more again in order to create more opportunity for america s middle class as a matter of history the top marginal tax rate of 70 percent was established in 1964 when congress passed a tax cut backed by president john f kennedy in the decades before that the top rate was much higher hovering around 90 percent so 70 percent was the top rate when reagan took office in january 1981 eight months after taking office reagan signed the economic recovery tax act of 1981 which cut the highest marginal tax rate to 50 percent in his second term reagan signed a bill in 1986 that lowered the top marginal income tax rate to 28 percent sanders continued to peddle some false claims about u s inequality and child poverty sanders this country today has more income and wealth inequality than any major country on earth we have the highest rate of childhood poverty regarding income inequality we noted back in may that world bank statistics list at least 41 countries with greater income inequality than the u s including israel brazil mexico chile and argentina and as for wealth inequality the share of wealth held by the top 1percent in the u s puts it in 11th place among 37 nations listed in the 2015 edition of the global wealth databook the top 1 percent in russia thailand indonesia india brazil chile south africa china czech republic and israel each hold a greater share of their nation s wealth according to that publication finally the rate of child poverty is far worse in many other countries including several with industrialized economies the campaign told us the senator was referring to a report from the organisation for economic co operation and development but that report ranks the u s seventh in relative childhood poverty among the 38 countries listed turkey israel mexico greece romania and bulgaria all had higher rates of child poverty than the u s in the oecd s ranking it s also worth noting that relative poverty is a measure of household disposable income relative to others in that country clinton erred when she said real wages haven t risen in nearly 15 years clinton w ages adjusted for inflation haven t risen since the turn of the last century that s not true according to the most recent figures from the bureau of labor statistics real average weekly earnings of rank and file workers were 7 2 percent higher in september than they were in december 1999 furthermore real weekly wages have jumped 2 3 percent in the most recent 12 months alone sanders repeated one of his campaign trail talking points but we are going to end the absurdity as warren buffet often remind us that billionaires pay an effective tax rate lower than nurses or truck drivers that s the case for some in those professions compared with billionaires who earn their money through investments but it s not accurate for all in fact a truck driver would have to earnmore than the median salary to pay a higher effective rate we previously ran the calculations for several different hypothetical nurses and truck drivers and firefighters and police officers who have also been part of this sanders claim comparing total effective tax rates including payroll taxes to what an investment fund manager would pay if only paying capital gains tax rates on earnings the billionaire fund manager would pay 23 8 percent the top capital gains ratefor income above 413 200 for individuals anda 3 8 percent medicare surcharge tax on investment income for those earning more than 200 000 a truck driver earning the median income for the profession 39 520 wouldn t pay a higher rate then the fund manager s 23 8 percent but if that truck driver earned a higher salary such as the average pay in peabody massachusetts 57 250 and was single with no dependents he or she would pay an effective tax rate of 26 percent higher than the fund manager if that truck driver had one dependent child however the rate would drop to 21 percent as for nurses the median salary is much higher 66 640 a single nurse with no dependents would have a 28 percent effective tax rate with that salary but once we add a dependent child or a nonworking spouse or both the nurse s rate sinks below that of the wealthy fund manager if the billionaire fund managers earnings were taxed at regular income tax rates he or she would pay a higher rate most marginal income tax rates are higher than capital gains rates with individual income between about 37 000 and 90 000 at the 25 percent rate for 2015 the top income tax rate is 39 6 percent which starts after income surpasses 413 200 o malley lumped princeton economist alan krueger in with what he called economists on wall street krueger is not a wall street economist o malley made his remarks when he had a disagreement with clinton over how much to raise the minimum wage o malley supports raising it to 15 per hour clinton has proposed 12 per hour and she cited princeton economist alan krueger s support for her proposal and concern for increasing the minimum to 15 per hour o malley i think we need to stop taking our advice from economists on wall street clinton he s not wall street o malley and start taking advice clinton that s not fair he s a progressive economist o malley is wrong about krueger s background it is entirely in academia and education krueger graduated with adoctoratein economics from harvard university in 1987 since 1987 he has held a joint appointment in the economics department and woodrow wilson school at princeton university according to his biography on the university website krueger also has held top positions in government including chairman of the council of economic advisers under president barack obama and chief economist at the department of labor under president bill clinton his full curriculum vitae can be found here o malley claimed that maryland was the only state that went four consecutive years without an increase in college tuition that s no longer the case o malley we were the only state to go four years in a row without a penny s increase to college tuition yes as governor o malley did sign bills implementing a tuition freeze at public universities in maryland that lasted from 2007 until 2010 but maine has now matched what maryland once achieved in march of this year the university of mainesystem board of trustees again voted to freeze in state tuition at its seven member schools that means the school system has now gone four years without an increase in tuition at its public universities by brooks jackson robert farley lori robertson d angelo gore andeugene kiely geewax marilyn jfk s lasting economic legacy lower tax rates npr 14 nov 2013
