senate races acknowledged that o rourke and abrams would be strong senate candidates but argued that their high name id is a result of the work they put into the 2018 campaign cycle and that other candidates can do the same texas and georgia are fundamentally competitive regardless of who the democratic candidate is it takes time to build up your name id it took beto o rourke and stacey abrams two years to do that said the strategist a poll commissioned by the democratic senatorial campaign committee published in late april showed on a generic ballot test voters in georgia are more likely
