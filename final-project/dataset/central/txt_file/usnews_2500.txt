donald trump earned billions in free publicity during the 2016 election defeating a crowded field of more experienced rivals to win the nomination and then the presidency so far none of the people seeking to replace him are trying the same strategy nine of the 23 democratic presidential candidates took the stage at the poor people s campaign forum in washington monday the latest cattle call event in which the historically crowded field failed to make a splash even with several candidates struggling to break out of the bottom tier in polling they stuck to the script discussing their policy proposals and between the lines promising a return to normalcy if elected in 2016 we got the hunger games and look we re paying the price for those showy tactics it s a question of do we want showmanship or leadership california rep eric swalwell one of the presidential candidates told time after the event i submit that most of our candidates are pretty serious and would bring leadership these are serious issues and we ll leave the showmanship to the president and it will be a one term presidency to be sure trump had a few advantages in 2016 as a reality tv star and longtime cable news guest he had little trouble getting booked his ideological flexibility and willingness to brush aside political norms meant he was always surprising and the republican grassroots liked his brash approach trump s remarks were sometimes sexist and racist which only fueled further publicity and his success spurred others in the field to even more dramatic remarks with wisconsin gov scott walker pledging to wreak havoc on washington florida sen marco rubio mocking trump s hand size and south carolina sen lindsey graham calling trump a jackass by contrast many of the democratic contenders are relative unknowns looking to persuade voters upset by trump s norm breaking behavior and the democratic grassroots wants to hear serious policy solutions for major problems monday s forum which was not intended to be solely a democratic event showcased the difference before the event began organizers encouraged people in the audience to put their phones away and take notes on what the speakers were saying candidates there spent time addressing everything from climate change and the disproportionate effect it has on low income individuals to military spending and how they would instead use some of those federal dollars massachusetts sen elizabeth warren said she would be ok with getting rid of the filibuster if republicans kept using it as an obstructionist tool and vermont sen bernie sanders repeated his support of voting rights for incarcerated felons they even held off on any direct criticism of former vice president joe biden who said that if he s the nominee he thinks he can win georgia north carolina south carolina and possibly even florida and texas who was the first speaker at the event and has so far been the breakaway frontrunner in polls the focus on issues has come as a relief to many voters planning on supporting a democrat the way that i m feeling as a voter i think that that whole showboat we ve already seen that and that kind of got us to where we are and it s kind of a turnoff at this point at least for me said vidale watson 23 of washington the whole showboating and have to be the fly like cool one the joke iest one of all i don t think that s what we want to see anymore write to lissandra villa at lissandra villa time com
