as democratic presidential hopefuls unroll their platforms for the 2020 presidential election some of the hot button issues they re discussing such as immigration and healthcare will sound familiar from past presidential races but one idea that has popped up in the campaigns of sen elizabeth warren sen kirsten gillibrand mayor pete buttigieg beto o rourke and others may be unexpected changing or abolishing the electoral college in some ways it s not actually surprising that more attention is being paid to the electoral college two of the last three u s presidents donald trump and george w bush were elected to their position without winning the popular vote that s possible because when americans cast their ballots in a presidential election every four years they re not voting directly for president but rather for electors who promise to vote for a particular candidate the electors from all the states come together to form the electoral college and select the president because of the way the number of electors per state is determined an individual vote from a sparsely populated state is worth more in the final count than a vote from a densely populated state so it s possible to win the electoral college vote while losing the popular vote some 2020 candidates argue that abolishing the electoral college would bring the country closer to the ideal of one person one vote proponents also argue that the process would increase voter participation especially in states that are deeply red or blue whereas some voters today are left feeling that their vote cannot affect the result every vote matters and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting and that means get rid of the electoral college warren said during a cnn town hall a slight majority of americans agree about 53 of american are in favor of a constitutional amendment to require a popular vote compared to 43 who agree with maintaining the electoral college according to a survey by nbc news and the wall street journal however abolishing the electoral college has become more of a partisan issue since the 2016 election according to gallup in 2012 54 of republicans and 69 of democrats were in favor of amending the constitution by late november 2016 19 of republicans and 81 of democrats were in favor of such a constitutional change reasons for supporting the electoral college have shifted over time some today argue that the electoral college encourages candidates to campaign across more diverse geographical areas and helps by breaking down the complex process of voting into more manageable areas back when the constitution was being written however the process was a compromise between those who believed the president should be elected by congress and those who thought the chief executive should be elected by a majority of the people the framers were also concerned that it might be difficult for voters to learn enough about presidential candidates the system also gave greater power to more sparsely populated states and to states with many slaves states were able to count enslaved persons toward their populations without giving them the right to vote or even counting them as full people and as constitutional scholar akhil reed amar has argued on time com the process gave the country a pro slavery tilt for 32 of the county s 36 first years a white slaveholder from virginia was president defenders of the electoral college also have a major advantage the process is enshrined in the constitution which means that a constitutional amendment would be necessary to change it there is a precedent for changing the system the 12th amendment clarified the distinction between the electors votes for president and vice president and the 23rd amendment gave washington d c the right to electoral votes but that doesn t make it easy no matter whether the electoral college changes or stays in place however the electoral college has already left an indelible mark on some of the most consequential moments in american history determining who was in power during the sept 11 attacks and the reconstruction period after the civil war here s a full list of presidents elected by the electoral college without winning the popular vote modern elections have been known to get ugly but the election of 1876 may be the most contentious race ever when rutherford b hayes the republican governor of ohio took on new york democrat samuel tilden the claws came out for example rumors circulated that tilden was single because he had syphilis the election is also the only race in american history which the victor initially won both fewer electoral votes and fewer popular votes than his opponent tilden won 184 electoral votes one shy of the number needed to win to hayes 165 votes however the election was riddled with voter fraud and suppression in the post civil war south after the election the validity of the votes in louisiana florida south carolina and oregon was challenged congress ultimately came up with a special commission composed of 15 congressmen and supreme court justices who were tasked with devising a solution the commission s decision became known as the compromise of 1877 which effectively put an end to the reconstruction era in the south in exchange for democrats allowing hayes the white house victory republicans agreed to remove all federal troops from the south leaving democrats free to reclaim control of the region and local governments to subjugate african americans who had so recently been freed from slavery ultimately the electoral college vote was decided to be 185 to 184 in hayes favor with tilden winning 254 000 more popular votes the election of benjamin harrison an indiana senator and republican over democratic president grover cleveland was also riddled by corruption both parties were accused of using floaters citizens who were willing to sell their votes to sway the election public attention was drawn to the practice after an indiana newspaper published a letter apparently written by a republican national committee official which instructed party workers on how to handle floaters harrison whose campaign was better organized was able to capture indiana his home state even though it had gone to cleveland in the previous election cleveland captured nearly 91 000 more popular votes but lost the electoral college to harrison with a vote of 168 to 233 cleveland got his revenge four years later however when he defeated harrison with an electoral vote of 277 to 145 he became the only president to serve two non consecutive terms it took 112 years for there to be another election where the victor won fewer popular votes in 2000 vice president al gore took on george w bush the governor of texas and the son of the 41st president bush won 271 electoral votes to gore s 266 votes but gore won 500 000 more popular votes the election was so close in oregon and new mexico that the victor wasn t called for a few days but the real test came in florida the race was so close that florida law required the votes to be recounted and then the florida supreme court further ordered that ballots in four counties needed to be counted again however on dec 12 2000 the u s supreme court voted 5 to 4 that the florida supreme court s ruling was unconstitutional because not counting ballots by uniform methods violates the 14th amendment s equal protection clause despite the uncertainty surrounding the election ultimately most americans did not feel that the events had undermined their sense of the legitimacy of either the supreme court or bush according to polling by gallup about 66 of americans told pollers that the election did not undermine their respect for the court and 83 said they d accept bush as the legitimate president however another institution did take a hit to its reputation the electoral college on dec 15 and dec 17 2000 59 of americans said that the constitution should be amended so that the candidate who wins the most votes nationwide wins the presidency in later years gore joined that majority in 2016 he told nbc news that he believes that the electoral college should be eliminated to encourage voter participation we ve got to get back to harvesting the wisdom of crowds in the united states we ve got to get back to the kind of conversation of democracy that allows good ideas to rise to the surface he said our democracy has been hacked now it s pathetic how our system is not working today in an election that surprised many political experts and pollsters real estate mogul donald trump defeated former secretary of state hillary clinton taking in 304 electoral votes to clinton s 227 votes however clinton took in 2 8 million more popular votes while the full impact of the election remains to be seen it quickly generated conversation especially among democrats about changing the electoral college clinton had called for the abolition of the electoral college after gore s 2000 loss she reiterated this position after her own defeat we ve moved toward one person one vote that s how we select winners clinton said in september of 2017 although trump had previously criticized the electoral college process he seemed to change his mind after his victory the electoral college is actually genius in that it brings all states including the smaller ones into play campaigning is much different trump tweeted on nov 15 2016 but he said he thought he could have campaigned just as well in a popular vote system so he didn t believe that the electoral college affected the outcome much at all write to tara law at tara law time com
