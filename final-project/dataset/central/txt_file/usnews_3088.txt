launched the great american comeback tonight i stand before you to share the incredible results jobs are booming incomes are soaring poverty is plummeting crime is falling confidence is surging and our country is thriving and highly respected again america s enemies are on the run america s fortunes are on the rise and america s future is blazing bright the years of economic decay are over the days of our country being used taken advantage of and even scorned by other nations are long behind us gone too are the broken promises jobless recoveries tired platitudes and constant excuses for the depletion of american wealth power and prestige in just 3 short years we have shattered the mentality of american decline and we have rejected the downsizing of america s destiny we are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never going back i am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been our military is completely rebuilt with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world and it is not even close our borders are secure our families are flourishing our values are renewed our pride is restored and for all these reasons i say to the people of our great country and to the members of congress before me the state of our union is stronger than ever before the vision i will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world s most prosperous and inclusive society one where every citizen can join in america s unparalleled success and where every community can take part in america s extraordinary rise from the instant i took office i moved rapidly to revive the united states economy slashing a record number of job killing regulations enacting historic and record setting tax cuts and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements our agenda is relentlessly pro worker pro family pro growth and most of all pro american we are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race color religion and creed since my election we have created 7 million new jobs 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration the unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century incredibly the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country if we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration the world would not now be witness to america s great economic success the unemployment rates for african americans hispanic americans and asian americans have reached the lowest levels in history african american youth unemployment has reached an all time low african american poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded the unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years and last year women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added the veterans unemployment rate dropped to a record low the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all time low workers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in united states history a record number of young americans are now employed under the last administration more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls under my administration 7 million americans have come off of food stamps and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare in 8 years under the last administration over 300 000 working age people dropped out of the workforce in just 3 years of my administration 3 5 million working age people have joined the workforce since my election the net worth of the bottom half of wage earners has increased by 47 percent 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent after decades of flat and falling incomes wages are rising fast and wonderfully they are rising fastest for low income workers who have seen a 16 percent pay increase since my election this is a blue collar boom real median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded since my election united states stock markets have soared 70 percent adding more than 12 trillion to our nation s wealth transcending anything anyone believed was possible this as other countries are not doing well consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights all of those millions of people with 401 k s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60 70 80 90 and even 100 percent jobs and investment are pouring into 9 000 previously neglected neighborhoods thanks to opportunity zones a plan spearheaded by senator tim scott as part of our great republican tax cuts in other words wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades creating jobs energy and excitement this is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this it is all working opportunity zones are helping americans like army veteran tony rankins from cincinnati ohio after struggling with drug addiction tony lost his job his house and his family he was homeless but then tony found a construction company that invests in opportunity zones he is now a top tradesman drug free reunited with his family and he is here tonight tony keep up the great work our roaring economy has for the first time ever given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start this second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law everybody said that criminal justice reform could not be done but i got it done and the people in this room got it done thanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign the united states has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world by far with the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years america is now energy independent and energy jobs like so many elements of our country are at a record high we are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago likewise we are restoring our nation s manufacturing might even though predictions were that this could never be done after losing 60 000 factories under the previous two administrations america has now gained 12 000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built we have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs companies are not leaving they are coming back everybody wants to be where the action is and the united states of america is indeed where the action is one of the single biggest promises i made to the american people was to replace the disastrous nafta trade deal in fact unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that i decided to run for president following nafta s adoption our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs many politicians came and went pledging to change or replace nafta only to do absolutely nothing but unlike so many who came before me i keep my promises six days ago i replaced nafta and signed the brand new united states mexico canada agreement usmca into law the usmca will create nearly 100 000 new high paying american auto jobs and massively boost exports for our farmers ranchers and factory workers it will also bring trade with mexico and canada to a much higher degree but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity this is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of america s labor unions i also promised our citizens that i would impose tariffs to confront china s massive theft of american jobs our strategy worked days ago we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with china that will defend our workers protect our intellectual property bring billions of dollars into our treasury and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the united states of america for decades china has taken advantage of the united states now we have changed that but at the same time we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with china including with president xi they respect what we have done because quite frankly they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year decade after decade without someone in our country stepping up and saying enough now we want to rebuild our country and that is what we are doing as we restore american leadership throughout the world we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere that is why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on cuba we are supporting the hopes of cubans nicaraguans and venezuelans to restore democracy the united states is leading a 59 nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of venezuela nicol s maduro maduro is an illegitimate ruler a tyrant who brutalizes his people but maduro s grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes dreams and aspirations of all venezuelans joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate president of venezuela juan guaid mr president please take this message back to your homeland all americans are united with the venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom socialism destroys nations but always remember freedom unifies the soul to safeguard american liberty we have invested a record breaking 2 2 trillion in the united states military we have purchased the finest planes missiles rockets ships and every other form of military equipment all made in the united states of america we are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share i have raised contributions from the other nato members by more than 400 billion and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled and just weeks ago for the first time since president truman established the air force more than 70 years earlier we created a new branch of the united states armed forces the space force in the gallery tonight we have one of the space force s youngest potential recruits 13 year old iain lanphier an eighth grader from arizona iain has always dreamed of going to space he was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy he aspires to go to the air force academy and then he has his eye on the space force as iain says most people look up at space i want to look down on the world sitting beside iain tonight is his great hero charles mcgee was born in cleveland ohio one century ago charles is one of the last surviving tuskegee airmen the first black fighter pilots and he also happens to be iain s great grandfather after more than 130 combat missions in world war ii he came back to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve america in korea and vietnam on december 7th charles celebrated his 100th birthday a few weeks ago i signed a bill promoting charles mcgee to brigadier general and earlier today i pinned the stars on his shoulders in the oval office general mcgee our nation salutes you from the pilgrims to our founders from the soldiers at valley forge to the marchers at selma and from president lincoln to the reverend dr martin luther king jr americans have always rejected limits on our children s future members of congress we must never forget that the only victories that matter in washington are victories that deliver for the american people the people are the heart of our country their dreams are the soul of our country and their love is what powers and sustains our country we must always remember that our job is to put america first the next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young american gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the american dream yet for too long countless american children have been trapped in failing government schools to rescue these students 18 states have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships the programs are so popular that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists one of those students is janiyah davis a fourth grader from philadelphia janiyah s mom stephanie is a single parent she would do anything to give her daughter a better future but last year that future was put further out of reach when pennsylvania s governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50 000 children janiyah and stephanie are in the gallery this evening but there is more to their story janiyah i am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over i can proudly announce tonight that an opportunity scholarship has become available it is going to you and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice now i call on the congress to give 1 million american children the same opportunity janiyah has just received pass the education freedom scholarships and opportunity act because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school every young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow for this reason our magnificent first lady has launched the be best initiative to advance a safe healthy supportive and drug free life for the next generation online in school and in our communities thank you melania for your extraordinary love and profound care for america s children my administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background through our pledge to american workers over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million americans my budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation s high schools tonight i ask the congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in america to expand equal opportunity i am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation s historically black colleges and universities a good life for american families also requires the most affordable innovative and high quality healthcare system on earth before i took office health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years i moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive i have also made an ironclad pledge to american families we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions that is a guarantee and we will always protect your medicare and your social security the american patient should never be blindsided by medical bills that is why i signed an executive order requiring price transparency many experts believe that transparency which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year will be even bigger than healthcare reform it will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care but as we work to improve americans healthcare there are those who want to take away your healthcare take away your doctor and abolish private insurance entirely one hundred thirty two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million americans to those watching at home tonight i want you to know we will never let socialism destroy american healthcare over 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders these proposals would raid the medicare benefits our seniors depend on while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration this is what is happening in california and other states their systems are totally out of control costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money if forcing american taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you then stand with the radical left but if you believe that we should defend american patients and american seniors then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens this will be a tremendous boon to our already very strongly guarded southern border where as we speak a long tall and very powerful wall is being built we have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year my administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies we have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs and medicines are being approved by the fda at a faster clip than ever before i was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years the cost of prescription drugs actually went down and working together the congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels i have been speaking to senator chuck grassley of iowa and others in the congress in order to get something on drug pricing done and done properly i am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices get a bill to my desk and i will sign it into law without delay with unyielding commitment we are curbing the opioid epidemic drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years among the states hardest hit ohio is down 22 percent pennsylvania is down 18 percent wisconsin is down 10 percent and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all protecting americans health also means fighting infectious diseases we are coordinating with the chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in china my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat we have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for americans with kidney disease alzheimer s and those struggling with mental health challenges and because the congress funded my request we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer and we will eradicate the aids epidemic in america by the end of the decade almost every american family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness here tonight is a special man someone beloved by millions of americans who just received a stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis this is not good news but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet rush limbaugh thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country rush in recognition of all that you have done for our nation the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity i am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country s highest civilian honor the presidential medal of freedom i will now ask the first lady of the united states to please stand and present you with the honor rush kathryn congratulations as we pray for all who are sick we know that america is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs in 2017 doctors at st luke s hospital in kansas city delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive born at just 21 weeks and 6 days and weighing less than a pound ellie schneider was born a fighter through the skill of her doctors and the prayers of her parents little ellie kept on winning the battle for life today ellie is a strong healthy 2 year old girl sitting with her amazing mother robin in the gallery ellie and robin we are so glad you are here ellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life thanks to modern medical wonders 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where ellie was born now survive our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like ellie that is why i am asking the congress to provide an additional 50 million to fund neo natal research for america s youngest patients that is also why i am calling upon the members of congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late term abortion of babies whether we are republican democrat or independent surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from god as we support america s moms and dads i was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave serving as a model for the rest of the country now i call on the congress to pass the bipartisan advancing support for working families act extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the nation forty million american families have an average 2 200 extra thanks to our child tax credit i have also overseen historic funding increases for high quality child care enabling 17 states to serve more children many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether and i sent the congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high quality childcare and urge you to act immediately to protect the environment days ago i announced that the united states will join the one trillion trees initiative an ambitious effort to bring together government and the private sector to plant new trees in america and around the world we must also rebuild america s infrastructure i ask you to pass senator barrasso s highway bill to invest in new roads bridges and tunnels across our land i am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high speed internet including rural america a better tomorrow for all americans also requires us to keep america safe that means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level including our nation s heroic ice officers last year our brave ice officers arrested more than 120 000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10 000 burglaries 5 000 sexual assaults 45 000 violent assaults and 2 000 murders tragically there are many cities in america where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens in sanctuary cities local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public instead of handing them over to ice to be safely removed just 29 days ago a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of new york was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92 year old woman the killer had been previously arrested for assault but under new york s sanctuary policies he was set free if the city had honored ice s detainer request his victim would be alive today the state of california passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants with catastrophic results here is just one tragic example in december 2018 california police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests including convictions for robbery and assault but as required by california s sanctuary law local authorities released him days later the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence he viciously shot one man going about his daily work he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest he walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon he hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles critically injuring innocent victims one of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51 year old american named rocky jones rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range murdering him in cold blood rocky left behind a devoted family including his brothers who loved him more than anything one of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight jody would you please stand jody our hearts weep for your loss and we will not rest until you have justice senator thom tillis has introduced legislation to allow americans like jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies i ask the congress to pass the justice for victims of sanctuary cities act immediately the united states of america should be a sanctuary for law abiding americans not criminal aliens in the last 3 years ice has arrested over 5 000 wicked human traffickers and i have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking domestically and around the globe my administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the united states before i came into office if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested you were simply released and allowed into our country never to be seen again my administration has ended catch and release if you come illegally you will now be promptly removed we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of mexico honduras el salvador and guatemala as a result of our unprecedented efforts illegal crossings are down 75 percent since may dropping 8 straight months in a row and as the wall goes up drug seizures rise and border crossings go down last year i traveled to the border in texas and met chief patrol agent raul ortiz over the last 24 months agent ortiz and his team have seized more than 200 000 pounds of poisonous narcotics arrested more than 3 000 human smugglers and rescued more than 2 000 migrants days ago agent ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of border patrol and he joins us tonight chief ortiz please stand a grateful nation thanks you and all the heroes of border patrol to build on these historic gains we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit welcoming those who follow the rules contribute to our economy support themselves financially and uphold our values with every action my administration is restoring the rule of law and re asserting the culture of american freedom working with senate majority leader mcconnell and his colleagues in the senate we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written this includes two brilliant new supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh my administration is also defending religious liberty and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools in america we do not punish prayer we do not tear down crosses we do not ban symbols of faith we do not muzzle preachers and pastors in america we celebrate faith we cherish religion we lift our voices in prayer and we raise our sights to the glory of god just as we believe in the first amendment we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country so long as i am president i will always protect your second amendment right to keep and bear arms in reaffirming our heritage as a free nation we must remember that america has always been a frontier nation now we must embrace the next frontier america s manifest destiny in the stars i am asking the congress to fully fund the artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be american astronauts using this as a launching pad to ensure that america is the first nation to plant its flag on mars my administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical islamic terrorism last week i announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between israel and the palestinians recognizing that all past attempts have failed we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future three years ago the barbarians of isis held over 20 000 square miles of territory in iraq and syria today the isis territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed and the founder and leader of isis the bloodthirsty killer al baghdadi is dead we are joined this evening by carl and marsha mueller after graduating from college their beautiful daughter kayla became a humanitarian aid worker kayla once wrote some people find god in church some people find god in nature some people find god in love i find god in suffering i ve known for some time what my life s work is using my hands as tools to relieve suffering in 2013 while caring for suffering civilians in syria kayla was kidnapped tortured and enslaved by isis and kept as a prisoner of al baghdadi himself after more than 500 horrifying days of captivity al baghdadi murdered young kayla she was just 26 years old on the night that united states special forces operators ended al baghdadi s miserable life the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general mark milley received a call in the situation room he was told that the brave men of the elite special forces team that so perfectly carried out the operation had given their mission a name task force 8 14 it was a reference to a special day august 14th kayla s birthday carl and marsha america s warriors never forgot kayla and neither will we every day america s men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart one of these american heroes was army staff sergeant christopher hake on his second deployment to iraq in 2008 sergeant hake wrote a letter to his 1 year old son gage i will be with you again he wrote to gage i will teach you to ride your first bike build your first sand box watch you play sports and see you have kids also i love you son take care of your mother i am always with you dad on easter sunday of 2008 chris was out on patrol in baghdad when his bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb that night he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country sergeant hake now rests in eternal glory in arlington and his wife kelli is in the gallery tonight joined by their son who is now 13 years old to kelli and gage chris will live in our hearts forever the terrorist responsible for killing sergeant hake was qasem soleimani who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took chris s life soleimani was the iranian regime s most ruthless butcher a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of american service members in iraq as the world s top terrorist soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men women and children he directed the december assault on united states forces in iraq and was actively planning new attacks that is why last month at my direction the united states military executed a flawless precision strike that killed soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever our message to the terrorists is clear you will never escape american justice if you attack our citizens you forfeit your life in recent months we have seen proud iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers the iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons stop spreading terror death and destruction and start working for the good of its own people because of our powerful sanctions the iranian economy is doing very poorly we can help them make it very good in a short period of time but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help we are here let s see which road they choose it is totally up to them as we defend american lives we are working to end america s wars in the middle east in afghanistan the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress and peace talks are underway i am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in afghanistan many of them innocent it is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency these are warfighters the best in the world and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all we are working to finally end america s longest war and bring our troops back home war places a heavy burden on our nation s extraordinary military families especially spouses like amy williams from fort bragg north carolina and her 2 children 6 year old elliana and 3 year old rowan amy works full time and volunteers countless hours helping other military families for the past 7 months she has done it all while her husband sergeant first class townsend williams is in afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the middle east amy s kids have not seen their father s face in many months amy your family s sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace we thank you as the world
