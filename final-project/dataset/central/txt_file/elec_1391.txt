times in the next few months we ll travel to a battleground state then to a vital county in each state in that county we find a starting point for our visit first and main streets the intersection of

the mother of three she wears sneakers and a gray t shirt her face dimples when she smiles her husband works as a chef and she s a stay at home mom in this area called new tampa where suburban style developments spread out for miles this neighborhood has stone countertops high ceilings and lush florida palm trees in the yards it looks beautiful but we have issues kos says i mean there s issues in every single place you see in here this is the kind of area where the real estate market soared then collapsed during the financial crisis things feel like they re finally kind of settling in she says people you know kind of took their losses and started making do with what they had a lot of people did lose their houses we had friends that had to move away we had six to nine foreclosures in our

with fluctuating home prices like everybody else she says she looked up how much her home is now worth because we move around we know we have another move we know we re going to lose some more money she says so it s kind of tough it takes time and as she wipes a little sweat from her face on this humid afternoon kos thinks of how the neighborhood has become unfamiliar lot of houses are rentals now you know people have moved out and have rented their houses she says couldn t sell the houses so they started renting them we don t know who they re letting in in the last election she says she voted for president obama and then she laughs because she doesn t like to get into political fights this time around she says she s on the fence usually my husband and i have a huge conversation and we sit down and we go through our pros and cons and we go through who our candidates are and we try our hardest she says they both decided on obama in 2008 she says i think he came in he thought he could do so much and everybody we wanted to believe this and we thought it was possible but like everything it takes time she says but she s not disappointed in the president i tend to understand she says when you try really hard but you know but there s just so much you can do she adds i don t know if i m a fan of obamacare she hasn t quite figured out what it means for her all she knows is that she gets all kinds of paperwork if she goes to the hospital now a very scary place on social issues she s with the president she got in a big argument on facebook the other day over chick fil a the restaurant chain whose president spoke out against gay marriage she insists she is an undecided voter for now which according to surveys would make her one of the nation s very few but she does not start out with a positive impression of the republican alternative mitt romney i just question too many things about him she says in the coming months kos and her husband will be talking through their decision once again just as they did four years ago this time around her decision will be an emotional one because as she votes for president she is voting for a commander in chief her son s commander in chief my son who s 20 has just joined the army and that is it s scary she says he s going to leave for basic training sept 11 not sept 10 not sept 12 sept 11 and he chose it and he wanted it and he thought it was for him and he fought for it i mean we went back and forth for almost 10 months and for a mom who i was a single mom for a while and to work as hard as i did for him to choose it she breaks off in tears the future is it s a very scary place and with that kos and her daughter sofia go back to cleaning the paint out of the garage so that s my life she says with a laugh you guys got
