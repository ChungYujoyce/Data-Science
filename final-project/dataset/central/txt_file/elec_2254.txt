 democrat cory booker dropped out of the presidential race monday ap news the left notes booker s strengths and is surprised that he didn t make more headway with voters booker is a mesmerizing orator in my view more compelling a speaker than any of the other democrats running he presents the story of his own life as an allegory of the best that this country can be his destiny was changed by a white man a volunteer lawyer who helped his parents buy the home of their dreams at a time when new jersey real estate agents steered african americans away from white neighborhoods booker uses the word grace frequently and calls for a courageous empathy his problem was not that he lacked a solid operation booker had a talented campaign team and a good organization albeit one that ran out of money as his prospects dimmed what was really misplaced sadly was faith that his uplifting message could be heard in the ugly moment we are in karen tumulty washington post dated but relevant maybe it s that he can come off like he s trying too hard maybe he s just too weird a confection of traits a vegan star trek fanboy who still lives in inner city newark while courting wall street and dating the actress rosario dawson to connect with a broad cross section of voters or maybe he s being subjected to a kind of second order racism it s not that voters are opposed to putting another black man in the white house it s that they re afraid other voters won t be willing to put another black man in the white house a sort of racist prisoner s dilemma edward isaac dovere the atlantic many posit that despite introducing notable policies on gun control criminal justice reform and the racial wealth gap booker s candidacy lacked a defining issue or position on the ideological spectrum in a contest defined more by the divide between the progressive and moderate wings of the democratic party but his campaign also suffered from factors beyond its control in a historically diverse field mr booker struggled for attention amid the excitement of new candidates like senator kamala harris of california who allowed voters to imagine a black woman as president or mayor pete buttigieg of south bend ind whose campaign as an openly gay man is also historic nick corasaniti new york times there is also the unusual nature of the incumbent bernie sanders and tom steyer insist that it will take an unconventional candidate to defeat trump meanwhile middle of the road candidates such as joe biden and sen amy klobuchar d minn say voters are hungry for a return to normalcy booker and the other folks who ve fallen by the wayside represented neither a complete break with convention except for williamson who proved that simply being unconventional isn t enough nor a pendulum swing back to the salad days of pragmatic policymaking and bipartisan governing of the clinton presidency jon healey los angeles times there is a moral radicalism to the way cory booker lives out his politics he lived for years in a housing project he leads hunger strikes he challenges political machines he s a vegan he has a more ambitious policy vision than is often discussed but beneath that is a far more radical ethical vision than he gets credit for the problem is that while he s comfortable saying what that ethical vision demands of him he s very uncomfortable saying what it demands of the rest of us booker is trying to craft a politics of love and reconciliation in a time of conflict and confrontation but how do you fight and heal simultaneously if you need to create friction to get attention how do you not feed the thing you think is ripping the country apart the race will be poorer for booker s absence there s something he was trying to say that i think the country would benefit from hearing i hope he figures out how to say it more clearly and we get more opportunities to listen ezra klein vox the right is critical of booker s campaign strategy and the media s focus on his race the right is critical of booker s campaign strategy and the media s focus on his race perhaps the most interesting thing to say about booker s campaign is that he s a vivid illustration of how the traits that make a politician interesting for media profiles don t always translate into actual support on the trail booker was the multiracial vegan former standout stanford tight end who had been the subject of oscar nominated documentaries and generated tales of heroics as mayor of newark despite all that booker could often come across as boring his debate one liners and applause lines were so perfectly rehearsed that they came across as cloying his signature move in the debate was to wait until an argument between two other candidates had started to get interesting and impassioned and then interject with a disapproving this kind of infighting is just what the republicans want to see but this kind of infighting was also a serious disagreement about which policy direction was right for the democratic party which is precisely the sort of thing a presidential primary is supposed to sort out jim geraghty national review booker s campaign failed to make a significant impression on black voters progressive voters or older establishment voters perhaps that s because his message was so unoriginal even his signature policy gun control was associated more with beto o rourke s campaign than with booker s and many of booker s other proposals have been dominated by warren and sanders kaylee mcghee washington examiner here s a guy who was a high school football all american went to stanford earned a rhodes scholarship to oxford graduated from yale law school served two terms as the mayor of a medium sized city almost three times larger than south bend ind and has twice been elected to the united states senate but what the mainstream media really wants you to take away here is that he s a black guy he did all those amazing things and the media s response is to reduce booker to his race no wonder he had to drop out by a literal interpretation of identity politics the debate ended up as quite diverse by any empirical standard when compared to recent history two women two men of jewish ancestry the son of taiwanese immigrants and one roman catholic but as the media says of booker and as booker said of harris and julian castro before him some diversity is more diverse than others chris stirewalt fox news are rank and file black democrats distressed by the absence of debaters who share their skin color i doubt it black democrats have not supported black presidential candidates in this cycle they prefer the very white joe biden the fact is that if black democrats supported booker in large numbers he would be on the stage if they had supported kamala harris in large numbers she wouldn t have seen the need to quit the race and she would be on the stage but black democrats seem to be largely color blind when it comes to evaluating this cycle s crop of candidates bless them for that paul mirengoff power line blog cory booker has run a campaign centered on love in a political era with little time for it most of the democratic candidates vie to see who can denounce president donald j trump in more florid terms for former vice president joe biden mr trump is destroying the soul of america for mr sanders he is a racist mr trump hits right back accusing the democrats of embracing socialism crime and even terrorism mr booker on the other hand says he loves donald trump not his policies or his personality he just says he won t be drawn into the hateful morass that constitutes american politics in the year 2020 love manifestly isn t selling alas editorial board washington times 17 year old discovers planet 6 9 times larger than earth on
