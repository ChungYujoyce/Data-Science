the chinese stock market had been open only 3 hours on the first trading day of the year when it began to implode a sharp depreciation in the chinese currency and bad news from the manufacturing sector prompted a rapid plunge in stocks the 7 drop was so severe it triggered so called circuit breakers electronic hand brakes of sorts that stop trading if stocks tumble too quickly the brakes were supposed to halt panic but instead they spooked the financial world london new york city and other global markets dipped sharply after they opened as nervous traders mulled worrisome cues from the world s second largest economy many remembered keenly similar china bred market turmoil last august markets eventually stabilized after chinese national champions big state run firms and funds went on a beijing directed buying spree but by jan 7 the chinese markets were crashing again this time only 12 minutes after opening triggering more circuit breakers authorities tried to get the shanghai and shenzhen exchanges up and running just a few minutes later at 9 59 a m two minutes after trading resumed they were down again the chinese currency was in free fall and normally cautious chinese policymakers were lurching about for the right moves to stabilize markets again worldwide exchanges recorded big opening losses and global investors struggled to understand what was happening in this usually predictable state run economy in the end the global economy ushered in 2016 with wall street s worst five day start in history one killer new year s hangover and yet as far as stock market crashes go this wasn t a disaster of lehman brothers proportions after all chinese stocks make up a minuscule portion of the global equity markets and the chinese have a ring fenced state run banking system this wasn t a too big to fail event indeed a number of global markets including the u s rebounded relatively quickly once it was clear that chinese central bankers and regulators were standing by as per usual to buoy markets in one way or another at least for the time being still especially if you have had the courage to look at your 401 k recently you could be forgiven for asking what the hell is going on the world after all is seven years into economic expansion america has been in a steady if thrill less economic recovery since 2009 and the most recent u s jobs numbers were great finally driving unemployment down to normal levels president barack obama wasn t wrong to wax about the resilience of the american economy during his final state of the union address on jan 12 and yet there has been more stock market volatility over the past few months than in all of the past several years combined here s the hard truth you must accept to understand what s happening in global markets these days the problems that caused the great recession were never really fixed debt which is always the root of financial crises and their resulting recessions didn t go away it just found new places to flourish around the world back in 2008 the u s had a debt bubble driven by a gonzo real estate market that exploded and brought global markets low today china has cooked up its own epic debt bubble which has grown at about three times the rate that the subprime bubble did the pace of debt run up is the best measure of the danger it can cause it also has its roots in real estate not to mention a financial system even more dysfunctional than the one the u s has and a political system equally hamstrung by vested interests china s debt bubble is now popping and the country that has made up the largest single chunk of global growth over the past several years is in a major slowdown one that is for all intents and purposes a recession that along with growing worries that china s once lauded economic technocrats may not be able to fix things has destabilized global markets the result is a metastasizing crisis that doesn t give a fig for international borders or show any signs of slowing the measure of normalcy in the global economy over the past few years was guaranteed by a period of unprecedentedly low interest rates it was also helped along by a 29 trillion infusion of public cash into private markets in practically every nation engineered by the world s governments and central banks the u s federal reserve first and foremost propped up growth following the financial crisis but the fed s money dump known as quantitative easing ended more than a year ago that s when markets got jittery in december fed chair janet yellen and other central bank governors drew another line in the sand with the first u s interest rate hike since 2006 market volatility has been elevated since then when rates rise it s supposed to mean the economy is getting stronger which in the u s it has been at least in terms of job creation but as too many americans know too well there is little or no real wage growth which is very unusual at this point in an expansion that is especially problematic in an economy like the u s s 70 of which is consumer spending there are more jobs but not the kind that put more money in people s pockets or make it possible for consumers to drive demand in the global economy we have a recovery but in many ways it is a genetically modified recovery not created by real growth on main street thanks to four decades of globalization the u s doesn t carry as much weight in the world economy as it used to during the asian financial crisis of the late 1990s for example u s growth powered ahead despite troubles in much of the rest of the world but the chinese economy has grown wildly since then china made up about a third of all global growth over the past decade even more than the u s which made up only 17 this represents a major break from the past says morgan stanley investment management chief macroeconomist ruchir sharma historically the u s has been the single largest contributor to global growth and a contraction in the american economy has been the catalyst that tipped the world into recession now the next global recession is likely to be made in china the middle kingdom and other emerging markets many of which rise and fall on chinese economic news make up 40 of the entire global economy so what happens there matters more than ever while questionable chinese government statistics still claim that the country is growing at 7 a year sharma puts that figure closer to 4 other longtime china observers say it s even lower in china that level of growth feels like a recession a fear that president xi jinping acknowledged at november s apec meeting when he pledged that china was working vigorously to overcome difficulties and meet challenges by strengthening macro regulation and effectively advancing reforms indeed most of the world s top economic forecasters have begun to wonder if 2016 will bring a full blown global recession already most of those forecasters are predicting serious market turbulence in the weeks and months ahead historically global recessions happen every eight years and we re in the seventh year of an expansion notes sharma so based on past data it s quite likely when american consumers stopped buying stuff after the 2008 subprime crisis china tried to take up the slack in the form of a massive government stimulus program this meant a major run up in its debt a few years back it took a dollar of debt to create every dollar of growth in china following 2009 it has taken four times that and even today debt in china is still rising about twice as fast as growth why is that a problem because financial crises are caused by fast run ups in debt and aside from wars and high inflation financial crises are mainly what slow down the global economy in this context china s unprecedentedly fast debt run up is particularly worrisome a couple of years ago the china bubble started to burst the chinese government tried to stop it by propping up one market after another from housing to stocks last july the government spent more than 400 billion to shore up overpriced stock markets before giving in to gravity and letting the markets fall many global markets rebounded after the chinese authorities made it clear that big state run companies would continue to buy up chinese blue chip stocks to support the country s main bourse the shanghai market beijing also said that bans on big institutional investor stock sales which had been set to expire would continue the markets simply needed this institutional underpinning as the past few weeks have made clear investors are all too willing to cash out of chinese investments and put their money someplace with more political and economic certainty the minute they can but china is now in a catch 22 situation since the very fact that authorities have to take such actions means they aren t in control of the markets and that further erodes investor confidence in a way this is partly good news china has to cede more state control to the market system while bringing growth to a more sustainable level in order to move up the economic food chain but the unpredictability of policy decisions around that is cause for concern says mohamed el erian chief investment adviser for financial services company allianz the chinese are in new territory adapting to a more free market situation that they know less well they learn quickly but there will be a learning curve he says that learning curve has already proved costly nearly a trillion dollars of capital have left china since 2014 as many investors try to get their money out of the country that has forced the government to open up its 3 3 trillion war chest of foreign currency reserves to prop up the renminbi which is trading at much lower levels in hong kong than on the mainland an indicator that investors think the chinese markets and economy have further to fall that might sound like a lot of money but reserves were around 4 trillion at the beginning of last year a marker of how fast they are being run down and experts like sharma say that only around two thirds of those reserves are liquid or easily accessible in a pinch so how big is that war chest really he asks for years we ve had this idea that the chinese are these very competent technocrats and that they have plenty of money to cover all the debt they ve built up but today we estimate that about half of the new loans being doled out in china are going to pay interest on the existing debt load the current volatility in the markets which will likely continue through 2016 reflects worries about whether authorities will be able to move smoothly from a state run economy to a consumption led one it s a shift that only three countries in asia have ever made japan south korea and singapore and none of them had anywhere near the population of china nor the opacity of decisionmaking that is characteristic of china s communist party leadership all this combined with the back and forth policy moves has resulted in a low level of trust in what the market hears from beijing as a recent deutsche bank analysis concluded meanwhile there are new worries about the u s its export sector has been struggling for some time in part because a strong dollar has made u s goods more expensive in the global marketplace that s a big problem because net exports have contributed twice as much to this recovery as to recoveries of the past the fed is raising rates and the dollar is rising but the rest of the world is still moving in the opposite direction creating a great divergence in monetary policy that will take the global economy into new territory and likely contribute to more market turbulence as investors struggle to figure out where to place their bets in a world where asset prices and classes no longer move in sync although u s consumers are no longer a source of instability neither are they a source of growth americans have off loaded plenty of personal debt in the wake of the crisis and cleaned up their household balance sheets but unlike in recoveries past spending hasn t picked up despite the rise in stock and housing wealth over the past few years that s very unusual over the past 30 years as soon as the prices of assets like stocks and homes began to rise people typically felt more secure reducing their savings and spending again since the great recession something else has changed u s net wealth has increased by 20 trillion since 2012 thanks to gains in both stock markets and housing but the personal savings rate which now hovers around 5 is about twice what it should be given such gains according to research by jpmorgan the root cause say economists could be in part our collective age people spend less as they get older but it may also be the fact that most of that stock and housing wealth is accruing within a small subset of the population the top 10 of the population owns nearly 90 of all stocks even as real wage levels remain virtually flat that means that only the wealthy feel more economically secure and there are only so many cars homes and designer trinkets they can buy this has been a drag on the u s recovery and it may be a permanent one history shows that when consumers go through a seismic economic event it changes their behavior over the long term think about depression era grandparents who save tea bags or boomers who fueled the economy with their postwar spending it could be that the financial crisis of 2008 and the recovery that followed which has been the longest slowest one on record has bred a new type of american consumer one less willing not to mention able to consume in any case aging demographics in developed countries like the u s european states and japan don t bode well for growth which is essentially a function of working age population and productivity combined so where does that leave us struggling to find a safe way forward in a new world one that developed countries helped create globalization fueled by western neoliberal economics and the american economic miracle of the past century has ushered in a more diverse and far richer global market free markets if sometimes inefficient and periodically prone to crisis won over competing models but as a result america must share center stage and can no longer pull the world forward alone the global rebalancing that many economists and policymakers had hoped for following 2008 a shift in which the world could depend more on china and other emerging markets and less on u s consumption hasn t really come to pass we still live in a global economy that is driven by debt rather than productive investment low wages impede productivity gains inequality is a further drag on growth and emerging markets can t yet offset the long term slowing of developed nations in economics as in geopolitics it s now a world in which there is no single superpower this appears in the january 25 2016 issue of
