percentage who say journalists have exaggerated the risks of the outbreak has decreased notably in recent weeks according to survey data from pew research center s election news pathway project among u s adults surveyed from april 20 26 69 say the news media have covered the outbreak very well or somewhat well a number that is virtually unchanged from the 70 of respondents who said the same thing in a survey conducted from march 10 16 but as the toll from the coronavirus has grown dramatically over time there has been movement in the share of americans who say the news media have greatly or slightly exaggerated the risks it poses with that percentage dropping from 62 in march to 48 in april that includes a decline in the portion saying the media have greatly exaggerated the risks from 37 to 24 at the same time the portion of respondents who say the media have gotten the covid 19 risks about right grew by 9 percentage points from 30 to 39 to analyze these survey questions by additional media habits and demographic characteristics visit the interactive tool and access thedataset underlying these overall numbers are deep partisan divisions about the media s coronavirus coverage divisions that were evident in march and remain so in april most recently more than half of republicans and independents who lean toward the republican party 54 say the media have covered covid 19 somewhat or very well in the april survey a number that swells to about eight in ten among democrats and democratic leaning independents 82 and while about two thirds of republicans and republican leaners 68 in the april survey say the media slightly or greatly exaggerated covid 19 risks that is true of only three in ten democrats and democratic leaners the portion of those saying the media exaggerated the risks declined across both parties from march to april but that decrease was considerably more pronounced for democrats than republicans by a ratio of two to one americans generally positive view of the media s coverage of the coronavirus outbreak has remained steady in recent weeks in march 70 of all adults said news organizations have done very well or somewhat well in that task with nearly the exact same portion 69 saying this now within that total there was also little change from march 30 to april 27 in the percentage who say the media have done very well what also remained consistent across both time periods is the significant partisan divergence on that question as of late april 54 of republicans and republican leaning independents say the media have performed somewhat or very well compared with a full 82 of democrats and democratic leaners a gap of 28 percentage points modestly larger than the 21 point gap in the earlier survey the portion of republicans saying the media have done very well actually declined 10 points it is worth noting that the strong partisan divide exists alongside a consistent element of president donald trump s frequent briefings on covid 19 direct criticism of news organizations and journalists that partisan gap is even larger among ideological segments within each party as of april about half of conservative republicans 48 say the media have done very or somewhat well in covering covid 19 that number grows to 62 among moderate and liberal republicans and it increases further to 81 among conservative and moderate democrats and 84 among liberal democrats in the period covered by the two surveys the toll taken by the virus and the reaction to it changed dramatically public schools and nonessential businesses were shut down while america s governors issued stay at home orders to residents in most states on march 10 there were fewer than 1 500 reported cases in the u s by april 26 the nation was closing in on 1 million cases in the march survey about six in ten americans 62 said that the media had exaggerated either slightly or by a great deal the risks of covid 19 an additional 30 said they had gotten the risks about right and 8 said they had not taken the risks seriously enough or not taken them seriously at all in the april survey about half 48 of adults say the media have exaggerated the risks slightly or greatly 39 say they have gotten it about right and 13 say they have not taken it seriously enough the partisan chasm on this question grew even larger from march to april the percentage of both republicans and democrats saying the media have exaggerated the risks dropped with the biggest decrease coming among democrats back in march 76 of republicans and republican leaning independents said the media had exaggerated covid 19 risks compared with 49 of democrats and democratic leaners a difference of 27 percentage points as of april about two thirds of republicans 68 say the media have exaggerated the risks fewer than half as many democrats surveyed in april 30 say the same meaning the gap between republicans and democrats grew to 38 points at the same time the percentage of democrats who say the media have gotten the risks about right climbed from 41 in march to 55 in the april survey among republicans it moved up modestly from 17 to 20 adding ideology onto political party identification shows particularly wide gaps between conservative republicans and liberal democrats almost three quarters of conservative republicans 73 respond that the media have exaggerated the covid 19 risks compared with 60 of moderate to liberal republicans one third of moderate and conservative democrats also say journalists have exaggerated the risks a number that is even lower 26 among liberal democrats only 16 of conservative republicans say the media have gotten the risks about right compared with 57 of liberal democrats as was the case with parties overall the shares of conservative republicans and liberal democrats who say the media have exaggerated the risks decreased since march but the drop was steeper among liberal democrats the percentage of conservative republicans saying the media exaggerated risks fell from 80 in the march survey to 73 in april but the percentage of liberal democrats who gave that same response was cut nearly in half from 50 to 26 the percentage of conservative republicans who said the media have gotten the risks about right stayed about equal 14 in march and 16 in april for liberal democrats that figure jumped from 39 to 57
