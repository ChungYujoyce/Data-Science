the five most recent christian science articles with a spiritual perspective every monday spin and overstatement have long been a part of political rhetoric but this year is pushing fact checkers into overdrive and that s not all bad loading july 1 2016 professional fact checkers might be excused for being a tad exhausted this campaign season tracking the public statements of 22 major party candidates during the primaries was one thing but a general election pitting donald trump against hillary clinton two candidates with abysmal scores for honestyamong voters is another sending the fact checking world into overdrive is mr trump really worth 10 billion as he claims not according to forbes magazine is it true that mrs clinton slept during the benghazi terror attack in 2012 as trump says no according to clinton testimony was clinton allowed to use a personal email server when she was secretary of state as she has asserted no according to a recent report by the state department s office of the inspector general trump alone is enough to keep the entire fact checking industry afloat when the flamboyant billionaire gave a big speech recently denouncing clinton the associated press assigned 12 reporters just to check the veracity of his assertions a whole platoon of journalistic talent that could have been doing other things moaned washington post media critic erik wemple it s easy to get discouraged by all the charges of lying hurled around lyin ted lyingcrookedhillary both a verbal trump charge and the name of a trump campaign site handouts from the clinton campaign that lay out trump s lies hypocrisy and catastrophic ideas and certainly to some voters the whole tone of the campaign is so depressing the answer is just to tune out and stay home on election day but to veteran fact checkers it s the time to shine angie drobnic holan editor in chief of the pulitzer prize winning site politifact com says she s really optimistic citing the growth of media fact checking you can have a cynical take on that but mine is more optimistic because fact checking is especially needed this year she says donald trump is a candidate who has persistent problems with accuracy and i m heartened that there s widespread recognition that this is someone who needs to be fact checked trump supporters not surprisingly disagree jeffrey lord a regular on cnn defending trump calls media fact checkers elitist and says the candidates themselves do a better job of countering each other s assumptions this self policing concept sounds a bit like having a basketball game with no referees and besides it s just not going to happen media fact checking is here to stay so are politicians who say things that aren t true and accuse each other of lying but there s a spectrum of political speech there are out and out lies deliberately false statements meant to deceive then there are statements that are unintentionally false exaggerations and spin sorting through the differences can be impossible as it requires knowing what s inside the speaker s head and what about a candidate who makes big promises knowing they can t be fulfilled that s another form of political speech that is less than truthful but which voters have come to expect and often excuse in a recent focus group veteran pollster peter hart asked 12 republicans if they thought a president trump would ever actually build a wall across the mexican border eight people voted no same with his promise to deport the 11 million illegal immigrants in the us and yet most of the 12 were fine that these promises would likely go unfulfilled they don t hear a pledge they hear i m going to do something says kathleen hall jamieson director of the university of pennsylvania s annenberg public policy center which sponsored the focus group but making pie in the sky promises is one thing statements of fact that prove false are another and that s where fact checkers are having a field day politifact has judged 174 statements by trump so far and found only 16 to be either true or mostly true seventy have been judged false and another 34 rated pants on fire referring to claims that are not only inaccurate but also ridiculous according to ms holan with clinton politifact has judged 218 statements and rated 112 true or mostly true 24 false and three pants on fire the next question is whether the assessments of politifact and other fact checkers actually penetrate public consciousness our traffic is better than it s ever been says holan whose site is affiliated with the tampa bay times media organizations are doing fact checking in part because it s very popular with readers professor jamieson whose annenberg center launched the first political fact checking website factcheck org in 2003 is less sanguine fact checking has never been more important more complicated and less likely to reach its target audience with the desired corrected information jamieson says part of the problem is the ever accelerating news cycle in order to get a correction through you have to get people to stand still long enough to hear it she says another issue particularly for fact checking operations attached to news sites is low public opinion of the media only 6 percent of americans have a great deal of confidence in the press according to a survey released in april by the media insight project get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox holan of politifact says that when readers accuse her site of partisan bias against trump she counters with data that show republicans who do well on the politifact truth o meter such as jeb bush of course former governor bush didn t do very well as a presidential candidate voters don t necessarily favor a candidate because he or she is more factual moreover for a slice of the electorate this cycle reflects a break from politics as usual and that includes an embrace of candidates who speak to voters without the filter of polls
