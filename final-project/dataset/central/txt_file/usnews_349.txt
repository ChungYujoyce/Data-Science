in season one of abc s designated survivor series a show that conceptualizes what it would be like if american democracy had to rebuild after most top officials were killed in a terrorist attack there s an episode in which the presence of the poison ricin on a few voting machines threatens to decimate voter turnout on the day the country is supposed to elect replacement members of congress the television show is fictional of course and the biotoxic hazard is melodramatic but experts say that anxieties over the current outbreak of a new coronavirus covid 19 in the united states could theoretically pose a similar threat to voter turnout in upcoming primaries and possibly the general election in november as the covid 19 outbreak has spread to all 50 u s states infecting more than 6 000 and killing more than 100 people state election officials are making preparations to mitigate the risk of infection quell voters fears ahead and control the spread of misinformation about the disease ahead of election day in most states casting a ballot requires showing up in person along with thousands of other people often in small crowded spaces and sharing germ ridden objects like pens clipboards and voting machines given that the centers for disease and control and prevention currently believes covid 19 spreads between people who are within six feet of one another and possibly by touching communal surfaces that the virus is on voters concerns are not entirely unfounded in massachusetts which currently has at least 218 confirmed covid 19 cases secretary of the commonwealth william galvin ordered local polling places to disinfect voting booths more often than usual procure extra pens to be swapped out with germ laden ones and have volunteers on standby in case poll workers didn t show up on march 3 due to coronavirus fears sign up for our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking on this link and please send any tips leads and stories to virus time com ahead of washington state s march 10 primary which was conducted exclusively by mail and drop boxes state officials asked voters to abstain from using saliva to seal the envelopes that contained their ballots in case covid 19 is transmittable on surfaces days after contact those tasked with processing the mail ballots were also instructed to wear gloves days before the state s voting deadline it was grappling with 75 confirmed cases and 13 deaths washington secretary of state kim wyman told me its vote by mail system was a saving grace i think that the vote by mail system it definitely gives voters confidence that they can participate and not have to worry about risk going out and getting exposed because they re in a big group of people at a polling place she said the washington state democratic party also postponed a major fundraising dinner that was expected to draw more than 1 000 attendees in light of covid 19 the seattle times reported a volunteer with the state party told time that calls to their election hotline about coronavirus and its possible effects on the democratic primary have also surged in recent days while it s unclear how much fears about covid 19 will affect u s voter turnout in the remaining primaries and if so by how much the recent elections in iran offer an instructive example two days before the country s feb 21 parliamentary elections iran announced its first case of covid 19 by feb 23 there were 43 confirmed cases and eight deaths marking the highest fatality rate outside of mainland china at the time in response people skipped the polls only 43 of the population voted the lowest participation rate since the 1979 islamic revolution the supreme leader of iran ayatollah ali khamenei blamed the low turnout on adversaries exaggerations about the threat of the virus this negative propaganda about the virus began a couple of months ago and grew larger ahead of the election khamenei said their media did not miss the tiniest opportunity for dissuading iranian voters and resorting to the excuse of disease and the virus there s some historical precedent for epidemics driving down turnout in u s elections too about 100 years ago when the 1918 influenza hit the u s midterm candidates were banned from hosting political rallies and speaking tours though the outbreak occurred near the end of world war i which would have already affected voter turnout historians say that the reduced candidate voter engagement and fear of the influenza itself likely contributed to the cycle s low participation figures voter turnout rates in the midterm elections of 1910 and 1914 were 52 and 50 respectively in 1918 turnout was only 40 according to the united states election project it s logical to think that the spanish flu had some impact says matt dallek a political historian at george washington university s graduate school of public management then and now the impact of global health threats extend beyond campaign and election mechanics to influence voters perceptions of candidates and how they can handle crises he explains while it s too early to tell how covid 19 will play out in the 2020 election he adds it may already be having an effect certainly the virus might be seen as a factor that s helping joe biden given that he seems to be a kind of a safe harbor in a category five economic and public health storm dallek says initially fears of covid 19 didn t appear to have impacted voter turnout in the 2020 u s primaries in fact democratic voter turnout on super tuesday went up exceeding the levels from 2016 in at least a dozen states according to the hill but an uptick in confirmed cases has thrown election officials and voters for a loop ohio called off its march 17 primary just hours before polls were supposed to open this was after republican ohio gov mike dewine supported a lawsuit that sought to delay the primary until june and a judge subsequently ruled against that lawsuit prior to postponing the state sent all 88 of ohio s county boards of elections the most up to date information from the cdc regarding best practices for preventing the spread of disease including recommendations for the provision of extra supplies for preventing the spread of the flu and viruses an official with the ohio secretary of state s office told time the buckeye state also sought to move primary voting sites away from nursing homes due to the susceptibility of serious symptoms among older people who become infected with covid 19 as georgia kentucky and louisiana also decided to postpone their primaries democratic national committee chair tom perez urged states to stick with their schedules to stem the spread of germs he recommended states adopt vote by mail and set up drop boxes where voters could deposit their ballots the right to vote is the foundation of our democracy and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt he said in a statement arizona illinois and florida chose to proceed with their scheduled primaries despite fears that coronavirus concerns could keep poll workers away and that long lines would undermine experts pleas to practice social distancing preliminary numbers suggest turnout was down significantly in some areas of illinois dupage county one of chicago s suburbs saw less than 15 of its 614 000 registered voters cast ballots according to the new york times meanwhile in florida in person voting lagged from 2016 numbers but vote by mail ballots picked up most of the slack though 1 709 000 democrats participated in the 2016 florida primaries 1 712 000 participated in 2020 as of 10 p m tuesday according to the miami herald in arizona the vast majority of the 1 2 million registered arizona democrats cast ballots early by mail the associated press reported but if germs are one concern so is the potential for misinformation maurice turner an expert in election security at the center for democracy and technology says fears about contracting the new coronavirus are just part of the battle officials and voters must grapple with the possibility that bad actors are willfully spreading falsities about the virus in an effort to depress voter turnout or to manipulate which populations turn out to vote there s plenty of opportunity to put out different pieces of information that are either accurate and are concerning in a way that helps increase the anxiety or to try to seed disinformation or totally false information on what people could do or what they should or should not do in a way that just causes more confusion he says at the end of the designated survivor episode only one poll worker died as a result of the ricin unfortunately it would be much harder to determine how many may get sick from waiting in long lines to cast their ballots but in the meantime turner advocates people find a way to continue engaging in their civic duty wash your hands don t touch your face get out and vote write to abby vesoulis at abby vesoulis time com
