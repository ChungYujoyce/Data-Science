hillaryclinton sasterisk heavy victory in iowa mighthave been the narrowest of wins for her but it was arguably the worst of all possible outcomes for the democratic party as of this writing the result was a statistical tie 49 9 for clinton and 49 6 for bernie sanders themargin of victory in the delegate count was decided by sixcoin tosses that flip truthers will forever remember as mysteriously biased towardclinton clinton raced to the podium to declare victory but the news mediawill continue to describe it as a tie probably forever sanders supporters won t even make that concession bitterly complaining about irregularities and again coins that seemed to be in clinton s pocket figuratively speaking a crushing defeat would have been worse for clinton of course but this wasn t much better in fact the nature of this victory will probably bring out the worst in clinton if she lost decisively asshe did in iowa in 2008 she d have the option of playing the victim maybe she deven cry again like she did in portsmouth n h in 08 earning the sympathy vote instead she won iowa this time but saying so requires lawyerly qualifications and caveats everyone knows this win was nothing to brag about according tothe new york times her advisers said they did not know if a significant staff shakeup was at hand but they said that the clintons were disappointed with mondaynight s result and wanted to ensure that her organization political messaging and communications strategy were in better shape for the contests to come that s not exactly william wallace in braveheart shouting of victory in sanders vs clinton caucus contest democracy won rekha basu clinton simply can t go around talking about her win in iowa without seeming ungracious and grasping every time she tries it will by the very nature of that victory seem like spin already her supporters are fanning out across cable news overselling the win and reinforcing the sense that team clinton is disconnected from reality also any bragging from the clinton camp will further antagonize sanders supporters many of whom are already quite hostile to clinton but the real loser in all this is the democratic party the ghost of eugene mccarthy has hovered over the democratic race for a year in 1968 the left wing senator from minnesota challenged president johnson in the new hampshire primary mccarthy actually lost by a significant margin but the mere fact that he got 42 of the vote against the sitting president was enough to ultimately knock johnson out of the race and entice robert f kennedy into it iowa puts the brake on the trump train column policing the usa alook at race justice media these are different times and clinton isn t an incumbent president even so numerous observers raised the possibility that if clinton suffered a devastating loss in both iowa and new hampshire it might be enough to entice vice president biden al gore michael bloomberg or someone else into the race to save the party from the prospect of a socialist nominee or a fatally flawed clinton candidacy there was never any question in my mind that clinton will never drop out like richard gere in an officer and a gentleman she s got nowhere else to go but there was some slim possibility that someone else would get in and beat her and sanders that won t happen now she will almost surely go on to lose in new hampshire after that her best hope is to grind out a victory over many months antagonizing sanders supporters who are disproportionately made up of exactly the kind of young activists clinton desperately needs to win in november the window for a democratic savior if one ever existed slammed shut mondaynight the democrats are stuck with what they ve got jonah goldberg american enterprise institutefellow andnational reviewcontributing editor is a member of usa today s board of contributors in addition to its own editorials usa today publishes diverse opinions from outside writers including ourboard of contributors to read more columns like this go to theopinion front page
