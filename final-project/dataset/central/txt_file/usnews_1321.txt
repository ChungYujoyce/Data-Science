the record number of women sworn into congress on jan 3 included a 68 year old bison farmer from west virginia a 29 year old progressive upstart from new york and a 58 year old native american single mother from new mexico each had broken ground in her own way but in the capitol building where they now work that s less likely to make any of them terribly distinctive the newest members of the 116th congress made the legislative body the most diverse in u s history not only ethnically and racially but generationally as well more than 20 of the new lawmakers are millennials making this a particularly fresh faced freshman class a handful of them express their determination to make a difference in washington by restoring a level of co operation effectiveness and mutual respect to the work they were elected to do reported by abigail abrams alana abramson and charlotte alter watch meet the freshmen the experiences that shaped my political ideology the most are my life experiences as a vulnerable working class american when you really understand and internalize the intensity and the urgency that most americans are going through you approach this job totally differently younger folks don t hear anybody talk about the future anymore it s all about battles of the past they want to know how are they going to be able to afford college how are they going to get a good job what kind of future is there going to be for them in this country we have this huge influx of new voices new ideas and perspectives that have not really ever been heard in this body in the centuries that the united states has been on this earth we are going to see changes in process we re going to see changes in policy and hopefully transparency and productivity the top legislative priority for me in the first term is definitely job creation and economic growth i don t think that there s one silver bullet that we have in terms of public policy but i think that a growing economy is the closest thing we have it s o k that i hate it a little bit here i think that s important people think it s crazy when i say it but i m like if i m too much in love with just being here then i ll be disconnected and i ll forget why i ran in the first place the job is to act to do we ve got children and generations coming up behind us who need answers they need solutions they don t need bickering they don t need arguing they don t need headlines they need actual substantive critical thought issues of infrastructure for some people like my district it s broadband for some people it s roads and bridges i think that s an area where we see a common need to really find solutions and can work across the aisle to help our communities and improve the way of life for so many americans i want my constituents to know and realize that the door is open the ceiling is broken now so i intend to leave the ladder down i want other native women women of color and women to run for office and i ll be there to make sure that they do i ve been a working mom for many many years so having that pressure in my life has always been there but i think it s changed now because i m really modeling for my kids what it means to stand up for your values what it means when you re concerned about your country that you stand up and do something so many of the problems and challenges people told me about are not going to be solved without tackling campaign finance reform first so the high cost of prescription drugs health care consumer protection a lot of these issues we can t make any progress until we do meaningful campaign finance reform the problems that we face in my district are quite simple takes people two hours to get to work people are dying from overdoses kids are afraid to go to school because of gun violence and i don t believe that shy incrementalism is necessarily the answer here we have to be responsible but we need to be bold carol miller republican west virginia s third
