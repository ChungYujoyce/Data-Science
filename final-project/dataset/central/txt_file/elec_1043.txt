candidates their success shows how us politics is changing loading january 31 2016 it is possible perhaps even probable that this fall s election will be contested between two of three most disliked presidential candidates of at least the past quarter century and it is possible perhaps even probable that this is not a coincidence agallup surveyreleased saturday shows that donald trump has the highest unfavorability rating 60 percent of any presidential candidate since the polling firm started tracking the figure in 1992 for her part hillary clinton ranks third 52 percent with the no new taxes breaking george h w bush of 1992 at no 2 in other words the 2016 presidential election could be decided between two people that the majority of americans according to gallup don t like politically how is this possible actually it makes complete sense in fact one could argue that such a contest would perfectly befit the current political era at a time when partisanship has taken new and more rigid forms the result has been an america increasingly wary of the other side many americans are increasingly motivated to voteagainstcandidates rather thanforthem mr trump and former secretary of state clinton symbolize this shift in different ways but they speak to the shrinking middle of american politics as the national parties have less and less in common their national candidates likewise have less in common leaving voters with a starker choice that they are just as likely to oppose as embrace indeed political scientists note that americans aremore neatly sorted into the two parties than they have been in recent history in other words conservatives support republicans and liberals support democrats no more blue dog democrats who want to reform welfare no more northeast republicans who want to address climate change it means there is a brighter line between the national democratic and republican parties than there has been in decades because there is less internal pressure to moderate if increasingly everyone in the party is left of center or right of center the party naturally shifts left or right the result is two sharply different visions for america two sharply different sets of solutions another result is the vanishing swing voter see the monitor scover storyon the subject a larger share of american voters mightregister as independentsthan as democrats or republicans but they don t act that way those independents who reliably turn out to vote tend to take sides just like the partisans voting in consistently partisan ways people are more confident in their opinions when they see polarized parties corwin smidt a michigan state university political scientist told the monitor they think well if the choices are so stark it s just not a gray area at all and so they worry about the other side winning according to research by emory university political scientists alan abramowitz and steven webster they found that voting behavior is increasingly guided by this negative partisanship this fall it seems american voters might have a lot to vote against trump has become the republican front runner precisely because of his lack of broader appeal argues pollster frank luntzin the financial times no high polling presidential candidate in the modern era has so intrepidly drawn the ire of so many within the americanelectorate he writes yet in rendering one voting bloc utterly apoplectic he has appealed viscerally to another the balance of middle ground politics is not shall we say mr trump s bailiwick his calls for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants and a temporary ban on all noncitizen muslims entering the country are antithetical to those outside his conservative base which partly explains their appeal within it he s simply raising an important issue nobody else has the courage to talk about mr luntz adds paraphrasing the trump voters reasons for supporting the billionaire for clinton the issue is less ideological than historical she is facing aperceived lack of trustworthinessthat dates back to her husband s administration and has been exacerbated by her handling ofstate department e mails yet the same trends that have vaulted trump to front runner status are apparent in the democratic primary process too bernie sanders could topple clinton in iowa and new hampshire and he is an avowed socialist talking about a revolution in sanders s vision a massive grassroots uprising will shatter the constricting limits of today s political debate and thrust forward long time liberal goals such as single payer health care and free public college tuition writes ronald brownsteinin the atlantic for sanders s growing army it s an exhilarating prospect for republicans it is appalling to some degree this is what primaries do push candidates toward the extremes but there is a mounting sense that as the parties move further apart this year represents something new or at least more intense while the experience might be temporarily cathartic evidence suggests it might not be ultimately satisfying as congress has become more sorted americans confidence in it has declined americans have less confidence in congress than they do in any other major american institution and have since 2010 according toa gallup survey after all a revolution entails one side winning not likely in a political environment where each side is becoming more entrenched to stop the other on both sides the energy is with candidates offering the dream of a clean sweep and a blank sheet on which to rewrite the nation s priorities writes mr brownstein yet because the candidates offering such fundamental change are largely misdiagnosing the reasons for today s impasse it s unlikely they could break it even if they capture the presidency their misdiagnosis brownstein suggests that it s unlikely one side can ignore the other to rewrite the nation s priorities get the monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox given the nation s underlying partisan divisions the only way to advance bigger ideas may be through compromises across party lines that neither side is discussing much yet what this primary campaign has done perhaps is highlight the shifting political topography and distance between those party lines link copied get unlimited monitor journalism
