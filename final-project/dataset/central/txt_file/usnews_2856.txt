should get the same pay he said on msnbc s morning joe in 2015 but he said categorizing people could be dangerous adding it s very hard to say what to say what is the same job he also told an iowa tv station that year that i f you start to say everybody gets equal pay you get away from the whole american dream and if everyone gets the same you re into a socialistic society trump told cnn that he absolutely paid women at his company the same as men and sometimes more and former trump organization executive barbara res told rolling stone that she didn t think her gender affected her pay while working for trump since taking control of the white house however trump has made a number of moves that critics say could harm pay equity in 2017 he stopped an obama era rule meant to address the wage gap by requiring large companies to report to the government how much they pay employees by race and gender a federal judge recently overruled the administration and revived the rule and last year
