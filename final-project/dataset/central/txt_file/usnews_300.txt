giridharadas is a time editor at large and the author of winners take all the elite charade of changing the world the true american and india calling he is also a political analyst for nbc news and teaches writing at nyu on march 29 2003 at a wedding reception in the harvard faculty club lawrence w reed gave a toast in honor of the friend whom he was serving as best man one joseph p overton overton had worked at dow chemical he had since become an executive at a free market small government think tank in central michigan among his duties at the mackinac center for public policy was raising money and in doing so he had made a brochure that would become his legacy overton was trying to describe the role of think tanks in a society and he posited an idea that would come to be called the overton window in a given society at a given moment there is a range of policies politically acceptable to the mainstream a 70 top tax rate and a 20 top tax rate are both within this window in america today abolishing taxes is not generally the theory went politicians will only propose ideas that fall within the window it falls to think tanks and others to propose unpopular things outside of the window in the hope of shifting the window and making the previously unthinkable achievable overton was an ardent libertarian who pushed ideas like school choice and according to reed s wedding toast he had on occasion resorted to more extreme methods of moving the window of the possible including the time reed recounted that day we flew in a cessna 172 in broad daylight at treetop level 150 miles into war torn mozambique to assist armed rebels fighting the marxist regime there overton died just weeks after his wedding were overton still alive he would be pushing 60 and might be aghast to learn that his window having become famous after his death is now invoked to describe america s great unlikely backlash against the system he defended so ardently capitalism a democratic socialist bernie sanders is among the top contenders to be the next democratic nominee for u s president his rival and fellow senator elizabeth warren is also among the top tier of candidates declaring herself a capitalist who wishes to transform american capitalism as we know it with a wealth tax a green new deal and the elimination of private health insurance a more centrist candidate mayor pete buttigieg of south bend ind illustrated the shifting winds when he recently declared that neo liberalism is the political economic consensus that has governed the last 40 years of policy in the u s and u k its failure helped to produce the trump moment now we have to replace it with something better in 2016 the democratic socialists of america dsa had 5 000 members since then its dues paying membership has multiplied more than tenfold this new energy on the left terrifies chief executives and billionaires and yet many of them have been voicing similar alarms about a crisis of capitalism ray dalio the billionaire co chairman of the investment firm bridgewater associates warned in april that america faced a national emergency in capitalism s failure to benefit more people and he pronounced the american dream lost the anti capitalist impulse has some purchase on the right too before he pushed a tax cut that lined the capitalists pockets donald trump ran most improbably as a republican skeptical of the financial elite s loyalty to americans on fox news tucker carlson has entertained a surprising skepticism of capitalist doctrines and said positive things about warren america loves a capitalist reckoning the way the nfl loves colin kaepernick but it is having one anyway and if this year that reckoning seemed to reach new intensity it was because the economic precariousness stalled mobility and gaping social divides that have for years fueled the backlash now had an improbable sidekick plutocracy itself and the win win ideology that has governed the past few decades this year america s ultra elites seemed to bend over backward to lend support to the idea that maybe the system they superintend needs gut renovating as a political movement bubbled up to challenge their wealth and power the elite s own misbehavior trickled down and where the two met ideas that once seemed unutterable started to many to sound like the future history is the story of conditions that long seem reasonable until they begin to seem ridiculous so it is with america s present manic hyper capitalism until recently it seemed normal that a technological revolution that began with promises of leveled playing fields had culminated in an age of platform monopolies normal that businesspeople should try to make as much money as possible by paying as little as possible in taxes and wages then donate a fraction of the spoils to pr friendly social causes normal that economic security for most americans was becoming a relic of the past normal that people in the street level marijuana business go to prison while people in the business of selling ads to russian intelligence go on magazine covers normal that bankers could shatter the world economy with their speculating and that they would be among the few to be made whole after the crisis for years there have been voices trying to denormalize this state there were protests in seattle in 1999 there was occupy in 2011 there was the dsa there was the world social forum to rival the world economic forum there was eternally bernie sanders saying the exact stuff he is still saying today there were civic groups trying to organize workers and poor communities there were outcasts in silicon valley warning that mark zuckerberg wasn t really about human connection but america was in the grips of the ideological consensus that buttigieg described hyper capitalism was the intellectual stadium in which the country played there was a left side of the field more wary of capitalism s extremes and a right side of the field prone to capitalist boosting but the stadium as overton understood demarcated the boundaries of the debate for most people capitalism more or less as we practice it is our system and it is the best system so how do we tweak it to make it better then in 2016 something happened sanders ran for president he built a formidable national movement powered by small donations and won 22 states mind you as a democratic socialist in the united states of america sometimes the thing that could never happen happens and it makes people doubt their sense of reality and in that election cycle if sanders discredited capitalism as a conscious project his cause received unexpected unintentional help from the man who would become president trump ran as a flamboyant capitalist wary of certain aspects of capitalism but promising that his capitalist mind and his capitalist fortune would make him a uniquely gifted uniquely incorruptible president when that turned out not to be the case trump not only damaged himself but the idea of the selfless billionaire savior too the overton window was moving then came the 2018 midterms and a new wave of democratic candidates most prominently representative alexandria ocasio cortez of new york questioning capitalism as capitalism in a way that seemed unfamiliar and fresh as the 2020 campaign approached warren jumped into the race a beneficiary of the opening sanders had helped carve for capitalist critical aspirants to america s highest office with her now famous litany of plans warren detailed an agenda that would put american business in a headlock that she and sanders both veritable enemies of big business are among the top candidates shows how much the politics of capitalism has changed who should be time s person of the year for 2019 cast your vote in the reader poll but politics can be abstract it can be complicated people are busy living politics often benefits from scandal from prominent misbehavior from a dramatization of the discourse and this was what was so remarkable about 2019 because of the coming election in these populist times it was already a year potentially full of trouble for the plutocrats or plutes as i like to call them to save space and thus paper and therefore trees but almost as if to assist the cause the plutes seemed this year to put on an extended exhibit of performance art whose plain if unstated thesis is that plutocracy is maybe a bad idea exhibit a early in the year amazon run by one of the world s richest people jeff bezos announced it was pulling out of its planned hydra like second headquarters in new york city it seemed to come as a surprise to bezos that in a city where a significant number of people struggle to keep up with rising costs and stagnant pay many weren t excited by the idea of the state and city giving his company a few billion dollars in tax breaks that wouldn t be available to a regular joe starting a business in the debate that erupted the conventional wisdom that it is always better to attract jobs even by offering companies major incentives came to be questioned exhibit b the college bribery scandal wealth and privilege are already great guarantors of securing a spot in a university what the scandal unearthed by federal prosecutors illustrated is that many very rich people are not satisfied with the general advantage of hyper privilege nor even with the specific advantage of donations to universities that give you an edge but not a guarantee the ascendant critics of capitalism in american politics have called the system rigged for years but here was a biopsy of the rigging the most revealing subplot of the college scandal was the arrest of bill mcglashan many others ensnared in the scheme had bolder faced names but mcglashan was significant because he had become a symbol of the hope promoted by so many of the winners of our age that they would lead the charge toward a fairer society mcglashan through the rise fund that he helped create and is managed by his private equity firm tpg growth had helped popularize the growing field of impact investing in which a fund pursues not only economic returns but also the betterment of the world he was charged with and pleaded not guilty to trying to bribe his son into the university of southern california thus depriving the people whom he supposedly helped for a living of a fair shot at that college seat exhibit c in july facebook on account of just one of the scandals hovering over it this one involving privacy violations received a 5 billion fine from the federal trade commission now for you that may be a big fine for facebook it was such a feathery tickle that the company s stock surged on the news reaching its highest price in nearly a year facebook s massive market power its dubious behavior in the face of russian intelligence activities its fueling of polarization and its enabling of mis information and even violence were unaffected by the ftc fine a penalty that if anything left the impression that companies like facebook enjoy near total impunity still in response to these scandals and outrages many in the business world declared themselves newly interested in reform the most prominent and heralded instance this past year was a statement by the business roundtable an umbrella organization whose members are the chief executives of many of america s largest companies for decades the roundtable has clung to a particular interpretation of the purpose of a business that it is solely to make money for shareholders with its new statement issued in august the roundtable updated its view business roundtable redefines the purpose of a corporation to promote an economy that serves all americans it was inspiring limited stuff what it really revealed was how hard it will be for the old guard capitalists to change at all the statement was a call for every corporate signatory to decide voluntarily to behave in ways more supportive of people and the planet as far as i know no company because of the statement announced the cessation of practices in lobbying tax avoidance employment or other realms when i publicly questioned the teeth of a pledge that reminded me of my own pledges not to eat fries jamie dimon the chief executive of jpmorgan chase and chairman of the roundtable contacted me we talked on the phone for half an hour he was incredulous that i didn t trust that the pledge would mean action i challenged him to give the pledge teeth why not begin to lobby for proposals in congress that would make stakeholder capitalism the law not just an airy promise why not excommunicate companies that lobby for things contrary to the stated values of the roundtable he said the roundtable wasn t a police force when i put to him that many signatories of this pledge to treat people better were known to be fairly exploitative of workers he pushed back with words that illustrate that self reformed capitalism is a lot like unreformed capitalism but with better public relations he said that he knew the chief executives i was talking about and that he liked them they were good people he was sure they were kind to employees plus he said a lot of people just don t like to work a spokes person for dimon later said to the washington post these quotes don t reflect the conversation in public relations an important term of art is getting out ahead of the story if bad news about you is coming pre empt it by telling the story on your terms the business roundtable s move long on rhetoric short on support for any actual reforms with teeth seemed very much in that tradition get out in front of the backlash to extreme capitalism by proposing an optional capitalism lite then there is the other classic way in which the plutes get out in front of such backlashes philanthropy if you re goldman sachs contribute to a financial crisis that costs millions of men and women their homes and livelihoods then give back and scrub your name through something like the 10 000 women program to mentor entrepreneurs yet this year more people seemed to see through this take and give playbook a striking moment came in late march when new york state led by its new attorney general letitia james filed a lawsuit against members of the sackler family and others whom it accused of abetting the opioid crisis in addition to alleging malfeasance in selling the drugs the complaint made a claim about the use of philanthropy to lubricate wrongdoing ultimately the sacklers used their ill gotten wealth to cover up their misconduct with a philanthropic campaign to whitewash their decades long success in profiting at new yorkers expense the suit cited donations to many arts institutions resulting in sackler wings and institutes and centers while also serving to cleanse their name in a way that allowed the grim machinery of drug peddling to grind on for years then there was the jeffrey epstein case epstein the late sexual predator and maybe tycoon gave endless ammunition to plutocracy s critics here was a man who had allegedly trafficked and raped children who had been convicted of serious offenses and who managed through deftly arranged philanthropy and social climbing to re establish himself in high society epstein ingratiated himself with harvard he gave money to the massachusetts institute of technology and was given the chance to meddle in its research a phenomenon that one writer aptly called sugar daddy science he even spent a surprising amount of time with bill gates a children s advocate who has since apologized for his lapse in judgment yet what epstein revealed was less individual lapses than systemic rot in our culture especially at our universities which have become drive through reputational laundromats as the chances have increased that a candidate outside the neoliberal consensus will win the nomination we have begun to see the great plute freakout of 2019 a wave of plutes have weighed in about the dangers of a sanders or warren presidency although their obvious motivation is clear not wanting to lose their money to the federal government that s seldom how they argue it instead they engage in economic concern trolling framing their self preservational worries as being in fact worries about you and yours zuckerberg of facebook warned us that taxing wealth would limit the diversity of philanthropic efforts in medical research leon cooperman a hedge fund billionaire warned us that taxing wealth would curb the good works that he and his friends do and then in the cherry on top michael bloomberg the former new york city mayor and media billionaire made moves to launch his own bid for the democratic nomination peak billionaire may be a billionaire deciding to possibly attempt to purchase a party nomination because of his fear that some candidates in the race aren t plutophilic enough and then running against a maybe billionaire who promised that being a billionaire would make him specially incorruptible and now is in impeachment proceedings over his alleged corruption america s crisis of capitalism has cousins abroad in chile an increase in subway fares triggered massive antigovernment pro reform protests in recent months killing at least 20 and injuring more than 1 000 a slogan of the protests has been neoliberalism was born in chile and will die in chile the protesters have been demanding that education and health care be established as rights under the chilean constitution argentina has also been rocked by protests as it grapples with an economic crisis rising hunger and the angry fallout from an international monetary fund bailout last year in britain the chaos of brexit drags on fueled by feelings that the economy wasn t working for enough people and questions about whether billionaires should exist the mercy of all this elite failure and backlash is this the ongoing collapse of any pretense of selflessness among the winners of our new gilded age if a single cultural idea has upheld the disproportionate power of this class it has been the idea of the win win they could get rich and then give back to you win win they could run a fund that made them sizable returns and offered you social returns too win win they could sell sugary drinks to children in schools and work on public private partnerships to improve children s health win win they could build cutthroat technology monopolies and get credit for serving to connect humanity and foster community win win as this seductive idea fizzles out it raises the possibility that this age of capital in which money was the ultimate organizing principle of american life could actually end something could actually replace it after all a century ago america was firmly planted in the first gilded age and then it found its way into the progressive era and the new deal an era of great public ambition business didn t go away it wasn t abolished capitalists didn t go into gulags it was just that the emphasis of the society shifted money was no longer the lodestar of all pursuits the choice facing americans is whether we want to be a society organized around money s thirsts a playground for the whims of billionaires or whether we wish to be a democracy the second gilded age will end at some point the question is what comes next what trump offers is tribal nationalism strongman politics and plutocrat friendly policy greased by populist rhetoric the other possibility is that as occurred a century ago a gilded age collapses into an age of reform an era defined culturally by renewed public purpose and politically by the restoration of the state in areas where people are too powerless to solve problems of their own defined by the use of shared institutions to solve shared problems you can already see glimpses of how an age of reform is being dreamed up higher taxes on the very fortunate to be sure more regulation and worker protections and the like an attack on climate change almost as dramatic as climate change itself programs to give workers greater security it would be an age in which it was cooler more thrilling more admired more viable to change the world democratically if there is one thing that could hasten the end of the age of capital and accelerate the coming of an age of reform it is a vigorous new culture of joining in american life not clicking not liking not retweeting not tiktokking not screaming at msnbc fox but actually joining political movements and civic organizations with memberships so vast that politicians cannot ignore them the age of capital has been facilitated by a remarkable solidarity among the ultra fortunate putting that period in the museum will take other broader solidarities giridharadas is a time editor at large and the author of winners take all the elite charade of changing the world contact us at editors time
