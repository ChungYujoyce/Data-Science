choose on caucus night eight months before voters head to their caucus sites though the poll shows movement within a democratic primary that is still wide open here are six takeaways from the iowa poll biden s support is shaky in december months before he even entered the race nearly a third of iowa voters said they backed biden today about six weeks after he announced he would run biden s support has fallen by a third biden s declining support came even before this week s controversy over his flip flop on the hyde amendment which came after selzer began fielding her poll in december 82 percent of iowa democratic voters said they saw biden favorably this month that number is down to 72 percent of democratic voters a 10 point drop his unfavorable ratings are up9 points and biden s backers are less enthusiastic about their chosen candidate than supporters of other candidates just 29 percent of biden s supporters say they are extremely enthusiastic about backing the former vice president an average of 43 percent of sanders warren and buttigieg supporters say they are extremely enthusiastic about backing their chosen candidate sanders has a ceiling three years ago sanders came within a handful of votes of achieving a stunning upset over front running former secretary of state hillary clintonhillary diane rodham clintonthe hill s morning report presented by facebook americans debate life under covid 19 risks the 10 senate seats most likely to flip stakes high for collins in coronavirus relief standoff more today almost every iowa democrat has an opinion of sanders only 5 percent of likely caucusgoers say they do not know enough about him to have formed an opinion a lower number than everyone but biden but sanders also has one of the highest unfavorable numbers among democratic candidates a quarter of state democrats say they view him negatively about the same percentage as those who see biden unfavorably the dichotomy between sanders s high name recognition and his relatively low poll numbers suggest sanders fans from 2016 are looking elsewhere this year and that the 77 year old self avowed democratic socialist has a ceiling through which he cannot break as warren buttigieg harris and the others introduce themselves to voters and earn more support they are likely to pull from a population that backed sanders over clinton in 2016 the high

coronavirus a political hit job more unfavorably warren is on a growth trajectory selzer isconsidered one of the most skilled pollsters when it comes to surveyingiowa s electorate what makes her especially effective is that her surveys consistently illustrate who s on the move up or down and though it is eight months before the caucuses warren is the candidate on the move she hasa higher net favorable ratingthan any other candidate in the field 71 percent see her favorably while just 17 percent see her unfavorably that s a better ratio than biden sanders and buttigieg an equal number of democratic voters 61 percent say they are actively considering or backing warren and biden the highest rates in the field that s5 points higher than those who say sanders is on their ticket and9 points higher than both buttigieg and harris warren has been more aggressive in laying out detailed policy proposals than any other candidate she has hired more staffers in iowa than any other candidate and she has spent more time in iowa more than two weeks than any other front runner in terms of sheer growth no one has improved more than buttigieg who wasn t even included in the december

puts him in the conversation a tough field to poll what s harder than keeping an iowa voter on the phone while a pollster reads a list of all two dozen candidates running for the democratic primary nomination how about accounting for the two different kinds of elections democrats will run next february the iowa democratic party for the first time plans to hold whatitis calling virtual caucuses events in which voters who can t attend their polling places in person on february 3 can still make their preferences known party rules say those who participate in virtual caucuses will be given the power to decide 10 percent of the delegates allocated during the caucuses regardless of how many people show up in person or by phone about 28 percent of likely democratic caucusgoers said they would participate in the virtual caucus making their votes worth about a third of those who actually show up in person that has forced selzer to ask iowa democrats not just who they plan to support but how they plan to participate and to weight support accordingly those who say they are likely to choose the virtual option are younger more moderate and more likely to be currently registered as no party which of course they must change to participate in the democratic party caucuses they are also less committed to caucusing than those who say they intend to show up on caucus night selzer wrote in an explanation of her methodology biden s support is higher among those who plan to caucus virtually 33 percent than those who plan to caucus in person 23 percent buttigieg and sanders fans disproportionately plan to show up in person warren s supporters are about evenly split while harris backers are more likely to say they will caucus virtually the new virtual caucus meant to allow more voters to participate in the process is likely to expand the universe of those who get to make their voices heard and it s also going to make the process of measuring those voters all the more difficult iowa poll has clout the iowa poll will be the lead story in tomorrow s des moines register it is already playing across cnn the poll s other top sponsor and it comes just as iowa democratic activists head to cedar rapids for the state party s annual hall of fame dinner where 19 out of 24 presidentialhopefuls will speak selzer s poll will be the talk of the afternoon so many candidates are speaking that the state party will kick off the event at 2 p m central time and it won t go unnoticed among state democrats that the front runner biden is the only top contender who won t show up
