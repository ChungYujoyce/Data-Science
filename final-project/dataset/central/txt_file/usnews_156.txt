enters politics and as recent pew research center data shows americans want limits on that flow a center for public integrity ipsos poll in february found that 85 percent of americans regardless of party believe elected officials often do favors for big campaign donors that has been a major issue in the democratic presidential primary where 24 candidates are vying for their party s nomination in

adjourned for the summer didn t make the stage only new york city mayor bill de blasio and former rep joe sestak of pennsylvania entered the race after bullock former vice president joe biden and sens kamala harris elizabeth warren and bernie sanders meanwhile are significantly ahead of bullock both in terms of financial resources and poll numbers some bullock supporters are decidedly sticking with him he s a really kind guy i think he cares deeply about everyone in his state said francisco martin rayo a strategy expert at the boston consulting group who s co hosting bullock s august fundraiser

election commission the decision that opened the floodgates for corporate union and dark money spending in federal elections bullock bolstered his campaign finance reform bona fides in 2012 as montana attorney general bullock argued on behalf of the state of montana in western tradition partnership v montana to protect the 1912 montana corrupt practices act the act passed 100 years prior banned corporate spending in political races it is utter nonsense to think that ordinary citizens or candidates can spend enough to place their experience wisdom and views before the voters and keep pace with the virtually unlimited spending capability of corporations to place corporate views before the electorate wrote the montana supreme court bullock won his case but his opponent appealed the ruling all the way to the u s supreme court enter american tradition partnership v montana again bullock represented montana but this time in the u s supreme court and without spoken argument the supreme court reversed the montana opinion and upheld citizens united bullock lost his case but he maintained his reputation as an advocate against unregulated political money he signed the 2015 montana disclose act into law which mandates more financial disclosure by political committees pacs seeking to influence an election by spending money he was featured in the 2018 documentary dark money which premiered at the sundance film festival in his 2020 announcement video he described the fight of my career as one against corrupt money in politics now it seems the funding for bullock s
