effectiveness of isis recruitment propaganda the global engagement center was also looking to identify interventions that would decrease the likelihood that potential recruits would join the islamic state al qaeda and other terrorist organizations abroad documents show the documents include the original solicitation describing the kinds of services scl would provide to the state department and information about payments to scl totaling 496 232 they also detail the state department s justification for awarding the contract to scl without conducting open bidding for contractors cambridge analytica the scl subsidiary was founded by former trump campaign and white house adviser steve bannon the firm folded earlier this year amid a scandal involving how it obtained personal information from facebook accounts including potentially tens of millions of americans under the contract the state department wanted scl to conduct not less than 50 and preferably up to 75 interviews of a representative sample of people who could be potential isis recruits across europe the former soviet union and the middle east using these interviews scl was to isolate those factors that have the ability to change the behavior of isis recruiters and potential isis recruits scl group which boasts more than 25 years experience conducting behavioral change programs in over 60 countries was asked

process for government contracts documents obtained by the center for public integrity show that the state department justified circumventing traditional competition citing scl s unique qualifications and special capabilities in designing influence campaigns that work unlike other offerings which are largely based on intuitive hunches or superficial research the state department further asserted that no other companies can compete with scl in gathering the necessary data and analyzing it in a way that permits the design of effective data driven influence campaigns further the state department argued that disclosing their justification for a no bid contract would disclose the executive agency s needs and disclosure of such needs would compromise national security or create other security
