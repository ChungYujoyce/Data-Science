it s time and past time to do something about the criminal justice system as i ve been arguing for years but with last week s white house conference on criminal justice reform it looks as if we might just see progress though i think we need real structural fixes too right now we have both an over and an under incarceration problem the over incarceration problem is that too many people are sent to jail for things that shouldn t carry much jail time if any nonviolent regulatory crimes low level nonviolent drug crimes etc even crimes that are punished with fines can turn into jail time if the defendant can t pay the fine as is often the case with poor defendants at the same time people who commit serious violent crimes often get out too soon then when people do get out they have a hard time making it honestly many people don t want to hire an ex con even when the crime was a comparatively mild one and many ex cons lack the skills to make it in the employment world though the current booming job market is helping with that coming out of the white house conference it looks like there are two things happening first work on improving re entry rehabilitation and workforce training programs and second sentencing reform under the first step act which has already passed the house of representativesand which president donald trump encouraged senators to support the proposal among other things reduces mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders these are worthwhile things which have earned president trump praise from inner city pastors who see the criminal justice system s work up close but i don t think they re enough when you look at the big picture the truth is we don t really have a criminal justice system mostly what we have is a plea bargain system police arrest people prosecutors charge them with crimes and then a deal is struck when the police search and arrest you you have a lot of constitutional due process rights but they re mostly enforceableonly if you go to trial if you go to trial you have a lot of constitutional due process rights there but the prosecutor s decision to charge you with a crime and what to charge you with which is key to the plea bargain deal is subject to virtually no constitutional protections at all more during all the russia hacking hype china is rising in influence america has a nobility problem and it means our leaders don t pay for their failures donald trump plays it safe with supreme court pick brett kavanaugh s gold plated resume policing the usa a look at race justice media once charged with a crime defendants are in a tough position first they must bear the costs of a defense assuming they are not indigent second even if they consider themselves entirely innocent they will face strong pressure to accept a plea bargain pressure made worse by the modern tendency of prosecutors to overcharge with extensive kitchen sink indictments prosecutors count on the fact that when a defendant faces dozens of felony charges the prospect that a jury might go along with even one of them will be enough to make a plea deal look attractive because the vast majority of cases result in plea bargains not trials all the constitutional due process rights make little difference the result is something that except in rare cases where the crime is high profile or the defendant is rich doesn t look much like what s taught in civics classes it looks more like a conveyor belt to prison because that s basically what it is one solution is to have fewer crimes there are literally as i noted in the columbia law review a few years ago so many crimes that not even the government can keep up with them all the more crimes we create the more criminals we create and that s bad because enforcing the law as yale law professor stephen l carter points out is inherently violent the more laws the more violence when new york made it a crime to sell loose cigarettes for tax reasons carter notes it set the stage for eric garner s death as carter writes this is by no means an argument against having laws it is an argument for a degree of humility as we choose which of the many things we may not like to make illegal i think we re much too quick to criminalize conductwithout thinking this through the next step in criminal justice reform should be to drastically prune the criminal law glenn harlan reynolds a university of tennessee law professor and the author of the new school how the information age will save american education from itself is a member of usa today s board of contributors follow him on twitter instapundit
