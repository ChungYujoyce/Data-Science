are sure to get under his skin for precisely that reason the indictments lay out in granular detail the nature of the alleged russian effort to aid trump according to prosecutors that effort involved significant manpower and money there were more than 80 employees assigned to one part of the project by july 2016 according to court documents and a broader effort codenamed project lakhta was being bankrolled at a rate of 1 25 million per month as of september 2016 the court documents note that the overall objective was to sow discord in the u s political system but they add defendants operations included supporting the presidential campaign of then candidate donald j trump and disparaging hillary clinton whatever the legal ramifications this is a significant political problem for

these latest indictments build on multiple guilty pleas and indictments of several trump campaign officials demonstrating the gravity of the trump russia scandal the president began tweeting about the matter within hours of the indictment noting that prosecutors say the russian effort began in 2014 before his presidential campaign began no collusion he also insisted a message reiterated by a written statement from white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders but with the indictments dominating political news expect more explosive trump comments soon no proof here of collusion rosenstein emphasized during his news conference that none of the information amounted to a smoking gun proving allegations of collusion between russia and the trump campaign there is no allegation in this indictment that any american was a knowing participant in this illegal activity there is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election hesaid these are important points and should serve to put a brake on some of the wilder speculation about what the indictments mean however rosenstein s words are not the sweeping exonerations that trump and his allies suggest either clearly friday sindictments are part of a much broader picture of russia related activities under investigation that picture includes the hacking of the democratic national

in the current context it had the effect of tying him more closely to mueller and to the probe rosenstein is clearly trying to walk a line his emphasis that thefridayindictments contained neither proof of collusion nor proof that russia s effects affected the election s outcome might help to placate trump to some degree still this was a symbolic show of independence amid a partisan storm the
