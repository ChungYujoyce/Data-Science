 the united states and china cooled their trade war on friday announcing a phase one agreement that reduces some u s tariffs in exchange for what u s officials said would be a big jump in chinese purchases of american farm products and other goods reuters the left is critical of the deal arguing that its predicted benefits are unrealistic and that it does not address the root issues while lighthizer and trump are crowing about an expected 40 billion to 50 billion in annual agricultural sales few analysts believe those numbers are realistic the highest level of farm products the u s has ever exported to china was 26 billion in 2012 plus this first phase deal doesn t do anything about the 25 tariffs already in place on the bulk of goods that china exports to the u s considering this fact how aggressive will china really be about pursuing increased agricultural purchases and intellectual property protections editorial board san francisco chronicle while the benefits of the trade war are speculative its costs are real the tax foundation estimates that trump s tariffs have cost americans more than 88 billion so far making this one of the biggest tax hikes in history to cushion the blow the administration gave 28 billion to farmers twice the cost of the 2009 auto industry bailout meanwhile the real issues with china from trade barriers to militarism in the south china sea to human rights violations remain unaddressed max boot washington post the deal on friday pushes the thorny issue of china s state support for its industries down the road most likely complicating relations between the world s two largest economies for years to come it seems to affirm the belief held by many chinese officials that mr trump will back off from his trade war threats if markets tumble or if his supporters in agricultural states suffer too much even before friday mr trump had delayed or canceled tariffs four times this year such policy shifts could ultimately encourage beijing to draw out negotiations for phase ii even further to reach the best possible deal keith bradsher new york times from what we can see there is nothing in this tentative deal that wouldn t have existed in the absence of the past two years of wrangling intellectual property reform has been a long standing project for president xi jinping china s first dedicated ip courts were established back in 2014 and have generally dealt fairly with non chinese litigants penalties the most glaring weakness in the post 2014 system are already being toughened perhaps that s come as a result of u s pressure but it fits just as well with china s domestic priorities if little has been achieved when us leverage was at its highest even less is going to be achieved once that leverage is ratcheted back down david fickling bloomberg the way to compete with china on trade is neither sweeping tariffs nor the administration s futile insistence that china change its fundamental economic model we need public investment in research and production to increase our international competitiveness a much more focused trade policy would do something our trade competitors including china itself does to see around the next corner of global demand where no country has yet to establish a comparative advantage china did so with the assembly of consumer electronics but that s a low value added play we should do so in green technology there s a clear path to quickly getting unstuck one that evinces strong progressive values and an export strategy that supports american workers and their communities not multinational corporations jared bernstein new york times china presents a more formidable rival than the former soviet union ever was which means that allies matter more than ever to u s power but unlike his predecessors in the age of the soviet threat trump s first move in his campaign against china was to sabotage the alliances that once enhanced u s leverage the united states cannot impose its will on china but it can work with others to write rules that china cannot afford to ignore david frum the atlantic the right supports the deal as a modest but positive step and argues that the us has the advantage in future negotiations the right supports the deal as a modest but positive step and argues that the us has the advantage in future negotiations the trade deal that president trump announced with china on friday isn t ve day but it s still welcome economic news the modest deal is essentially a detente that eliminates the damage from pending u s tariffs and even makes some progress on longstanding problems like china s intellectual property theft china is promising to stop conditioning business licenses or other permits on tech transfers to joint venture partners china is also promising new protections against patent theft notably requiring chinese firms that inform a u s competitor if it is selling a product that includes technology that might infringe on the u s firm s patent this so called patent linkage will give u s firms recourse to object before they ve lost market share to the cheating firm mr trump has done more to address chinese cheating than any previous president and he is smart to step back and test if china will honor these new commitments the deal will also help china s reformers who want to make these policy changes to overcome its own many economic weaknesses if china s mercantilists block reform mr trump or the next president can revisit the terms mr trump is showing good faith in giving china a chance to show it can play by the rules of honest global trade editorial board wall street journal this looks like a win politically the timing of this is obviously good for the president he can claim another win on trade just two days after a us mexico canada trade deal to replace nafta was approved in principle by nancy pelosi the vote on that deal is set to take place next week pelosi actually took some heat for handing trump a win in the same week he is being impeached but more important than the partisan win is the possible end to at least a portion of the trade war with china that should result in some price relief on consumer goods and even stronger economic growth in the near term all of that is bound to help the stock market and public perception of the strength of the economy john sexton hot air the u s has a far more adaptive and diverse economy than china china s economy is inefficient bloated dysfunctional plagued by institutions and policies that are not fit for their purposes if the tariff war resumes it will continue to prove much more disruptive to china than to the u s mr xi s purging of more than 1 5 million officials including top generals and party members will come back to bite him in addition to holding a weaker economic hand mr xi is far more vulnerable to internal rebellion and therefore more desperate for economic pain relief than the american president in every negotiation pressure is relative and the u s has more political and economic leverage than china mr trump is properly recasting china as the main threat to a fair and sustainable global economic system multinational companies are gradually assessing the commercial risk that sovereign risk poses to them the possibility that china will arbitrarily alter laws or regulations or fail to honor government bonds when they mature john lee wall street journal while chinese concessions will almost surely fall short the us didn t give up leverage as some wanted and can respond either to meaningful progress by china or the lack the us should use the deal to test beijing s intentions will american exports soar 200 billion and coercive technology practice halt no but clear progress on both fronts would be an excellent outcome in this light complaints the deal doesn t go far enough smack of preferring american capitulation sizable tariffs were applied barely six months ago the prc won t undertake major change at the convenience of an increasingly shrill american investor class the us can now wait to see how china s deeds fit its words a good position in an election year derek scissors american enterprise institute a libertarian s take the deal is pretty good because it reduces business uncertainty confirms that the administration realizes its approach was unsustainable and by formalizing terms to resolve the variety of issues that frankly distract attention from the most difficult problems in the relationship creates needed space to shift focus to the genuinely challenging matters relative to what was looming higher tariffs on all imports from china these terms should be welcome news to most consumers workers businesses and investors in the united states and china and
