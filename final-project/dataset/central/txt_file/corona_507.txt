economic experts are warning that the 1 2 trillion stimulus proposal under negotiation in the senate may fall well short of addressing the massive fallout from the coronavirus pandemic the plan drafted by senate republicans would include direct payments to many americans as well as 300 billion in loans to help struggling businesses stay afloat and a 200 billion facility for important industries such as airlines responding to this kind of protracted slowdown will require a bigger stimulus than the 6 of gross domestic product proposed by the administration narayana kocherlakota the former president of the federal reserve bank of minneapolis wrote in a bloomberg opinion piece it s going to take a much larger fiscal infusion to make up for that shortfall something more on the order of 2 5 trillion rather than 1 2 trillion kocherlakota called for 10 000 cash payments to every adult significantly more than the two payments of 1 200 included in the senate gop proposal

economic healthy by the end of 2020 starts at 2 1 trillion but it could be more and fiscal policy should be set to deliver more if conditions warrant epi research director josh bivens wrote in a friday blog post the right leaning american enterprise institute recommended the u s follow in the u k s footsteps and shore up all wages at 80 percent to save small businesses that alone would cost 1 2 trillion to 1 5 trillion in assistance they said low margin businesses will face great financial difficulty losing multiple months of revenue and many if not most small businesses would rather shut down or lay off a significant fraction of their workforce than take out a loan even with a favorable or zero interest rate aei scholars glenn hubbard and michael r strain wrote gordon gray the director of fiscal policy at the right leaning american action forum agreed that even the colossal bill under consideration by the senate may only be a first step while the costs are substantial this
