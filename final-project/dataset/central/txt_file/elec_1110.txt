poses for photos with a sign at a rally for democratic presidential candidate sen bernie sanders i vt on tuesday in carson calif for some weeks now as bernie sanders has extended his remarkable and improbable run as a presidential candidate people have been asking what does bernie want that question is a distant echo of what does jesse want a relic of the 1988 runner up candidacy of jesse jackson another outsider challenger with a dedicated hardcore following but more about jackson in a moment this week the question took a different form after a rowdy convention in nevada prompted death threats against that state party chair the question suddenly became are the democrats coming apart uniting for the fall has always been an issue for both parties but this year it was supposed to be the republicans with their 17 candidates and their frustrated nevertrump rearguard action who broke up over their differences now it s working out quite differently so we hear again that old nostrum democrats want to fall in love republicans want to fall in line a remarkable number of republicans have accepted if not embraced donald trump as their nominee but a large contingent of democrats continue to feel the bern or at least remain very much out of love with hillary clinton which brings us to this past weekend which proved that sometimes what happens in vegas does not stay in vegas the nevada fracas has created a media meme and a conversational focus for the conflict roiling the democratic party that is because it encapsulates the grievances felt on both sides sanders supporters see that some of their number were not seated in las vegas and see evidence that the system is rigged against them clinton supporters hear the epithets hurled at women on that stage including the state party chair and sen barbara boxer and perceive evidence of something else others will adjudicate what happened in las vegas where both candidates camps seem to think they were entitled to a majority of delegates although clinton won the initial round of caucuses back in february sanders had the upper hand in an intermediate round at the county level on april 2 one camp wanted an open process the other wanted respect for the rules a voice vote was gaveled to a conclusion despite an uncertain outcome which is bound to cause trouble but in the end the party chair herself has come to seem the principal victim more sinned against than sinning because of extreme phone and online harassment nevada s convention seems to have been an egregious case an outlier in other states where actual delegates are chosen in several phases regular order has been followed without a similar outburst but exceptions to the rule often make news and in this case cable tv and social media have endlessly repeated the raucous video shot at the convention and the toxic harassment that followed as nevada became a national story sanders was pressured to respond the candidate has condemned violence generically but has not apologized for his backers instead sanders and his retinue have denied responsibility for what happened and doubled down on their long simmering resentments against democratic party officials they say the entire process has been rigged against them even parts that have been in place for decades and the implicit message has been treat us fairly or expect there to be consequences when this message is combined with sanders vow this week to carry our fight to the convention it darkens the portents for the national convention in philadelphia so what does bernie want let s start with the obvious he wants to be nominated and elected that s understood every candidate has a perfect right to continue fighting until the last ballot is cast as sanders vows to do but even if he wins california and several other states on june 7 sanders would need vertiginous victory margins to win enough delegates to close the pledged delegate gap with clinton the democrats divide delegates proportionally according to the popular vote which is just about as democratic a method as you can imagine so sanders one path is to persuade superdelegates to prefer him over clinton even though they currently prefer clinton by more than 10 1 the only superdelegate to flip so far deserted sanders for the front runner sanders and his spokespersons say superdelegates should now ignore the overall vote and the pledged delegate totals and look at how much better sanders does against trump in hypothetical november matchups the only problem is that hypothetical tests six months before the election are notoriously unreliable just ask president perot moreover many of the poll respondents who create this november differential right now are sanders supporters who say they will shift to trump in november the likelihood of their actually doing so is problematic given past experience with disgruntled backers of other candidates who fell short the most recent example would be the clinton backers in 2008 who swore they would not vote for the man who beat her barack obama but wound up doing so in the fall so the path to the nomination for sanders is not just uphill it is essentially vertical so what else might sanders want no one seems to think sanders wants to be vice president or have any other role in a clinton administration he would return to the senate where he would be in a wholly new weight class of political influence but he clearly wants to make a difference to alter how the democrats go forward in the fall campaign and beyond and that is what the clinton camp must manage it is entirely possible that the democratic convention in philadelphia this july will vote to change party rules shrinking the number of superdelegates or requiring them to follow the voting results in their states it is also possible if less likely that the party would agree to allow more independents a role in its nominating process although this would still depend on the will of the various states sanders supporters will also strive to make the party platform more progressive raising the minimum wage to 15 an hour and expanding medicare to cover people of all ages and perhaps calling for free tuition at public colleges the platform already calls for much of sanders program regarding the campaign finance system and other issues this might fall far short of the political revolution sanders says his campaign is about but it could still matter and it could still point the party toward a far more progressive future that is one way in which the 1988 precedent is relevant jesse jackson arrived in atlanta with about 30 percent of the delegates not nearly as many as sanders will have this summer at the time it was easily the best showing for an african american presidential candidate and although jackson was not going to be nominated massachusetts gov michael dukakis had a first ballot majority his message of racial and economic inclusion was popular and powerful within the party s base the dukakis forces recognized this and turned the proceedings over to jackson on the second night of the convention thousands of jackson supporters jammed the arena while delegates alternates and journalists waited outside unable to enter jackson gave an hourlong oration on the theme of common ground a siege gun speaking for unity jackson did his part in the fall helping dukakis carry nearly 90 percent of the black vote and 70 percent of the then minuscule hispanic vote unfortunately for dukakis minority voters cast only about one ballot in seven in 1988 but by 2012 the share of the vote cast by people of color had nearly doubled that stunning growth has turned a dozen states that were red in 1988 to blue in 2012 california illinois pennsylvania michigan new jersey virginia maryland new mexico connecticut new hampshire delaware and vermont the same demographic trends have made florida ohio and colorado toss ups in presidential elections all had been solidly republican in 1988 sanders hard base is not among minorities of course but among younger voters his success has been built on winning three fourths or even more of the voters under age 30 that is a group clinton will need in the fall just as much as dukakis needed jackson s base in 1988 sanders may not want a jackson style prime time convention session all his own he might be willing to settle for platform and rules revisions that would validate his campaign but if he wants a bernie night in philadelphia when he can bring his political revolution to life even for a few hours it might be a small price to pay for peace npr thanks our sponsors become an npr sponsor
