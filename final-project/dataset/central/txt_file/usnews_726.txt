 find out exactly what they have and read every word of it so says california senator dianne feinstein played by annette bening to staffer daniel j jones in amazon s upcoming political drama the report sen feinstein sets jones played by adam driver on an investigation of the central intelligence agency s detention and enhanced interrogation or torture of suspected terrorists during the administration of president george w bush ultimately a seven year project that would nearly take over his life written and directed by filmmaker scott z burns the report chronicles jones real investigation on behalf of the senate intelligence committee into the bush era cia as well as the senate s subsequent struggle with the obama administration to release what jones uncovered working for sen feinstein then the chair of the committee jones and his team reviewed around 6 3 million pages of internal cia documents and wrote a roughly 6 700 page report on their findings often referred to as the torture report which remains classified to this day in 2014 the senate voted to release a more than 500 page executive summary which served as a basis for the film s script some dialogue is even pulled from the summary itself the film lays out in graphic detail what jones discovered that the u s government s detention and interrogation program was inefficient needlessly brutal and intentionally hidden from policymakers and the american people the report also depicts how president barack obama s administration specifically john o brennan s cia worked to undermine the committee s efforts to make their findings public jon hamm plays president obama s chief of staff denis mcdonough who the film suggests repeatedly sided with the cia after the 2011 killing of osama bin laden improved the president s chances for reelection burns tells time he consulted the work of investigative journalists like jane mayer and james risen the autobiographies of cia officials interviews with military and law enforcement experts on interrogation and interviews with the senators on the intelligence committee but the primary source for the film was the declassified executive summary itself i made a choice not to say at the beginning of this movie based on a true story what i chose to say is that this movie is based on this report burns explains before we can identify whether a story is true or not we have to identify what the facts of the story are burns stresses that the report is about facts this is the cia s own accounting of their program and it s an amazing puzzle that dan jones was able to put together out of 6 2 million documents and so one would think if there was a narrative that said this program worked it would ve been found somewhere in those 6 2 million documents here s a brief overview of the real events behind the report jones and his team found that between 2002 and 2008 at least 119 detainees were held by the cia in covert locations around the world known as black sites the cia admitted at least 26 of the detainees were wrongfully held according to the committee s executive summary interrogations of cia detainees were brutal and far worse than the cia represented to policymakers and others thirty nine of the detainees were tortured the techniques included walling slamming a person against a wall slaps nudity stress positions and sleep deprivation some were made to stay awake for as long as a week and others were told their families were in danger or they were going to be killed at least five detainees were subjected to unnecessary rectal rehydration and at least three were waterboarded which simulates the experience of drowning the report found the interrogations caused psychological and behavioral issues including hallucinations paranoia insomnia and attempts at self harm at least one detainee gul rahman died possibly because of hypothermia crucially jones team also found that the interrogations weren t effective seven detainees provided no intelligence at all and many detainees made up information creating faulty intelligence other detainees provided significant accurate intelligence prior to or without having been subjected to these techniques the summary continues furthermore jones team found that the cia exaggerated the effectiveness of the program and misled the white house congress and the american public the executive summary concludes that the program was mismanaged what s more it was developed by two psychologists james elmer mitchell and bruce jessen played by douglas hodge and t ryder smith in the film who had no experience as interrogators and lacked specialized knowledge of both al qaeda and counterterrorism burns says he was first drawn to this topic after reading katherine eban s 2007 vanity fair article rorschach and awe which examines how mitchell and jessen developed the interrogation program burns parents are both psychologists and he says he was interested in the idea that a field of science that had largely existed to explain human behavior and heal people could somehow be used by this the report features prolonged scenes of mitchell and jessen s interrogations of suspected terrorists and includes some composite characters such as maura tierney s cia official because names in the executive summary were redacted the investigation into the cia s interrogation program began in 2007 when the new york times reported that the cia had destroyed tapes of interrogations in 2005 two years before feinstein became jones boss west virginia democratic senator jay rockefeller was the chairman of the senate intelligence committee and he asked jones to review the cia documents to determine what was on the tapes before working for sen rockefeller jones had been an fbi analyst in the international terrorism operations section he and former cia lawyer alissa starzak who doesn t appear by name in the film dove into the cia s records for two years and delivered a report to the committee in 2009 on their findings basically the members of the committee found out that they had been lied to by the cia the real daniel jones tells time that the techniques were far more brutal than they had ever described that the whole claims of effectiveness related to the origins of the program were simply not true and that there were all these other management failures in march 2009 in response to jones report the committee voted 14 to 1 to launch a larger investigation into the cia s detention and interrogation program sen feinstein had become the chairman of the committee at this point and asked jones to stay on to head up the investigation he was initially told it would take about a year to complete around the same time attorney general eric holder announced he was broadening a criminal investigation into the cia and as a result the cia said that no one within the agency was allowed to speak to jones team the republican minority on the committee then pulled their support for the investigation arguing it couldn t get far without interviews jones and his team of four core members moved ahead poring over millions of agency documents in a windowless basement room over the years jones and his team wrote thousands of pages about what they found jones recalls having to beg other staff members to read the report asking for their help on clarity and checking for typos we don t have editors it s just us he explains they finished that 6 700 page document in 2012 sen feinstein sent the report for comment and review by the cia other intelligence agencies and the white house in june 2013 the committee heard back that the cia had major problems with the report and claimed it contained inaccuracies over the summer jones and his team began meeting with the cia to work through these sections jones describes the period as the summer of hell we knew what the facts were and we would basically say you know the ocean water is blue here it is and they would say no we think it s yellow and i d be like but here s the picture right it s blue he explains jones became so frustrated that feinstein told him to stop meeting with the cia jones remembers feinstein instructing him to include the cia s objections in the footnotes of the summary ensuring the world knew the ridiculousness of their response he tells time in early winter the cia accused the senate of illegally accessing an internal review of its detention and interrogation program known as the panetta review and removing it from cia facilities without authorization the cia s own inspector general then opened a criminal referral after senators accused the cia of improperly monitoring jones team per the times in february the cia then filed a second criminal referral against jones and his team arguing that they hacked into the cia and took the panetta review without permission in march sen feinstein gave a biting 45 minute speech on the senate floor condemning the cia s actions she confirmed that part of the review had been copied and moved to the senate s office because the cia had destroyed the interrogation tapes and the review had since disappeared off the committee s computer system feinstein accused the cia of conducting an unauthorized search of her staffer s computer network saying she was concerned the cia may have violated the constitution s separation of powers principle she requested an apology and added that she viewed the criminal referral against jones staff a potential effort to intimidate john brennan strongly denied feinstein s accusations saying nothing could be further from the truth per the times but in july the cia s inspector general found that the agency actually had penetrated the senate intelligence committee s computer network and filed the criminal referral against jones and his team was based on false information the same day brennan apologized the panetta review came to the same conclusions as jones investigation but differed from the cia s official response jones tells time he thinks it should never have been withheld from the committee jones says the review appeared on his computer one day either by a computer glitch or a whistleblower he says a lot of documents slipped into the millions they were given access to some having nothing to do with interrogation it might have just accidentally come through the department of justice dismissed the charges against jones team the executive summary then moved to the white house to determine what should be declassified it came back heavily redacted and the senators pushed to include more details and names in the version released to the public finally after a long back and forth with the obama administration the senate released the executive summary on dec 9 2014 shortly before democrats lost control of the senate the senators who are involved are the ones who make things happen jones says i was just a staffer it really takes senators being courageous in a 2014 op ed in the washington post jose a rodriguez jr the former director of the cia s national clandestine service whose name appears throughout the report responded to the committee s findings with cutting words the report s leaked conclusion which has been reported on widely that the interrogation program brought no intelligence value is an egregious falsehood it s a dishonest attempt to rewrite history i m bemused that the senate could devote so many resources to studying the interrogation program and yet never once speak to any of the key people involved in it including the guy who ran it that would be me burns says that these conflicting narratives between the cia s account of what happened and jones discoveries inform the conflict of the film he s interested in the question how do these two narratives battle it out in the real world and which one ends up getting purchased in the culture as the truth the film ends in 2014 after the senate releases jones findings but the issues it explores persist in the present day in 2015 the senate passed the mccain feinstein anti torture amendment which banned any further use of enhanced interrogation techniques on detainees in the spring of 2018 gina haspel who per the times oversaw the torture of a terrorism suspect in thailand and was involved in the 2005 destructions of the interrogation tapes was confirmed as the director of the cia during her hearing before the senate haspel pledged not to restart the interrogation program write to madeleine carlisle at madeleine
