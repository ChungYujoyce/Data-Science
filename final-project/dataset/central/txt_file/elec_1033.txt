usually do not face an opponent during primaries the scale of trump s spending and the sophistication of his digital operations is unparalleled among sitting presidents according to analysts trump s digital operation in 2016 was so successful he appointed the man widely credited with steering it brad parscale as his campaign manager for 2020 in an interview with pbs s frontline documentary the facebook dilemma parscale called facebook a critical aspect of trump s campaign in 2016 he said it allowed trump to speak directly to camera and use microtargeted ads to tailor messages to specific communities and demographics we might write 50 000 ads that only have very very small nuances changed about them parscale said the trump campaign did not reply to requests from the hill seeking comment from parscale a similar strategy appeared to be in place ahead of 2020 facebook data showed the donald j trump for president committee spentmore than 3 5 million since may 2018 spread out over 77 230 ads or an average cost of 45 each similarly the trump make america great again committee run jointly with the republican national committee spent 6 2 million over 91 538 ads or an average cost

narrative for whoever comes to oppose him smikle added and then the question is how does the democrat respond to that 2020 democratic contenders are showing they have absorbed the message behind trump

presidential campaign three years ago some of the 2020 contenders have already shown a keen understanding of digital media most prominently sanders who was widely credited for smartly leveraging the medium during his unsuccessful run for the 2016 democratic nomination against clinton sanders also has an army of small donor supporters which he showed off by announcinghe had raised 6 millionjust over a day after announcing his 2020 presidential bid meanwhile former rep beto o rourke d texas who has said he is deciding whether to run for president in 2020 proved a keen digital campaigner last year when he came less than three points away from defeating cruz in the red state facebook data showed o rourke spentmore than 8 million on facebook an amount overtaken only by trump and has proven an adept fundraiser among small donors raising more than 70 million last year but analysts believe democrats will need to do more as the party braces to take out trump in 2020 not least because he has already amassed a huge list of supporters that he can continue to target via emails or facebook ads democrats need to stay focused on the general election and build up infrastructure and keep democrats engaged and mobilized around the general said acronym s mcgowan i think that s a really important piece of this because trump has effectively already begun his general election campaign view
