ethics laws and codes and interior s ethics office has sanctioned how he deals with former clients that have business before the agency but democrats and environmental groups accuse him of using his position at interior to shape regulations and legislation in favor of big agriculture oil and gas interests and other former clients the confirmation vote thursday was overshadowed by questions about his actions into 2017 after he gave up his registration as a lobbyist in anticipation of his appointment to interior a previously unreported set of invoices and emails obtained by california water law
