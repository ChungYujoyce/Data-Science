no evidence to show it works for that either the president initially had suggested the country could reopen by easter but pulled back seeing projections of a staggering death toll even if restrictive

previously booming economy had been among trump s biggest talking points as he heads into the 2020 presidential election but the past few weeks have seen precipitous drops as the u s deals with the fallout from the virus that has shuttered businesses gutted airlines and forced people into their homes the president also continued to tout hydroxychloroquine a drug long used to treat malaria rheumatoid arthritis and lupus after very small preliminary studies suggested it might help prevent the coronavirus from entering cells and possibly help patients clear the virus sooner but the drug has major potential side effects especially for the heart and large studies are underway to see if it is safe and effective for treating covid 19 trump suggested he may consider whether he should start taking the drug though he also said he d ask his doctor first some studies are testing whether hydroxychloroquine can help prevent infections in health care workers but none has suggested that others such as the president should take it to prevent infection with congress away house speaker nancy pelosi pressed for the next aid package to be ready for an april vote in a letter to house
