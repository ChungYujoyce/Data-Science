company and top editors in deep legal trouble and reopen them to prosecution for paying hush money to a playboy model who claimed she had an affair with donald trump federal prosecutors are looking at whether the enquirer s feud with bezos violated a cooperation and non prosecution agreement that recently spared the gossip sheet from charges in the hush money case two people familiar with the matter told the associated press on friday the clash between the world s richest man and america s most aggressive supermarket tabloid spilled into public view late thursday when bezos accused it of

investigating how the publication recently obtained private messages that bezos and his girlfriend had exchanged and publicly declare that the enquirer s coverage of bezos was not politically motivated enquirer owner american media inc said friday that its board of directors ordered a prompt and thorough investigation and will take whatever appropriate action is necessary earlier in the day the company said it acted lawfully while reporting the story and engaged in good faith negotiations with bezos in recent months the trump friendly tabloid acknowledged secretly assisting trump s white house campaign by paying 150 000 to playboy centerfold karen mcdougal for the rights to her story about an alleged affair with trump the company then buried the story until after the 2016 election trump s longtime personal attorney and fixer michael cohen pleaded guilty last year to charges that included helping to broker that transaction federal prosecutors considered the payment an illegal corporate contribution to trump s campaign in september though ami reached an agreement with federal authorities that spared it from prosecution it promised in the agreement not to break any laws the deal also required the continuing cooperation of top ami executives including ceo david pecker and enquirer editor dylan howard now federal prosecutors in new york are looking at whether ami violated those terms the people familiar with the matter said they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke to ap on condition of anonymity a violation of the agreement could lead to criminal charges over the mcdougal payments and the resulting court proceedings could lay bare details of the gossip sheet s cozy relationship with the president the enquirer and top executives

photographs legal experts said the u s attorney s office in manhattan declined to comment carrie goldberg a brooklyn lawyer representing revenge porn and sex crime victims said bezos account laid out a clear case of criminal coercion the enquirer has weaponized journalism and made it into this bartering brokering thing where it s like if i can blackmail you with the threat i ll expose this unless you ve got something better goldberg said it is a federal crime to threaten to injure someone s reputation in exchange for money or a thing of value though federal courts haven t made it clear whether a public statement like the one demanded by ami could be considered something of value bezos said the enquirer did not demand money former new york federal prosecutor jennifer rodgers said prosecutors are probably weighing the pros and cons of keeping the cooperation agreement in place the agreement secures pecker s testimony in any future cases stemming from the hush money payments while winning a criminal case over the bezos matter would be far from clear cut rodgers said the company could say it was relying on the advice of its counsel or even cite first amendment protections she said the
