on stephen colbert s cbs late night show the host challenged elizabeth warren on the issue of single payer healthcare which she unequivocally supports he attempted to nail the leftist senator down on the question of whether or not middle class americans taxes would have to go up they would a lot in order to fund the program she and bernie sanders have proposed she ducked he drilled down further then she ducked again prompting the comedian to call her out on it seemingly to her surprise this is about as hostile as it gets for a democrat on national entertainment television and colbert immediately pivoted to offering warren advice on how to make the argument in favor of middle class tax hikes for the greater good of single payer healthcare his critique you see came from a place of support and agreement he simply wants her to be the most effective leftist she can be the political problem is that coming out and saying yes we re going to raise all of your taxes a lot but it ll be worth it is highly politically risky to wit if voters were told that a government run system could lead to delays in getting care or higher taxes support plunged to 26 percent and 37 percent respectively the issue that will really be fundamental would be the tax issue said robert blendon a professor at the harvard t h chan school of public health who reviewed the poll he pointed out that state single payer efforts in vermont and colorado failed because of concerns about the tax increasesneeded to put them in place the other fundamental problem for warren is that her plan would rip away private healthcare plans from nearly 180 million americans making such coverage illegal at the last democratic debate warren tried to brush this off by claiming that few americans love their insurance companies what many many americans do value quite strongly however is the coverage and providers they come to rely on polling underscores that reality which is a massive political liability for single payer advocates who explicitly want to permanently uproot tens upon tens of millions of people from those existing arrangements in addition a recent kaiser poll recently found that 86 percent of americans with private coverage were satisfied with it healthcare disruption is deeply unpopular as both parties have learned in recent years warren may try to here s the thing her way out of addressing these facts but she can t deflect away from much higher taxes illegal private coverage and long bureaucratic wait times for care i ll leave you with this by my count this raises sanders proposal costs to between 62 trillion and 85 trillion over the decade adding in the 15 trillion baseline deficit and we re looking at a budget hole of perhaps 100 trillion 40 of gdp no taxes are closing that gap fantasyland https t co 9v1ro5mcrw alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
