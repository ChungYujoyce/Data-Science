apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion guessing whether or not dprk s supreme leader kim jong un will yield to president trump s demands and agree to dismantle his country s nuclear and missile programs reached the peak on the eve of the second u s north korea summit in hanoi the u s intelligence community holds the pessimistic view which is widely shared by most western pundits yet we remain hopeful because kim jong un is a very different leader from his predecessors and his track record imbues us with guarded optimism mr kim knows well the criticisms and negative perceptions of north korea around the world he is able to see objectively his country s position on the international arena that is as a relatively backward isolated and unpredictable rogue state facing growing economic hardships and political uncertainty he knows the west believes he is a liar and cheater and western leaders don t trust his government and find it politically difficult imprudent and pointless to negotiate with it while he can t criticize his predecessors for the state of affairs he inherited from them he always asks whether any foreign leader has ever seriously negotiated with him then he wonders why they believe that he is just like his father kim jong il and grandfather kim il sung which is really a subjective assumption not a fact top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed it is a no secret that mr kim sees himself as the ruler of north korea for the next several decades despite government propaganda he understands that it will be extremely difficult for him to sustain his rule in the long run due tightening international sanctions and therefore he has to choose between reliance on nuclear weapons or international cooperation to preserve his regime mr kim frequently tells his interlocutors he wants to normalize relations with the united states fast fast he devotes considerable time to personally managing the dprk u s relations mr kim wants to settle the nuclear issue before mr trump leaves office while recognizing the implementation of the nuclear deal might take time he understands this year is critical and if no progress is made in dprk u s relations in 2019 it will be more difficult to achieve a breakthrough and normalize relations in the year of presidential election campaigns in the u s and south korea in 2020 although neither side is sure what the opposite side really wants they have already expressed how much they are willing to give in what is left is how to assemble all pieces of the denuclearization normalization puzzle together and in what sequence since pyongyang washington and seoul recognize time is on no one s side they apparently share the belief in the practical utility of the quick action for quick action approach two critical challenges still face negotiators trust and value on the trust side mr kim stresses the major discrepancy between the untied states and north korea s negotiating positions all his steps including the dismantlement of yonbyon nuclear center and other critical components of dprk s nuclear program will be irreversible whereas all u s steps e g sanctions relief suspension of military exercises exchange of liaison offices economic assistance etc will be reversible a credible solution to the irreversibility problem undermining mutual trust must be found before any final deal is reached on the value side despite common perceptions some u s offers e g opening a liaison office or signing the end of korean war declaration don t look appealing to mr kim at all because he sees them as either purely symbolic without enhancing the security of his regime or benefitting washington more than pyongyang and therefore he doesn t want to give up anything of value to obtain them the united states needs to put more credible security assurances and economic benefits on the table to entice mr kim to strike a deal in turn to make the deal more palatable for mr trump mr kim appears to be willing to acquiesce to the yonbyon plus formula which will incorporate some hidden card a positive surprise for the united states that he is likely to bring to the negotiating table in hanoi mr kim comes across as a rational individual calculating his steps on the basis of the cost benefit analysis a strategist prioritizing regime preservation and national survival yet he appears to be very emotional and never satisfied unless things get done fast kim jong un committed himself at least verbally to denuclearization he told so in person to president trump and secretary mike pompeo repeatedly to chinese president xi and south korean president moon does he mean it only future will tell does mr kim himself know what he wants probably not yet because he is evolving just like any other 36 year old person he may be certain today but he may change his mind tomorrow the best advice for our leaders in dealing with mr kim is distrust gorbify and verify they need to maximize engagement and embrace kim jong un win his heart and mind shape his new thinking limiting the influence of his hardline aides holding his hand firmly and wisely guiding his actions toward a prosperous and secure future for the korean people in a safer world the alternative is bleak failure in hanoi might prompt mr kim to return to his shell lock down his country and resume belligerent behavior while waiting until the next u s administration to come escalating tensions on the korean peninsula will be deja vu all over again alexandre y mansourov is
