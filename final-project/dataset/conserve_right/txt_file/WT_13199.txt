apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the recent naval incident in the kerch strait connecting crimea to the russian mainland smells of a provocation by ukrainian president petro poroshenko desperate to pull his approval ratings out of single digits in advance of next year s election the immediate target of this gambit straight out of the 1997 movie wag the dog is to derail a meeting between president donald trump and russia s vladimir putin at this week s g20 in argentina trump must not fall for it as with increasing tensions with beijing over us naval probing in the south china sea the kerch incident shows once again that risks of direct military conflict between the us and russia and china are on the rise signs point toward what was once unthinkable world war iii the united nations which was supposed to help ensure global peace and security seems not up to the task top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches not only that there s increasing concern that it s a war the us might not win us military superiority is no longer assured and the implications for american interests and american security are severe said a new report by the national defense strategy commission an independent agency authorized by congress the us might struggle to win or perhaps lose a war against china or russia predictably the response has been to insist the us military is underfunded and to demand more money be thrown at the problem this is despite the fact that our military budget is already roughly ten times that of russia s and three times larger than china s maybe the real problem is not one of lack of funds besides even if money could solve the problem we don t have it what would transpire if social security checks stopped showing up in mailboxes and medicare benefits got cut off asks hunter derensis in the american conservative when presented with that choice will the average american choose his social safety net or continued funding for far flung bases in stuttgart okinawa and djibouti moreover what has the so called unipolar security maintenance of our planet gotten us is the world or for that matter america safer than during the cold war actually if we see what is going in afghanistan iraq libya syria yemen where the us military is actively involved not only have these countries been devastated some of them became even more fertile ground for islamic terrorism the us military is also involved in ukraine where the 2014 western backed coup not only resulted in making this country among the poorest in europe but stoked neo nazi violence belatedly discovered even by the swamp critters there is a better way rather than doubling or tripling down on a futile and dangerous quest to maintain a fading unipolar global domination and power projection the us can accept a multipolar future in which the us would remain the first among equals for the foreseeable future this means coming to terms first of all with the two giants the national defense strategy commission worries about going to war with russia and china as we recommended following donald trump s election rather than adversaries russia and china can become america s essential partners and are we are convinced ready to respond positively it s time for trump and america to take the initiative for u s russia china cooperation towards a secure prosperous and peaceful future trump s meeting this week with putin and with china s xi jinping can help move that forward it s now perhaps time to consider another important man for inclusion prime minister narendra modi of india a demographic giant on a par with china india is a nuclear power with a burgeoning economy long on friendly terms with moscow new delhi has worked to sort out its sometimes acrimonious relationship with beijing too adding one more item to the alphabet soup of global groupings usric united states russia india and china makes sense it would also be nice to include a proverbial fifth wheel in the form of europe but at this time that may not be possible neither the uk france germany nor any other single european country is of sufficient stature as for the european union itself the notion of say jean claude juncker or donald tusk sharing the stage with trump putin xi and modi doesn t pass the laugh test if trump succumbs to pressure to cancel his meeting with putin it would be a mistake of historic proportions it would signal abandonment of his 2016 his america first common sense agenda and submission to the deep state that has sought to block him at every turn and still conspires to remove him from office instead we urge the president to meet with putin as well as with xi and modi and consider calling a big four usric summit in the near future the g20meeting is a perfect opportunity at least to test the waters he must not waste it edward lozansky is president of the american university in moscow he is the author of the book operation
