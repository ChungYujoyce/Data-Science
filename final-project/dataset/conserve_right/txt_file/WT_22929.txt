apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap unveiling a new immigration plan president donald trump said he wanted to provide a sharp contrast with democrats and he did aiming to upend decades of family based immigration policy with a new approach that favors younger totally brilliant high skilled workers he says won t compete for american jobs trump s sweeping immigration plan is more a campaign document than anything else it s a white house attempt to stretch beyond the build the wall rhetoric that swept the president to office but may not be enough to deliver him a second term as trump heads into reelection season his campaign sees the plan as a way to help him look more reasonable on a signature issue than he often seems and to cast democrats as blocking him trump s rose garden address was tempered by friday morning while he requested democratic support trump fired off tweets about bad hombres moving into the united states and how they will be removed top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey border patrol is apprehending record numbers of people at the southern border the bad hombres of which there are many are being detained will be sent home trump tweeted all people that are illegally coming into the united states now will be removed from our country at a later date as we build up our removal forces and as the laws are changed please do not make yourselves too comfortable you will be leaving soon trump said thursday that his new system with points given for those with advanced degrees job offers and other attributes will make it exactly clear what standards we ask you to achieve nowadays we discriminate against genius he said using a softer tone than his usual fiery campaign rallies we discriminate against brilliance we won t anymore once we get this passed even before the speech democrats whose votes would be needed for any bill to be approved by the divided congress panned the effort and questioned the republican party s commitment to families are they saying family is without merit asked house speaker nancy pelosi are they saying most of the people who ve come to the united states in the history of our country are without merit because they don t have an engineering degree pelosi continued certainly we want to attract the best to our country but she said merit is a condescending word that means merit in the eyes of donald trump trump s new plan has been months in the making a project of his son in law jared kushner who has been meeting privately with business groups religious leaders and conservatives to find common ground among republicans on an issue that has long divided the party kushner has long complained that many advocates on the immigration issue are very clear about what they re against but have much more trouble articulating what they re for kushner set out to create a proposal that republicans might be able to rally around his mission to give the president and his party a clear platform heading into the 2020 elections trump didn t mention his son in law s work during the address but noted that the proposal wasn t written by politicians instead the president said it had input from law enforcement personnel it also had echoes of white house senior adviser stephen miller who wants to push down the country s immigration levels and has driven much of the administration s policy as part of the plan officials want to shore up ports of entry to ensure all vehicles and people are screened and to create a self sustaining fund paid for with increased fees to modernize ports of entry the plan also calls for building border wall in targeted locations and continues to push for an overhaul to the u s asylum system with the goal of processing fewer applications and more quickly removing people who don t qualify in addition the plan includes a proposal to allow public donations to pay for the president s long promised border wall the plan does not address what to do about the millions of immigrants already living in the country illegally including hundreds of thousands of young dreamers brought to the u s as children a top priority for democrats nor does it reduce overall rates of immigration as miller and many conservative republicans would like republicans in congress who were briefed on the plan by kushner and miller earlier this week welcomed but did not fully embrace the approach some of those up for reelection including sen susan collins of maine objected to its failure to account for the young dreamers at its core the proposal would fundamentally overhaul how the country for decades has approached immigration the country has long placed a preference on providing green cards to family members of immigrants under the trump plan the country would award the same number of green card as it now does about 1 million annually but far more would go to exceptional students professionals and people with high level and vocational degrees factors such as age english language ability and employment offers would also be considered far fewer green cards would be given to people with relatives already in the u s they would be reserved just for immediate family members trump mentioned spouses and children rather than parents and adult siblings fifty seven percent would be awarded on merit as opposed to the current 12 our plan is pro american pro immigrant and pro worker trump said saying it contrasts with what he called democrats support of chaos lisa koop director of legal services at the national immigrant justice center called trump s plan a political stunt intended to posture rather than problem solve mark krikorian executive director of the center for immigration studies which advocates for lower immigration rates welcomed a very positive effort that was undermined by the embrace of the current very high level of immigration associated press writers kevin freking and colleen long in washington and nicholas riccardi in denver
