secretary of state shot back and said her presidential primary rival would have let the american auto industry go bankrupt in a heated debate in flint michigan the two candidates both of whom called on michigan gov rick snyder a republican to resign over his handling of the flint water contamination crisis testily traded barbs days before voters in the critical midwestern states of michigan ohio and illinois go to the polls mr sanders who won an impressive three primary and caucus victories to mrs clinton s one over the weekend came out swinging against mrs clinton and said massive free trade deals she supported such as nafta have contributed to the decline of the u s economy see also bernie sanders suggests gop presidential candidates are mentally ill nafta was enacted in the 1990s when president clinton was in office mr sanders also blasted mrs clinton for supporting normalized trade relations with china and other agreements your story is voting for every disastrous trade agreement and voting for corporate america mr sanders said again tying mrs clinton to wall street and zeroing in on her paid speeches to goldman sachs he also mocked mrs clinton saying she only recently found religion on the issue of corporate america and wall street firms moving jobs overseas to make more money see also bernie sanders democrats complicit in corporate welfare one of us has a super pac one of us has raised 15 million from wall street for that super pac one of us has given speeches on wall street for hundreds of thousands of dollars he said now i kind of think if you get paid a couple of hundred thousand dollars for a speech it must be a great speech i think we should release it and let the american people see what that transcript was mrs clinton again refused to release her goldman sachs transcripts unless all other presidential candidates including republicans release full transcripts of their paid speeches as well but mrs clinton also returned fire on mr sanders and criticized him for voting against a 350 billion package in 2009 that included a bailout for general motors and chrysler mr sanders has said he voted against the legislation because it bailed out wall street billionaires he was against the auto bailout mrs clinton said the money was there and had to be released in order to save the auto industry and 4 million jobs i voted to save the auto industry he voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry she also attacked mr sanders for voting against the export import bank a federal agency that offers loans to american companies exporting products mr sanders has voted against the bank and considers it a form of corporate welfare but mrs clinton argues that it is necessary to keep u s firms competitive in a global marketplace i think we re in a race for exports she said the debate took place against the backdrop of the flint water crisis and both candidates said mr snyder should step down immediately both candidates also made clear that they believe environmental protection agency officials should resign if they are found to have been negligent and both also left open the possibility of criminal charges against public officials people should be held accountable wherever that leads mrs clinton said if it leads to resignations or recall if you re in political office it if leads to civil penalties if it leads to criminal responsibility there has to be an absolute accountability and i will support whatever the outcomes of those investigations are mr sanders sounded a similar note after an investigation if people in fact were found to have committed a criminal act they should go to jail he said sunday night s debate came a day after mr sanders and mrs clinton traded wins in a slate of weekend primaries and caucuses mr sanders soundly beat mrs clinton in kansas and nebraska while mrs clinton won louisiana mr sanders also won the maine caucuses on sunday night beating mrs clinton handily in the state while the senator from vermont continues to win states across the country he still trails far behind mrs clinton in the delegate count the saturday results still gave the former secretary of state more delegates than they did the senator overall mrs clinton has 1 121 delegates and mr sanders has 481 the figures include both pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses and so called superdelegates or party leaders who are free to support either candidate a vast majority of those superdelegates have lined up behind mrs clinton moving forward the electoral map looks rough for mr sanders in michigan for example the latest real clear politics average of all polls gives mrs clinton a 20 point lead she also has commanding double digit leads in ohio florida illinois and other states voting march 15 according to real clear politics averages the states voting march 15 have more diverse populations which is likely to work in mrs clinton s favor she routinely crushes mr sanders among black voters and that popularity has led her to dominant wins across the south mr sanders on the other hand has performed best in states with fewer minority voters such as new hampshire and nebraska as she seeks a string of victories across the midwest that could effectively lock down the nomination mrs clinton has turned her fire on mr sanders record on manufacturing even as they sparred on the issue at sunday night s debate the clinton campaign sent out emails hitting mr sanders for voting last year to eliminate the export import bank mr sanders has cast the bank as a form of corporate welfare and he was the only democrat to vote to kill the bank last year when given the chance to stand on the side of manufacturing jobs sen sanders has showed time and time again that it s not just a priority said rep debbie dingell michigan democrat and clinton supporter mr sanders said he has stood with american workers for decades and that mrs clinton is the one who has supported policies that led to a decline in manufacturing i was on a picket line in the early 1990s against nafta because you didn t need a ph d in economics to understand american workers should not be forced to compete against people in mexico making 25 cents an hour he said copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms
