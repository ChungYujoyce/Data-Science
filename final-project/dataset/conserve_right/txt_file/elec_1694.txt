walker introduced the collective bargaining measure tens of thousands of people descended on the state capitol to demonstrate against the plan and minority democrats in the state senate fled to illinois in a futile attempt to block a vote republicans who controlled the legislature pushed the plan through anyway democrats have been looking for payback ever since they ousted two gop state senators in recalls last august and gathered enough signatures on recall petitions this winter to force walker and four other republican officeholders into tuesday apos s elections the race between
