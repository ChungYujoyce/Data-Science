the republican convention ended on the theme believe in america that sounded nice but it was just another platitude mitt romney s speech was filled with platitudes we will honor america s democratic ideals we re united to preserve liberty please liberals and conservatives have real differences we should state them america is going broke and tough decisions must be made to save our future we must slow the growth of entitlements and military spending mitt romney was silent about that sure believing in america means individuals get to decide how to run the businesses we create but it should also mean that we get to run the rest of our lives too whom we marry what we do for recreation what substances we ingest how big our soft drinks are mitt romney said nothing about that i want to believe that if romney is elected he will finally impose some fiscal discipline and fight to put america on a sustainable course but his tampa speech gave me no confidence that he would instead he pandered saying as governor of massachusetts i chose a woman lieutenant governor a woman chief of staff half of my cabinet and senior officials so what what does that have to do with america s problems was that supposed to persuade people that republicans don t wage war on women it won t if conventions are mere infomercials republicans should at least do them well it s offensive that politicians force taxpayers to pay 18 3 million to subsidize these pep rallies sen tom coburn r okla tried to end the subsidies saying there is no justification for spending public funds on booze balloons and confetti he s right but congress ignored him the republicans did some good things in tampa like showing two debt clocks and allowing speakers like ted cruz to say rights are secure only when government power is restrained but then mitt romney spoke he said nothing of significance believing in america means objecting when politicians claim they solve our problems romney said he has a plan to create 12 million jobs huh why not 13 million why not 50 promising 12 million is an absurd conceit when politicians say yes we can we should say no they can t government fails but individuals succeed the dems are worse what do they stand for they say they believe in a progressive liberal society but to them that means a giant government that pretends to solve problems causes new ones and then spends even more to appear to solve those problems i say appear because they never actually do it president obama came in full of promises what s he accomplished he expanded george w bush s dangerous debt government spending sets peacetime records he proposed nothing serious to bring medicare under control he didn t curtail our role as world policeman on the contrary the administration routinely bombs several populations by remote control military spending continues to grow here s what i wish obama would say this week i was wrong to expand government the way i have i overreached modern liberalism put us on an unsustainable course i will save america by restoring limited government that keeps the peace but then leaves free people alone hey i can hope mr president like you i believe in social justice but i believe in thomas jefferson s idea of social justice a free society where people are unimpeded by bureaucrats and politicians where people freely trade goods and services that is cooperate without anyone telling us what to do it means that the government won t engage in what frederic bastiat called legal plunder taking resources from some mostly working people to bestow them on others that s genuine liberalism original liberalism you mr president have bought into the upside down distortion of liberalism where government runs things much of it on behalf of cronies the well heeled and well connected and the rest of us follow directions that s not liberalism let s call it what it is corporatism state socialism crony capitalism liberalism is about liberty individual freedom and free markets only that can bring us the real hope and change that freedom represents alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
