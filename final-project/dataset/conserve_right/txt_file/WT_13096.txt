apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion presidential leadership 15 decisions that changed the nationby nick ragoneprometheus books 25 332 pages some of the early presidential decisions discussed here may be little remembered perhaps for good reason george washington s decision to put down the whiskey rebellion is no doubt as nick ragone writes in presidential leadership an early landmark in the struggle between states rights and federal power a struggle he then traces through thomas jefferson approving the louisiana purchase andrew jackson rejecting nullification and abraham lincoln signing the emancipation proclamation but no matter how you frame it the picture of george washington as revenuer in chief donning his old uniform to lead troops against a ragged band of tax resisting moonshining farmers is singularly unappealing top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches of the next grouping of decisions theodore roosevelt building the panama canal woodrow wilson creating the league of nations fdr passing lend lease harry truman deciding to drop the atomic bomb most of the ground with the exception of lend lease has been well plowed or in the case of the panama canal the interest in the details of its construction has naturally diminished over the years it s when he comes to his final grouping lyndon johnson and civil rights richard nixon visiting china ronald reagan s evil empire speech that mr ragone a respected reporter commentator and author brings his skills fully to bear especially in his treatments of presidents nixon and reagan true he feels compelled to issue the obligatory disclaimer just because there is a chapter on nixon and china doesn t mean i believe nixon was a great president but in fact despite several such disclaimers the aspect of the nixon presidency he chooses to deal with proves just that the trip to china was a geopolitical masterstroke making possible the successful end to the war he inherited in vietnam creating cracks in the cold war structure and causing a distinct shift in the balance of global power away from soviet interests as a diplomatic feat mr ragone concludes the china trip certainly has no rival in the 20th century perhaps in american history it required endless patience broad vision a mastery of the subject matter a natural gift for negotiation put another way it is difficult to overstate its significance nixon s trip to china activated the tectonic forces that shook the foundations of what reagan would famously call the evil empire in a speech to a group of religious broadcasters the speech which would cause a great outpouring of intellectual establishment angst and written by tony dolan was not intended as a major foreign policy address mr ragone quotes aram bakshian at the time reagan s director of presidential speechwriting if anyone in the state department read it they just read the first few paragraphs and set it aside they didn t know it was going to be a foreign policy speech on the face of it it wasn t a foreign policy speech but it would have great foreign policy repercussions among american liberals reports mr ragone the reaction was vehement henry steele commager called it the worst presidential speech in american history new york times columnist anthony lewis found it primitive and outrageous the new republic saw in it a call to holy war something a president should not say but in the soviet union mr ragone writes the reaction was quite different said vladimir bukovsky his phrase evil empire became a household word in russia natan sharansky added finally the leader of the free world had spoken the truth concludes mr ragone as for the speech itself it was only that but in a flash it had perfectly captured what reagan believed was the metaphysical essence of the cold war good versus evil never again could the united states and the soviet union be considered moral equivalents he had succeeded in branding it evil and by so doing as mr ragone points out by deciding to use those two words reagan helped redirect the course of history john r coyne jr a former white house speechwriter is co author of strictly right william f buckley jr and the american conservative movement w
