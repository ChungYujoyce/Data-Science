apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic winterset iowa black lives matter activist kat redding says if former south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg captures the democratic presidential nomination she won t vote come election day ms redding is among a small band of black lives matter members from south bend that protested mr buttigieg s campaign stop over the weekend in los angeles and have followed him here to iowa where they hope to cast a pall over his candidacy three weeks out from the first in the nation caucuses by cautioning voters that the silver tongued 37 year old can t be trusted to address the concerns of the black community to me mayor pete is the equivalent of trump ms redding told the washington times on monday i feel like trump is very aggressive with his racism and i think mayor pete is very passive with his racism top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender if mr trump and mr buttigieg are my options i would not vote they are just two of the same people she said and denied recent news reports identifying her as a supporter of sen bernard sanders the line of attack and public protests have made life more difficult for mr buttigieg who has struggled to gain traction with black voters even as his message of belonging and unity has struck a chord with voters in predominantly white iowa and new hampshire where he is running near the front of the pack mr buttigieg s allies have a different take on his eight years as mayor south bend councilwoman sharon mcbride who is black countered that the opinions of south bend black lives matter are not necessarily representative of the black community in south bend many of whom are supportive of pete and believe that our city has gotten better under his leadership as someone who has worked closely with pete as a member of my hometown s common council i know him to be a thoughtful honest inspiring leader ms mcbride said praising his record on affordable housing and combating homelessness the buttigieg campaign meanwhile highlighted the reduced unemployment and poverty rates on his watch it also touted the douglass plan for black america named for abolitionist frederick douglass which the presidential hopeful rolled out earlier this year that outlines his vision for lifting up black communities through changes to the criminal justice system and spending more on schools and health care ms redding and a few other members of black lives matter a group that she said includes about two dozen members crashed a buttigieg town hall sunday holding anti black anti poor signs blasted out news releases knocking him and signaled they aren t going away polls show mr buttigieg is locked in a tight race with sen bernard sanders of vermont sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts and former vice president joseph r biden the last of whom has been the clear favorite of black voters across the nation becky kakac a white iowa supporter of the ex mayor said at the winterset town hall that she understands that mr buttigieg has work to do with black voters but appeared befuddled at the idea that mr buttigieg and mr trump could be cast as two peas in a pod i would never put them in the same pod ms kakac said that s upsetting i don t know what to think of it i am kind of shocked that someone would say that she attributed mr buttigieg s struggles with black voters to him being less well known than the other top contenders for the democratic presidential nomination i believe he has the best chance of beating donald trump and also bringing us back together after the election the 68 year old woman said we are going to be more divided in another few months than we are right now and i think he is the guy who can unify us larry corkren said he s whittled his choices down to mr buttigieg or mr biden the 75 year old iowan who also is white said he is interested in learning more about why mr buttigieg turns off black voters before he makes a final choice when the dust is all settled then i hope at that point black voters hispanic voters will unite around the candidate he said mr buttigieg will get another crack at scoring points with voters in iowa as well as those tuning in across the country nationally when he takes the stage at the cnn des moines register sponsored debate tuesday in des moines mr sanders mrs warren mr biden and billionaire activist tom steyer also qualified for the debate which is the last scheduled before the feb 3 iowa caucuses on monday mr buttigieg kicked off the day with a campaign stop here in winterset and closed it out with a town hall with actress mandy moore at iowa state university ms moore praised mr buttigieg at the evening event saying he knows how to unite people around their shared values when i really stop to think about pete i don t even think hollywood knows what to do with him ms moore said at isu he s that much of an original at his first stop in winterset he touched on issues of race this is a country that cannot wait to make sure that your race has no bearing on your health and your wealth or your life expectancy or your relationship with law enforcement in your community mr buttigieg said here in madison county which mr trump easily carried in 2016 it is the fatal police shooting of a black man named eric logan in june that served as a flashpoint over lingering racial tensions in south bend opening mr buttigieg up to criticism from activists that he has failed them that has made life more difficult for mr buttigieg on the campaign trail as the flareup in south bend and the national headlines that followed have shaped the way black voters view his candidacy in states that are not overwhelmingly white as are iowa and new hampshire the first two states to vote it also has provided mr buttigieg s rivals with an opportunity to raise doubts about his electability and raise concerns over whether he is the party s best bet for re energizing black voters after their turnout fell out in key states in 2016 charles franklin director of the marquette law school poll said mr buttigieg has a lot of ground to make up with black voters who are more familiar with his rivals the question remains whether those difficulties really would keep black support down in a general election and especially keep turnout down in a general election mr franklin said i think it is almost certainly the case if he were
