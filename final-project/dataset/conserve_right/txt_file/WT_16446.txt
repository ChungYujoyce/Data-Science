quantum3d product controlled for export as a defense article the software is used in visual simulation software program used for training military fighter pilots meng also illegally installed a copy of quantum3d s mantis simulation software on a chinese navy site and altered the code to make it appear as though it belonged to a competitor the software was part of a sales demonstration project for the chinese produced by meng this conviction the first in the nation for illegal exports of military related source code demonstrates the importance of safeguarding our nation s military secrets and should serve notice to others who would compromise our national security for profit said kenneth l wainstein assistant attorney general for national security this case is the latest evidence of the department s enhanced investigative and prosecutorial efforts to keep america s critical technology from falling into the wrong hands investigators said meng stole software that is designed for precision training of military fighter pilots in night vision scenarios among other applications u s officials said the compromise could be more extensive than outlined by prosecutors because

reconnaissance office nro the secret intelligence agency that builds and operates the nation s constellation of spy satellites is former cia official carol staubach the likely appointment is raising questions among some in congress and the intelligence community about the close associations of several current and former intelligence officials with booz allen hamilton a leading intelligence agency consultant ms staubach is currently a vice president at booz allen involved in the nro market according to the company s web site the director of national intelligence dni retired navy vice adm michael mcconnell also worked for booz allen before taking his position and former nro director keith hall works for booz allen when everyone asked the question how will mike mcconnell s association with booz allen affect how he makes decisions it s apparent that he is demonstrating loyalty to his former company said one intelligence source who is skeptical of ms staubach s leadership skills ms staubach is a 33 year cia veteran who spent 15 years on detail to nro from august 2001 to july 2003 she was director of nro s imagery systems acquisitions and operations and in charge of buying and operating classified spy satellites that post put her in charge of budgeting billions of dollars in satellite programs the nro director post is open as a result of the current director richard kerr s appointment as deputy director of national intelligence ellen cioccio a spokeswoman for mr mcconnell said mr kerr remains at nro and thus it would be premature to comment on a replacement while the senate considers his nomination that said when and if a new nro director is appointed he or she will be appointed by the secretary of defense with the concurrence of the dni as required by
