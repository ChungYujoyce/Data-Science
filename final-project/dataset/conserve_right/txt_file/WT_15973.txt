to display its claim to sovereignty over virtually the entire crucial waterway however the vice president of china s academy of military sciences lt gen he lei declined to comment thursday on aircraft deployments on artificial islands chinese has built in the area saying those were entirely china s domestic affair earlier thursday foreign minister wang yi appeared to blame the u s and its allies

neighbors on completing a code of conduct to prevent frictions in the waterway which has rich fishing grounds vital sea routes and a potential wealth of undersea natural resources some outside forces are not happy with the prevailing calm and try to stir up trouble and muddle the waters their frequent show of force with fully armed aircraft and naval vessels is the most destabilizing factor in the

brings it to 1 1 trillion yuan 173 billion years of double digit percentage growth have given china the world s second largest defense budget after the united states which is in a class of its own

single party rule and intolerance for political dissent beijing unhappy with us carrier s vietnam visit a chinese communist party newspaper said beijing was unhappy with the first visit by a u s navy aircraft carrier to a vietnamese port since the vietnam war and was monitoring developments however the global times said the uss carl vinson s visit was unlikely to alter the balance of power in the south china sea which china claims virtually in its entirety and has been fortifying with military structures on man made islands china s vigilance and unhappiness are inevitable but we don t think that the uss carl vinson s vietnam trip can stir up troubles in the south china sea the paper known for its hard line nationalist views said in an editorial the visit will not generate any special tools to pressure china while the u s sending warships to the south china sea will only waste money the paper said the u s is free to send warships to the south china sea which will only waste money china is much less interested in the uss carl vinson s vietnam visit than american and vietnamese nationalists it said vietnam and china have extensive overlapping claims to islands and resources in the sea and u s officials say the port call is a sign of the u s commitment to the region and u s vietnam ties vice adm phillip sawyer commander of the u s 7th fleet told reporters in a conference call tuesday that china s island building and militarization cause angst within the region and the angst that it causes is really because of lack of transparency associated press writers ashok sharma
