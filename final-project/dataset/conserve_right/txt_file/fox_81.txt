meadow and delaney tarr a student who survived the shooting about how they aposre coping and what they aposre asking of the nation aposs leaders but first i sat down earlier with florida aposs governor rick scott to discuss his new package to prevent gun violence begin videotape wallace governor scott welcome back to fox news sunday scott it aposs great to be here thanks for what you do wallace thank you let aposs start with an outline of the plan you aposve just announced raise the age to buy all guns to 21 ban sale of bump stocks pass a red flag law that let families or authorities go to court to take guns away from mentally ill or violent people 450 million to harden schools and putting law enforcement in every school 50 million for mental health briefly what aposs the thinking that aposs behind what you decided to do and what you decided not to do scott chris what i did was i listened to a lot of people law enforcement educators and mental health students parents and said what aposs going to fix this problem right one we have to make sure our schools are safe law enforcement harden the schools we aposve got to make sure we deal with the fact that there are people out there that have mental illness issues they shouldn apost have access to a gun if you threaten people or yourself you shouldn apost have access to a gun so everything i aposm doing is how do you solve the problem i aposm a business person you go in you solve the problem and that aposs why i aposm doing it wallace how confident are you that the florida legislature will pass this package you aposve only got two weeks left in this session scott right i aposm in my i aposm starting i aposll be in my last two weeks in session i aposve been talking to the house and the senate i actually spoke to them this morning i aposm going to work every day between now and the end of session on one purpose get this passed make sure we get the 500 million funding make sure we have the law enforcement the mental health issues make sure we aposre not people are not going to have access to a gun i aposm going to make sure parents feel confident in sending their child to school wallace during your eight years as governor you have gotten an a plus rating from the nra but in this package you aposve broken with them on a few things raising the age to buy rifles from 18 to 21 the red flag law why scott you know i aposm an nra member i believe in second amendment i believe in the first amendment all the amendments i think most members in the nra agree with me this is logical i aposm sure there aposs going to be some that disagree but i aposm a dad i aposm a granddad and i aposm a governor i want my state to be safe i want every child to be in a safe environment when they aposre trying to be educated wallace but you aposve been a hardliner for the nra and gun rights there aposs a reason they gave you an a plus back in 2011 you signed something called the docs versus glocks law which prohibited doctors from asking any of their patients whether or not they had guns in 2016 after the terrible mass shooting at the orlando pulse nightclub you said the second amendment doesn apost kill people evil kills people and just this last april here aposs you in talking to the nra here you are begin video clip scott we need a majority that has the capacity to comprehend that these three words in the constitution shall not infringe end video clip wallace to the degree that you now want to limit some gun rights some would say that you want to infringe governor were you wrong back then scott no here aposs what you have to do in this job you have to weigh individual rights which i clearly believe in right i believe in the second amendment but you also have to make sure you protect your you know your citizens your kids and so you aposve got weigh each of these things what i did here is say i aposm going to do what i can to make sure guns are not in the hands of the wrong people if you have a mental illness you shouldn apost have a gun if you aposve threatened others or you threaten yourself you shouldn apost have a gun so i aposm going to do everything i can to do that at the same time harden our schools significant law enforcement presence and also make sure we share information that aposs one of the issues that we deal with we aposve got to share information when we know somebody has mental problems you aposve got to be all the agencies whether it aposs law or you know state agencies have to share information wallace one of the things you aposre not doing that many parkland students want is you aposre not banning assault weapons why not scott well i aposm not into banning you know specific weapons i think what you need to do is ban specific people from having weapons focus on the problem we aposve got to focus on solutions that work banning the people that are going to potentially cause the problems so it aposs all these things together but i aposm against people that are going to potentially cause the harm and we know they are there are so many i mean look at what aposs common these people are talking about what they aposre doing they aposre threatening others this individual look at all the problems he had and it wasn apost stopped wallace yes i aposm going to pick up on the lapses and that aposs certainly a big part of the problem at least in this particular case but i want to focus on the guns just one more time look at these mass shootings in just a little over the last two years december 2015 san bernardino 14 dead june 2016 orlando 49 dead october 2017 las vegas 58 dead november 2017 sutherland springs texas 26 dead and now parkland 17 dead i understand it aposs the person who fires the weapon as you say it aposs evil but don apost these assault weapons allow an evil person to kill more people more quickly scott you know when you think about any of these things i went to pulse you know we had the airport shooting a little over a year ago and now we have this i mean your heart goes out to everybody that aposs been impacted so you aposve got to weigh you aposve got to weigh our constitutional rights which i believe in against public safety so and that aposs what i aposm trying to do with this and that aposs why it aposs not just one thing it aposs everything i listened i listened to law enforcement i brought them up i listened to educators i listened to mental health people i listened to students i aposve talked to parents and i believe what we aposre doing will i believe it will stop this from happening that aposs my goal i want to do everything i can in my job right now to make sure this doesn apost happen again wallace president trump wants to train and pay teachers to patrol the schools and if there aposs a shooter to take them on here he is begin video clip trump and a teacher would have shot the hell out of him before he knew what happened end video clip wallace he aposs talking about that a lot you oppose arming teachers scott i disagree with him i believe you aposve got to focus on people that are well trained law enforcement that are trained to do this i want to make sure we have significant law enforcement presence on top of hardening the schools metal detectors and bulletproof glass better perimeter fencing all these things and the other thing is i want to give our sheriff aposs department in each county the authority to do create the program on a per school basis and that parents can feel comfortable that their child is going to a safe school wallace but why not if there aposs a teacher and you know not every teacher only teachers that are trained only teachers that volunteer that if there aposs a teacher in a classroom and the shooter doesn apost know where that teacher is why not scott i want our teachers to teach and i want our law enforcement officers to be able to protect the students i want each group to focus on what they aposre good at wallace as you mentioned there were a number of security lapses in this particular case last month someone called the fbi tip line and said this i know he the shooter is going to explode in november the woman whose home the shooter was staying in called the palm beach county sheriff aposs department the 911 number and gave this warning begin audio clip roxanne deschamps housed nikoas cruz i cannot have him on the premises now he put the gun in the head of this brother before so it aposs not the first time and he did that to his mom end audio clip wallace and reportedly not one but several of the broward county sheriff aposs deputies failed to get into the school while the attack was going on what are you going to do about that scott first off can you imagine being a parent that lost a loved one and know that all these failures right i mean we aposve got to have accountability in this country with the fbi what happened tell us they still this is you know a week and a half after who was called what was the process how was it broken give us the facts hold people accountable the local sheriff aposs department they aposve got to be completely transparent we have to do a thorough investigation and whoever didn apost do their job has to be held accountable i talk to law enforcement around the state there aposs no one i talk to that is not disgusted that the local sheriff aposs deputy that was there did not go in and kill that individual wallace governor if the florida legislature passes your entire package if congress passes everything that president trump is talking about what can you say to the young people the students who are watching you right now will they be safe scott i aposm going to do everything i can remember i aposm a father i aposm a grandfather one of the first things i said when this happened i called each of my daughters and i said unfortunately in your lifetime you aposre going to have to teach your children how to deal with an acting shooter that aposs unfortunate we aposre going to have to do that we aposre going to do everything we can but each one of us is going to have to be prepared wallace governor scott thank you thanks for coming in and we aposll obviously be following how your package goes in the florida legislature scott thanks chris end videotape wallace coming up we will speak with two members of the parkland community who lived through the school massacre and are now calling on lawmakers to make sure a tragedy like this never happens again commercial break wallace one of the big differences between previous mass shootings and the tragedy in parkland florida has been the active response and eloquence of the survivors and the victims apos families students like senior delaney tarr begin video clip delaney tarr senior marjory stoneman douglas high school the only reason that was gotten so far is because we are not afraid of losing money we are not afraid of getting reelected or not getting reelected we have nothing to lose the only thing we have to gain at this point is our safety end video clip wallace and parents like andrew pollack who lost his daughter meadow begin video clip andrew pollack father of victim meadow pollack there should have been one school shooting and we should have fixed it and i aposm pissed because my daughter i aposm not going to see again she aposs not here she aposs not here end video clip wallace delaney and andrew join us now from coral spring florida and i want to say right at the start how sorry all of us are for your loss and what you aposve had to go through andrew when you were at the white house at that very raw emotional moment you said after 9 11 we fixed the situation we made it a lot harder for people to get onto planes with guns when you hear what governor scott just said when you hear what president trump is saying would that fixed the problem pollack it aposs not going to be fixed because i just heard what you said what you are focusing on polarizing this event the murder of these kids you are talking about gun control i just had to listen to you and governor scott talk about gun control gun control is a big issue no one in america is going to gun together on gun control chris we aposre here you didn apost say one thing about fixing it the american people we could get together on school safety but when you polarize it this event and every other media we don apost care about gun control right now that aposs a big issue in the country and you are not going to get everyone together on it but we are going to get everyone together on fixing our schools and i just listen to you so i just listen to you you didn apost talk you didn apost mention one question to governor scott about what are we going to do about the security of our children how are we going to do that but you are just talking about gun control which is going to just give you more ratings and every other media or event my daughter is dead i want to know our kids are going to school in kentucky on monday how are those kids safe how about bringing that up to the media how about bringing that up to governor scott not about guns it aposs not about guns now today it aposs not about guns it aposs about the safety in our schools and that aposs what you ask governor scott about and i got to listen to that at my house my kid is not here because the schools weren apost safe that aposs the main thing if you go into a courthouse the judge is safe the stenographer is not worried someone is coming in with a gun because they can apost get in with a gun the american people we just want our school safe we don apost want to talk about guns right now wallace well let me bring let me bring in delaney i very much respect what you have to say sir delaney your thoughts about what you are hearing from the governor and from the president which is about a lot more than just guns guns as part of it but they also are talking about hardening schools about arming teachers your thoughts on what you are hearing tarr it is it aposs a very multidimensional issue and he does andrew did say he said this is about school safety and personally i think that there is also an issue with the fact that he was able to access this weapon this gun i personally i do not believe that arming teachers is a solution here i know many people marco rubio rick scott they have also said that arming teachers is not a solution here but there are many different issues that need to be addressed wallace what do you think delaney what are the issues that you think need to be addressed tarr i absolutely do agree that we need to we need to address the failures that have created a situation like this a horrible situation like this all of the things that have failed us all of the systems that have failed us i think that we do need to focus on improving our school safety a little bit on improving our officers and i also believe that we need to make it harder for people to access guns when they are not mentally stable when they are young when they are not in a place where they should be owning a weapon like this wallace andrew i want to go back i understand your strong feelings but isn apost this issue isn apost this issue of mental health and trying to make sure that sick people don apost have access to guns isn apost that part of the problem pollack ok but was that was that a big issue when we were protecting airports was that a big issue i aposm not saying it aposs not an issue chris but when we were protecting our federal issues is that a big issue we have our children in these classes which is that aposs the issue is ok that could be worked out but right now the country just wants to come together and make our schools safe for our kids there is no other issue than our kids going to class and not thinking about some monster is going to stalk ph them in the hallway that aposs what we need to focus on and we could all come together as americans instead of other issues and those other issues i agree with you there are other issues there but the main issue right now is fixing the schools wallace so let aposs talk specifically about that sir when you say fix the schools i mean you aposve compared it to airports are you saying school security id checks you tell me what it is that you would like to see pollack i think that i aposm not i aposm not an expert in it but i think we need to hire the experts and check every school individually and make sure they are safe for the children you know there aposs a serious problem like i said if the new norm has to be our kids are safe in school this can apost happen again i can apost let it happen to another kid in another state like right now governor scott governor scott is doing what he had to do but he also had to go visit the parents of dead kids for two weeks i aposm on right now today because i want to tell every governor in every other state they need to be proactive right now they need to get a bill in place what all and we are going to put all america together and work with these governors to protect our schools we can apost have another shooting in this country i can apost live with it and i aposm this has this has to stop with parkland and my daughter aposs death can apost be in vain it has to be the last one wallace andrew what do you think about the teacher issue and you know i know this must be incredibly painful but now we hear the stories that there were police on the scene and they didn apost go in at least three sheriff aposs deputies were there and didn apost go in what pollack yes one deputy that worked there peterson he worked there and he aposs a coward he was he stood by the door i know is a fact he could have made it to the third floor and saved all six victims if he wasn apost some little i can apost even words can apost even describe the way i think about him but i aposm not trying to think about that stuff because that aposs just negative and it aposs just going to make me toxic so i just want to get the word out to the governors of every state that they have to do something now today get together they can call me i have other dead parents here we all want to help them and let aposs make the school safe wallace delaney when you hear that and it aposs not just the sheriffs or the deputies that didn apost come in but all crosstalk pollack a lot of failures chris that needs to be there aposs a lot of incompetence all around i could write you a book on all the incompetence that happened at that school but that aposs that aposs not going to fix it or bring any of our dead kids back i just don apost want any more dead kids and all that stuff is going to come out and i don apost want to focus on that i aposm on with you chris today to tell the american people that are messaging me what we need to do is fix it now in every other school make it the new norm now you aposve got to have metal detectors it aposs got to be like a courthouse like a federal building like an airport that aposs how we need our schools now wallace delaney you go back to school this week how are you feeling about that delaney tarr senior marjory stoneman douglas high school it aposs very daunting to imagine going back to a place that just two weeks prior held such horrors and it aposs scary because i don apost know if i aposm going to be safe there but i know that i have to i know that now more than ever i am proud of who i am and i feel like i need that sense of normalcy because in all of this it aposs like i can apost even be a high schooler anymore and i just want to be a high school senior again and it aposs so hard to think about even doing that at this point wallace andrew when we heard you at the president aposs listening session and i speak as a parent and a grandparent my heart broke for you i aposm sure a lot of people did around the country how are you doing sir pollack it aposs rough i have my moments you know it aposs like a wave a wave of emotions but i have this fury fire inside of me that aposs driving me that i can apost explain it i can walk through flames right now i could there aposs nothing i can apost do and i just want to get the word out to everybody in this country that it could happen to you i aposm a real i aposm a real guy i grew up in long island i didn apost mean i never thought this could happen and it happened there aposs parents here that came here to support me today this young lady has to live within it stops and it aposs an easy fix chris you know you just need some competent people to get together and put the right plan in place and make it so the kids are safe that aposs all you know they aposve got to be safe in school wallace andrew delaney thank you both for sharing your stories our hearts go out to both of you but more important we aposre going to stay on the story i promise you andrew i understand that it is not just a gun control issue and we are going to do everything that we can to make our schools safer and you are both welcome back anytime as part of that effort thank you both pollack thanks chris tarr thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the push to respond to another mass murder and whether this time will be any different commercial break wallace coming up the democrats released their response to the republican fisa memo begin video clip trump that was really just a confirmation of if you call it the republican memo or the nunes memo it aposs referred to as a lot of things but that was nothing but a confirmation end audio clip wallace we aposll speak with a key democrat on the house intelligence committee coming up commercial break begin video clip wayne lapierre nra ceo chris murphy nancy pelosi and more cheered on by the national media eager to blame the nra and called for even more government control dana loesch nra spokesperson many in legacy media love mass shootings you guys love it end video clip wallace nra officials wayne lapierre and dana loesch going after democrats and the media in the wake of the mass shooting in florida and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove reporter for axios jonathan swan former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and kimberley strassel of the wall street journal kim you didn apost go nearly as far as the nra folks did but you wrote a pretty tough column in the wall street journal on friday i want to put some of it up you write age limits and gun restrictions aren apost an answer they aposre a sideshow do you agree with what we just heard from andrew pollack with that aposs not the focus and it has to be on keeping school safe hardening them like airports kimberley strassel fox news contributor the the i think that we aposre having progress this time after this because we are finally talking about the things that actually really matter and they are one protecting vulnerable communities it is no accident that these shooters go to places that are gun free zones because they know they aposll be the only bad person with a weapon and no one there to stop them and two mental health particularly those with severe mental illness and how we both have to get treatment for these people help them overall but make sure that they do not have easy access to guns and these have been the failings that have been consistent in nearly every one of these events wallace congresswoman edwards kim writes in her column that raising age limits banning weapons are empty gestures do you agree with her donna edwards former u s congresswoman d md well i mean i think clearly somebody who aposs 19 or 21 who has a diagnosed mental illness that presents a danger is not going to be stopped from buying a gun but what we have to do is that the difference in the in mass shootings is that somebody who shows up who has a weapon that aposs turned into an automatic weapon changes that place kills more people and so i think we do have to reinstate the assault weapons ban i think that we do have to make sure that people who are prohibited really are prohibited and can apost slip through and get a weapon anyway and so these are things that are common sense measures that most americans support and the nra has proven this last week is completely out of out of step with the vast majority of the american people strassel can i just i want to wallace go ahead strassel no one no one has used an automatic weapon in any event edwards they convert it they have converted semiautomatic weapons to make them effectively automatic the ar 15 strassel with a bump stock edwards the ark 15 with a with a bump stock with a magazine clip that you know fires in a rapid speed and and and more ammunition turns that into a much more dangerous wallace but congresswoman there was you know and i got a stern talking to from andrew pollack and and part of what he aposs saying is which which actually i think is a is a is an argument you can argue whether he aposs right or wrong is you aposre going to have that argument you and kim are going to disagree people in congress are going to disagree and their let aposs be honest we aposre not going to ban assault weapons anytime soon and he aposs saying let aposs do what we can agree on which is harden schools make them like airports metal detectors security guards all of that edwards well we we could turn our schools into prisons and it aposs still not going to keep people who are able to go and get a weapon that they couldn apost ordinarily get across a counter and in some other way from turning those weapons into weapons of war in our schools and our shopping malls and our churches i mean we aposve seen this over and over again and if the nra wants to use its money to stand in the way of sensible gun legislation they can do that but i think these children have demonstrated these young people have demonstrated this last week that that is no longer acceptable wallace kim and then i want to bring the gentleman in strassel but no we we need to be talking about mental illness these people are getting rid of by the way too what chris just said matters so much you know and i know we both know no one aposs reinstating an assault weapons ban anytime soon so we can spend the next two years fighting about that or we can actually do something proactive in the schools and in other vulnerable communities churches again no accident that these are the places that the targeters go out and go after wallace karl we aposve seen all this way too many times and we almost know the script before it happens there aposs a massacre there is all this demand for change there aposs a debate and nothing happens president trump said this week this time is going to be different take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposre talking about common sense and it aposs a great thing and the nra will will back it i really feel very confident the nra will back it and so will congress and so will the senate end video clip wallace is he right is the president right is this time different karl rove fox news contributor it feels like it because principally the focus while we aposve had the the traditional debate we aposve always had about weapons and guns this debate as mr pollock so powerfully put it is focused on keeping our school safe and look think about this we had so many failures of our local law enforcement 39 times this kids was the police were called about this kid we had 911 warnings about his mental state we had social media postings the system failed we had an armed guard at stationed at the school who stood outside for four minutes while shots rang out inside we had him joined by at least three other deputies who again stood outside while shots rang out and people were killed and we had failures the fbi the fbi received on its on its on its wallace so what aposs the answer karl well the the answer is take a look at every one of those failures of those systems and fix them find out what other failures there are this bill by senators cornyn and murphy a bipartisan answer to fix the problems in the federal registry we had an action taken by the secretary of the air force which was far reaching she was the she was the one charged with after the shooting in sutherland springs texas with with fixing the problem of the federal government having 7 000 air force personnel i believe the number was who should not have had weapons who were not in the database that would have kept them from getting weapons so but i think mr pollack has hit it this is about looking at our schools i had breakfast yesterday morning with my goddaughter who aposs in high school in frisco texas and she talked about how it is routine for their teachers to lock the doors in the classroom now i can apost remember that when i went to high school wallace no ph rove i cannot but that aposs the world in which we live and we aposve got to look at these places and say what can we do to limit the number of access points to increase the security and to make it more less likely that if somebody attempts this kind of an act they can be stopped and thwarted wallace jonathan what are you hearing at the white house is the president how hard is he prepared to push the package that we aposre hearing about some of which involve guns some of which doesn apost involve guns and is it realistic to think that he aposs going to be able to bring as he claims republican leaders who have killed gun legislation and a lot of these issues before and the nra along because there aposre some issues here like the red flag law like raising the age that are going to be very tough for the nra to swallow jonathan swan national political reporter axios well the few issues that he aposs hung up on the raising the age limit he aposs very passionate about that privately immediately since the this terrible tragedy he was saying kids can apost be allowed to have done he just kept saying that and people would try to work out what he meant and then finally he put a number around it he said if you aposre under 21 you shouldn apost have a gun well i don apost see that flying through congress i mean the right are not happy about that and you know i aposve been getting text messages this morning even just pointing to his interview last night with jeanine pirro judge jeanine he kept pushing that point i don apost see that getting anywhere in congress the cornyn bill people talk about it like it aposs a fait accompli you know fixing this national instant background check that aposs even going to be like you know not the easiest thing in the world i think they can get it through but the problem is people will want to turn this into a christmas tree they aposll want to attach every little thing that they aposve been wanting in terms of gun control and that aposs the way you kill these bills so i think if they keep it kind of narrow and focused they can get something done there but the school safety issue seems to be the one that culturally trump is most passionate about and i think he aposs probably in the best position to change the conversation wallace but but even on that issue jonathan swan it aposs a state issue right wallace i was going to well one is a state issue also the idea of the teachers swan right very controversial wallace even governor scott aposs against that swan inaudible yes strassel well look i mean too i think you have to put it in the right framework if you aposre talking about forcing or requiring teachers to do something like that aposs not going to fly but look we know that probably the most law abiding part of the public are people who have concealed carry permits they aposve had to go through a lot of background checks they aposve had to go through training there aposs surely some teachers out there quite a few probably who have concealed carry permits if they want to be more protected in the classroom should we tell them no i think that aposs a debate that needs to happen out there otherwise ways just for teachers to protect maybe give them a flash bang or something so that when someone runs in they have some opportunity to help protect their kids but those are the debates we need to be having edwards we don apost have enough money to put firearms in schools what we need to do is to make sure that our children are safe by making sure that people who have mental illnesses who are otherwise prohibited should not be able to get a weapon and take these weapons of war off the streets strassel inaudible wallace all right we have to we have to break away here i just i just want to say though as i listen to you frankly i aposm discouraged because the same divisions that have stopped progress in the past i aposm worried that maybe it aposs going to stop it again rove be more optimistic strassel yes wallace be more optimistic edwards young people wallace well i have to say they have been edwards they will change it wallace the one silver lining in this whole thing the students thank you panel see you next sunday when we come back the democrats counter memo on alleged government surveillance abuses is not public we aposll speak with a key member of the house intelligence committee next commercial break chris wallace fox anchor breaking now the democratic rebuttal to that republican memo that alleged the fbi and justice department abused their powers to surveil a former trump campaign official joining us now from connecticut congressman jim himes the number two democrat on the house intelligence committee congressman the republican memo says that the fbi and the justice department based their application to the fisa court to surveil that trump campaign adviser carter page based it on the so called steele dossier in the memo the democratic memo you say that aposs not true explain rep jim himes d conn intelligence committee yes so chris and and thanks for having me on you know as the democratic memo now makes plain the application to the fisa court for a warrant to monitor carter page was not based on the steele information and and if we have time we aposll cover the question of whether the steele information has been the steele dossier has been in any way discredited because it largely hasn apost but nonetheless the point is that the as memo makes clear carter page was of interest for his connections to the russians for years before 2016 october of 2016 he had had all sorts of contact he had been with the russians he aposd been interviewed by the fbi and so there aposs a long history of which the dossier is just a small part of that application to the republican judges for a warrant wallace but but let me but let me pick up on that because in the gop memo that was put out by the majority devin nunes and the majority they make this statement and i aposm going to put up the quote from the memo deputy fbi director mccabe testified before the committee on in december 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the fisc the foreign intelligence surveillance court without the steele dossier information congressman nowhere in your ten page memo do you and the other democrats rebut that himes that is true but i was in the room devin nunes was not in the room when andrew mccabe was interviewed and i will tell you that he did not say that he did not say that a fisa warrant would not have been requested but for the steele information now he wallace well then why didn apost you put that in your memo himes well because the transcript of our conversation with andrew mccabe was classified and the democratic memo this is important chris the democratic memo unlike the republican memo contained no additional classified information that was made that was made public so again i was in the room andrew mccabe did not say that the fisa warrant would not have been sought what he did say was that the warrant as the application itself which of course went through all sorts of scrutiny at doj and then was scrutinized by a republican federal judge that all of its pieces were important but he absolutely did not say that it would not have been filed had it not been for the dossier and for inaudible wallace all right i want to get to this question of classified information in a moment but i just want to follow up on the steele dossier one of the republicans apos main complaints is that the government never informed the court when it sought the warrant to monitor carter page never informed them that the dossier had been paid for by the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee you in writing the memo i say you collectively quote this from the application for the warrant the fbi speculates that the identified u s person and you identify him as glenn simpson of fusion gps was likely looking for information that could have been used to discredit candidate number one aposs that aposs donald trump aposs campaign speculates likely shouldn apost the fbi have been a lot clearer to the court that the steele dossier was bought and paid for by the clinton campaign himes well remember when steele is doing this work he doesn apost know that fact in other words he aposs been hired by fusion gps which has been hired by a law firm which has been hired by the dnc and the clinton campaign but to answer your question directly chris you can read and the american public can read what was actually shown to the judge it says that the individual who did this work was acting in a way that was designed to find dirt not the exact word but designed to find dirt on donald trump was being paid so why didn apost the fbi in the fisa application name clinton dnc and fusion gps it aposs a great question chris because it has always been policy of the doj and the fbi when you are doing these things if there is an individual an american individual who is not under scrutiny to refer to them as u s person one u s person two and i remind you that the last fall scandal that devin nunes generated was around whether there had been improper unmasking of u s person information by susan rice by sam power we went through a whole investigation around that and so now the republicans are saying well they didn apost specifically name clinton and dnc well that of course is the policy that fbi and doj have observed forever on these applications not to name u s citizens wallace here is the reaction yesterday from the republican chair of the house intelligence committee devin nunes begin video clip rep devin nunes r cali intelligence committee chair they are advocating that it aposs ok for the fbi and doj to use political dirt paid for by one campaign and use it against the other campaign and i don apost care who you are a republican a democrat or an independent in the united states of america that is unacceptable end video clip wallace doesn apost nunes have a point sir himes no he doesn apost and furthermore he has no credibility again we know that devin devin of the midnight run where he goes to the white house to get information to suggest that there had been wiretapping of donald trump we know that that aposs not true i referred to the unmasking scandal which turns out not to be true now it turns out that the fbi used as part of a much larger fisa application some information that it received from christopher steele a highly trusted source with a long history with the fbi wallace but wait but at a certain point james comey testified i think it was to your committee that the steele dossier was unverified and salacious so was it himes so wallace was it reliable or was it unverified and salacious himes well remember unverified does not mean unreliable unverified means that the fbi has not been able to do all of their work to determine what is true and what is not true that aposs the nature of raw intelligence but chris i aposm glad you bring up jim comey because the whole premise of devin aposs campaign here is that the fbi and the doj were biased against donald trump chris let aposs take a big step back here in the campaign itself while and now we know because you can read about it in the democratic memo while there was an fbi investigation of the trump campaign and of multiple individuals in the trump campaign you do not hear a word from the fbi about that very serious investigation about the possibility of russian collusion with the campaign but you hear jim comey time and again out there saying we are investigating hillary clinton now we aposre not investigating hillary clinton now we aposre back to investigating hillary clinton a lot of people believe that jim comey aposs actions may have prevented hillary clinton from becoming president of the united states but devin aposs contention is that oh well the fbi and the doj are actually biased against donald trump i aposve got to tell you if there was any bias within the fbi and the doj they should they had a very very weird way of showing it during the campaign itself wallace well here you aposre getting to to the bottom line because all for all the talk about dueling memos which i think are confusing a lot of people and the surveillance of carter page most people want to know one thing is there hard evidence that donald trump and or his campaign colluded with the russians to interfere with the 2016 election as you sit here today as the number two democrat on the house intel committee do you have any evidence of that or not himes what we know and i aposm not going to sort of preview what any of the investigations are going to do what we know is that two of the trump campaign aposs foreign policy advisors have now either pled guilty or or been indicted and the national security advisor for donald trump has pled guilty to lying about contacts with russia we know that those contacts exist we know that george papadopoulos had conversations with russia carter page wallace but but but but forgive me sir there aposs no evidence in any of that at least so far that there was collusion himes well it depends on how you define collusion when george papadopoulos hears from somebody associated with the russians that they aposre about to release a whole bunch of information and then they do when donald trump jr invites russians into his office in order to get dirt on the clinton campaign chris you tell me if that crosses your threshold for collusion but that is hardly really inaudible innocent ph wallace well frankly sir as long as you asked no it doesn apost i mean i mean you can say that they were conversations but that certainly doesn apost indicate there was a conspiracy by the trump campaign and the russian and the kremlin to to interfere i mean that indicates that there were there were contacts but it certainly doesn apost are you basing it on on that himes well again i aposm not jumping to conclusions as to what the investigations that are not finished yet are going to show i aposm just going to tell you that if nothing else if the president of the united states apos son says boy do i want to get dirt on hillary clinton and i can apost wait to release it during the summer when it will do the maximum damage and he knows that the individuals concerned are russian and by the way this is not the investigation this is donald trump jr admitting to this meeting when you know you have 20 indictments some of which are most of which are russian related let aposs just say without trying to prejudice where this investigation is going to go it aposs like it aposs you can apost say that there is absolutely no there there there were multiple contacts wallace congressman himes there was a desire to get information you know there aposs more work yet to be done here chris wallace congressman congressman himes thank you thanks for your time let aposs continue this conversation we aposll stay on top of where your committee goes from here himes thanks very much chris wallace up next our power player of the week how one man aposs hoppy led to a discovery 100 million years in the making commercial break wallace dinosaurs space flight a time machine this story has it all is it this summer aposs blockbuster movie no it aposs our power player of the week begin videotape ray stanford armature paleontologist it was almost unbelievable i couldn apost sleep for two nights it aposs like you aposve walked into the twilight zone and you you can apost believe what you aposve seen wallace voice over ray stanford is a 79 year old amateur paleontologist stanford well that aposs interesting wallace and he aposs talking about what he saw in the summer of 2012 after having lunch with his wife sheila who worked at the goddard space flight center stanford from my car about 90 feet away i spotted a smooth light brown rock sticking out and it looked like the kind of material that we sometimes find tracks in wallace when he says tracks stanford is talking about dinosaur tracks stanford much to my surprise the nicest nodosaur track that i aposve ever seen anywhere i think then it dawned on me this is goddard space flight center they aposre looking out into space millions of years ago inaudible down to the earth 110 million years ago and i thought wow this is a wonderful paradox i want to write some poetry wallace stanford aposs excitement is understandable because he aposs been hunting dinosaur fossils and tracks for the last quarter century and he aposs made hundreds of finds stanford yes this is a mammal footprint from 110 112 million years ago wallace one of them is in the smithsonian stanford it was the first hatchling nodosaur an armored dinosaur that had never been found in the whole world wallace but there was a problem with his latest discovery the gotthard center was putting up a new building there so they excavated the 4 tons stone and made a fiberglass cast of it which stanford got to study in his basement and that aposs when the excitement really started stanford well this was the nodosaur track the first find with the baby walking right right across it wallace on camera so this is the big dinosaur and this is a baby stanford that aposs the baby of the same species wallace voice over but along what appears to have been a prehistoric floodplain there were more than 70 tracks of eight different species stanford mammal tracks here some scratching around over there mammal tracks here you had theropods flesh eating small inaudible walking across here wallace on camera so the theropods are here tracking the mammals stanford that well it certainly would appear because they aposre walking so slowly wallace how do you know that they aposre walking slowly stanford because they aposre so close together wallace they aposre creeping stanford yes and we aposve we aposve done a calculation they aposre moving less than a half mile per hour wallace voice over that aposs what stanford says was so exciting fossils show how these animals died but tracks showed how they lived stanford i was looking into a time machine and could see these big flying reptiles landing and the little theropods sneaking around looking down at these little mammals digging in maybe that wouldn apost affect most people that way but it sure affected me that way wallace stanford aposs find was announced in january he calls it a snapshot created before more animals had a chance to cover the tracks stanford i suspect that a flood came after this had had a chance to dry out just a little bit a flood came and covered it and preserved it wallace on camera so washington really was a swamp stanford oh indeed it aposs been a swamp for over 110 million years wallace voice over stanford will keep looking for signs of dinosaurs but he knows where this discovery ranks stanford if anybody tells me i aposm going to find anything more interesting and important than i aposll tell them they aposre probably crazy it aposs it absolutely is like hitting t
