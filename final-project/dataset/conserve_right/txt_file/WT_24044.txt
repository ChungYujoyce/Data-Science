specifics about the condition of otto warmbier who died in 2017 in the united states soon after he was released from imprisonment in north korea the president later said of course he holds north korea responsible for otto s mistreatment and death we got our great people back and that includes our beautiful beautiful otto otto warmbier whose parents i ve gotten to know who s incredible mr trump said
