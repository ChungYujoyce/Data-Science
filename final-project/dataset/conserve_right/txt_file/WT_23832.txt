imports covering everything china ships annually to the united states the two countries are locked in a high stakes dispute over china s push to establish itself as a technological superpower the u s charges that china is resorting to predatory tactics including cybertheft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology in a drive to establish chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles trump s threat makes going ahead with talks very difficult politically for president xi jinping s government said jake parker vice president of the u s china business council he said the chinese public might view this as a capitulation if beijing reached an agreement before trump s friday deadline and if trump goes ahead american companies in china would be very concerned about official retaliation said parker a month ago trump predicted something monumental would be achieved in the next few weeks but last week treasury secretary steven mnuchin seemed to temper expectations suggesting that washington was willing to move on if it can t get the deal it wants a substantive deal would require china to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets and giving them more access to the chinese market philip levy

about alleged chinese perfidy so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word china went viral and collected more than 15 million views on youtube com trump charged that previous administrations gullible and weak had let china get away with abusive trade practices accepting empty promises from beijing and allowing the u s china economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided as evidence he pointed to america s vast u s trade deficit with china 379 billion last year by far the biggest with any country in the world once he took office trump s relationship with xi seemed to

accusing china of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies last july the trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on chinese goods to pressure beijing into changing its policies it now has imposed 10 tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports and 25 tariffs on another 50 billion the chinese have retaliated by targeting 110 billion in u s imports the fight between the world s two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth the international monetary fund the world bank and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy saying the u s china standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies build factories and make investments trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the united states and a benefit to the u s economy but a march study by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university found that the burden of trump s tariffs including taxes on steel aluminum solar panels and chinese imports falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses who buy imported products by the end of last year the study found they were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency nonetheless the overall u s economy has remained healthy on friday the government reported that the u s unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century markets rallied but on monday those gains were reversed as investors reversed course this is a big surprise given the increasingly positive messages from the various us officials involved in the trade talks in recent weeks said tao wang and ning zhang of ubs said in a commentary certainly the risk of an all out us
