apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the last thing alabama democratic sen doug jones may have wanted was beginning the year tied to the hip of his party s liberal leadership given that he is running for reelection but with the impeachment trial of president trump underway that s exactly where he found himself last week voting in lockstep repeatedly with senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat in party line votes on the trial s format he also found himself under attack in his home state top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed despite all of jones comments leading up to the trial where he insisted that he s not going to cast partisan votes he voted strictly along party lines yellowhammer news a right leaning alabama website declared last week schumer s alabama senator is doing what schumer wants america first policies a pro trump nonprofit is targeting mr jones impeachment votes in an ad campaign that started last week for him the choice is do i want to get hit by a car or a truck said alabama gop chairwoman terry lathan the damage is going to be bad either way but he can t be something he s not and he s a liberal fighting his liberal urges in a conservative state mr jones has been regarded as the most vulnerable senator ever since he captured the seat in 2017 an improbable perfect storm special election running in a year with no national election on the ballot and flush with out of state cash mr jones beat by 1 7 percentage points former alabama supreme court justice roy moore a republican who faced allegations he had sexually assaulted girls decades ago mr moore has always denied the allegations and is again running for the seat the most recent polling shows he is again mr jones best chance at reelection mr jones is losing against every other republican candidate according to a december poll by jmc analytics a southern political organization those republicans include former attorney general jeff sessions republican rep bradley byrne and former auburn football coach tommy tuberville a handful of conservative state lawmakers also are running a situation that makes it likely that the top vote getters in the march 3 primary will be forced into a march 31 runoff from a cash and organizational standpoint mr byrne would seem to have an edge while mr tuberville has shown surprising ability as a retail politician resources could be an issue for him in the most recent filings mr byrne had nearly 2 5 million on hand compared to mr tuberville s 1 4 million although the byrne campaign s 600 000 in spending is nearly double that of mr tuberville s according to the center for responsive politics mr sessions entered the race with some 2 4 million already amassed from his earlier campaigns despite a prolonged absence from the stump mr sessions already had a strong and moneyed alabama network that he can tap that makes him a more formidable candidate especially in what is shaping up to be an intense two month campaign his campaign did not respond to requests for comment mr byrne went on the attack against mr sessions last week telling an alabama radio station he thought mr sessions turn as attorney general had so soured his relationship with mr trump that he would be unlikely to get his endorsement but mr trump has some really hard feelings about jeff he really does mr byrne said even if he doesn t say another word take those two quotes the biggest mistake i ever made as president was appointing jeff sessions u s attorney general or this quote jeff sessions is a disgrace to the great state of alabama those two quotes that he made several months ago i don t see how jeff gets over those mr trump s resentment of mr sessions stems from his recusal from the russia investigation nevertheless part of mr sessions pitch to voters is a reminder that he endorsed mr trump long before any other serious republicans did and that he remains a loyal figure in the president s self described mission to drain the swamp the sessions camp has leaked internal polling it says shows him at 44 support compared to mr tuberville at 21 and mr byrne at 14 while few alabama political experts believe mr sessions has that much of a lead there is widespread agreement the gop is headed to a runoff in march the alabama farmers federation which has endorsed mr tuberville conducted a poll that showed mr sessions with a much narrower 35 31 lead over the former auburn coach that survey conducted in december put mr byrne at 12 and mr moore at 8 mr sessions long career in public office means he has plateaued in terms of recognition and mr tuberville s time on the sidelines at auburn made him famous mr byrne s campaign manager said adding that presents an opening for him we have the most room to grow and we have the money to do it seth morrow told the washington times and we feel especially good in a runoff where we see a lot of advantages for us mr morrow conceded mr sessions probably has a small lead at the moment but a runoff seems inevitable and that spells opportunity for mr byrne and mr tuberville the byrne campaign has seized some new year s momentum with an advertising campaign criticizing figures such as minnesota democratic rep ilhan omar and former nfl quarterback colin kaepernick we are the only ones who have a record of supporting president trump we voted for the trade bill we fought against impeachment mr morrow said at this point we ve been on tv by ourselves for a month and a half and we re kind of excited right now whoever wins the republican nomination looks to be in good shape against mr jones the recent jmc analytics poll showed mr jones losing to mr tuberville 47 40 to mr sessions 46 41 and to mr byrne 44 40 even if mr trump does not make an endorsement his presence on the general election ticket in november will be huge ms lathan said when mr jones won the special election to fill the seat left vacant by mr sessions some 650 000 regular republican voters in the state stayed home that group is unlikely to repeat its no show performance this year in the 2018 midterm elections gop candidates hauled in more than 1 million votes in landslide wins at the moment mr jones has the luxury of running unopposed and is free to criticize republicans generally what we re seeing is a republican party that is trying to divide people mr jones said in a recent interview with state media that s all they seem to want to do is talk about us versus them and divide people and not talk about anything but the president mr jones impeachment votes concerning mr trump however have highlighted a voting record that while moderate by the standards of the democratic base puts him at odds with most of his constituents overall mr jones has voted with the trump administration less than 37 of the time according to fivethirtyeight s tracking the most prominent such vote came when he opposed supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh s nomination but mr jones also voted against funding for mr trump s proposed border wall against eugene scalia as secretary of labor and has stood opposed to every move the trump administration has made in the middle east and his biggest contributions come from afar employees of california s alphabet the parent company of google account for the biggest source of his contributions and of the 5 million cash his campaign held at the end of 2019 nearly 80 of it came from big individual donations or pacs according to opensecrets the combination of mr trump s coattails and mr jones voting record will be a potent one at the polls ms lathan predicted the contrast couldn t be clearer he simply can t let down the millions he gets from california and new york she said we re confident but not
