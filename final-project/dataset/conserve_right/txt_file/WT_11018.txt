tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion china s reaction to the decision of the permanent court of arbitration in the hague that there was no evidence that china had exercised exclusive control over the waters or resources historically in the south china sea was disappointing but expected china immediately rejected this ruling asserting that the islands in the south china sea are china s inherent territory unfortunately what followed was a military exercise in the area southeast of hainan island and a chinese h 6k nuclear capable bomber flying over the contested area of scarborough shoal threats of china imposing an air defense zone were also disseminated routine chinese harassment of u s naval vessels and airplanes with provocative and unsafe maneuvering has become the norm indeed the contested area that s affected by these developments involves the transit of more than 100 000 ships and an estimated 6 6 trillion in trade annually demonstrations throughout china in opposition to the hague court s decision are spreading with the boycotting of u s food chains doing business in china the chinese government is using the media to discourage these demonstrations no doubt concerned that these demonstrations can escalate and result in civil unrest china experienced a similar scenario in 1999 when the u s unintentionally bombed the chinese embassy in belgrade and anti u s demonstrations throughout china became intense and dangerous requiring the government to intervene this could happen with current developments in the south china sea top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender nationalism in china is a powerful political dynamic that could incite the government and its people to pursue policies that eventually will be inimical to china s long term interests international law requires that china not interfere with the rights freedom and lawful use of the sea and airspace in the south china sea compliance would ensure that u s china relations remain strong economically and politically this is in china s interest what is especially disconcerting is the current tension with china in the south china sea and china s apparent unwillingness to manage a north korea that s building more nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems while threatening south korea and the u s with nuclear annihilation north korea s reported arsenal of plutonium and enriched uranium based nuclear weapons continues to grow as are their short intermediate range and long range missiles reportedly capable of delivering a nuclear warhead china has to be concerned about these developments it has to be concerned about the routine purges of north korean senior officials some formerly close to china an unpredictable north korea with nuclear weapons is an existential threat to china the region and the international community north korea is one of the many issues that require closer u s china collaboration if not managed smartly and timely north korea could purposely or by accident incite armed conflict in the region with the potential of nuclear weapons being deployed there s no doubt that south korea and japan will not sit idly by as north korea becomes more of a nuclear threat the prospect of japan south korea and possibly other countries in the region going nuclear is great nuclear proliferation has to be a priority concern for all countries the nuclear developments in pakistan and india are also destabilizing rather than eschewing the need for nuclear weapons these countries and north korea are building more nuclear weapons none of these countries are members of the treaty of non proliferation of nuclear weapons npt thus not subject to international oversight and safeguards hopefully iran currently spinning 5 060 centrifuges for low enriched uranium will also eschew the need for nuclear weapons when the nuclear joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa expires in 14 years at which time iran will not be under any restriction on the number and sophistication of centrifuges it could spin to enrich uranium given iran s recent violations of u n resolutions prohibiting the launching of ballistic missiles and its continued support of bashar assad in syria and terrorist organizations like hezbollah and hamas it s of concern to many that iran eventually may go nuclear if that should happen we d witness considerable nuclear proliferation in the region with saudi arabia turkey and egypt likely to seek their own nuclear weapons capabilities given the myriad of nuclear related regional and global issues that affect the united states and china one could only hope that china decides to work more closely with the u s on efforts to halt global nuclear proliferation china could start this collaboration by dealing with the north korea issue china has the leverage with north korea to influence even the mercurial kim jong un north korea needs china s energy economic assistance and cooperation without it north korea s economy would collapse it s this leverage that china could use with north korea combining this with the leverage the u s has mainly with its comprehensive sanctions there s a good chance north korea can be convinced to halt its nuclear programs and eventually denuclearize comprehensively and verifiably in return for security assurances a peace treaty and other deliverables the u s and china cooperated successfully in the past reportedly in addressing issues related to the soviet union and international terrorism this can be done with north korea and eventually with other global nuclear issues what s now important is to ensure that the tension in the south china sea does not escalate into conflict extant issues with the south china sea should not distract us from the immediate threat emanating from north korea joseph r detrani is president of the daniel morgan academy he formerly
