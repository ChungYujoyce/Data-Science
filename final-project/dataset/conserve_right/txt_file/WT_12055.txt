apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the trump administration says it has new momentum to expand international pressure on north korea following a unanimous u n security council vote to ramp up economic sanctions as punishment for pyongyang s recent long range ballistic missile tests president trump hailed a security council resolution that passed saturday with cooperation from both russia and china north korea s neighbor and main trading partner the president tweeted that the development is the single largest economic sanctions package ever on north korea and will have a very big financial impact news of the sanctions which seek to ban north korea from exporting coal iron lead and seafood worth about a third of its total income from trade came as secretary of state rex w tillerson arrived over the weekend in the philippines at an annual diplomatic gathering in east asia where chinese officials expressed cautious support for the development top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens on monday mr tillerson said the first and strongest signal north korea could give to show that serious negotiations were possible is to stop its ballistic missile testing speaking to reporters in manila the secretary declined to give a specific time frame for how long a halt would have to last before the u s would negotiate with the north but said america would know it when we see it he added that other means of communication are open to pyongyang again without elaborating chinese foreign minister wang yi who held separate meetings sunday with mr tillerson and with north korea s top diplomat publicly urged pyongyang to maintain calm and not violate the u n s decision or provoke international society s goodwill by conducting missile launching or nuclear tests mr wang s comments appeared to signal progress in the long elusive u s strategy of trying to deepen chinese cooperation toward more aggressively implementing sanctions against north korea however there were also indications that beijing remains wary about taking a lead role in containing pyongyang who has been carrying out the u n security council resolutions concerning north korea it is china said mr wang in manila on sunday who bore the cost it is also china mr tillerson also met with his south korean counterpart sunday and south korean president moon jae in spoke with mr trump by telephone sunday night according to the white house the two leaders agreed during the call that north korea poses a grave and growing direct threat to the united states south korea and japan as well as to most countries around the world mr trump and mr moon also welcomed the unanimous passage of the u n security council resolution the security council resolution drafted by u s officials and carefully negotiated with the chinese seeks to increase pressure on pyongyang to return to stalled international negotiations over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs u s and chinese officials don t exactly see eye to eye on the prospect of such negotiations the perception is that china wants negotiations to occur more rapidly than washington while the trump administration which has flirted with the alternative idea of backing all out regime change in pyongyang has expressed frustration that the chinese aren t putting enough pressure on the north koreans during his initial months in office mr trump voiced optimism about china s role but has more recently leveled veiled criticism at beijing saying at one point that chinese president xi jinping had tried to help on north korea and it has not worked out the administration has also teased the idea of expending washington s own unilateral north korea sanctions to target chinese companies as punishment for china s ongoing trade with pyongyang and overall perceived inaction on north korea some analysts go so far as to claim beijing tacitly backs pyongyang to antagonize washington and maintain a strategic security edge in the region mr tillerson said nothing publicly about north korea following his meeting with mr wang on sunday but did express broad optimism earlier in the day calling the u n security council resolution a good outcome the council voted 15 0 on the new sanctions which if fully implemented could deliver a 3 billion blow to revenues pyongyang gets from exports to china and a handful of other trading partners the sanctions also aim to block countries from giving any additional permits to north korean workers another source of money for kim jong un s regime in pyongyang the vote followed the regime s first successful tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the u s last month white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said saturday that mr trump appreciates china s and russia s cooperation in securing passage of this resolution u s ambassador to the u n nikki haley said the security council had succeeded in putting the kim regime on notice
