chris stirewalt and howard kurtz on the kelly file we ve been here before the alarm clock sounds and it s another biased debate presided over by the supposed neutral media yes it was a groundhog day debate tuesday night at longwood university that s where cbs anchor and debate moderator elaine quijano did her best lester holt impersonation or was it candy crowley or maybe cnbc throwing hard questions mostly at republican gov mike pence and allowing sen tim kaine to interrupt at will quijano turned left from the very first question citing 1988 liberal democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen s comment about the responsibility of being vice president she recalled that he said iftragedy should occur the vicepresident has to step in withoutany margin for error that set the stage perfectly and signaled viewers that the debate was to be seen consistently from the left and quijano didn t disappoint by a factor of 8 to 1 quijano peppered pence with tough question after tough question she reserved just one for kaine for conservatives it was like groundhog day if viewers saw their shadow that will mean slightly more than one month more of the most biased media election in human history by a factor of 8 to 1 quijano peppered pence with tough question after tough question she reserved just one for kaine quijano started out fine asking kaine how he praised secretary clinton apos s character including her commitment to public service yet 60 percent of voters don apos t think she apos s trustworthy why do so many people distrust her is it because they have questions about her emails and the clinton foundation but that was it conservatives got their moment and the rest of the debate was either kaine or quijano taking turns trying to interrupt pence even the new york times admitted she took sides elaine quijano the moderator helped mr kaine along opening one question with a recitation of mr trump s statements of course the times also deleted that quote later in the evening and eliminated any reference to the moderator in the story thanks to the helpful site newsdiffs it s clear how times editors whitewashed their own reporting the story sits ironically under the headline vice presidential debate what you missed it didn t matter nothing quijano did broke pence s rhythm the result many in the media are admitting pence won for now it was so obvious that team trump posted the comments with links back to the originals they included fun tidbits such as times campaign reporter michael barbaro 9 18 and pence is dominating this debate or the washington post s chris cillizza mike pence direct to camera and conversational winnng sic but hey it s twitter he also listed pence among the debate s winners even msnbc s thrill up my leg guy chris matthews said pence was eloquent excellent and looked like a grown up not that it will matter either cnn s jake tapper already showed where the media would go post debate keying in on kaine s allegation that pence couldn t defend his running mate s position i wonder what the media coverageis going to be like over thenext day or two the night goes to pence but i don t know about the week said tapper alluding to the media that will follow tapper understated the case we all know what the mainstream media will do at least he admitted it not every media outlet gave the night to pence left wing fusion s twitter feed was hilariously biased univision owns fusion and it s the same network that brings hispanics a one sided view of almost everything via anchor jorge ramos ramos is too adult to be the one handling fusion s juvenile twitter account but it was just as biased more than 30 tweets pushing kaine or attacking trump pence just 10 gave pence s message the running comments during the debate were almost laughably childish when kaine talked about protecting social security fusion ran a gif a couple second video showing the golden girls celebrating when he accused trump of loving dictators fusion posted another gif with the line oooooh burn pence was accused of subtle sexism for referring to broad shouldered leadership and we learned tim kaine schools mike pence on trump apos s putin ties four year olds tweet with more depth while quijano allowed kaine to make pence look calm and quiet she also had the occasional good line the people at home cannotunderstand either one of youwhen you speak over each other iwould please ask you to waituntil it is the other isfinished she chided of course she then allowed kaine to interrupt pence another billion or so times the actual tally of debate interruptions promises to be entertaining and slightly less than a billion or so last debate holt gained mainstream media plaudits for his anti trump strategy pushing the birther issue harassing trump about his taxes and pushing trump about not having the look to be president he avoided being lauered and now so did quijano the third debate on october 9 includes cnn lefty anderson
