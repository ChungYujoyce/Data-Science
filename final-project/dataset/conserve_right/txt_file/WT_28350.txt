tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion rome wasn t built in a day and neither will be a nuclear free north korea many critics complain that the results of the singapore summit in 2018 where president trump met north korean leader kim jong un and exchanged polite words were written in disappearing ink many of those critics are saying the same thing this time about a summit in hanoi peace is elusive and the search for it often tedious but jaw jaw as churchill famously said always beats war war mr trump himself is taking pains to temper expectations of the progress that he and his north korean counterpart initiated at singapore i d just like to see ultimately denuclearization of north korea he told an oval office press gaggle last week i think we will see that ultimately i have no pressing time schedule and i think a lot of people would like to see it go very quickly from the other side additional meetings he said likely will be required before denuclearization of the korean peninsula becomes reality the president has dropped his rocket man references since mr kim suspended his provocative missiles tests last year and is

the full extent of the north korean weapons of mass destruction missile programs monitoring of its sites and eventually the removal and destruction of stockpiles of fissile material weapons missiles

disappointing behavior dan coats the director of national intelligence testified to congress in january that north korea will seek to retain its weapons of mass destruction capabilities and is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities mindful of the north s distrust mr trump wants to see interim steps such as the disclosure and closure of several nuclear
