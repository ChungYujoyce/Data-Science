democrat s chances against greg abbott to the extent that democrats dream in technicolor the grand dream would be turning texas from red to blue in future presidential elections why add texas 38 electoral votes to the mega state troika of california illinois and new york and the sum is 142 more than midway to the magical 270 toss in another dozen reliably blue states and the democrats haul climbs to 256 republicans would have to all but run the table in the remaining 34 states including battleground colorado florida ohio and virginia to ever have a viable shot at the oval office as jerry seinfeld would say good luck with all that how close are democrats to flipping the lone star state barack obama received only 41 of the statewide vote in 2012 down 2 5 from 2008 by contrast michael dukakis received 43 3 of the november 1988 presidential election running against texas transplant george h w bush and hillary clinton s chances in 2016 currently not so robust if wendy davis current gubernatorial run is a benchmark about davis she rose to political notoriety in june of last year for waging a 12 hour filibuster on the floor of the texas senate to delay a state bill adding to and updating abortion regulations that landed the state senator in the pages of vogue and in east coast salons where pro choice activists implored her to run to become texas 48th governor that moment in june would also prove to be her political high water mark the first sign of trouble for davis though she received 78 of the vote in the democrats march primary she fared poorly in heavily hispanic predominately catholic communities in south texas democrats she may lose in november thanks to the pro choice brand texas surveys show the pro life position holding a 10 advantage statewide it may explain why though davis continues to run as a women s rights champion she s now talking about ending the statute of limitations on rape and sexual battery cases in texas rather than making her candidacy a straight referendum on abortion a second problem at the heart of davis appeal was a feel good story of a woman overcoming life s hardships that was until a january dallas morning news report that punched holes in her biography the made for lifetime tale of a divorced teenaged mother who lived in a trailer and earned her way to harvard law wasn t quite as it was advertised that prompted davis campaign to issue this statement from the candidate i am proud of where i came from and i am proud of what i ve been able to achieve through hard work and perseverance and i guarantee you that anyone who tries to say otherwise hasn t walked a day in my shoes what she didn t note her republican opponent texas attorney general greg abbott is a paraplegic if elected davis wouldn t be making texas political history two women miriam ma ferguson and ann richards have run the lone star state albeit a half century apart however davis is trying to reverse the political order texas hasn t held an open seat gubernatorial contest since 1990 the winner of that election richards the last democrat to serve as governor in the five gubernatorial elections since the closest a democrat s come to the governor s office is 45 9 richard s take in 1994 while losing to george w bush running on personality and biography one would assume a davis campaign swathed in sunshine and optimism think obama and hope in 2008 instead it s been darkness and slight davis highest profile ads this summer that would be a pair of buys suggesting that abbott was unsympathetic toward rape victims and opposed to cancer research curiously what s missing from the candidates ads would be the candidate herself why would davis under attack from one web site for being too attractive decide not show her telegenic self perhaps because she s a polarizing figure an april survey by public policy polling found the state senator with a 32 favorability rating among women and 33 among men abbott led 49 41 among women and 53 32 among men not every election is a fait accompli certainly when texas early voting doesn t begin until oct 20 and the two gubernatorial contenders will debate in mcallen three fridays from now a second debate in dallas at the month s end hangs in limbo as the two sides have clashed over format in the meantime davis has to figure a way around these hindrances a polling deficit perhaps as high as 12 8 that s the real clear politics average a 3 1 money disadvantage abbott is so well financed that he s running ads in movie theaters local news that overshadows the governors race current texas gov rick perry s indictment the ongoing refugee crisis along the mexican border collectively it suggests that wendy davis a year after filibustering in a pair of pink mizuno wave rider 16 runners is running an uphill race in a texas that isn t quite as blue as democrats would like to dream it is get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week subscribed
