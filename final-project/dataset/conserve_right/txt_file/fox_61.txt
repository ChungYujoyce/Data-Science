money unidentified male it is a joy wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the massacre at two mosques in new zealand is raising new questions about white supremacy hate and the role of inflammatory rhetoric on social media the suspected gunman appears to have been motivated by anti muslim and anti immigrant ideology and a horrific crime is an ugly reminder of a tax on houses of worship in this country in a moment we aposll speak with white house chief of staff mick mulvaney but first let aposs get the latest from ryan chilcote reporting from london begin videotape ryan chilcote correspondent in new zealand a traditional dance in honor of the 50 killed in the country aposs worst ever terror attack on the streets of christchurch families grief authorities say they are now returning the victims bodies to the families the 28 year old suspected gunman appeared in court saturday his face blurred under the judge aposs orders under scrutiny the australian aposs extensive travel to turkey bulgaria and pakistan and the 70 plus page hate filled manifesto he posted online just before the attack in it he claims this 2017 terrorist attack in stockholm when a truck was deliberately driven into a crowd killing five changed him investigators are also looking at its similarities to a manifesto written by a norwegian neo nazi who killed 77 people in 2011 in the attacks on the tree of life synagogue and the charleston church shooting the suspect had five firearms all of which he acquired legally new zealand aposs prime minister says that aposs unacceptable jacinda ardern new zealand prime minister we cannot be deterred from the work that we need to do on our gun laws in new zealand they need to change chilcote the prime minister aposs office received the suspects manifesto via email just nine minutes before the attack end videotape chilcote and that was of course just before the assailant used facebook live to broadcast his attacks for a full 17 minutes now facebook has issued in a statement they say that they removed a full 1 5 million videos of the attack in the ensuing 24 hours and they said that they are removing all of the videos even those that have been edited to remove the violent scenes out of respect for the family chris wallace ryan chilcote reporting from london ryan thank you joining us now the white house chief of staff mick mulvaney mick welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney white house chief of staff good morning and happy st patrick aposs day wallace yes thank you and i forgot to wear a green tie today but thank you for bringing that up mulvaney wasn apost going to say anything wallace what aposs the latest on the investigation into the new zealand massacre is there any sign it aposs part of a larger conspiracy and what aposs being done to beef up security around mosques in this country mulvaney yes i won apost go into the specific discussions that we have with our allies by the way the new zealanders some of our very closest allies in the global war on terror some of our closest friends we share a great deal of information with them so it was especially hurtful i think to see this happen to some of our people in it we consider our closest friends the president talked to the prime minister yesterday so this is a truly sorrowful and tragic event but we have no indication that this is part of a larger conspiracy i don apost think we aposve taken any we aposve suggested any additional security here in the united states but clearly they are going through some terrible times in new zealand i understand they are taking some steps in new zealand that other folks might be involved down there i think they make suggestions about how to operate mosques in the next couple of days such a truly truly tragic situation wallace in his 74 page manifesto the shooter wrote this i want to put it on the screen were are you a supporter of donald trump as a symbol of renewed identity and common purpose sure what does the president think of that mulvaney yes in fact i aposm a little disappointed you didn apost put up the next sentence which the next sentence because i looked at it last night was what about his policies and he aposs a leader and he said dear god no i don apost think it aposs fair to cast this person as a supporter of donald trump any more than it is to look at his sort of his eco terrorist passages in that manifesto that align him with nancy pelosi or ms ocasio cortez this was a disturbed individual an evil person and to try and tie him to an american politician from either party probably ignores some of the deeper difficulties that this sort of activity exposes wallace i want to make it clear i take your point and i want to make it clear the only person responsible for this slaughter is the shooter not president trump but some critics have said that he has contributed over the years to anti muslim here is one of his statements from the campaign begin video clip donald trump president i think islam hates us there aposs something there aposs something there there aposs a tremendous hatred end video clip wallace and after the attack democratic senator kirsten gillibrand tweeted this time and again this president has embraced and emboldened white supremacists and instead of condemning racist terrorists he covers for them and some folks were disturbed that after we saw the manifesto after the shooting which said that he was doing this to kill quote invaders the president said this when he was signing his veto message begin video clip trump people hate the word invasion but that aposs what it is it aposs an invasion of drugs and criminals and people end video clip wallace i understand and i very much agree that the president is not responsible for this action but has he considered given the fact that some people seem to feel that he has given them cover has he considered giving a major speech condemning anti muslim white supremacist bigotry mulvaney you aposve asked a couple questions so let aposs go back and talk about what senator gillibrand said look there aposs folks that just don apost want the president and everything that goes wrong they aposre going to look for a way to tie that to the president so if you see the word invaders in the manifesto they see that passage and say my goodness there must be some connection between this that aposs just absurd to say there aposs some type of connection between being against illegal immigration which is what the veto was about for legal immigration and the ruthless live streaming of murder of 15 people the two things have nothing to do with each other wallace but let aposs forget all of that crosstalk wallace let me just ask to the degree that there aposs an issue with white supremacist white nationalist anti muslim bigotry in this country and there is an issue with that why not deliver a speech condemning it mulvaney you aposve seen the president stand up for religious liberty individual liberty the president is not a white supremacist i aposm not sure how many times we have to say that and to simply ask the question every time something like this happens overseas or even domestically to say oh my goodness it must somehow be the president aposs fault speaks to a politicization of everything that i think is undermining sort of the institutions that we have in the country today let aposs take what happened in new zealand yesterday for what it is a terrible evil tragic act and figure out why those things are becoming more prevalent in the world is it donald trump absolutely not is there something else happening in our culture where people go know what i think today i aposm going to go on tv and live stream me murdering other people that aposs what we should be talking about not the politics of the united states crosstalk wallace if i may all i aposm saying is the president speaks out about a lot of things that he is not responsible for and that he doesn apost feel that there aposs any link terrorism why not make the speech and make it clear that there is no place in america for this kind of hatred mulvaney i think you saw that yesterday in the tweet i mean the president i aposm not sure what more you want the president to do you may say you want to give him a national speech to address the nation that aposs fine maybe we do that maybe we don apost but i think you could jump to the basic issue the president is doing everything that we can to prevent this type of thing from happening here the president is doing everything that we can to make it clear look this has to stop the work that we do including as i mentioned to the outset with our kiwi friends to prevent this happening is a very central part of defending this nation which is how the president spends a great deal of his time so look it aposs a tragedy and i get that we aposre in a hyper partisan sort of time in the country and i get that but that doesn apost mean we need to marry these two events wallace ok let aposs move to another subject you were at the table with trump and kim at the summit we can see you there in the foreground on the left in vietnam and the north koreans have now said after those talks fell apart they may end all talks between the u s and north korea and they may resume nuclear and missile testing if they do so how will the president respond mulvaney i think the resumption of missile testing will be seen as sort of a violation of some sort of breach of trust i think it was a general understanding that there was no reason for that to continue as long as we were continuing to have conversations the conversations continue we did not get a deal in vietnam i think those folks who thought it might be easy for us to get a deal don apost understand the complexities of the issue it took reagan and gorbachev many many times to solve just a piece of the nuclear weapons problem to think that we aposre going to solve the korean issue in one meeting or two meetings is probably not reasonable the discussions can and should continue i foresee the president and the chairman sitting in some point in the future but if they were to begin testing again that would be seen as a truly disappointing turn of events wallace and would the president have a specific response mulvaney i don apost know that i can speak to that but i think he aposd be very disappointed he has a very good relationship with the chairman i think they had an understanding that was not broken the fact that we didn apost get a deal in vietnam doesn apost mean the relationship was imperiled it just means there was no deal to be had at that time it doesn apost mean there aposs not an agreement we can make in the future wallace all right i want to ask about the president aposs veto on friday of the resolution that congress passed blocking his declaration of a national emergency on the border before the senate acted the president tweeted this a vote for today aposs resolution by republican senators is a vote for nancy pelosi crime and the open border democrats what does the president think of the 12 republican senators who defied him mulvaney you know i wouldn apost say he aposs happy i think that tweet is probably exactly where we saw things i had a bunch of phone calls from my former colleagues saying oh this is a big constitutional issue oh i aposm worried about where the money is going by the way there was a lot more senators concerned about where the money was going to be coming from where they aposre going to be losing from their states in their districts than the constitutional issue but fine some folks voted one way for one reason they might have also voted for a different reason but the bottom one is this this was a border security issue go back this is what we aposve been fighting about now since october when we first started having this discussion about wallace so where those 12 senators soft on the border mulvaney this was a border security vote it aposs up to them to go back and tell their voters why it was more important to overturn the president than it was to secure the southern border the question that i don apost think anybody has asked maybe if you could do this this would be great get one of the 12 senators in here and ask them do you think there aposs an emergency of the southern border they have to say yes democrats now will say yes the number of folks crossing every single they are through the roof i have 100 000 apprehended next month there is an emergency come emergency period end of story the next question is what you doing about it the president is doing everything he can i would ask those who voted against the president last week what are you doing to solve a national emergency wallace i aposve got a minute left congress keeps asking you see a lot of those senators were mostly concerned about where was the money going to be taken from congress keeps asking where is the money going to come from which military construction projects will lose their money and the pentagon has failed to give that information if i aposm told that your agency which i think you are still running the omb the office of management and budget has that information will it be given to congress will the list of the military construction projects which lose money under the national emergency will that information be given to congress before they vote whether to override mulvaney no the assumption in your question is not right you aposre assuming there aposs a list some place that were not given to congress which is absolutely false there aposs a process that we are going through that we will be and i think that we aposve already shared crosstal wallace i may be wrong that the pentagon had given the list to omb mulvaney no that is not true there aposs no identified list of projects that will not be funded there aposs an identified list of projects that will not be touched in fiscal 2019 that maybe what you aposre hearing about but we aposre still going to the process of prioritizing what projects are on the pentagon aposs books for 2020 and beyond that are already funded that are not as high priority as the border fence wallace and finally will you beat the override mulvaney yes sir in the house oh yes it doesn apost have a chance wallace no chance mulvaney no chance wallace so the president aposs veto will be sustained mulvaney it will be upheld in the house and won apost have to go back to the senate wallace well no because if it aposs upheld then it doesn apost even go to the senate mulvaney that aposs correct it won apost have to go back to the senate wallace oh i aposm sorry mulvaney right wallace thank you thanks for coming in today on st patrick aposs day mulvaney it aposs always good wallace enjoy your ties mulvaney sorry about crosstalk wallace the wardrobe malfunction mulvaney that aposs right wallace please come back mick mulvaney thanks chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the 12 republicans who went against president trump voting to block his declaration of a national emergency at the border plus what would you like to ask the panel about whether there aposs a split inside the gop just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump congress has the freedom to pass this resolution and i have the duty to veto it and i aposm very proud to veto it end video clip wallace president trump issuing his first veto of legislation to block his declaration of a national emergency at the border a bill that was passed with the support of 12 republican senators and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service gerald seib from the wall street journal and katie pavlich of townhall com well gerry republican senate leader mitch mcconnell warned president trump weeks ago don apost go for this national emergency because if you do you aposre going to get beat and in fact he did how do you think the president aposs decision to ignore mcconnell plays for him and for those 12 republican senators who decided in the end to go against him gerald f seib the wall street journal well look the 12 republican senators list is pretty interesting what is the common thread only one of them is actually running for reelection next year eleven of them are not wallace susan collins of maine seib susan collins of maine on the other hand a lot of senators who are running for reelection next year cory gardner martha mcsally thom tillis they all voted to support the president what that says is the concern in the party is that if you aposre opposed by the president you aposre in trouble in the republican primary so the political power of the president and the republican party was in some ways were affirmed or at least the political fear of the president in the republican party was reaffirmed by this boat wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and on this issue of those republican senators voting against the president voting to block his declaration jo pyper tweeted this my question to these 12 republicans would be where is their loyalty katie how do you answer jo and it was interesting because even though i didn apost bring it up mick mulvaney did well those republican senators said it wasn apost an issue of immigration it wasn apost the wall it was a matter of the separation of powers and congress apos power of the purse katie pavlich townhall com editor i think that aposs correct if you look at the reason why republicans voted for or against this resolution they talk about the fact that they do believe the president is overreaching you have a number of republicans including ben sasse who had an interesting vote to keep the national emergency i thought he would vote against it and in his justification for doing so he says look i do believe that we have ceded too much authority to the executive branch which is why i am supporting legislation introduced by senator mike lee to actually take back some of that power from the executive and give it back to congress there wasn apost a split from republicans about the issue of the national emergency in terms of a crisis on the border that is ongoing that nobody seems to want to fix on capitol hill the issue was the separation of powers the republicans put forward real legislation to actually take back some of that power and nancy pelosi in the house have said they are not going to take it out for a vote which proves that for them this is just political not just about really taking back power from the president whether it aposs a republican or democrat wallace all right let aposs get to the underlying issue here and it aposs actually the one that mick mulvaney brought up and said that we should ask republican senators we are going to ask our panel is there a crisis on the southern border here aposs what president trump had to say about that begin video clip trump in many cases they are stone cold criminals and in many cases and in some cases you have killers coming in and murderers coming in and we aposre not going to allow that to happen end video clip wallace now the president points to last month when more than 76 000 people were stopped at the border that aposs the highest monthly total in 11 years but of those more than 40 000 were family units and karl that raises my question which is the family units do they really want to be does it will really stop them or in fact don apost they want to be caught because they want to claim asylum so in that sense is the right answer more wall or is the right answer to change the laws so that you can turn around family units from central america the way you can from mexico now karl rove former bush white house adviser well look the mix of people approaching the borders has changed dramatically in the early part of the 21st century it was mostly single men mainly from mexico coming here for jobs and a wall helps to stop those people but you aposre right the asylum seekers the family units which is what the current immigration flow largely is they want to show up and surrender to the immigration authorities and a wall really doesn apost matter there but the border is being hit by both types of people the single males many of them from central america now rather than mexico and the family units so you do need a wall and you need a change in the procedures that we have dealing with families this all goes back to a 1993 u s supreme court case that was then memorialized in apos97 in an agreement between the clinton administration and some of the parties to the case call the flores agreement and it basically says that if you have an asylum seeker that shows up on the border you have to you have to keep the families together in as best condition as you can and you have to release minor children to either a relative a guardian or an entity that agrees to take care of them and this has been this makes a magnet for these kinds of families and we just don apost have the laws and the facilities to deal with them two answers pass a law that changes the rules or the dhs this is a consent agreement dhs can promulgate regulations wallace all right mo this is the way the president is now framing this issue begin video clip trump i think anybody going against border security drug trafficking human trafficking that aposs a bad vote the democrats are for open borders they are for crime i mean frankly they aposre for crime end video clip wallace is that going to be a hard issue for democrats in 2020 mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service look for president who came out on the night he was elected and said i want to be president for all americans to now on in the past we call democrats saying that we are for crime and we hate jews like that aposs going to be a big problem for him on this issue specifically on this issue i think democrats can be out there saying we have a plan to actually deal with immigration we need to have border security there is no one out there saying we shouldn apost have border security most democrats on the hill though are not naive enough to think a wall is the full answer to border security and they want to invest in technology they want to do drones they want to do lots of things on have more agents lots of things on border security wallace nancy pelosi says i don apost want to give a dollar for a wall elleithee because when the president is saying that the wall is the end all be all pavlich he does not say that crosstalk wallace he saying that no wall is the end all be all elleithee so but democrats have come forward and said that they want to that they are fine investing and building up and repairing where it aposs fencing but there needs to be more well they are actually karl crosstalk pavlich they aposre not elleithee how can you say that ph rove look robert francis o aposrourke says tear down the wall we got i mean please the democrats the president and the democrats have mutual ground on things like border security with technology and so forth but the one big difference is the democrats cannot accept the fact that a wall physical barrier is necessary on some parts of the border despite the fact that a democratic president helped build 113 miles crosstalk elleithee except democrats on the hill you can talk about residential candidates all you want you can talk about certain members of congress but the ones who were actually in the room at the table negotiating this have been talking about investing some of these stuff crosstalk rove oh nancy pelosi so she didn apost mean it when she said not a dime for the wall elleithee if you look at the packages that democrats have passed in the past and that they are promoting today the democratic majority in the congress is for investing overall in border security crosstalk elleithee this is a problem karl you know i respect you tremendous but this is a problem is that this is all you guys want to talk about let me finish the point i was trying to pavlich because americans care about it it aposs an issue that is a crisis that affects everybody whether crosstalk elleithee there is more to immigration than just a wall as hard as you guys want to make it about that there is more to it than just a wall crosstalk elleithee hold on you caught me off a number of times you aposve cut me off a number of times crosstalk rove i remember when the democrats killed it in 2007 we have democrats and republicans elleithee you have cut me off a number of times rove supposedly agreeing upon border security measures that involved technology and so forth where they disagree is is that the majority of the democratic caucus don apost want money for a border wall period elleithee karl there is so much more that needs to be done wallace final thought 10 seconds elleithee that this president will not talk about there is a humanitarian issue that is pulling people away from central america crosstalk elleithee we need to focus on that but you guys will not let go of this as the sole focus wallace guys we aposre going to take a break here you can continue outside we aposll see you a little later and i bet they will when we come back the 37 year old from south bend indiana known as mayor pete is looking to break out in the crowded democratic field pete buttigieg joins us live for a fox news sunday sit down with the 2020 candidates commercial break wallace coming up one of the democrats hoping to break out of the crowded 2020 presidential field begin video clip mayor pete buttigieg d south bend indiana i think it aposs pretty clear that i aposm not like the others i just bring a different perspective i think some of that aposs generational end video clip wallace our fox news sunday sit down a small town mayor with big time aspirations is next commercial break wallace we are now less than a year away from the iowa caucuses and the field of democratic candidates looking to make donald trump a one term president is taking shape we hope to talk with them at length so you get a better sense of who they are and where they would take the country joining us now for our first fox news sunday sit down south bend mayor pete buttigieg mayor welcome to fox news sunday buttigieg thank you good morning wallace so there are now more and today kirsten gillibrand officially entered the race there are now more than a dozen candidates officially in the race you aposre the only one who still has an exploratory committee what are you exploring and when are you going to decide whether to get in buttigieg so we put together the exploratory committee and rolled it out in january to see what the response would be to the idea of a midwestern millennial mayor entering the conversation for president would anybody take note how would the fundraising go would there be a level of interest in the early states now we aposre seeing all of those things but because i aposm not highly famous and i aposm not personally wealthy it takes a little bit to get the organization in place for a launch you only get to launch one and i aposve got to tell you i aposm not going to make any news this morning but all of the signs are pointing in the right direction and when we do come out it aposs a it aposs going to be a big one wallace people are trying to make sense of this huge sprawling field young versus old further left versus more moderate what aposs your lane buttigieg i don apost know i think everybody wants to fit you on an ideological spectrum which i think has never been less relevant i think more and more people just want to know what your ideas are and and whether they make any sense and part of how we were able to succeed in south bend governing i believe in accordance with progressive values but also earning a lot of support from republicans and independents wasn apost by trying to manage exactly where i was on this kind of left right spectrum it was by trying to do the right thing i view myself as a progressive but these labels are becoming less and less useful wallace we aposre we aposre going to get into specific issues in a moment one more sort of political question one of the ways in which you stand out is that you aposre 37 and if elected you would be the youngest president ever to some degree people talk about you as the bright shiny thing in the field the question is now that beto o aposrourke is in it some people in the grassroots say he aposs brighter shinier thing how do you combat beto and like him were you born to be in this race buttigieg i think i was born to make myself useful and i aposm not combating anybody they are going to be competitors more than opponents i think among the democrats and that aposs a good thing but i do believe that i aposm not like the others i belong to a different generations than most of the others you know mine was the generation that that you know was in high school when school shootings started to be the norm we aposre the generation that aposs going to be on the business end of the consequences of climate change we aposre also the generation that aposs on track to be the first in american history to make less than our parents if nothing is done to change the trajectory of our economy i think having a voice from that generation having a voice with executive leadership i mean i aposve got to tell you i know i aposm the young face in in this conversation but not only do i have more years of government experience under my belt than the president but i aposve got more years of executive government experience under my belt than the vice president i think that aposs relevant and i think coming from the industrial midwest a place where unfortunately my party really lost touch with a lot of voters especially in 2016 it aposs a combination of attributes not to mention the military service that i bring to the table that is simply different from the others and i aposm looking forward to competing wallace let aposs do a lightning round quick questions quick answers to the degree that you think you have one what aposs your big idea what your core message buttigieg well the biggest side is about wallace this is lightning round so you aposve got to be quick buttigieg yes sure i guess i aposd say generational change and then liberty democracy and security now i believe when you unpack each of those ideas they point you in a specific direction with some policies behind it maybe the rest of the light round will help us get to that wallace well we aposre going to we are let aposs turn to what some of the other democrats are talking about what aposs on the ideological agenda right now a lot of democrats pushing the green new deal you have said that it aposs more of a goal than a plan explain buttigieg that aposs right i mean it aposs a handful of pages laying out a goal for us to cut carbon emissions before they lead to changes that really destroy our economy and any prospect for people in my generation to do well i aposm thinking about what the world aposs going to look like in 2054 when i get to the current age of the current president and if we don apost act aggressively and immediately on climate it aposs not going to be a pretty picture so what they aposre doing wallace but are you saying are you saying for instance that some of the talk about retrofitting every building in america or trying to make the country carbon free by 2030 that that aposs just unrealistic buttigieg we aposre going to have to do it look wallace by 2030 buttigieg if we can apost do carbon free then we aposll do net carbon free which means that we aposre taking out as much as we aposre putting in the bottom line is scientifically the right year to do that was yesterday we have got to do this this timetable isn apost being set in congress it aposs being set by reality it aposs being set by science and it aposs going to hit those deadlines are going to hit in our climate with or without us and so we have to ask with the green new deal gets right is it recognizes there aposs also a lot of economic opportunity in this retrofitting building means a huge amount of jobs for the building trades in this country wallace ok buttigieg i view that as a good thing wallace ok we aposre way over the lightning round medicare for all you say it should be medicare for all who want it buttigieg that aposs right i do wallace explain buttigieg well i do believe that a single payer environment is probably the right answer in the long term but i think any politician who use throws around phrases like medicare for all has a responsibility to explain how we would get there in my view what you want to do is you take something like medicare you put it on the exchanges as a kind of public option and if people like me are right that that is both good coverage and more cost efficient then more and more people will buy in and it will be a very natural glide path towards the single payer environment wallace so was kamala harris wrong when she talked about just getting eliminating private insurance buttigieg yes i view it differently i mean think about medicare itself you still have medicare advantage and plans around that even countries like the u k with nationalized medicine still have a role for the private sector so i think there will be a role for the private sector but a very different one that we have in the corporate system today wallace the supreme court you talk about possibly expanding the court from nine justices to 15 buttigieg yes but it aposs not just about throwing more justices on the court what i think we need to do it some kind of structural reform that makes the court less political we can apost go on like this where every time there aposs a vacancy there aposs this apocalyptic ideological battle so the idea that one idea that i think is interesting as you have 15 members but only ten of them are appointed in the political fashion five of them can only be seated by unanimous agreement of the other ten there are other ideas that have been floated too about term limits or about rotating justices up from the appellate bench i think we should have a national debate about what aposs appropriate especially within the framework of the constitution but the bottom line is we aposve got to make some kind of structural form to depoliticize the supreme court wallace after donald trump aposs victory in 2016 you wrote an essay in which you said that i think it was called something from flyover country was that correct buttigieg yes wallace that what you said democrats have largely and to their very much their their loss ph their cost have ignored the industrial midwest how would you take on donald trump and specifically how do you beat him in michigan and ohio and wisconsin that upper rust belt that that he took away from the democrats buttigieg well again coming from a former auto manufacturing town in the northern part of indiana this is my home and i understand why our party largely lost touch but i don apost think it aposs just about donald trump as a matter of fact i think in many ways he aposs a symptom rather than a cause where i come from there are a lot of people and i think there are a lot of viewers of this network who are under no illusions about the character of the president but voted this way in order to make a statement some people i think voted to burn the house down because they aposve seen how for years democratic and republican presidencies produced economic and social and political results that let them down we aposve got to be speaking to people wallace ok i mean i forgive me that seems a little gauzy so how do you say to the people in those states you know that that feel that they aposve been left behind by globalism things like that globalization i aposve i aposve got a better answer than donald trump donald trump talks about jobs he talks about the and the appointment rate is at a record low buttigieg yes that aposs wallace he talked about restoring manufacturing jobs so buttigieg yes and look we aposve been restoring manufacturing jobs in our community too but we aposre realistic about the fact that with automation it aposs not going to look like the old economy the president aposs promise is to turn back the clock that we can somehow just go back to the 1950s and it aposs just not true the economy is changing the pace of change is accelerating and what we aposve got to do is master those changes in order to make them work for us there are some very specific policy moves to do that everything from making sure everybody has health care to increasing the minimum wage to delivering portable benefits so that when you get disrupted from your job it aposs not such a disruption in the rest of your life there are things that we can and must do to make sure that as these change come and again they will with or without us that we can actually succeed especially in economically vulnerable communities like where i come from in the midwest wallace ok let aposs let aposs talk about your record because you aposve been the mayor of south bend since 2012 let aposs put it up on the screen more than 800 million in private investment including a resurgence of downtown more than 4 000 jobs created more than a thousand abandoned homes demolished or repaired in your first term but critics point out the violent crime rate in south bend went up to last year and you aposve had a continuing problem with homelessness and i checked it out yesterday the unemployment rate of south bend is higher than the unemployment rate for the state of indiana as a whole so pluses and minuses yes buttigieg it is true that i aposve not personally resolve the problem of violence nor the problem of homelessness but i will say that we aposre doing more around homelessness than i think has happened in our community in 30 years and i think that characterization of the violent crime rate isn apost quite fair either when i was a kid it was not unusual to have more than 20 homicides in south bend last year we had nine that is obviously nine too many wallace i understand but if you look at your term as mayor it had gone up until last year buttigieg that aposs not really true it was up and down from year to year if you look at something like the like the homicide rate look i feel like i aposve been fighting gun violence and homicide in our community with one hand tied behind my back but i am proud about everything we have done as a community to come together by the way a low income community you know our per capita personal income just went over 20 000 a year so yes we have challenges with with economic growth we have challenges with crime we have challenges with homelessness but the way our community has risen to meet those challenges is something i aposm very proud of wallace why are you in such a hurry why not wait a few years get some more experience build up a bigger record get better known and run for president say at the ripe old age of 41 buttigieg it aposs not about becoming president it aposs not about finding some moment that it aposs the right wallace well if you aposre running for president it is about becoming president buttigieg now it aposs about america it aposs about what america needs all the decisions i aposve made to run for office in my career and all the decisions i aposve made to not run for office are about the moment what is called for and then what i bring to the table i see this very unusual moment look it aposs unusual for it to even be possible that a 37 year old midwestern mayor is giving national interviews about a possible candidacy for president but there aposs something happening right now that calls for something completely different than what we aposve been seeing generationally different regionally different somebody with a different life story and a different background and to the surprise of many including myself this moment could be the only moment over the last hundred years or the next hundred years when it aposs appropriate for somebody like me to be in this conversation but i aposll tell you with that moment shaping up i aposm not going to miss that moment wallace mayor thank you thanks for joining us today and we aposll be watching you out on the campaign trail buttigieg thank you wallace up next we aposll bring back or sunday group to handicap the growing democratic field for president from beto to bernie to the candidate lots of folks are still waiting for joe biden begin video clip crowd run joe run run joe run joe biden former vice president thank you thank you thank you end video clip commercial break begin video clip beto o aposrourke d presidential candidate literally not to be melodramatic but literally the future of the world depends on us donald trump president i think he aposs got a lot of hand movement i aposve never seen so much hand movement i said is he crazy or is that just the way he acts end video clip wallace well former texas congressman beto o aposrourke announcing his campaign for president and president trump wasting no time mocking the rising democratic star and we aposre back now with the panel so he got into the race long on grassroots support and media attention short on record and specific policy proposals mo how do you see him faring in this big and sprawling democratic field mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service i think he aposs one of the great unknowns of this race to be honest you know there is a big difference between i aposm a fan of beto o aposrourke i think he aposs a dynamic candidate he but there aposs a big difference between taking on ted cruz in a wave election year in texas and then running on the national stage against a field of democrats and so now all these people who really were impressed by the kind of grassroots campaign he ran in texas now are waiting to see how he does out there this is the phase of the campaign where candidates are sort of explaining their worldviews right the direction they want to take the country the policy specifics we aposll fill in as the campaign progresses so that aposs what he aposs doing now he aposs out there saying i mean here aposs what i think the world should look like we aposll see how he does now filling in those details wallace do you think you could get him to stop moving his arms so much elleithee if look if there aposs a debate between beto o aposrourke aposs hand movements on donald trump aposs hand movements in the general election i think we aposre going to have a very dizzy election but i aposll wallace i was going to say take some dramamine karl i aposve been waiting since he announced to ask you and i want you to call him beto how seriously do you take beto o aposrourke karl rove contributor yes i take robert francis o aposrourke very seriously look he is a as mo said he aposs a charismatic candidate he speaks well he can rouse a crowd he aposs got a sense of authenticity about himself it was ironic that his announcement was essentially made by a generous interview in a magazine with vanity in its title but he is a very attractive candidate and he raised 80 million in his senate race and nearly won a red state on the other hand his record is thin his ability to talk about these issues is elusive and the biggest problem i think he aposs going to face is is that look he had 2017 and through september of 2018 where ted cruz his opponent never engaged him and now he aposs going to be engaged every single day he saw it you know he gets in and we see an immediate dump of of oppo research by somebody on his on his background and his record about wallace he was involved with a group of hackers and rove right exactly and and and he how he aposs going to deal with that because he aposs been used to he aposs been used to a different kind of a campaign were here had free running range for about 18 months interesting to me is david plouffe who aposs a very smart guy is now engaged in the campaign wallace the campaign manager for barack obama rove barack obama and the does this a signal that the obama ites are going to get behind him and b will he listen to plouffe because he like like plouffe aposs original boss barack obama robert francis o aposrourke seems to think he is the smartest guy in the campaign and and not inclined to listen to advice wallace why do you hate calling him beto rove because it aposs a phony name he look when he did he when he went to woodberry forest the elite boarding school did he call himself at that he call himself that at columbia did he call himself that when he was a member of a grunge band who did he call himself that when he ran a web hosting company no once he began to run for office in a heavily latino county he stopped calling himself robert francis o aposrourke i aposm merely calling him the name that he appears on the ballot by and and i aposm not i encourage you to give him a new nickname robert francis o aposrourke r4 r4 it aposs a good name wallace ok the top contenders in the democratic race are mostly in with one notable exception take a look begin video clip biden i have the most progressive record of anybody running for the united of anybody who would run end video clip wallace that was last night he then crossed himself and tried to correct himself on this gerry how certain are you that he joe biden is going to run and how do you assess his strengths and his potential weaknesses if he does get in gerald f seib the wall street journal well first of all how certain ninety five percent but i mean you know it aposs joe biden five percent is still not 0 percent so i think it aposs very likely that was a very telling clip obviously that you just showed look this this field which we aposve been discussing is not fully formed until joe biden is either in or out and most likely he aposs going to be in then he will test the proposition of how much change do democrats really want this time do they want somebody who aposs transformational and mayor pete would certainly be a completely different kind of candidate order do they want somebody who aposs proven at the end of the day because they mostly want to beat donald trump that the highest priority is not ideological it aposs pragmatic we want somebody who aposs a proven candidate who can beat president trump that aposs our number one number two and number three priorities i don apost think we know because the activists in the democratic party have one answer to that question the democratic primary voters en masse may have a different answer to the question i suspect they aposre more pragmatic than we think they aposre going to be and i suspect that means joe biden has got a pretty good shot wallace katie as you look at this field and let aposs assume biden gets in so he aposs in the field who do you think and i understand it aposs awfully early but who at least at this point do you think would be the one or two candidates that would be the most potential threat to donald trump katie pavlich townhall com editor i think that joe biden would be a very big threat to donald trump just based on the path to 270 and the lessons that have been learned from the 2016 campaign the democrats believe that joe biden can talk to people in the middle of the country who have been left behind in a similar way that donald trump has but on a more progressive side of the political spectrum and it aposs going to be interesting to watch where the energy is really when it comes down to voting on in the democratic party because we aposve seen this leftist populism and this need for an outsider right so people who are outside of washington both in the republican and democratic side we aposll see how that plays out in our primary but when it comes to wallace anybody else inaudible biden pavlich i think biden is the guy yes in terms of beating donald trump which is democrats who i aposve talked to say that is the goal but i don apost think that barack obama is going to jump in as an endorsement actually i think he aposs going to wait until the primaries over based on the people who i aposve talked to about that but one thing i want to say about ohio for example i was there a couple weeks ago and the people there are saying look there aposs no way that people who were democrats voting for donald trump in 2016 are going to just magically switch their votes back to democrat because there happens to be someone like joe biden who knows how to speak the language they feel loyal to the president they feel like he aposs brought results and jobs back to their communities and they aposre going to report him for that with a second vote in 2020 wallace ok i aposve got one minute left again i know it aposs early give me the two or three candidates who you think will be around on the democratic field at the end of the nomination battle elleithee i don apost know but here aposs who i aposm watching because i think they aposre really interesting wallace right elleithee i think joe biden obviously for all the reasons we aposve been talking about i think pete buttigieg is a fascinating candidate who can make real noise in this race and really help steer the debate kamala harris has been running a very strong campaign so far and how far she can take that and i think amy klobuchar has been a bit of a surprise to a lot of people in these early stages we aposll see if she can sustain some of that early momentum she aposs seeing wallace anybody else seib amy klobuchar is my choice for dark horse you know a female candidate from the upper industrial midwest exactly the place where the democrats need to win votes back wallace and and a little bit more in in the center rove any wallace hold that thought and we aposll have to do it next time thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week a billionaire businessman who was vowing to die broke commercial break wallace you know many of them billionaires who give away much of their fortunes to charity like bill gates and warren buffett and michael bloomberg but we aposve met one who chances are you aposve never heard of and he aposs our power player of the week begin videotape wallace is it fun to give away money t denny sanford businessman and philanthropist it is and a joy it is truly a joy to help other people wallace voice over t denny sanford means what he says the 83 year old businessman and philanthropist makes this promise sanford i will die broke everything is committed to different organizations wallace on camera and why do want to die broke sanford my children are well taken care of and my my employees are well taken care of inaudible i will die broke wallace do you have any idea how much money you aposve given away over the years sanford currently about 1 6 billion wallace voice over sanford made his fortune in banking and credit cards in sioux falls south dakota it was there in 2003 he donated 16 million to build a children aposs hospital that looks like this sanford they like coming to a disney castle as opposed to going to a wallace on camera sterile hospital sanford it scares them this this is a joy for them to come wallace voice over his big donation came four years later 400 million to buy a local hospital system and turn it into sanford health now 44 hospitals in 20 states and nine countries very focused on cutting edge research sanford i aposm funding one for type one diabetes breast cancer my mother died of breast cancer when i was four and so that aposs that aposs a big project wallace sanford received an award in washington this week from research america sanford think beyond the life of business success and work towards a life of significance so i took that challenge to heart wallace and sanford announced another 25 million gift to do genetic testing of veterans to make sure they get the right treatment sanford so we aposll have 250 000 vets that have had cancer and now go back to them and find their biomarkers if you will to try and determine what is the best medicine for them as opposed to a standard prescription wallace you might think given the size of his giving he has a foundation with a big staff but that aposs not denny sanford aposs style sanford i can do it myself i have a staff one person my full time assistant and she helps me through the process simple wallace sanford aposs friends have a nickname for him sanford my best friends call me wolt w o l t the world aposs oldest living teenager i aposm young at mind young at heart and enjoy life wallace and like everything else his plans for the future could not be more direct sanford just keep enj
