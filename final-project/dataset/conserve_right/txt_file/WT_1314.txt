apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic miami ap florida has never been known as a place of stability especially in its politics and yet stability is what has been on the minds of many democrats in the state who say they ll vote for former vice president joe biden in tuesday s presidential primary election instead of vermont sen bernie sanders i like some of sanders ideas but he s a little too extreme for me said jeanne hilburn a 76 year old retired teacher who lives in the suburbs of tampa a lot of democrats are like me we want stability top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches as the race for the democratic nomination enters a penultimate phase with sanders campaign on the brink of collapse and biden s ascendant attention is turning to places like florida which is holding its primary on tuesday along with ohio illinois and arizona florida has 219 delegates the biggest prize of next week s election few places hold the electoral cachet of florida which has been among the most coveted swing states in the last three decades including during the contentious chaotic recount of 2000 it is a vital state for president donald trump who would have almost no path to reelection without it biden s advisers are banking on a decisive florida victory that sends a clear message that he is much better positioned to win the state and deny trump a second term in 2016 trump defeated hillary clinton here by 1 2 percentage points florida as always is pivotal in the outcome said nikki fried who is the state s agriculture commissioner and top elected democrat and who endorsed biden we are the ultimate swing state sanders support in florida has always been tenuous in the 2016 primary he lost to clinton by a nearly 2 to 1 margin this year sanders angered a potentially large voting bloc cuban americans by praising fidel castro for implementing a literacy program in the communist nation there is nothing positive you can say about the conditions in cuba if he doesn t understand that it is hard to conceive that he will get any votes said xavier suarez who was the first cuban born mayor of miami and is now running as an independent in the county mayoral race it s gonna be a massacre that leaves many florida democrats looking beyond the primary to november several groups have banded together to register people to vote and mobilize for november one of the four groups organizing together 2020 is led by fried it will hire employees register voters train volunteers and then turn everything over to the party after the july convention another of the groups is for our future a super pac that is made up largely of mike bloomberg s campaign apparatus a strong turnout in the florida primary could give hope to democrats though it would be difficult to draw any conclusions for november given the state s high number of independents and to be sure the coronavirus outbreak could keep some voters away from the polls and muffle any message from the turnout democrats know it will be a challenge to sway voters here about 3 6 million of the state s 13 6 million voters are registered independents which means they can t vote in tuesday s primary but are eligible to cast ballots in the general election florida is an interesting state depending on where you re at we can be very conservative or we can be very progressive said st petersburg mayor rick kriseman a democrat we also have a strong moderate and independent streak biden i think he ll do well here with democrats and independents and with republicans who are looking for an alternative to president trump ashley walker of organizing together said a priority is grassroots door knocking in counties that were close in 2016 like pinellas home to st petersburg which trump won by 5 500 votes and in pasco a suburban county just north of tampa where voters moved to republican candidates in the 2018 senate and gubernatorial races walker says the aim is to siphon off votes there the margins matter we re probably not going to win pasco county but we re going to need to close the margins so we lose less badly she said and in those counties that go back and forth between red and blue like pinellas it s especially important to get organized early to build relationships early similarly biden s supporters have been paying visits to spanish language tv shows and broadening diaspora outreach efforts in south florida john kerry the former secretary of state and the democratic presidential nominee in 2004 spoke about latin america policy on behalf of biden s campaign at a restaurant in doral the hub of venezuelan exiles we feel good about where we are in the state but we are not taking anything for granted said carmen torres of florida hispanics for biden democrats don t have a lock on the latino vote in florida particularly among the nearly 2 million residents who are originally from cuba venezuela and nicaragua where authoritarian socialist regimes have soured many exiles toward any left leaning politicians a third of cuban american midterm voters identify as democrats according to ap vote cast a wide ranging survey of the elecotrate but the survey said a majority 56 of cuban american midterm voters expressed approval of the way trump was handling his job as president daisy baez a former democratic state lawmaker is leading a group called dominicanos con biden to rally her fellow dominican americans to support the former vice president a similar effort to rally venezuelans will roll out on sunday we wanted to address our message to a specific community baez said we needed to piece it down in smaller parts as sanders chances diminish biden may also need to win over his challenger s fervent supporters if an endorsement follows some may not follow suit nick mora 24 a florida international university student marched alongside 20 students on a recent afternoon on campus to persuade others to vote early for sanders mora acknowledged sanders defeat earlier this week was disappointing but said they were not ready to give up yet let s just say joe biden does not have the same policy proposals as bernie mora said i feel like the progressive movement is being pushed down and there s not much we can do about it if we vote for joe biden so we are still try
