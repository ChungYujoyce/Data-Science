videotape donald trump president of the united states it aposs going to be a very important meeting the denuclearization of the korean peninsula of north korea the de nuke de nuke wallace we aposll discuss what comes next for kim jong un and president trump trump i aposll look forward to our meeting it should be quite something wallace with john bolton in his first sunday show appearance as white house national security adviser then the president aposs new lawyer meets with robert mueller as a senate panel moves to protect special counsel we aposll ask democrat chris coons about this bipartisan bill and whether it will make it to the full senate for a vote plus trouble for the trump cabinet his nominee to lead the v a withdraws while his epa chief gets grilled over ethics scott pruitt epa administrator facts are facts and fiction is fiction the lie doesn apost become truth just because it appears on the front page of a the newspaper wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the president aposs promise to drain the swamp and our power player of the week we meet a leader of the arms race for ideas in washington kay coles james president the heritage foundation the guiding mission of this institution is to be that true north for the conservative movement wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington this week aposs historic summit between the leaders of north and south korea has set the stage for a face to face meeting between president trump and kim jong un it will be the first time the leaders of the u s and north korea have ever met and central to the agenda trying to get kim to abandon his nuclear weapons program joining us now john bolton in his first sunday show interview as the president aposs national security advisor ambassador welcome back to fox news sunday john bolton national security adviser glad to be here wallace let aposs start with the trump kim summit is it going to happen when and where bolton well i think it is going to happen the dates and the places are still under discussion i think the president is eager to do it as soon as possible but we still need to work out the precise parameters wallace well you say he aposs going to do it as soon as possible is the u s side ready to sit down and talk bolton we will be when we do sit down i think it aposs something that the president has thought a good deal about already and i think people around the world have already given him credit for establishing the preconditions for this to happen in the first place president moon of south korea for example has been very clear that but for the pressure the economic pressure the political military pressure that president trump has put on north korea we would not be where we are today wallace given how apparently while the meeting between kim and the south korean president went on friday what could stop a trump kim summit from happening bolton well we need to agree on a place and that remains an issue but if in fact kim has made a strategic decision to give up his entire nuclear weapons program then i think deciding on the place and the date should be fairly easy wallace ok so let aposs talk about your position the u s position going in what the u s wants from kim will president trump insist that kim give up ship out all of his nuclear weapons all of his nuclear fuel all of his ballistic missiles before the u s makes any concessions bolton yes i think that aposs what denuclearization means we have very much in mind the libya model from 2003 2004 there are obviously differences the libyan program was much smaller but that was basically the agreement that we made and so we want to test north korea in this first meeting for evidence that they have made that strategic decision and we have we have history to give us some assistance on it and at 1992 the joint north south denuclearization agreement had north korea pledging to give up any aspect of nuclear weapons and to give up uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing now we got other things to talk about as well ballistic missiles chemical and biological weapons the american hostages the japanese abductees but starting on the nuclear side with what north korea agreed to more than a quarter of a century ago was a pretty good place to start wallace but just to pin this down north korea has to give up basically it aposs a whole program before the u s begins to relieve economic sanctions bolton yes i think that the maximum pressure campaign that the trump administration has put on north korea has along with the political military pressure has brought us to this point i mentioned president moon before just this past week president macron of france chancellor merkel of germany prime minister abe of japan the week before that this morning the prime minister malcolm turnbull of australia have all acknowledged we are at this point because of american pressure relieving that pressure isn apost going to make negotiation easier it could make it harder wallace what kind of time frame for north korea to give up its weapons how quickly what they have to do it and is there any possibility that the u s would accept north korea as a nuclear power and allow them to keep some of their infrastructure bolton i don apost see how that aposs possible again the north koreans have already agreed to this they agreed to it in 1992 with south korea and they have pledged similar things since then now it aposs also the case that they aposve lied about it and broken their commitments just one reason there aposs nobody in the trump administration starry eyed about what may happen here but by demonstrating they aposve made a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons it would be possible to move quickly again the libya case demonstrates this wallace well when you say quickly we are talking by the end of the year bolton well it aposs a matter first finding out just how much there is to dismantle i mean it aposs not possible to go to this meeting with a set of screwdrivers and think we are going to take it apart beginning the day after the meeting and therefore the full complete total disclosure of everything related to their nuclear weapons program with full international verification and i think following libya verification by american and other inspectors is could be very important here wallace now the joint statement from the two koreas on friday called for and i want to put it up on the screen a nuclear free korean peninsula and some people have suggested the north koreans will give up everything they aposve got but in return the u s would agree that we are not going to allow any nuclear armed airplanes or nuclear armed ships on the korean peninsula is that acceptable bolton well we certainly haven apost made that commitment and again i aposm looking at the panmunjom declaration as they call it in the context of a series of earlier north south korean agreements and again looking at the 1992 joint declaration when they said nuclear free they meant with respect to the two koreas wallace so you don apost view this as involving any kind of commitment from the u s bolton i don apost think it binds the united states no wallace after the summit on friday president trump tweeted this korean war to end the united states and all of its great people should be very proud of what is now taking place in korea i don apost have to remind you mr ambassador that up to this point kim has said some stuff but he has given up precisely nothing any concern that president trump is getting carried away bolton not at all as i said there aposs nobody starry eyed around here and we aposve all been called a number of things naive is not usually one of them i think the president sees the is a potential here for a historic agreement a breakthrough that nobody could have imagined even a few months ago that potential is there but as he says repeatedly the potential for no deal at all is also there and we aposre not going to know until we actually have the meeting and see what kim jong un is prepared to do it certainly the case that the mere words aren apost going to sway anybody wallace now it certainly the case that you have never had any illusions about the kim regime i suspect you expected me to do what i aposm about to do here are some of your greatest hits begin video clip bolton i think the only diplomatic option left is to end the regime in north korea by effectively having the south take it over here aposs an all purpose insult that you can use i aposll apply it to the north koreans question how do you know when the north korean regime is lying answer when their lips are moving end video clip wallace now i aposve got to tell folks that when we were playing those ambassador bolton had a smile on your face who should we believe that john bolton or this one bolton well you know i aposll give you the same answer i gave to martha maccallum the day the president tweeted my nomination when i didn apost even know i had been relieved of my duties at fox news you know i have said and written a lot of things over the years i stand by every one of them but i was a freelancer back then i had the luxury of voicing my own opinion that aposs not my job now i aposm simply an advisor the decision maker here is the president and i don apost think really there aposs anything to be served by going back to those golden oldies and comparing them to what the president aposs position is now my advice to him you know i give in private he makes the decisions that aposs how it works wallace now kim told the south koreans friday that south koreans are now saying is that he would give all his weapons up if the u s promises not to invade is that the kind of a guarantee that we would be willing to make bolton look this is part of a discussion that remains to be had we aposve heard similar things from north korea before that aposs why i think that while we should be optimistic in pursuing the opportunity we should be skeptical of rhetoric until we see some concrete evidence wallace well i aposm not going to pull one of your old bytes now i aposm going to pull one of president trump aposs from this week take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states kim jong un was he really has been very open and i think very honorable from everything we aposre seeing end video clip wallace kim jong un open and honorable bolton i think the president is focused on doing everything he can to make this meeting a success it aposs somewhat different than what he said before but i think he aposs saying look if you are going to come with a real strategic determination to give up nuclear weapons we aposre going to have a very serious conversation wallace ok let aposs turn to iran were president trump has a may 12th deadline to decide whether or not to re impose sanctions on the regime in tehran and to pull out of the iran nuclear deal the administration is talking with our european allies about a plan to stay in the deal but to add agreements that would limit iran aposs ballistic missiles sanction regional aggression and end the sunset clause when iran can start to break out and restart its nuclear program in 2025 would president trump accept that stay in the deal if you have those kinds of strengthening add ons bolton well let me start by underlying he has made no decision on the nuclear deal whether to stay in or get out he is certainly considering the framework the four pillars that president macron laid out in their meeting last week the iran nuclear situation now the situation in the future iran aposs ballistic missiles and regional peace and security and that i think is something that aposs of interest to the president and worth pursuing but in terms specifically of a nuclear deal there aposs no decision on that yet wallace but i guess what i aposm asking is does he feel that the deal itself is fatally flawed or does he think that if you address some of the other concerns like ballistic missiles like the sunset clause like their regional actions as a bad actor around the world that he you could fix the deal bolton well the question wallace is it fixable is really a question bolton he certainly said very negative things about the deal which which implied that these other steps wouldn apost really address that concern but look it aposs possible in the discussions with our european allies that we aposll be able to see some possibility there he aposll make the decision when it aposs appropriate to make a decision and that will be up until may 12th wallace finally and we have been colleagues and always gotten along but you know i don apost have to tell you you aposre a controversial figure here in washington and i want to talk briefly about that former secretary of state powell aposs chief of staff said of you publicly he aposs an absolutely brutal manager treats people like dirt since you came in three weeks ago at least four top officials in the national security council have either been pushed out or left how do you plead to the charge doesn apost play well with others and in your new role as you say you aposre not a free actor now you aposre a member of staff are you changing your ways either softening your views or softening the way you conduct business bolton well it aposs also possible that the news media have that wrong and that people who disagreed with me in the past have a certain view of my conduct that i don apost agree with i aposll let others speak to it i have my views i expressed my views i try and manage fairly i have made some changes in the staff of the national security council i think that aposs perfectly appropriate change and continuity are two key elements in any organization and we aposll try going forward to get the right people there but i think much of this mischaracterization was addressed back in my confirmation process for u n ambassador in 2005 i invite all of those interested to read the report of the senate foreign relations committee wallace do you think you get a bad rap bolton i think that aposs almost inherent in washington today we aposve seen even last night at the white house correspondents which i was happy not to attend just reprehensible behavior by somebody addressing the gathering and sadly it aposs par for the course in washington today wallace i have to say i aposm glad i didn apost attend either laughter wallace ambassador bolton thank you thanks for sharing your time with us please come back sir bolton will do wallace up next democratic senator chris coons on the president aposs dramatic foreign policy moves and the senator aposs effort to protect special counsel robert mueller from potentially being fired commercial break wallace as president trump prepares for a summit with kim jong un and negotiates with european leaders about the future of the iran nuclear deal we want to get a different perspective joining us now democratic senator chris coons one of the leading voices on the foreign relations committee and senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen chris coons d del foreign relations committee thanks chris great to be here wallace you have been very critical of president trump for some of his threatening of north korea over the last year or so here you were last summer when the president talked about raining fire and fury on the kim regime begin video clip coons i don apost frankly think blustery rhetoric is what aposs called for at this time we shouldn apost as a superpower make threats we are not fully prepared to follow through on immediately end video clip wallace looking back now was president trump right and were you wrong and did his unconventional style of threats and insults and especially the maximum pressure of his economic sanctions did that get us to the place we are right now where kim is at the table coons well we aposve been here three times before as you know under previous administrations of both parties kim jong un his father his grandfather the regime that rolls north korea has done a two steps forward one step back strategy where they make progress in their nuclear weapons program or missile program and then agree to come to the table and negotiate denuclearization which doesn apost come true i aposll give president trump credit for having helped create this opening through the sanctions regime he aposs helped put together and put in place and i was encouraged by what i heard from ambassador bolton a determination to not lighten up on north korea until there are verifiable and irreversible changes to their nuclear weapons program there aposs going to be a lot of hard work ahead a summit isn apost a strategy but having an upcoming summit with an opening where the supreme leader of north korea has already made a number of encouraging offers i think it aposs a terrific opportunity wallace so i want to pick up on the quite hard line that ambassador bolton just took which in effect was you aposve got to give up everything before we give up anything do you think that aposs practical and do you think that aposs the way to go coons my hunch is we aposre going to have to take several confidence building steps on both sides but for us to back off the sanctions against north korea without a process in place for a verifiable and irreversible change to the nuclear weapons program would be a mistake wallace and what about when kim talks about a denuclearization of the entire peninsula and the possibility that that means that we would keep nukes in the form of either planes or ships off the peninsula is that something you can live with coons that aposs not something that i would embrace but i think there aposs a lot of players here that need to be included and consulted the south korean government the japanese government these are countries that are vital allies of ours in the regions that have been directly threatened by kim jong un as well as the united states but to be clear one of the things kim jong un has been saying recently is that i aposve developed this nuclear weapons capability to defend my country my regime from an aggressive united states i do think we can and should repeat our commitment to not seek regime change as long as they are also making positive steps towards finding an end to the korean conflict restoring relations with south korea and making progress and negotiations with the united states wallace i want to turn to iran because you aposve also criticized president trump for threatening to pull out of the iran nuclear deal but the cause of this threat president macron this week chancellor merkel came to washington to plead with him to make what i was just discussing with john bolton these kinds of side deals on issues the nuclear deal doesn apost cover again is mr trump aposs hard line and in the case of iran is that also working coons i think this is a terrific opportunity for president trump who made his reputation as a builder to build on the iran nuclear deal and to deal with as you just said the areas that were not fully resolved through the iran nuclear deal the ballistic missile program their support for terrorism in the region their terrible human rights record the iranian regime is a dangerous threatening regime and if president trump can successfully lead an effort with our european allies to rein in order or to end their ballistic missiles program to put to change the outcome of the current iranian deal so that there isn apost a sunset clause i think these will be positive things that i would support wallace the president fired back friday at iran aposs threat to pull out of the nuclear deal if these added sanctions these added threats are put on the deal here was president trump aposs response begin video clip donald trump president of the united states they restart their nuclear program they will have bigger problems than they have ever had before they will not be doing nuclear weapons that i can tell you ok they aposre not going to be doing nuclear weapons you can bank on it end video clip wallace given how successful president trump seems to have been with his threats at least so far coons so far wallace so far coons so far wallace do you have any problems with that coons i think making it clear to iran that it continues to be our position that we will not allow them to develop nuclear weapons is completely appropriate iran has threatened both our vital ally israel and our european allies and the united states as has kim jong un of north korea and drawing a clear line that we will not tolerate a nuclear capable iran i think is completely appropriate but it aposs my hope that the president will pursue the wiser path of continuing to get the advantages we are certain currently getting out of the iran nuclear deal don apost take my word for it his own secretary of defense jim mattis has said the same thing the republican chairman of the foreign relations committee has said the same even folks who oppose the iran nuclear deal today see that we get more benefits by staying in it than by tearing it out wallace i aposm just curious because this must be an interesting time for you and a lot of other democrats who aposve been very critical of this president when it comes to foreign policy and at least for now and it aposs a preliminary stage nothing has been decided with kim nothing has happened specifically with iran but it does seem to be working coons if it works i will be the first to cheer on the president because frankly although we are political opponents we have different values and we come out politics and public service in different ways i want the united states to succeed so if president trump aposs strategy succeeds with north korea succeeds with iran that aposs in our country aposs best interest wallace let aposs turn to the special counsel aposs russia investigation you were one of four senators two democrats two republicans who sponsored a bill the senate judiciary committee passed this week by a wide margin to protect the special counsel if president trump were to move to fire him why do you think that aposs necessary coons well i think it aposs necessary because president trump himself keeps tweeting or saying things that suggest he hasn apost fully given up the idea of possibly firing robert mueller he called in to fox friends just last thursday he aposs issued a whole series of tweets saying this is a witch hunt that it aposs an attack on him and on democracy it shouldn apost be allowed to go on and so as long as he is making these threatening statements and as long as it aposs not clear why the republican leadership in both the house and senate who say robert mueller should be left alone should be unmolested should be able to complete his investigation they said they have confidence that president trump won apost fire robert mueller i have no confidence and obviously my colleagues both republican and democrat on the judiciary committee looked at this bill which is an ounce of prevention as my mom used to say will worth a pound of cure they looked at it and said this is a modest and reasonable step to make it just a little bit harder for the president to abruptly and without cause fire robert mueller this would be of the best interest of the country and of the president frankly wallace i want to pick up on that because senate majority leader mitch mcconnell as you point out has said flatly he aposs not going to let the full senate vote on this bill which was approved by the senate judiciary committee this week let aposs take a look at the senator begin video clip sen mitch mcconnell r ky majority leader i aposm the one who decides what we what we take to the floor that aposs my responsibility as the majority leader we aposll not be having this on the floor of the senate end video clip wallace one why do you think mcconnell is refusing to bring up the bill and two is there anything you can do about it coons well folks at this bill would never get a hearing it got a hearing they said they aposd never get a market it got a market they said they aposd never get through the judiciary committee it got through by a bipartisan 14 7 vote as long as president trump continues to say and do things that i aposm sure his attorneys would prefer he didn apost to threaten to take action against the department of justice or robert mueller i think the pressure to bring this to the floor will build if it were put on the floor this coming week i think we aposd get 60 votes for it so frankly it aposs my hope that the majority leader will change his mind wallace and why do you think his mind at this point is no bill no vote coons i think as the majority leader he continues to say it would be disastrous for the president to interfere with the investigation but i have confidence he won apost i don apost know what that confidence is based on this bill would be a responsible small measure to prevent some constitutional crisis frankly i aposll say to the mr president if you aposre mr president saying that you would sign this bill is the single boldest thing you could do to shut up the critics who say there is a risk you might fire robert mueller wallace senator coons thank you thanks for coming in today always good to talk with you sir coons thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss james comey the mueller investigation and another bumpy week for the trump team commercial break wallace coming up the world awaits a summit between president trump and north korea aposs kim jong un begin video clip trump it aposs taken a long time many many decades to get here let aposs see what happens end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if president trump can get kim to give up his nuclear weapons next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip james comey former fbi director i don apost consider what i did with mr richman a leak i told him about an unclassified conversation with the president donald trump president of the united states do you remember jon lovitz ph do you remember the liar well comey aposs worse comey aposs a liar and a leaker end video clip wallace former fbi director james comey and president trump at a campaign style rally last night continuing their war of words over who aposs telling the american people the truth and it aposs time now for our sunday group former trump campaign senior advisor jason miller mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service fox news analyst marie harf and rich lowry of the national review rich as the comey book tour rolls on who do you think is winning the battle for public opinion the former fbi director or president trump rich lowry national review well i think comey aposs obviously winning the battle for book sales but i view this a little bit like the michael wolf phenomenon where he sold books hand over fist but in the course of his book tour his reputation took a dent and i think that aposs true of comey it aposs clear he aposs a wiley ph a manipulative operative and careerist not the worst thing to be in washington and there are a lot of them but it makes the sanctimony really hard to take and this kind of private definition he has of what constitutes leaking that clearly is tailored to explicate him from his own leaking i also really hard to take wallace mo let me pick up your sense of how james comey is doing there were there were two things he said in the interview with bret baier this week one it frankly almost clintonian what aposs a leak and the other is that he claims he didn apost know the democrats had paid for the for the dossier even when he was into 2017 mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service yes i mean i i agree with rich on this i think if he cuomo you agree about elleithee well i agree that his that it aposs raising a lot of questions about him the more this book tour goes on but at the end of the day to your question about public opinion at the if you love donald trump you aposre he aposs going to be winning the the war of public opinion here if you hate donald trump comey is probably winning the war in here cuomo so no minds are changed elleithee so i don apost think anyone aposs mind is getting change and more importantly bob mueller aposs investigation goes on undeterred wallace well i want to pick up on that with you because the president once again made it clear this week that his patients with the mueller investigation is running out take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i aposm very disappointed in my justice department but because of the fact that it aposs going on and i think you aposll understand this i have decided that i won apost be involved i may change my mind at some point because what aposs going on is a disgrace it aposs an absolute disgrace end video clip wallace at this point do you think the president may still pull the plug on the mueller investigation or do you think that the real likelihood of that is receding elleithee i don apost know all right and that aposs the problem here is that we don apost know he aposs given no real indication that everyone should just feel confident that it aposs going to continue but you know i i would hope that he takes the advice of the democrats and the republicans on the hill that he should keep his hands off and just let this thing play out and if he if he has nothing to worry about he should want it to play out wallace jason it certainly isn apost helpful for the president to say well i may change my mind jason miller former trump campaign senior adviser well i think this investigation is imploding under the weight of there being absolutely nothing there i mean the fact that we aposre a year and a half wallace well well wait we don apost know that miller well there nothing has been proven we aposre over a year and a half into this thing and there aposs absolutely nothing wallace we don apost we don apost know miller but nothing in washington wallace jason miller chris in washington wallace we don apost miller where everything is wallace i aposm talking about the mueller investigation miller right wallace we have no idea what he aposs finding miller but there is if wallace i aposm not saying that he aposs finding anything but we don apost know the miller if there would have been something on collusion that would have leaked out that would have gotten out so long ago there is nothing to inaudible wallace so wait wait so you aposre now saying because there isn apost a leak i mean i thought you condemned leaks miller no a leak is terrible wallace which is it are leaks good or bad miller no leaks are terrible but you know that the if there was a way to hurt president trump it would have leaked out and that would have been out there there aposs been no evidence after a year and a half plus of searching of any collusion there aposs been nothing that aposs been proven to that point comey has gone from the quintessential g man ph to basically just another political hack i mean this is very clearly a politically driven operation wallace i aposm talk about mueller now not comey miller right and so far there aposs been nothing untoward about the president or his activity or anything that has been put forward so i think that most of the people around the country are taking a look at this and saying you know what the president aposs probably right this is a witch hunt and it needs to get wrapped up wallace so if there aposs nothing that aposs been found why not let mueller finish his investigation miller well and i think ultimately that aposs what will happen i think that the legal team that the president has now assembled with rudy giuliani and also with marty and jane raskin i think is a very good team and i think the advice that they aposre going to give him is smart and i that he should listen to them and i think hopefully this will be wrapped up soon wallace all right i want to continue with you because we had a troubling case this week of admiral ronny jackson the president aposs personal doctor who dropped out as the nominee to lead the department of veterans affairs after a volley of allegations from democratic senator jon tester take a look begin video clip jon tester d montana senator getting to the bottom of these accusations is critically important and there should be no there should be no stone unturned donald trump president of the united states tester started throwing out things that he aposs heard well i know things about tester that i could say too and if i said them he aposd never be elected again end video clip wallace jason not only were none of the allegations verified but perhaps the most explosive one that tester raised that jackson had gotten drunk at a secret service going away party and had crashed his car was specifically denied will republicans now go after tester who aposs up for re election this year miller absolutely and i think a lot of republican strategist that you talked to a week or so ago probably would have said that tester is one of the strongest of the so called vulnerable democrats that are up but i think there aposs going to be a newfound focus put on him but what senator tester did with making those personal attacks against ronny jackson who by all accounts is a very honorable person i think really was very despicable i think that senator tester will be in the crosshairs now for this election and really this is what happens in the swamp if it can apost be on the merits they go to the personal attacks wallace marie what struck me about this case is that there was plenty of of smoke about admiral jackson a lot of it supplied by jon tester but no fire at all there were there was not a single verified allegation and yet he still was forced out marie harf former state department spokesperson here aposs the challenge over 20 current and former service members came to jon tester as a senator and said these are our concerns you aposre right jon tester had not verified them but these weren apost his allegations these were people who served with ronny jackson he senator tester worked with the republican committee chair to postpone the hearing because the republicans were so concerned about the severity of these and i take it back to the way ronny jackson was announced if the white house had gone through a vetting process like most white houses do some of these if not all would have surfaced they would have been able to run them down if in fact they aposre not true and they would have been able to head off these allegations instead of pulling the nomination back at a time when they really need a head of the va so tester was put in a tough position these weren apost his allegations people came to him with them and as a senator it aposs his duty to bring them forward he has voted for every one of trump aposs va nominees the president has signed eight bills that jon tester has put forward on the va this is a guy who aposs fought for veterans lowry but you don apost you don apost bring them forward without doing any real due diligence on them sure check them out harf so what should he have done lowry he shouldn apost have aired unverified allegations he should have done some investigation he should have checked in with the secret service that aposs now batted down some of these more lurid allegations and look i think jackson should have been duty bound to defend himself if these allegations were untrue and a number of them seem to be but i think the problem with the nomination it was on such tenuous ground to begin with harf right lowry just the slightest little additional weight on the scale harf right lowry made it indefensible wallace all right panel i aposm glad we settled that we have to take a break here up next more on the president aposs moves this week on north korea and iran plus what would you like to ask the panel about the risks and rewards of a trump kim summit just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip kim jong un north korea leader we will make sure that the agreement we have reached which the people of the korean peninsula and the world are watching does not fulfill the unfortunate history of unfulfilled promises trump one of the fake news groups this morning they were saying what do you think president trump had to do with it i aposll tell you what like how about everything end video clip wallace i think he was probably funnier than the comedian at the white house correspondents dinner north korean leader kim jong un pledging this time agreements he makes with south korean leaders won apost fall apart and president trump taking credit for bringing kim to the table and we aposre back now with the panel well we asked you for questions for the panel and ever since we got this one i have been excited about asking marie harf harf i know wallace spokeswoman for the john kerry state department the question we got on facebook from mark bellman who asks will trump win the nobel peace prize if he successfully negotiates the denuclearization of north korea if not why not i should point out at that rally last night people were chanting nobel nobel marie how do you answer mark harf i have no idea but this isn apost about donald trump at the end of the day the u s plays a key role but this is really about north and south korea and you aposve seen with a new south korean president the south koreans really step up and take the initiative you know this isn apost about taking victory laps and i know that at a campaign rally it can seem like the thing to chant although i aposve never heard that at a campaign rally before in my or campaign style rally in my life but we aposll see what happens here this is not all about the u s and we need to remain tempered in our expectations about what will come out of this wallace i understand all of that but you aposre you aposre really not going to give donald trump credit for the fact that kim under pressure under military pressure under economic pressure has come to the table harf i will yes i will absolutely give the administration credit for ramping up the pressure and for getting us to where we are today and for being willing to sit down and talk and invest in diplomacy absolutely but we also have to remember the north koreans have before agreed to denuclearize they have agreed to end the korean war and every time those things have been agreed to they have fallen apart so we have to be very prudent as we go into these talks about not giving up too much not letting the pressure up because we aposve heard this game before and it aposs never ended the way we want it wallace jason i understand that there is some warranted i told you so aposs from trump supporters like yourself as kim comes to the negotiating table but is there a danger and i i pointed out to ambassador bolton the korean war is ended is there a danger of trump getting swept up in summit hype miller well i think the comments that you aposve seen from the president have been pretty clear eyed about this about recognizing that we still have a long ways to go but to answer the question that marie danced around a little bit i would go to give president trump a nobel peace prize i aposm sure that comes as a total shock to everybody wallace i was going to say you aposre on the nobel peace prize committee harf yes miller well it someone aposs got to start the ball rolling and so i aposll go harf and you aposre going to take that this morning miller get yes i aposll help the president out here this morning but i think based on what we aposve already seen so far with the steps that they aposve taken towards ending the war i mean even moving into the same time zone these might seem like small things to us but these are pretty big and also as we saw this morning from ambassador bolton with his comments that the u s isn apost going to just you know listen to the lip service that we are going to make sure that concrete steps are taken so i think the administration is taking a very strong approach on this but let aposs be clear about the bigger thing going that aposs going on here is what president trump has done is he has proven wrong all of the foreign policy so called experts who wanted hillary clinton to win who they have basically have gotten us into all these foreign policy messes if we had taken these strong approaches with regards to economic sanctions with regards to military threats and being tough and we started doing that back during clinton we wouldn apost have been in this mess in the first place wallace all right let aposs turn to iran because again you have to say that president trump seems to be bending the world to his will here here is french president macron this week addressing congress on the need to toughen the iran nuclear deal begin video clip emmanuel macron president of france it is true to say that this agreement may not address all concerns and very important concerns this is true end video clip wallace mo that aposs what president trump has been saying all along and this week both macron and merkel seem to agree with him that yes the standing by itself the iran deal is not enough and that you need some strengthening provisions elleithee i don apost and marie can correct me if i aposm wrong i can apost remember anyone every saying that the iran deal was perfect i think a lot of people even in the obama administration said yes this thing isn apost exactly where it needs to be but this is an important step forward and that anyone would be open to it being strengthened what you see now are american allies like french wallace then why didn apost the excuse me why didn apost the u s kerry and obama strengthen it in their remaining time in office elleithee well i think they went about as far as they could go at the time and and now you see our allies like france and germany really worried that the united states is going to pull out begging for us to try to you know stay in it and if it if we don apost talking about trying to figure out some some new deal without us and this is what worries me about the trump administration aposs foreign policy is that time and time again whether we aposre talking about trade or whether we aposre talking about the iran deal we are leaving our allies out there to have to figure out how to move forward in the world without us and that that worries me lowry i think trump has moved very usefully beyond the obama legacy so the obama position basically oh we can apost enforce the red line it aposs too complicated it aposs too hard well it wasn apost we need a policy of strategic patients which was obama aposs policy with north korea which basically means waiting around for the north koreans to develop a nuclear tipped icbm that can threaten the continental united states and trump aposs like no i aposm not going to accept that i aposm going to try to shake something loose and now with iran this deal was a boon to the iranians it gave them enormous economic benefits they aposve spread their influence even further in the middle east to the the border of israel where you have ongoing conflict now and a lot of the nuclear provisions will expire in ten years that aposs a wonderful deal for the iranians it aposs not a good deal for us and i think he aposs right to try to shake something else loose there as well wallace marie as someone who was involved in the negotiations under secretary kerry with iran i mean the president is pointing out a lot of things that he says were wrong was wrong with the deal that your secretary negotiated that we gave them all the benefits upfront that that we didn apost control their bad acting in the world we didn apost control their ballistic missile program there was this sunset clause he aposs basically saying you made a bad deal and he aposs fixing it harf well he aposs not fixing it he aposs threatening to blow it up without something to replace it with and so wallace no that aposs not well that aposs not harf well wallace well wait a minute that aposs not true harf he has some principles wallace he aposs he aposs at least talking about adding these provisions we aposre not sure what he aposs going to do by may 12th harf exactly he has some principles but look on the nuclear side we did not give them all the benefits upfront with their nuclear program today under the transparency monitoring and verification with what they have they cannot make a nuclear weapon if you aposre concerned about sunset if you aposre concerned about 10 years 15 years 20 years fine i aposll take that as a as a as a criticism work to make it longer don apost make it shorter by pulling out of it now so i actually think macron was very smart this week in saying the nuclear deal was very good in a lot of ways let aposs not just throw that out let aposs work to strengthen the other pieces of it lowry but the point is the point is he would not be as motivated to try to do that if trump wasn apost pressuring and threatening to pull out of the deal harf sure but there aposs a fine line between pressure and being irresponsible and if we aposll see what happens on may 12th because if donald trump walks away from this deal and we lose all of the transparency and monitoring and verification if the iranians go back to enriching uranium that will be on president trump and i think if you aposre going wallace all right but let me all right but harf if you aposre going to pull out of something you have to replace it with something better wallace but you harf and we don apost have that wallace you presented one possibility which is that he pulls out of the deal what if he agrees with the europeans and they do add these toughening sanctions solving what a lot of people think were holes in the original deal that john kerry negotiated what then harf great great i would absolutely support it if we can get the iranians to agree to longer timelines from the 10 15 20 25 wallace well well wait no no they aposre not talking about asking the iranians to agree to it we aposre saying at least that aposs what no that aposs what the europeans harf right wallace and and president trump are saying this isn apost a treaty and that the europeans and the u s can unilaterally say you do this we aposll impose sanctions you do this we aposll impose sanctions harf so that aposs not how diplomacy works when you aposre negotiating both sides have to agree to a tough decision and and look the europeans rightly agree with us that we want to address ballistic missiles let aposs do that in a separate agreement the the joint comprehensive plan of action that addressed the nuclear programs has a lot of stuff in it that nonproliferation experts agree is good it aposs not perfect but why would discard all of that lowry but it constrains wallace go ahead go ahead rich lowry but it constrains our ability to sanction iranians for other behavior and part harf not true that aposs not true rich lowry and part of the strategic point of this harf that aposs not true lowry and the salesmanship was that it would moderate iranian behavior harf also not true lowry if anything iran behavior has become more extreme miller right they aposre harf that aposs not that aposs not true that was never our argument our argument was actually this deal is more necessary if the iranian regime doesn apost change lowry iran is funding hezbollah iran is funding hamas harf yes miller this is doing absolutely nothing to stop them from developing their nuclear weapons program it aposs slowing them down a little bit but their iran aposs goal is the full destruction of israel that is that is the full goal here and i think that if we if the only thing that we aposre trying to do is slow them down a little bit on their nuclear capabilities and i think we aposre completely shortsighted here you have to look at this from what aposs been done ph wallace all right i i i know you aposre dying to answer we will have this conversation during the commercial thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week what aposs behind the thinking at one of washington aposs most powerful think tanks commercial break wallace as republicans and democrats clash over ideas both sides are supported by private organizations that supply data and research in this intellectual arms race there is no bigger figure than our power player of the week begin videotape kay coles james president the heritage foundation operating in this town it aposs more about people and people aposs lives and it aposs not simply about policy and babbles ph and fighting ideological wars wallace voice over kay coles james is talking about the real life consequences of policy struggles in washington and her role since january as president of the heritage foundation one of d c aposs top think tanks james the guiding mission of this institution is to be that true north for the conservative movement wallace founded in 1973 heritage has been on the cutting edge of conservative thought and republican policy wallace on camera has heritage struggled to find a role in donald trump aposs washington james absolutely not there is no struggle one of the things that i love about being the president of the heritage foundation is i don apost have to navigate i just have to stand donald trump president of the united states great for the american people thank you well wallace voice over heritage played a big role in the tax cut bill the president signed last year but they don apost always get their way wallace on camera president trump has been embracing tariffs that aposs hardly a conservative idea james i would agree wallace voice over james grew up in public housing in southern virginia her mom was on welfare james my definition of a conservative is someone who has the audacity to believe what their grandmother taught them wallace on camera such as james not relying on government or anyone else by the way to clear the path for you wallace voice over she was in junior high in the early apos60s when she was chosen to help integrate her school james we had to walk past dogs and angry parents and shouting people and it was a very traumatic period and i aposve been a fighter all my life wallace james served in republican administrations from reagan to bush father and son she was on the trump transition team but says she was blocked from working for him james i don apost like keeping the omarosa story alive but i am told that she and you know the chief of staff priebus at the time just didn apost think it was a good idea wallace but james has done just fine running a think tank with almost 300 staffers and a budget of 70 million besides policy she says her role now is to grow the conservative movement james you don apost have to be painted with an angry white male image wallace but does she think it aposs just image that has led african americans to give republicans between 4 percent and 8 percent of their votes in the last three presidential elections james the first thing you do with any republican candidate any candidate is find whatever evidence you can big or small and paint them as a racist wallace and james intends to change people aposs perceptions james it aposs important to reach out to women it aposs important to reach out to minority groups w
