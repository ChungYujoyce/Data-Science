events he was expected to attend top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time a popular rumor circulating in china on the internet is that mr xi was in a swimming accident that injured his back but lack of confirmation from any reliable or official sources has gone heightened speculation online an increasingly viral version says that mr xi along with he guoqiang the communist party s internal disciplinary chief were targets of an elaborate assassination plot involving choreographed car accidents that they barely survived the plot is rumored to have happened around sept 1 the date of mr xi s last public appearance xi jinping is positioned at the center of the most intense power struggle in china in the last three decades unlike two previous predecessors jiang zemin and mr hu whose designations by party elders as heirs apparent were never seriously challenged mr xi met with unusually strong opposition from within the ranks of the ruling politburo it was widely reported and partially confirmed that a group of powerful and highly energetic detractors of mr xi led by the now purged politburo member bo xilai are challenging mr xi s qualifications to be china s next leader the challenge from mr bo rocked the party s establishment in march and led to mr bo s downfall after the attempted defection to a u s consulate by his police chief in the city of chongqing where mr bo
