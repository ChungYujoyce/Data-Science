apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion president trump s recent executive order establishment of the united states space force represents a major positive turn in u s national security policy in many ways this new order is as significant as was president reagan s famous march 23 1983 star wars speech leading to his strategic defense initiative sdi that got the attention of the russians and was cited by many as a basic reason for ending the cold war section 1 importantly states the department of defense shall take actions to marshal its space resources to deter and counter threats in space section 3 elaborates the united states space force should enable prompt and sustained offensive and defensive space operations and now at issue framing programmatic and policy actions to protect us from the 1 almost daily new nuclear threats coming from russia s president putin and his generals e g hypersonic threats and 2 blatant russian violations of key nuclear arms control treaties top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens so how do we best implement the president s new space force executive order from both policy and systems viewpoints in this context we recall with a strong sense of deja vu the valuable lessons from the 1970s and 1980s the 70s brought us the 1972 anti ballistic missile abm treaty and strategic arms limitation talks salt agreements and associated soviet violations like in this past decade agreed limits only legitimized major increases in the soviet nuclear threat soviet intercontinental range ballistic missiles icbms got bigger and bigger and carried more and more nuclear warheads referred to as multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles mirvs president reagan changed the name of the game he sought reductions instead of limits and charged his strategic arms reduction talks start negotiators to reduce nuclear arms meanwhile the soviets were deploying ss 20 intermediate range ballistic missiles irbms threatening nato and all of western europe so mr reagan built our own intermediate range nuclear force inf systems pershing ii irbms and ground launched cruise missiles glcms and in october 1983 began deploying them in five west european nations with the full support from our nato allies the soviets immediately walked out of all ongoing arms control negotiations and launched an unsuccessful global propaganda campaign echoed by the arms control community seeking to defeat president reagan and leaders of all the nato inf deployment nations all were re elected in 1984 highly publicized sdi efforts had begun demonstrating technology to defeat the growing soviet icbm and inf threat president reagan sought cooperative measures to overturn the mutual assured destruction mad policies that underpinned cold war realities he poignantly asked wouldn t it be better to save lives than to avenge them after their failed propaganda campaign these conditions led the soviets in march 1985 to join the new nuclear and space talks nst which restored the start and inf negotiations and initiated the defense and space talks dst focused on president reagan s vision for truly effective strategic defenses especially those based in space while the soviets emphasized that sdi would undermine strategic stability and lead to an arms race in space many believed their concerns about sdi brought them back to the negotiating table then sdio director usaf lt gen james a abrahamson visited us in geneva and elaborated anticipated advances with the soviets he strengthened our case against soviet arguments that sdi would precipitate a destabilizing arms race in space this because our technological edge clearly would assure our ability to cost effectively counter anticipated soviet advances perhaps the most important lesson was that sdi planned space based defenses could intercept soviet ballistic missiles in their boost phase as they rise from their launch pads while their rockets still burn and before they could release offensive countermeasures this capability would neutralize soviet large mirved icbms motivating an eventual agreement to eliminate such systems at least for a time our case was reinforced by a widely publicized september 1986 proof of principle experiment delta 180 demonstrated in space that then existing technology could intercept ballistic missiles in their boost phase long seen as the most effective defense against likely offensive countermeasures notably current defense undersecretary for research and engineering michael griffin was key in designing and conducting delta 180 and subsequent sdi experiments in space extending those lessons over 30 years ago l essons he surely recalls a month after delta 180 president reagan demonstrated his sdi commitment by walking out of the reykjavik summit when soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev demanded that sdi limit its research on space based systems to the laboratory which would have gutted the most important sdi advancements nevertheless mr reagan pocketed mr gorbachev s concessions that formed the substance of future inf and start treaties major reductions in offensive nuclear forces and eventual elimination of highly mirved icbms however when these treaties expired we had not built the space based defenses that could shoot down highly mirved icbms and guess what the russians have again built large highly mirved icbms that again threaten us and we are again and just as in the early 1980s recovering from a hollowing out of our military capabilities deja vu again we should also go back to the future to build with today s even more advanced and less expensive technology advanced by the private sector the space based interceptors pursued 30 years ago before former defense secretary les aspin took the stars out of star wars in 1993 president trump s visionary new space policy directive is exactly the propellant this critical work needs henry f cooper former director of the strategic defense initiative organization and daniel j gallington served in a series of senior national security related positions including the nuclear and space talks with the sov
