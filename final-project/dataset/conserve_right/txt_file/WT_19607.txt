ld be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion any impeachment proceeding even one as flimsy as the one being pushed against president trump is the greatest possible distraction from his responsibilities mr trump s inability to ignore even the slightest insult will multiply that effect a hundredfold his responses lashing out on twitter as they already are in 1998 99 when america last endured an impeachment drama the world was a relatively calm place two decades later the dangers to our nation are more serious and immediate they will despite the president s inevitable focus on impeachment demand his attention russia china iran and north korea among others are preparing to interfere in our 2020 election to their greatest ability house democrats have passed a bill that they claim would prevent such interference but in fact would do essentially nothing congressional republicans need a lot of guidance and pressure from the president to do more top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the war in afghanistan is now in its 19th year american troops as well as those from some remaining coalition nations are still being killed there is no prospect of even a cease fire agreement with the taliban far less a settlement by which they will abide the sept 14 attack against major saudi arabian oil facilities were perpetrated by iran secretary of state mike pompeo said flatly that the drones and cruise missiles were not launched from yemen the attacks are believed to have been launched from western iran by iranian revolutionary guard corps troops or hezbollah terrorists iran s proxy or both in cooperation saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman has said that a war between his nation and iran would cause the world s economy to collapse his overly dramatic statement illustrates the saudis near panic after the iranian attack mr trump has dispatched more troops to saudi arabia along with a patriot missile battery to add to their defenses is he prepared to fight to defend saudi arabia although mr trump s economic sanctions have crippled the iranian economy those sanctions haven t deterred iran s military aggression as the september attacks on saudi arabia demonstrate economic sanctions are no longer enough stronger measures are required will the president choose a kinetic response unfortunately our principal nato allies britain france and germany while blaming iran for the september attacks are still doing everything else they can to appease iran they are trying to get mr trump to agree to another nuclear weapons deal like the one former president obama made in 2015 mr trump has a lot of work to do with those nations to bring them back to reality those concerns are enough to keep any president in the oval office burning the midnight oil but they are only at the top of the pile russia s proxy war in eastern ukraine goes on will the ukraine related impeachment charges deter mr trump from acting effectively against russia russia is also militarizing the arctic from its base in franz josef land above the arctic circle and is creating weapons whose sole purpose is to work effectively in sub zero temperatures china too is asserting itself in the arctic we have done virtually nothing only a few cold weather exercises of troops to meet these new challenges and that s the least china is doing chinese debt trap diplomacy conducted through its belt and road initiative is rapidly turning independent nations into tributary states in

chinese will then control its militarization of the south china sea continues at a fast pace threatening u s allies such as japan china s cyberwar against the united states goes on unabated mr trump is trying to negotiate a trade deal with china that would at least slow its theft of u s secrets both commercial and military but despite the threat of u s tariffs china is unlikely to agree to such terms or abide by any such agreement north korea s kim jong un despite two meetings with the president and mr trump s proclamation of mutual love has not agreed to disarm his missiles and nuclear weapons and never will north korea continues to fire missiles while rumors are circulating about another trump kim summit israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu s re election after the second israeli election this year still hinges on his ability to form a national unity government with his rivals continued instability in israel s government may incent iran into ordering hezbollah to launch another war against israel at any time there are too many other emerging threats to recite here mr trump has a good team around him and he will inevitably delegate much to them during the impeachment but he remains in the words of former president george w bush the decider only he can decide which actions we will take to answer the litany of international threats and decide he must by
