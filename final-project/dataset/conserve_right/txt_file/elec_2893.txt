email scandal picked up steam sunday as the lead republican investigator on benghazi said there are huge gaps between emails received so far from her private server and even a top senate democrat urged mrs clinton to be more forthcoming sen dianne feinstein california democrat said that mrs clinton the former secretary of state and early favorite for the 2016 democratic presidential nomination needs to speak out because from this point on the silence is going to hurt her actually what i would like is for her to come forward and say just what the situation is because she is the pre eminent political figure right now mrs feinstein said on nbc s meet the press she is the leading candidate whether it be republican or democrat to be the next president and i think that she needs to step up and come out and state exactly what the situation is see also hillary s watergate rep trey gowdy the south carolina republican who heads the house select committee on benghazi said the panel received 800 pages containing 300 of mrs clinton s emails from the state department in december but that there are huge gaps between some of the emails there are gaps of months and months and months mr gowdy said on face the nation on cbs if you think back to that iconic picture of her on a c 17 flying to libya she has sunglasses on and she has her hand held device in her hand we have no emails from that day and we have no emails from that trip given that the panel has issued multiple subpoenas for records related to libya and the attack on the benghazi diplomatic post in 2012 it strains credibility to believe that if you re on your way to libya to discuss libyan policy that there s not a single document that s been turned over to congress he said mr gowdy issued subpoenas last week to mrs clinton for her communications regarding libya as well as letters to internet companies informing them that they are obligated under the subpoenas to preserve the emails the uproar surrounding her email account could not come at a worse time for mrs clinton who is expected to announce a presidential candidacy in the next month or so the controversy which was discussed on every major sunday news show has also resuscitated the benghazi issue seen as the low point of her tenure at the state department democrats have characterized the subpoenas as a politically motivated effort to damage mrs clinton s image as she prepared for a presidential run noting that she has already turned over 55 000 pages of emails from her commercial account to the state department for vetting w hat s not appropriate is for a taxpayer funded investigative committee which is what we are to be using our power our subpoena or tax dollars to become an arm of the republican national committee and that s what happened this week and that is deeply disturbing said adam b schiff california democrat who sits on the benghazi committee on cnn s state of the union democrats also stressed that mrs clinton broke no laws in using her personal server for official business and that she turned over the emails late last year at the request of the state department which made the same request to other former secretaries mr schiff said the committee already has the relevant emails they republicans issued a subpoena for records we already have he said republicans have repeatedly cited a lack of transparency in the process they emphasized that nobody knows whether mrs clinton has turned in all business related emails from her private account nor does anyone know who on her staff was in charge of screening the emails and deciding which to forward rep darrell e issa california republican said the latest subpoena was necessary because voluntary cooperation does not guarantee that it s a crime not to deliver all a subpoena which trey gowdy issued is so that in fact it will be a crime if she knowingly withholds documents pursuant to the subpoena mr issa said he needed to do that because she wasn t forthcoming 21 2 years ago she in fact hid the very existence of this until she was caught mr issa also noted that her private emails would not have been produced under the numerous freedom of information act requests filed in the years since the benghazi attack t here is a big difference between being open transparent honest and having public integrity and only when you get caught do you turn in documents mr issa said we only have the documents she gave us that s not the basis normally an inspector general searches through all documents to find which ones are appropriate you don t necessarily ask the person to self disclose the email controversy has also opened up the state department to charges of a double standard regarding former u s ambassador to kenya scott gration who was fired by department of state chief of staff cheryl mills after a scathing inspector general s report listed numerous problems including his use of a private email secretary clinton and cheryl mills were in very close dialogue on all issues and i know that in my view she would have known that secretary clinton was not using the open net mr gration said on cnn s state of the union so i do find it sort of unusual that she stated that this was one of the reasons why i had to move on and as i look back it seems a bit unfair mr gowdy added that he has lost confidence in the state department s ability to decide which emails to release they re the ones who allowed this arrangement they re the ones who did nothing about this arrangement until they had a request from our committee mr gowdy said adding we re not entitled to everything i don t want everything i just want everything related to libya and benghazi president obama said in an interview saturday with cbs that he learned of the private email server in news accounts and that i m glad that hillary s instructed that those emails about official business need to be disclosed mr gowdy responded that with respect to the president it s not up to secretary clinton to decide what s a public record and what s not sen charles e schumer new york democrat said sunday that mrs clinton has complied with the law by preserving the emails and that no one has alleged that any have been deleted the fact that she had so many of them the fact that she turned them over by the way before any of this became public i think in october the state department asked all secretaries of state to send their emails over and she s the only one who has done it i think gainsays any of that mr schumer said on face the nation on cbs mrs clinton said wednesday in a post on twitter i want the public to see my email i asked state to release them they said they will review them for release as soon as possible perhaps the most astonishing disclosure sunday came from sen lindsey graham south carolina republican who said he has never used email i don t email mr graham said on nbc s meet the press no you can have every email i ve ever sent i ve never sent one copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy policy manage newsletters
