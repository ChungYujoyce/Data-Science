there s no denying democrats are still upset about donald trump s defeat of hillary clinton in the 2016 election but some have taken things to a new low coming up with scenarios under which clinton could still become commander in chief scenarios that will never come to fruition take for example an article that ran in newsweek monday titled how hillary clinton still can and should become president after the trump russia investigation the author puts forward an argument made by a harvard university professor that includes house speaker paul ryan handing the white house keys to clinton here s the argument if number 1 iftrump is definitively found to have colluded directly with russia he would be forced to resign or be impeached if number 2 if trump is removed vice president mike pence would become president if number 3 if pence becomes president he should resigntoo given that he benefited from the same help from mother russia if number 4 if pence resigns before appointing a vice president ryan would become president if number 5 if ryan becomes president he should do the right thing and choose clinton for vice president then he should resign newsweek the answer seems unavoidable he should nominate the person defeated by the treason of his own party and then step aside and let her become the president the harvard professor argues without doubt if ryan did the right thing that would be the most extraordinary event in the history of america since the confederate army fired on fort sumter but unlike that this event would build the union not divide it the only saving grace is that the author starts out the article basically acknowledging the argument is nothing but a pipe dream sure it s been more than 340 days since donald trump beat hillary clinton but there s still one very narrow highly unlikely and entirely unprecedented way that clinton could become president as ridiculous as these types of stories are it s not quite as bad as the website that lets visitors imagine what it d be like if clinton had won alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
