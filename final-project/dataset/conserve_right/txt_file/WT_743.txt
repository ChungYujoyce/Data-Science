name calling over responsibility for the spread of the novel coronavirus the global pandemic is just one in a series of irritants that has rocked the relationship between washington and beijing since the trump administration began to step up long simmering confrontations on issues ranging from territory to trade to high tech telecommunications the virus however has exposed an even deeper rift one that widened yet again on tuesday when china announced the expulsion of several american journalists the move underscored the growing mutual mistrust and hostility between the world s two largest economies top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century since the virus has spread president donald trump and his top aides including secretary of state mike pompeo have increasingly criticized china noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the chinese city of wuhan in late 2019 they have also referred to the virus as the wuhan virus or the chinese virus disregarding world health organization terminology that avoids identifying it by geography on wednesday trump again defended linking the virus to china just hours after repeatedly calling the virus the chinese virus on twitter it s not racist at all no not at all it comes from china trump told reporters that s why it comes from china i want to be accurate at a state department news conference on tuesday pompeo called the virus the wuhan virus six times and suggested the chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response by highlighting its tough measures that have helped contain the outbreak pompeo also suggested that an after action report would corroborate his claim indicating that the tensions are unlikely to end when the pandemic is over experts are not unsympathetic to that position they made some blunderous mistakes in the early six or seven weeks and then they came down hard with a gargantuan quarantine said j stephen morrison director of the global health policy center at the center for strategic and international studies referring to china now he said in a conference call with reporters china is suppressing whatever additional dissident thoughts there may be on exactly what s going on in a meeting tuesday with hotel executives at the white house trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in china asking pointed questions of marriott ceo arne sorenson about where the impact was first felt and this all started in china that s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit trump asked absolutely sorenson replied hopefully you all heard that trump told reporters pompeo has led a worldwide campaign to try to stop countries from allowing the chinese high tech giant huawei to get access to next generation wireless networks and repeatedly warned about the dangers of chinese investment on tuesday he suggested china had failed to alert the world quickly enough when it discovered the virus outbreak we know that the first government to be aware of the wuhan virus was the chinese government pompeo told reporters that imposes a special responsibility to raise the flag to say we have a problem this is different and unique and present risks and it took an awful long time for the world to become aware of this risk that was sitting there residing inside of china having already been targeted by trump in a trade war and by pompeo and others for repression of muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in western xinjiang province the chinese have taken particular offense to the constant linking of the virus to china complaining vociferously and suggesting that the u s military may have actually introduced the virus to wuhan recently some american politicians have linked the new coronavirus with china to stigmatize china we express strong indignation and opposition to it foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said tuesday we urge the u s to immediately correct its mistakes and stop unwarranted accusations against china that in turn has prompted angry protests from the u s the disinformation campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility pompeo said before quickly adding that now is not the time for recriminations yet recriminations seem to be the order of the day china was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to them trump said tuesday that was false and rather than having an argument i said i have to call it where it came from it did come from china so i think it s a very accurate term but no i didn t appreciate the fact that china was saying that our military gave it to them shortly after trump s comments the chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of american reporters from the new york times wall street journal and washington post china said the move was a reciprocal response to the trump administration s designation of five chinese media outlets as foreign missions and restricting the number of chinese who could work for them pompeo said he hoped china would reconsider i regret china s decision today to further foreclose the world s ability to conduct free press
