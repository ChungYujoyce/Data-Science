apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china s intelligence services are among the most aggressive at spying on the united states followed by cuban russian and iranian spy agencies according to the u s government s top counterintelligence coordinator these services are eating our lunch joel f brenner the new head of the office of the national counterintelligence executive said in his first interview since being named to the counterspy post in august mr brenner a former inspector general at the national security agency told the washington times that the u s remains the no 1 target of virtually every significant espionage service on the face of the earth top stories ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches china s intelligence activities have been very aggressive at acquiring u s advanced technology often before it is fully developed here the technology bleed to china among others is a very serious problem he said noting that the fbi is improving its efforts to identify and protect sensitive technology beijing also succeeded in penetrating and thus frustrating u s intelligence against china through katrina leung a los angeles businesswoman who was a long time fbi informant secretly loyal to beijing mr brenner said mr brenner s office known as ncix is working on a new presidential strategy for counterintelligence the goal of the office is to provide strategic direction aimed at bolstering counterintelligence agencies including the fbi cia and pentagon counterspy units another key priority is using counterintelligence techniques such as turning foreign agents or recruiting supporters against terrorist groups hezbollah or al qaeda don t do a terrorist operation without doing an intelligence operation first mr brenner said they are very thorough and capable in the way they do their advance surveillance and reconnoitering we ve got to get better at that aspect of supporting counterterrorism and that is one of our core missions here in this office additionally the ncix is pressing counterspies to do more to stop computer based intelligence gathering something he called a growing threat you can now from the comfort of your own home or office exfiltrate information electronically from somebody else s computer around the world without the expense and risk of trying to grow a spy mr brenner said we ve got to start addressing that in a big way he said network vulnerability is a huge issue and it s an issue in the private as well as a public sector mr brenner also said he is trying to recruit more capable people to join counterintelligence services you can t leave counterintelligence to the fanatics and paranoiacs he said we really need our best people and so training and education and supporting national security studies is something we re paying a lot of attention to he also plans to speed up damage assessments or lessons learned after spy cases and to conduct aggressive follow up to make sure recommended changes are implemented currently the ncix is conducting a damage assessment of the leung spy case examining how leung secretly spied for china by sexually entrapping two of the fbi s most senior counterspies fbi agents james j smith and bill cleveland the leung case was a very serious espionage case mr brenner said a view that contrasts with that of fbi officials who have sought to play down the spy case saying it was mainly about improper sexual relations between the fbi informant and her handlers leung through her lawyers has denied spying for china mr brenner said china however was in fact running leung as their agent that was an intelligence operation and it was a very successful intelligence operation he said it was a classic honey trap spy jargon for sexual entrapment leung was initially charged in 2003 with spying for china but the charges were dropped and she eventually pleaded guilty in 2005 to minor charges making false statements and filing a false tax return smith also pleaded guilty to lying to investigators in addition to china cuba s intelligence services continue to pose a major intelligence threat as do spies from russia and iran mr brenner said noting that cuban intelligence remains a a very professional service they were trained by the kgb and now they re training the venezuelans he said russia s intelligence service remains very aggressive against the united states and the iranians also have a mature and capable service he said all are running significant operations against us overall the problem of stopping foreign spies is daunting both due to the number of spies and as a result of problems among u s agencies charged with stopping them namely the fbi domestically and the cia overseas mr brenner said he is trying to reform counterintelligence as the mission manager within the office of the director of national intelligence various counterspy agencies from the defense department to the fbi and cia have regarded counterintelligence as an intramural sport we re trying to turn the counterintelligence community into a community in reality as well as in name he said americans are going to wake up one day and realize that the place in the world we have come to take for granted isn t ours by some god given right
