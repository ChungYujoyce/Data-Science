credentials donald trump as in past debates sparred sharply with his rivals on stage over his controversial proposals notably his call to ban muslims from entering the country but the changing dynamics in the race appeared to drive frequent clashes between the senators from texas and florida who are now battling to be the trump alternative in the race as ben carson slides in the polls with the terror attacks in paris and san bernardino calif refocusing the race squarely on security issues cruz from the outset tried to sound a tough message against radical islam we will utterly destroy

legislation reining in nsa metadata collection rubio accused cruz of helping take away a valuable tool for security officials while cruz said marco knows what he s saying isn t true rubio later cited

talk on fox and friends all this tough talk ted stood up there said apos i apos m going to utterly destroy isis apos anyone can say that but what are you going to do it with rubio said accusing the texas senator of supporting a budget that cuts defense spending and voting against defense authorization bills new jersey gov chris christie used the arguing to contrast his own executive experience

s failed in this campaign the trump bush acrimony simmered throughout the debate with bush later telling trump he can t insult your way to the presidency and trump once again reminding bush that his
