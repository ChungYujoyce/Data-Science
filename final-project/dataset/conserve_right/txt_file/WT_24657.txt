apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump s suddenly mellow rhetoric toward iran and north korea runs counter to his more hawkish advisers and comes on the heels of some 2020 democratic candidates accusing him of fomenting war in the middle east even for a president who often contradicts top aides mr trump s comments that his administration is not looking for regime change in tehran and that he s not bothered at all by pyongyang s latest missile tests were startling departures from the administration s hard line against both longtime adversaries trump fancies himself a strategist but whiplash is not a strategy said michael rubin a specialist on iran at the conservative leaning american enterprise institute trump s comment relieves the pressure at the heart of the maximum pressure campaign he s falling into the trap by democrats who want to associate any pressure falsely with war top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time after mr trump decided last week to deploy another 1 500 u s troops to the gulf region to confront iran democratic presidential candidate beto o rourke was among those on the left accusing the president of provoking yet another war in the middle east while back of the pack mr o rourke of texas isn t likely to hurt the president analysts say the warmonger sentiment is a challenge for mr trump heading into 2020 polls show that voters especially independents give the president poor marks for his often confrontational foreign policy a quinnipiac university survey last week found that 37 of voters approve of mr trump s handling of international affairs with only 34 of independents approving a hart research poll conducted for democrats in late april found that 67 of respondents worry that mr trump lacks the temperament we need in a commander in chief the president who returned to washington on tuesday from a four day trip to japan said he believes iran would like to make a deal with the u s to lift tough economic sanctions and a tightening oil embargo but iran said tuesday there are no prospects for talks with the u s iran pays no attention to words what matters to us is a change of approach and behavior iranian foreign ministry spokesman abbas mousavi said according to reuters the president also emphasized that the u s doesn t want to topple iran s leadership saying we are looking for no nuclear weapons we re not looking for regime change i just want to make that clear mr trump said i don t want to hurt iran at all it has a chance to be a great country with the same leadership a week after mr trump tweeted if iran wants to fight that will be the official end of iran the president told reporters in japan nobody wants to see terrible things happen especially me the president withdrew last year from the obama administration s 2015 nuclear deal with tehran and has imposed increasing sanctions on iran in an effort to force it to the negotiating table sen chris murphy connecticut democrat and a member of the foreign relations committee said mr trump is making the u s a global laughingstock secretary of state mike pompeo is going around the world saying iran must meet 12 demands mr murphy tweeted trump says that iranians just have to get rid of nuclear weapons which they already had what a disaster mr rubin said the president is also falling victim to a rhetorical game the flip side of regime change is regime preservation he said we should not be in the business of preserving a regime that kills americans nor should we ever throw a life raft to a failing regime on north korea mr trump had already expressed satisfaction over the fact mr kim at least wasn t testing ballistic missiles or nuclear devices but his downplaying of pyongyang s short range missile tests came just two days after national security adviser john r bolton said the administration had no doubt that the tests violated u n security council resolutions scott seaman asia director at the eurasia group said mr trump s conciliatory comments on north korea are designed to bolster the narrative that everything is under control and that his bond with north korean leader kim jong un is critical to keeping the denuclearization process on track despite the occasional hiccup along the way it also likely reflects trump s irritation with the fact that many of his own advisers the japanese and probably plenty of other people as well are telling him that the situation is not as rosy as he wants to believe mr seaman said trump s main goal is to ensure that north korea remains a good story and foreign policy win for him as he ramps up his reelection campaign others say mr trump and mr bolton are working on the same strategy even if appearances differ if they truly diverged the president would fire john bolton said patrick m cronin who holds the asia pacific security chair at the hudson institute instead president trump is playing good cop egging kim on to commit to complete denuclearization and bolton is playing bad cop urging pyongyang to take a serious step rather than seeking sanctions relief without denuclearization mr trump s pushback is familiar earlier in his term he frequently undercut then secretary of state rex w tillerson on north korea and middle east policy broke with former defense secretary james n mattis on a u s troop withdrawal from syria and dubbed his move to bar visitors from several muslim majority countries a travel ban even as his aides avoided the term it s not the first time he s disagreed with his advisers on something said g terry madonna a politics professor at franklin and marshall college in pennsylvania on mr trump s tacit rebuke of mr bolton mr madonna said mr trump s style and public opinions about it are pretty fixed so anybody who works for him needs to understand that there s nothing that s going to change he said he believes that he can make a deal with anyone he believes he can best anyone in the art of the deal and that s not going to change mr trump s base also is likely to believe his characterization unless something dramatic happens mr seaman said the problem of course is that kim has set a deadline of sorts for the u s to soften its stance on denuclearization and sanctions by the end of this year or north korea might walk away from talks for good he said analysts at eurasia group a political risk consultancy don t expect mr kim to kick off 2020 by testing an inter continental ballistic missile but mr seaman said next year will likely bring with it more risk of tensions as trump and kim struggle to manage the bilateral relationship in the midst of intensifying u s campaigning and uncertainty about the outc
