democrats make the case for impeachment in this week aposs debate we ll ask our sunday panel how it aposs playing in the battleground states all right now on fox news sunday and hello again from fox news in washington a unintelligible fight is now shaping up between the senate and house over the impeachment of president trump house speaker nancy pelosi says she won apost send the articles of impeachment to the senate until the two parties there agree on the rules for a trial but if the articles are never sent over does that mean the president was never actually impeached in a moment we aposll talk with marc short the chief of staff to vice president pence but first let aposs get the latest from rich edson at the president aposs mar a lago retreat in florida rich rich edson fox news reporter chris president trump begins two weeks in florida taking a victory lap even though just days ago the house voted to impeach him addressing thousands of conservative students at a turning point usa summit president trump claims victory in impeachment saying house republicans voted unanimously against it begin video clip donald trump one ninety five to nothing you don apost see that end video clip rich edson he also touted a strong economy and phase one of a trade agreement with china he says he aposll sign very shortly the president calls december a historic success for his administration despite a historic admonishment rep nancy pelosi d calif it is tragic that the president aposs reckless actions make impeachment necessary he gave us no choice rich edson house speaker nancy pelosi is withholding impeachment articles from the senate delaying a trial democrats want republicans to allow witness testimony the president calls the delay unfair senate republicans are brushing it off begin video clip mitch mcconnell i aposm not sure what leverage there is in refraining from sending us something we do not want end video clip rich edson still there has been some bipartisanship a defense policy in government spending bills a free trade agreement and an accepted invitation from the speaker for the president to deliver the state of the union february 4th the president aposs campaign says he aposll travel to miami january 3rd to launch an evangelicals for trump coalition evangelicals have widely supported the president though in a surprise piece an editorial last week in christianity today the magazine said the president aposs conduct merits impeachment and removal chris chris wallace rich edson reporting from mar a lago rich thank you joining us now here in washington chief of staff to vice president mike pence marc short marc welcome back to fox news sunday marc short chief of staff to vice president mike pence chris thanks for having me chris wallace speaker pelosi as we just heard says that she won apost send over the articles of impeachment until she knows what the ground rules are for a senate trial and she wants democrats to be able to call witnesses here she is begin video clip nancy pelosi the next thing for us will be when we see the process that is set forth in the senate then we ll know the number of managers that we may have to go forward and who we would choose end video clip chris wallace is there anything the white house and senate republicans plan to do or are you just going to wait on pelosi marc short well chris i think her position is really untenable the reality is that she said in the house that this president poses such a grave danger to the globe that we have to trample on his constitutional rights not allow us to have any witnesses in front of the intelligence committee not allow us to have counsel present now allow us to provide evidence in our own defense we aposre going to trample those rights to rush this through and now we aposre going to hold it up to demand a longer process in the senate with more witnesses i don apost know when they became so concerned about due process after trampling over the president aposs rights but to your opening segment i think the president believes that we aposre winning right now he believes that we ve won on taxes the economy is booming unemployment is at record low military spending is rebuilding chris wallace okay i get all of that and there s plenty of time for the campaign but answer my question is there anything that you can do or do you just have to wait for pelosi to marc short chris it s not just the campaign congressman al green said we have to impeach him unintelligible chris wallace i understand all of that i m asking you a specific question is there anything you can do to move this trial along or do you just have to wait for pelosi to do what she s going to do marc short we re quite confident that the position is untenable and she s going to move it along and that chuck schumer and mitch mcconnell reach a deal on how it s going to proceed in the senate chris wallace so you think that she ll eventually give in marc short she ll unintelligible there s no way she can hold this position chris wallace the president says that he wants his day in court how frustrated is he right now by what pelosi is doing and he s been sort of back and forth on this does he want a full trial in which he can call witnesses republicans can call witnesses to defend him marc short he s frustrated with what he found to be a completely unreasonable impeachment so sure he s frustrated by that but he s also anxious to get not just acquitted but exonerated in the senate so he s looking forward to his opportunity to have a fair trial in the senate chris wallace and does a fair trial mean both sides call witnesses marc short i think what s happened and 20 years ago in the clinton impeachment is that you saw that they agreed to let both sides lay out their case and then we ll take a vote about additional witnesses that s what they agreed to and it wasn t just it was a 100 0 vote on the process including chuck schumer supporting that process so when schumer says he wants the same proceedings that happened with clinton i don t i think that s what we welcome too he s trying to now change the rules and have a whole different process and chris if her case is so airtight as she said that she had to ram it through and it s undeniable why does she need more witnesses to make her case chris wallace that s a question for speaker pelosi i hope we have her on what does the president make of pelosi this week inviting him to deliver his state of the union address to congress a joint session on february 4th does he read that as her acknowledging that her case is going nowhere marc short we think her case is going nowhere yes and i think the president looks forward to addressing the whole country on february 4th to talk about how well this country is doing chris wallace and how does he feel about the fact that she invited him this week marc short well i think it s the same thing chris in the midst of the impeachment we had 15 to 20 house democrats over in a black tie event for a christmas party with the president it s like how serious are they really doing this or again is it really just a political exercise to placate the radical left of their base that s what we think this has been all along it s why this was the seventh impeachment vote it wasn t the first they ve tried seven times they had 70 votes for impeachment even before mueller even testified on the russian collusion hoax they ve been trying to do this from day one of this administration and the reality is that they continue to see us racking up victories for the american people and they know they can t beat him at the ballot box chris wallace on friday night president trump tweeted this headline we re going to put it up russian president vladimir putin says u s president donald trump s impeachment is farfetched and predicts the u s senate will reject it that s president trump retweeting what putin said about him at the same time the president the white house threatened to veto the big spending bill which would avoid a government shutdown unless democrats dropped a provision that would have said the president must release any funding that congress approves military aid for ukraine i know there were separation of power issues there congress dictating what the president must do or not do but does president trump still believe that it was ukraine not russia that interfered in the 2016 election marc short chris it doesn t have to be an either or it can be both but that reporting was once again miserable reporting by the washington post we requested 250 million in aid to ukraine if congress did its job and completed their spending bill on september 30th we would have had it then it was delayed for over three months because they did a sham impeachment they re the ones actually delaying aid to ukraine what our admiration said is that they tried to put a special provision there that said there s no executive review on any of this aid not just ukraine but other countries but ultimately the aid is in there and we re going to deliver that aid to ukraine so it s actually incredibly misleading and misappropriate reporting by the washington post to say that we were issuing a veto threat over aid to ukraine it was on the policy writers in which congress was trying to say we re taking the executive branch ability to review that aid any executive would have had concern over that whether it s republican or democrat alike chris wallace and i pointed that out there were separation of power concerns but you said it doesn t have to be either or forget the question of russia does the president believe that ukraine interfered in the 2016 election marc short he thinks we should at least investigate it chris i mean go back to 2016 i know this is inconvenient for a lot of people in the mainstream media but when russia interfered in our election barack obama was president and joe biden was vice president and joe biden himself said he was in charge of ukraine policy and his son is getting between 50 000 and 80 000 a month to serve on a board where he has no experience whatsoever so his question is why shouldn t we investigate it it seems like we can never get enough investigation of interference foreign interference in our elections for three years but as soon as the president asks for it it s like hey we must impeach him chris wallace well that s not why it happened as you know i mean there was a phone call and there was a question of conditionality of a white house visit and giving the military aid and that it was on that basis that he was asking for the investigation but let me take your point marc short there was not conditionality chris wallace you say well we can we should still investigate every major u s intelligence agency says it was russia that interfered in the election during the house intel committee hearings a member marc short unintelligible chris wallace let me just finish a member of the trump national security council fiona hill said this idea that ukraine interfered in the election is kremlin disinformation so why does the president think it s still worth investigating whether ukraine did something marc short why don t we go and try to find the bottom line and the answers we re not questioning russia s interference chris i m accepting that but it doesn t mean that just because russia interfered doesn t mean others didn t as well chris wallace well but they re saying fiona hill that the whole question of ukraine is russian marc short i don t think chris wallace disinformation and in fact according to reporting you may say is inaccurate putin supposedly in a meeting they had in germany told the president that it was ukraine and he apparently said to some people in the administration putin told me it s ukraine marc short i ve read that again reporting in the washington post i never heard that i believe that there can be just because you re saying you know my house was robbed last night means your house couldn t have been robbed last night it s quite possible that both were interfering in elections so why not investigate that chris wallace okay let s turn to a new subject an evangelical magazine christianity today ran an editorial this week under a headline and there you can see it trump should be removed from office it said that he should be removed we believe is not a matter of partisan loyalties but loyalty to the creator of the ten commandments here is editor marc galli who wrote that begin video clip mark galli christian today editor the question is when does his behavior which is described as immoral accurately rise to the level where he is no longer fit to serve office and to me we crossed that line with the impeachment hearings end video clip chris wallace now your boss vice president pence is an evangelical how does he feel about president trump being called by christianity today a quote leader of such grossly immoral character marc short well i don apost want to put words in the vice president s mouth but chris i think for a lot of us who are celebrating the birth of our savior this week the way that we look at it is that this president has helped to save thousands of similar unplanned pregnancies this president has helped to make sure that religious liberty is protected this president has done more as we celebrate today in our churches across the country this morning they re singing o little town of bethlehem there s been no president no president has been a greater ally to israel than this president so for many of us who are christian we look at this and say i am thankful that donald trump is president and i m thankful that mike pence is vice president chris wallace you talk about morality and character finally i want to ask you about the president s comments in michigan this week where he suggested that the late congressman john dingell might be in hell looking up rather than in heaven looking down here s the reaction of dingell s wife debbie to the president s comments begin video clip rep debbie dingell d mich i loved my husband very much i m still having a hard time he was my partner and the love of my life and so i was already having a hard time with this holiday and the comment that he made was just it made me sad end video clip chris wallace how do you explain the president making a comment that hurt her so deeply you talk about christmas this will be her first christmas in 38 years without her husband and why won t he apologize marc short chris i m sorry that she s hurting and i m sorry and i certainly you know hope that wish her the best as she deals with her circumstances i think that our administration respects the service of john dingell and service we respect in uniform we respect his service to our country and congress and we respect her service to our country in following her husband in congress i think that you know i m sorry that she s in this circumstance today but you know in light of where we were on what was it wednesday night i think the president saying you know john dingell was not exactly a wallflower john dingell called the president an imbecile in his closing months john dingell himself as well had a lot of critical comments about the president yet he took time to call debbie dingell to express his personal condolences at the passing he lowered flags to half mast i think at the time in the moment the president aposs feeling that you know that in midst of an impeachment vote that that was something that came up in his rally speech chris wallace marc thank you thanks for your time this week and merry christmas to you and your family marc short merry christmas to you chris chris wallace up next the white house and senate republicans say democrats suddenly have cold feet about impeachment we ll talk with a member of the house democratic leadership congresswoman debbie dingell next commercial break chris wallace president trump spent impeachment night at a rally in michigan a state critical to his re election where he made waves on both sides of the aisle by insulting a prominent democratic family joining us now michigan congresswoman debbie dingell whose late husband john was the target of the president aposs remarks she is also co chair of the democratic policy committee and congresswoman welcome back to fox news sunday debbie dingell thank you chris good to be with you chris wallace all right why is speaker pelosi delaying in sending the articles of impeachment over to the senate and how long is she willing and prepared to wait debbie dingell so i don t know what the timeframe will be but i would like to remind people that when president clinton was impeached he was impeached on december 19th and the managers were not appointed until january 6th the congress doesn apost return until january 6th and was kind of referred to by marc short earlier there were two resolutions at that time one was a resolution to proceed that was passed by 100 to 0 and then there was a second resolution about who the witnesses would be i think that chris wallace but there were no witnesses you aposre talking about in the senate debbie dingell there were witnesses in the there were three witnesses for bill clinton the first resolution did not approve witnesses but ultimately there was a second resolution and there were three witnesses in the clinton impeachment and i think what the speaker is trying to do is to ensure that there aposs going to be a fair trial i think they aposre going to continue to be discussions i don apost know i aposm not part of those very tight discussions but senate schumer aposs trying to work with senator mcconnell to make sure there aposs a fair hearing i think there are witnesses that would not that the president would not allow to testify like the chief of staff like john bolton and others that people would like to get that testimony from to ensure it is a fair trial chris wallace okay debbie dingell but it will move chris wallace but i want to take marc short aposs point it was a question i was going to ask anyway when you guys were debating this in the house house democrats said you couldn apost hold off on impeachment you couldn apost even wait for the courts to decide on house subpoenas because donald trump was such a threat to the nation here are some of your colleagues during this process begin video clip rep jamie raskin d ohio the president aposs continuing course of conduct constitutes a clear and present danger to democracy in america rep cedric richmond d la this is not a rush to judgment it aposs a rush to justice and we must not delay rep adam schiff d calif could we find a more perfect description of the present danger emanating from 1600 pennsylvania avenue end video clip chris wallace so if president trump is such a threat if this case is so urgent why not send impeachment to the senate right away debbie dingell well first of all chris did you really think the united states senate was going to start this trial before january 6th you have no idea what aposs going to happen in the next two weeks as the leaders are trying to negotiate what aposs going to happen and as i remind you republican impeachment with president bill clinton that managers weren apost appointed until january 6th i hope that the leaders are going to continue to talk i think what you know this was one of the hardest votes i think that and one of the most important votes i ll cast in my career however long it may be and it was about protecting our national security i did not come out for this impeachment last summer under enormous pressure from tom steyer buying 40 ads and moveon org because i was worried about the division in this country but it became very clear there was a danger to our national security there was a danger to our democracy and that aposs why we are aware of what aposs happening and have to protect it as we go into this next year aposs election chris wallace okay but you certainly would agree you say well it always is a delay over between christmas and new year aposs but nancy pelosi has made it clear she aposs hoping that by holding it up it creates some leverage that will allow chuck schumer to make a deal with mitch mcconnell on the ground rules for the trial the question is why does she think she has any leverage here the president and top republicans say she aposs threatening not to give them something they don apost want anyway take a look begin video clip president donald trump they don apost want to put them in because they aposre ashamed of them because it aposs what they aposve done is wrong and it aposs bad for the country mitch mcconnell looks like the prosecutors are getting cold feet in front of the entire country and second guessing whether they even want to go to trial end video clip chris wallace and one of the democratic witnesses before house judiciary harvard law professor noah feldman says look if you don apost turn over if you don apost send impeachment to the senate then the president is never actually impeached so isn apost this almost the definition of an empty threat debbie dingell i don apost think that it is an empty threat and i don apost like the words threat i think this is about our democracy so what we aposre trying to do is to make sure that there aposs a fair trial and when senate mcconnell you aposre supposed to be you aposre a juror you aposre supposed to be go in with an open mind and listen to the facts there are more facts to be gathered says i aposve already made up my mind and i aposm going to do what the white house says i don apost call that a fair and impartial hearing or court trial chris wallace okay i aposm going to take one last crack at this because the constitution is clear and for all of the complaints from republicans well you aposre not doing it right or wrong the constitution was very clear and very simple that impeachment is the sole purview of the house it aposs equally clear article i section 3 says this the senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments so according to the founders let me finish according to the founders what happens in the senate is none of your you the house is none of your business debbie dingell all people are doing is making sure it aposs a fair trial and by the way i aposve read that very same part of the constitution it doesn apost say how quickly you have to move it from the house to the senate i think that you aposre doing to see it go sooner than quite frankly mitch mcconnell maybe even like i think he aposd like to never have to try it and try to this shouldn apost be a political moment in our nation aposs it aposs a nation aposs history it aposs a sad moment i wish that it had not been just a partisan vote somebody will yell at me for saying that i don apost think this is a good time in our country aposs history but we do all take an oath of office that requires us to protect our democracy and our national security so chris wallace all right we re going to turn now to a subject that is personally difficult for you and got a lot of attention this week and i discussed it with marc short just at the end the comments that president trump made about your late husband john dingell in a rally in michigan this week he talked about the honors that he ordered for your husband at his funeral here he is at the rally begin video clip donald trump she calls me it s the nicest thing that s ever happened thank you so much john would be so thrilled he s looking down he d be so thrilled thank you so much sir i said that s okay don t worry about it maybe he s looking up i don t know laughter end video clip chris wallace what did you think when you heard that debbie dingell it just sort of kicked me in the stomach it was politicization of something that didn t need to be so and by the way john dingell earned he was buried at arlington cemetery because he was a world war ii veteran and that had been discussed with the army a year before he wasn t laid out to rest in the rotunda quite frankly nancy had called me and tried to work through funeral details and i didn t want anything that other former members weren t allowed so we didn t do that and it wasn t the president s to give he called me to tell me he was lowering the flags and to this day and this minute i m grateful that he did it i was grateful for the call he was kind and empathetic and it meant a lot to somebody who was hurting and loved her husband chris wallace a number of your congressional colleagues have called out the president for his remarks and some of them are republicans and i want to put these on the screen your fellow michigan congressman fred upton most unfortunate and an apology is due senator lindsey graham he said the same joke about john mccain it is not funny republican congressman dan crenshaw merry christmas debbie you deserve to be able to heal in peace those comments were totally unnecessary but here is the only comment since the president s the only comment from the white house from stephanie grisham here she is begin video clip stephanie grisham white house press secretary i think that as we all know the president is a counterpuncher it was a very very supportive and wild crowd and he was just riffing on some of the things that had been happening in the past few days end video clip chris wallace i guess the argument is he did something nice for you he did order the flags to be lowered debbie dingell he did chris wallace to half staff debbie dingell and it was appreciated chris wallace and you voted to impeach him debbie dingell those are two different issues for me you know we have to learn in our country that you can disagree agreeably i understand that this impeachment was a very personal issue to him but i think there are lines that you don apost cross and i think he crossed a line there i don t want need an apology don t want an apology i don t want a campaign to begin around that what i do want is people to take a deep breath and think going forward that their words have consequences that they can hurt and how do we bring more civility back to our political environment and not actually just the political environment the rhetoric in this country has turned so ugly vitriolic and bullying it s not okay social media is destroying our sense of community in this country chris wallace i well it s interesting you said that because this week you put out i don t know if people will be able to see it but this statement this is a picture you were all younger then we were all younger then debbie dingell unintelligible chris wallace of you of the bushes and the dingells the george h w bushes and your husband john in his final days of a year ago last november wrote a statement on the passing of bush 41 and i wonder if you could read because i frankly i think this is an important message particularly at christmastime this is what your husband wrote on the passing of john dingell i mean i m sorry on the passing of george h w bush debbie dingell george bush came from a time as did i when we believed that american equality demands that we treat one another with the same dignity and respect with which we expect to be treated he was horrified at the harshness of our national discourse has taken and deeply disturbed at watching too many people speak past each other we both shared deep concern about the hateful taunts the despicable actions and language that plague our political culture chris wallace still has a lot of resonance doesn t it as we debbie dingell you know someone sent that to me on friday morning and yes it has a lot and the day that john dingell died the night before and the day john dingell died he dictated an op ed that appeared in the washington post with that same message he was worried about this country and he wanted us to know that we all had responsibility for it and that compromise isn t a dirty word he used to say to me people god gave us two ears and one mouth for a reason we need to listen to each other more and look this is going to be a hard holiday for me it s been hard i miss him with my whole heart and soul but if something good can come out of this if maybe the president can think a little more sometimes if all of us all of us i would like to work with the president and everybody else to just be a little kinder and that random acts of kindness can make somebody s day a whole lot better chris wallace congresswoman dingell thank you thanks for coming in today i hope you know that a lot of people in this town will be thinking of you and are thinking of you this christmas debbie dingell i m very blessed and so was john thank you chris chris wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the standoff between the house and senate plus what would you like to ask the panel about speaker pelosi s strategy of holding up the impeachment trial just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip male speaker resolved that donald john trump president of the united states is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors end video clip begin video clip donald trump this lawless partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the democrat party have you seen my polls in the last four weeks end video clip chris wallace on the same day the house of representatives voted along party lines to impeach him president trump rallied supporters predicting it will backfire on democrats and it s time now for our sunday group cofounder of the federalist ben domenech fox news political analyst juan williams former dnc chair donna brazile and jason riley of the wall street journal ben let s start with you your thoughts about house speaker pelosi aposs decision first of all about the house impeachment and then pelosi aposs decision to hold off on turning the articles of impeachment over to the senate does she really have any leverage ben domenech the federalist nancy pelosi aposs one of the smartest democrats in washington and in the country she was really boxed in on this in a way that i think she was uncomfortable with and i think that she aposs made a huge error in the way that she dealt with the immediate post impeachment reality extending this out is not in the interest of the democrats who make up the majority in the house of representatives those 30 democrats from trump friendly districts who are going to have to defend this decision back home they don apost want this story to extend they want to be able to go back to their districts and say we did this because we thought we had to but then we immediately proved that we could work with the president when it comes to issues like trade they want to move on to other issues that they can talk about in the campaign trail and 2020 chris wallace so why do you think that she aposs doing this ben domenech i think she aposs doing it because she aposs not actually in control anymore the base is in control of this party okay and the base of the democratic party wants to impeach donald trump wants very much to see him impeached for anything under the sun they want asterisks all the way down for his presidency chris wallace okay donna brazile off camera i should tell you was laughing a little bit at that she aposs going to get her chance to respond we asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of nancy pelosi delaying and turning over the impeachment articles to the senate we got this on twitter from david almo spelled phonetically he must not be that much of a threat to democracy if they aposre willing to hold it off right donna how do you answer david and how do you answer ben on the issue of whether nancy pelosi is in control donna brazile former dnc interim chair maybe i aposm showing my age now ben but i remember after the clinton impeachment in 1999 was a hill staffer back then he was impeached on the 19th and the mangers and everyone went to the senate on january 6th so in terms of timeline we might be operating on similar timelines as we saw in 1999 i believe she aposs right first of all she aposs not just one of the smartest democrats and i know a lot of democrats i think she aposs one of the smartest and impartial defenders of the constitution she is she aposs using every tool in her toolbox to make sure that the resolutions that are conducted in the senate now she can apost control the senate mcconnell has made that clear but she wants to make sure that every tool will be used or utilized so that when she sent over the managers she understand what game that the senate will be playing ben domenech but donna you have to i mean this doesn apost really fly when you see things like clyburn coming out and saying that oh well mitch mcconnell is colluding with the white house or jerry nadler coming out and saying chris wallace but he did say i aposm taking my cues from the white house ben domenech right but jerry nadler coming out and saying we can apost trust mitch mcconnell to be an impartial juror this doesn apost fly with anybody nobody really thinks that that aposs what aposs going on in the senate that they aposre just going to sort of remove all of their partisan loyalties from the situation donna brazile but if you recall if you recall and chris is right the mr mcconnell said that he aposs going to work with the white house counsel and he aposs going to take an oath to be an impartial juror that aposs like the jury working with the defendant look at the end of the day speaker pelosi will do the right thing she will send over managers they will march over to the united states senate and announce the articles of impeachment and at that point the senate will begin their actions chris wallace our audience will be happy to know we actually have four panelists not two let aposs bring jason riley in where do you come down on all this jason riley wall street journal well it aposs not just mitch mcconnell that has told nancy pelosi that the house has no say it aposs the constitution donna that says chris showed the language from the constitution earlier sole power to the house for impeachment sole power to the senate for the trial and the issue is not whether mitch mcconnell is impartial it aposs not his job to be impartial that aposs the job of chief justice roberts who will be overseeing this trial of course mitch mcconnell is a partisan republican no one is expecting him to be partial but the problem here as ben said is that nancy pelosi initiated this process to please her progressives and she rushed it through to please those house members that she knows want to go back home and talk about something else and now she is in a bind here chris wallace is she in a bind juan williams fox news political analyst i don apost think so at all boy i was surprised shocked to hear anybody say nancy pelosi is not in charge of the democrats wow she aposs had quite a streak here but i would i mean she held her caucus together i mean look oh of these 31 who have who come from districts where president trump won the election she aposs going to see a number of defections she did not see any large defections she held them together anyway the bigger point here is is this going to be like an o j simpson jury jury nullification in the o j simpson case it was we don apost like the cops in this case oh we don apost like the democrats so we aposre going to ignore the facts we aposre going to ignore the evidence there will be no evidence not guilty the problem would be that would be a sham so nancy pelosi does can apost control what goes on in the senate according to the constitution as you read here for us chris but she can try to say if this is going to be a sham well then i don apost need to really put any energy into the managers that i send over there send political send rhetorical people if it aposs a matter of actual witnesses if john bolton mick mulvaney are called to give firsthand testimony about the president aposs actions then i need to send someone who knows about the case jason riley juan how can the house force the senate to call witnesses that the house itself refused to call juan williams they didn apost refuse to call them they couldn apost call them because they wouldn apost come because guess what jason the president said don apost go up there donna brazile and they withheld jason riley they refused to let that process run its course cross talk and now they are claiming juan williams wouldn apost that cross talk into their slow walking strategy at the white house jason riley my problem with it is that they aposre claiming that this testimony is so essential to this process if it is that essential why didn apost they let it play go forward in the house juan williams because the president wouldn apost allow it he not only withheld witnesses he withheld evidence chris wallace all right you know what it aposs a good question why didn apost they do it and it aposll you folks you can ruin your christmas laughter cross talk you can talk about it over christmas dinner all right panel we have to take a break here when we come back as the timing and scope of the senate trial remain in limbo we aposll discuss how it aposs playing in the key battleground states as we head into 2020 impeachment and the election that aposs next commercial break male speaker better trade deals delayed stronger borders obstructed funding for our troops incomplete a do nothing congress focused on a witch hunt and your congresswoman abigail spanberger is siding with them end video clip chris wallace that s part of an ad from a pro trump group targeting a freshman house democrat from a virginia swing district who voted for impeachment and we re back now with the panel well let s look at the latest poll in a couple of the swing states on the question of impeachment in florida 50 percent now oppose impeaching and removing the president while 46 percent support those actions in wisconsin another swing state 52 percent oppose impeaching and removing president trump while 40 percent are in favor juan will what the democrats did this week in impeaching the president will it help the president in terms of 2020 his reelection prospects and will it endanger the democratic house majority juan williams i don t think it endangers the majority in fact we ve seen a rash of republican retirements mark meadows from north carolina for instance this week is another one another republican who just left but what you do see in those polls is a distinct tilt in those very critical electoral college states against impeachment and that s not good news for the democrats it is better news for the president by the way those polls stand in contrast to our own fox poll this week the washington post had a poll it s about 50 percent generally nationally who support impeachment and removal chris wallace yeah but there seems to be a difference between nationally and swing states juan williams that s what i m saying but the but it s also the case that in those swing states the majority supported the impeachment inquiry and a majority if you look again at the national polls say we want to have for example witnesses and a fair trial in the senate and finally what you see is that a majority and this is a super majority in the national polls say he did something wrong so i think the democrats in those swing districts chris need to talk more in terms of he did something wrong this is unconstitutional more so than they need to talk about impeachment because that s not helping the democrats right now chris wallace jason how do you see it the house action this week to go ahead and impeach the president net plus or minus for democrats looking forward towards november jason riley well it looks like it s going to be a net minus chris because it s not just where the polls stand today it s the direction in which they have been moving and they have been moving in trump s favor i think pelosi and the democrats thought they d be able to peel off some republicans in this process they have not been able to do that so it s seen as this highly partisan exercise also i think the democrats overpromised they were they said bombshells were coming bribery extortion collusion and the articles themselves seem to be pretty weak tea and i think that s a problem they have going forward they couldn t deliver on what they said was coming chris wallace all right let s switch subjects it s easy to overlook but there was another democratic debate this week in california a democratic presidential debate and the big target was mayor pete buttigieg who now leads in some polls in both iowa and new hampshire and one of the big issues and elizabeth warren went after the mayor on this was the issue of campaign financing take a look begin video clip sen elizabeth warren d ma the mayor just recently had a fundraiser that was held in a wine cave full of crystals and served 900 a bottle wine mayor pete buttigieg d ind this is the problem with issuing purity tests you cannot yourself pass end video clip chris wallace so donna it s now turned out and this is no surprise to anyone that in fact when she was running for the senate not when she was running for president that elizabeth warren held a lot of big ticket fundraisers including one in a penthouse in new york one at fenway park does she look like a hypocrite donna brazile well i think the point that she was trying to make was that mayor pete should open up his events and he should be more transparent on the other hand i do believe that what we saw this at the debate this past week was that the democrats are ready to take off the gloves we re within 45 days of the iowa caucuses over 1 600 precinct caucuses i ve done a few in my life it s now down to the final weeks before we choose someone who will ultimately i think be in a front row get a front row seat i can t help but think about the political calculus this is not about the political calculus of the president or in his reelection or the senate or the house it s about our constitution and validity and integrity of our election i keep saying i experienced the russian hacking this was not a myth this was not a hoax this happened in real time and if we don t protect our elections from future interference of foreign governments then we don t have a democracy anymore so i had to say that chris before i go home for christmas laughter chris wallace okay i m glad you got it out at this dinner table and not that dinner table let s go back to politics where s the democratic race at this point ben ben domenech well i think what you just saw there is it s a bunch of different elites adjudicating who s more elite why do you go to wine caves it s because it s where the money is laughs this is a situation where i think you have a field that a lot of democrats are not particularly satisfied with because they see a lot of the different defects that each candidate has you kind of want someone who s able to step forward and really inspire a lot of people i think that mayor pete has done that to this point and whether he s going to be able to ride that into the future in success in iowa is i think a real question to me one of the most interesting aspects of this debate was the success of amy klobuchar who i think did a very good job this is a kind of a do or die moment for her though if she loses in iowa if she s not able to make some noise there she may not be able to withstand much future into this cycle chris wallace jason jason riley well first chris i want to thank you for putting together a more diverse panel than the democrats could muster on thursday night laughter i think that was very impressive maybe they should call you for more chris wallace we didn t have strict guidelines on donors laughter jason riley i m sure donna appreciates that but in any case i think biden had a very good night chris he stayed above the fray no stumbles no huge gaffes there and he let the other candidates fight among themselves donna said they re taking off the gloves well no they re really taking off the gloves i think when bernie sanders and elizabeth warren start going at one another because i think biden will stay up there while those other two are splitting those progressives unintelligible chris wallace unintelligible donna and i ve got less than 30 seconds they really they focused their attention i understand it on mayor pete buttigieg because he s leading in iowa joe biden kind of was under the radar donna brazile and that s the reason why he s still on top voters know who he is they trust him they believe that he s going to be able to beat donald trump chris wallace thank you panel merry christmas donna brazile merry christmas chris wallace glad you got all of this all off laughter now you can just have a very christmassy time with your families donna brazile a lot of unintelligible thank you chris wallace up next our power player of the week honoring america s veterans this holiday season plus another visit from the wallace grandkids commercial break chris wallace it s a christmas tradition here to share the story of how one family has found a way to express the meaning of the holiday season it s a moving example of love for our country and personal generosity once again here is our power player of the week begin video clip morrill worcester wreaths across america we wouldn t have the opportunities if it wasn t for the people that fought for us and who gave their lives for us chris wallace it s that plainspoken wisdom that has driven morrill worcester for years on a mission that has touched america s heart each december worcester places wreaths at arlington national cemetery and thousands of volunteers are there to help him morrill worcester i think a lot of people think like i do they just want to you know they appreciate the veterans and they want to show it chris wallace this story begins back in 1962 when worcester then a 12 year old paperboy from maine won a trip to washington what impressed him most was arlington its beauty and dignity and those rows and rows of graves morrill worcester every one represents a life and a family and a story they aposre not just tombstones i mean those are all people chris wallace thirty years later in 1992 worcester was running his own wreath company in harington maine but as christmas approached he had a bunch left over morrill worcester these wreaths are real fresh raked just made and i just didn t want to throw them away chris wallace he thought of arlington and all those graves when the cemetery approved he and a dozen volunteers drove the wreaths down and laid them on the headstones and so it continued for years until a few christmases back when an air force sergeant took this picture which ended up on the internet morrill worcester it kind of struck a nerve and people emailed it to each other and it really went around the world chris wallace we were there the next year as he and his workers at the worcester wreath company loaded up 5 265 wreaths then they embarked on what worcester calls the world aposs longest veteran aposs parade a 750 mile journey that at some points attracted more than 100 vehicles and when they got to arlington so many people wanted to participate male speaker this ceremony you are about to witness is an army wreath laying ceremony to be conducted for the worcester wreath company chris wallace for years worcester paid for all of this out of his own pocket and he started wreaths across america sending hundreds to cemeteries and war memorials around the country but he will need help to reach his new goal morrill worcester i think around 2 7 million graves and that aposs a tall order to decorate 2 7 million graves so chris wallace but you aposd like to do it wouldn apost you morrill worcester i really would yeah some time i don apost know how but hey you know chris wallace how long are you going to keep doing this morrill worcester i aposm going to keep doing it for as long as i work and then i know my family aposs going to continue so it aposll be here for a long time chris wallace this is the 28th year morrill worcester has taken on his christmas wreath project this month volunteers placed 2 2 million wreaths on veteran aposs graves at more than 2 000 locations in all 50 states including 254 000 wreaths here at arlington national cemetery and now another c
