apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap as world leaders gather in spain to discuss how to slow the warming of the planet a spotlight falls on china the top emitter of greenhouse gases china burns about half the coal used globally each year between 2000 and 2018 its annual carbon emissions nearly tripled and it now accounts for about 30 of the world s total yet it s also the leading market for solar panels wind turbines and electric vehicles and it manufactures about two thirds of solar cells installed worldwide we are witnessing many contradictions in china s energy development said kevin tu a beijing based fellow with the center on global energy policy at columbia university it s the largest coal market and the largest clean energy market in the world top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches that apparent paradox is possible because of the sheer scale of china s energy demands but as china s economy slows to the lowest level in a quarter century around 6 growth according to government statistics policymakers are doubling down on support for coal and other heavy industries the traditional backbones of china s energy system and economy at the same time the country is reducing subsidies for renewable energy at the annual united nations climate summit this year in madrid government representatives will put the finishing touches on implementing the 2015 paris agreement which set a goal to limit future warming to 1 5 to 2 degrees celsius above pre industrial levels nations may decide for themselves how to achieve it china had previously committed to shifting its energy mix to 20 renewables including nuclear and hydroelectric energy climate experts generally agree that the initial targets pledged in paris will not be enough to reach the goal and next year nations are required to articulate more ambitious targets hopes that china would offer to do much more are fading recent media reports and satellite images suggest that china is building or planning to complete new coal power plants with total capacity of 148 gigawatts nearly equal to the entire coal power capacity of the european union within the next few years according to an analysis by global energy monitor a san francisco based nonprofit meanwhile investment in china s renewable energy dropped almost 40 percent in the first half of 2019 compared with the same period last year according to bloomberg new energy finance a research organization the government slashed subsidies for solar energy last week in beijing china s vice minister of ecology and environment told reporters that non fossil fuel sources already account for 14 3 of the country s energy mix he did not indicate that china would embrace more stringent targets soon we are still faced with challenges of developing our economy improving people s livelihood zhao yingmin said as a fast growing economy it was always inevitable that china s energy demands would climb steeply the only question was whether the country could power a sufficiently large portion of its economy with renewables to curb emissions growth many observers took hope from a brief dip in china s carbon emissions between 2014 and 2016 today the country s renewed focus on coal comes as a disappointment now there s a sense that rather than being a leader china is the one that is out of step said lauri myllyvirta lead analyst at the centre for research on energy and clean air in helsinki he notes that several developed countries including germany south korea and the united states are rapidly reducing their reliance on coal power after climbing sharply for two decades china s emissions stalled around 2013 and then declined slightly in 2015 and 2016 according to global carbon budget which tracks emissions worldwide this dip came as chinese leaders declared a war on pollution and suspended the construction of dozens of planned coal power plants including some in shanxi at the same time the government required many existing coal operators to install new equipment in smokestacks to remove sulfur dioxide nitrous oxide and other hazardous substances about 80 of coal plants now have scrubbers said alvin lin beijing based china climate and energy policy director for the natural resources defense council a nonprofit as a result the air quality in many chinese cities including beijing improved significantly between 2013 and 2017 residents long accustomed to wearing face masks and running home air filter machines enjoyed a reprieve of more blue sky days as low pollution days are known in china in the past three years china s carbon emissions have begun to rise again according to global carbon budget the coming winter in beijing may see a return of prolonged smog as authorities loosen environmental controls on heavy industry in part to compensate for other slowing sectors in the economy permits for new coal plants proliferated after regulatory authority was briefly devolved from beijing to provincial governments which see construction projects and coal operations as boosts to local economies and tax bases said ted nace executive director of global energy monitor it s as though a boa constructor swallowed a giraffe and now we re watching that bulge move through the system said nace in china it takes about three years to build a coal plant the world has already warmed by 1 degree celsius all scenarios envisioned by the intergovernmental panel on climate change for holding planetary warming to around 1 5 degrees celsius involve steep worldwide reductions in coal power generation in that effort other countries rely on chinese manufacturing to hold down prices on solar panels wind turbines and lithium ion batteries china has a really mixed record on the one hand it s seen rapidly rising emissions over the past two decades said jonas nahm an energy expert at johns hopkins university on the other hand it s shown it s able to innovate around manufacturing
