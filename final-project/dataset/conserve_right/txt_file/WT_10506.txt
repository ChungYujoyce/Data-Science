apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap an array of activists academics and dissidents is questioning the chinese authorities purge of bo xilai demanding that china s legislature follow the rule of law and allow the disgraced leader to defend himself before lawmakers the nation s leadership is desperate to move beyond a scandal involving a former member of its politburo that has drawn worldwide attention and some say it is doing so at the expense of standard legal procedures left leaning supporters of mr bo wrote an open letter to the national people s congress urging it to allow him to have his say the petition has begun to draw broader and somewhat unlikely support attracting signatures from exiled dissidents and rights activists who don t consider themselves in mr bo s corner top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 the legislature s standing committee was expected to expel mr bo during its four day meeting starting tuesday a move that would strip mr bo of his legislative immunity and pave the way for his criminal prosecution likely in a swift trial the letter which also has circulated on activist websites that are blocked in china urges the congress not to expel mr bo until he has the chance to address allegations against him they should give bo a chance to defend himself the procedure has to be just said zeng yuan a local rights activists from chengdu who said he signed the petition even though he does not support mr bo a politburo member has been silenced just like that this has gone against what the constitution says about human rights mr zeng said by phone mr bo was one of china s best known politicians until he fell from grace earlier this year when a close aide disclosed that mr bo s wife had murdered british businessman neil heywood he has been out of sight presumably detained since mid march he was expelled from the party last month authorities have said they intend to charge mr bo with obstruction of justice connected with the heywood murder as well as corruption and illicit sexual affairs that go against communist party rules mr bo s reputation for championing social fairness and communist nostalgia made him popular among poorer chinese and those who identify themselves as member of the new left believers in a strong authoritarian government that promotes more egalitarian economic and social policies but his maneuvering to reach the highest echelons of the communist party angered many in beijing while his campaign to promote communist party culture revived memories of the chaotic cultural revolution mao zedong s radical experiment in class warfare to root out opponents of communism mr bo also has been accused of trampling on civil liberties making it all the more noteworthy that rights activists are coming to his defense his anti mafia crackdown in the city of chongqing was rife with allegations of torture against suspects the open letter was drafted by liu jinhua 77 a bo supporter in the southwestern city of leshan who said the missive was sent by registered mail to the legislature whether bo xilai broke the law or not should be based on facts we ask for openness and fairness mr liu said we hope that in the handling of major events like the bo xilai incident that has grabbed the attention of the world we can promote china s rule of law mr liu said that organizers received hundreds of signatures by email and that it was not possible to verify the authenticity of all of them at least 10 of the several hundred names have already been proved fake he said though he believed the vast majority of them were genuine the letter also criticizes government moves to block leftist websites and clamp down on dissenting voices in the bo scandal are these not barbaric acts that flagrantly violate our constitution and laws and shameful acts that completely departing from the principle of the rule of law and the people s democratic spirit the letter says mr liu elaborated in an email that moves to shut down discussion of the bo case appeared to subvert the legal system in order to carry out a political purge signatories include gong xiantian a law professor at the prestigious peking university who confirmed in an email that he signed the letter exiled dissidents wang xizhe and gao han living in the united states also confirmed their signatures mr wang and mr gao do not identify themselves as leftists mr gong said the letter should not be seen as a criticism of china s legal system only of the illegal handling of the bo case our system has its shortcomings but no system exists without shortcomings he said mr liu said that he met with authorities in his city saturday to discuss the letter but that they decided that he was patriotic and a supporter of the party and told him he was safe they asked him not to publicly issue the letter but that it was ok to forward it to the congress a
