becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens meanwhile comparable majorities of veterans and americans overall see the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq as not worth fighting and they view the u s military engagement in syria as more negative than positive i feel very very emotionally wedded to the vets trump said in a call with military veterans last month they ve been very good to me also i can tell you at the ballot box they were extremely good to me we re going to take care of you in all 57 of veterans approved of trump s leadership as commander in chief compared with 41 of americans overall about half of veterans or 48 said the president respects veterans a great deal and an additional 14 think he respects them a fair amount but there were signs of strain heading into the 2020 election the pew survey found views varying by party gender and age women younger veterans and democrats generally were more skeptical of the president s respect for veterans ap votecast a nationwide midterm survey that included more than 4 000 veteran voters similarly found lower approval for trump among veterans who are women younger in age and democrats trump

weapons agreement 53 to 46 and of sending troops to the u s mexico border 58 to 41 majorities also were supportive of trump s handling of north korea russia and nato allies but veterans leaned more
