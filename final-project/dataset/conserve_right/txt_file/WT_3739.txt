charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century political is personal this was no staid bureaucratic tale told by a distant and removed narrator yovanovitch s account was instead deeply personal layered with outrage over having been kneecapped by lies and her abrupt recall in a 1 a m phone call from a country she said was vital to u s interests after a smear campaign she said involved trump s personal lawyer rudy giuliani and was amplified by cable news hosts and the president s oldest son donald jr she was directed in april 2019 to come from ukraine to the united states on the next plane because she no longer had the confidence of the president i remain disappointed that the state department s leadership and others have declined to acknowledge that the attacks against me and others are dangerously wrong yovanovitch said she counted herself among the professional public servants who she said serve u s interests regardless of who occupies the white house and wrapping her testimony in historical context invoked the diplomats who were killed in the 2012 benghazi attacks tortured in captivity in iran and injured in mysterious attacks in cuba we honor these individuals they represent each one of you here and every american these courageous individuals were attacked because they symbolized america she said very intimidating while republicans said yovanovitch was in effect peripheral to the impeachment inquiry she drew direct connections to the president yovanovitch left no doubt that

refused to allow republican rep devin nunes the top republican on the house intelligence committee to yield his time to stefanik early in the hearing but the attempt came during a portion of the hearing when rules explicitly stated that only schiff nunes and committee lawyers were permitted to question yovanovitch when stefanik s allotted time did come up she used it in part to criticize schiff and read news clips recounting his promise that the whistleblower would be allowed to testify before the committee republicans led by trump celebrated stefanik the only republican woman on the committee trump retweeted multiple clips of stefanik asking questions of yovanovitch trump smears the witness he would be too busy to watch said the white house he d tune into an opening statement delivered by nunes but spend the rest of the day working hard for the american people press secretary stephanie grisham said instead trump responded to the hearing in real time castigating yovanovitch by tweet as she testified about her poor treatment by the president and his administration everywhere marie yovanovitch went turned bad tweeted trump pointing to the time she spent in war torn somalia

appoint ambassadors who serve at the pleasure of the president thank you for your service they thanked her for her tremendous public service they said georgetown university was lucky to have her one
