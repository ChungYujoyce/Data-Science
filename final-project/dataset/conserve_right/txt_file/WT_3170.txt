know they can t win the 2020 election so they re pursuing the insane impeachment mr trump said they want to erase your vote like it never existed they want to erase your voice and erase your future but they will fail because in america the people rule again the president also referred to a report thursday evening in the washington examiner that the anonymous whistleblower who launched the impeachment inquiry against him had worked with mr biden in the white house in a brand new report just came out as i m walking on the stage hard to believe actually it turns out that when joe biden was vice president he worked with the so called whistleblower mr trump said this is nothing but a partisan witch hunt sabotage and i m sure the media are going to say it s a totally unsubstantiated story the president mocked hunter biden s profiteering several times and said of him your father was never considered smart he was never considered a good senator he was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss barack obama s ass mr trump was visiting the district of somali born rep ilhan omar a left wing democrat with whom he has feuded he called her an america hating socialist who has a history of launching virulent anti semitic screeds she is a disgrace to our country and she is one of the big reasons that i m going to win and the republican party is going to win minnesota in 13 months the president said mr trump also boasted of his crackdown on refugee resettlements telling minnesotans that leaders in washington brought large numbers of refugees to your state from somalia without considering the impact on schools and communities and taxpayers i promised you that as president i would give local communities a greater say in refugee policy and put in place enhanced vetting and responsible immigration controls and i ve done that since coming into office i have reduced refugee resettlement by 85 mr parnas and mr fruman face four charges including conspiracy falsification of records and lying to the federal election commission about political donations the charges against the pair appear to be unrelated to their ukraine activities both men have donated heavily to republican campaigns including the contribution to america first action in may 2018 through a business called global energy producers according to fec data prosecutors say the two men shielded the foreign source of the funds by laundering through their u s business mr fruman went so far as to intentionally misspell his name so the fec wouldn t catch the donations they said they were arrested at washington dulles international airport before they could board an international flight with one way tickets said geoffrey berman u s attorney for the southern district the men were seen earlier wednesday having lunch with mr giuliani at the trump international hotel in washington the wall street journal reported the complaint says the men took part in political activities in the u s on behalf of at least one ukrainian government official including an effort to remove the u s ambassador in kyiv marie yovanovitch who was recalled from her post in may the pair reportedly pledged to raise campaign funds for then rep pete sessions texas republican and met with him at a pro trump super pac event in 2018 mr sessions is not charged but is referred to as congressman 1 in the indictment they also have claimed to have attended a small gathering with the president in washington in may 2018 focused on the midterm elections the house committees are demanding that the two men testify and turn over documents related to efforts to get ukrainian officials to investigate the bidens the democratic national committee or hillary clinton your clients are private citizens who are not employees of the executive branch the committee chairmen wrote in a letter to mr giuliani they may not evade requests from congress for documents and information necessary to conduct our inquiry the federal investigation stemmed from a complaint filed by the campaign legal center an open government advocacy group the organization uncovered the trump campaign donation in july 2018 we are pleased that federal law enforcement has conducted an investigation into these campaign finance crimes and made these two arrests the public is now learning just how dangerous dark money can be in u s elections including the potential for illegal foreign funds which doj says were used here said trevor potter president of the campaign legal center and former republican chairman of the fec the fact that these two individuals were working with giuliani and ukrainian government officials to alter u s policy in that country will obviously be relevant to the impeachment investigation mr potter said in issuing a subpoena to mr perry the democratic committee chairmen said recent media reports have raised questions about any role you may have played in conveying or reinforcing the president s stark message to the ukrainian president these reports have also raised significant questions about your efforts to press ukrainian officials to change the management structure at a ukrainian state owned energy company to benefit individuals involved with rudy giuliani s push to get ukrainian officials to interfere in our 2020 election the chairmen added the president also confirmed that former rep trey gowdy south carolina republican won t be able to join his legal team as outside counsel in the impeachment defense until at least january because of what he called lobbying rules gabriella mu o
