chinese government lashed back at remarks by british foreign secretary jeremy hunt on the causes of the anti government protests in hong kong foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said hunt appeared to be basking in the faded glory of british colonialism and obsessed with lecturing others hunt had said that hong kong authorities should not use the vandalism in the legislative building as a pretext for repression he said the authorities need to understand the root causes of what happened which is a deep seated concern by people in hong kong that their basic freedoms are under attack geng said britain has no authority to discuss matters in the territory he noted hong kong was under british rule for 155 years run by governors appointed by the british crown rather than being an autonomous democracy the protesters in hong kong are demanding direct election of the city s leader lam was chosen by an elite committee of mainly pro beijing electors the u k considers itself as a guardian which is nothing but a delusion geng said it is just shameless to say that hong kong s freedoms are negotiated for them by the british side associated press journalists ken moritsugu and
