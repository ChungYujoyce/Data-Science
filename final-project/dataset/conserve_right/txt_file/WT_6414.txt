international peace security and stability as well as the ultimate objective of a world without nuclear weapons germany s foreign minister heiko maas told the council that despite its achievements the npt is facing serious setbacks nuclear disarmament has come to a standstill new technologies are creating dangerous strategic imbalances and proliferation crises are demanding our fullest attention he pointed to north korea acquiring nuclear weapons disregarding the npt and security council resolutions as a key failure maas said the only realistic way ahead is applying pressure and stepping up nuclear diplomacy he urged international support for u s efforts to negotiate with north korea and for the 2015 iran nuclear deal which remains the best and only promising tool to keep iran from obtaining nuclear weapons russia s u n ambassador vassily nebenzia blamed the breakdown of nuclear and arms control agreements on attempts by one state to dominate the world and to impose on the international community its rules at the expense of the interests of other states and of international law a clear reference to the united states he said the u s has ignored a russian proposal to impose a moratorium on medium and short range ballistic missile systems and he said putin is still waiting for an answer to his proposal to extend the new start treaty without any preconditions

of nuclear planning acting u s deputy ambassador cherith norman chalet said that advancing to a world without nuclear weapons must take into account the global security environment we cannot overlook the actions of those states that are expanding and modernizing their nuclear stockpiles as well as developing exotic delivery systems threatening their neighbors and violating their arms control

basis as possible and avoid divisive positions states must also be united in the goal of the final fully verified denuclearization of north korea and remain committed to a secure peaceful and bring future for north korea if it fulfills its obligations she said and we must remain united in our determination that iran never acquire a path to nuclear weapons russia s nebenzia said it s important for nuclear and non nuclear states to join efforts to ease tensions and confrontation it s important that the review conference of 2020 contribute to strengthening the nonproliferation regime rather than weakening i
