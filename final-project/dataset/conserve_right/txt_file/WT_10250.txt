 of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion with the signing of the economic cooperative framework agreement ecfa we have further evidence that rapprochement between taiwan and china continues though not as meaningful as advocates would have us believe nor as harmful as critics suggest ecfa is nonetheless a significant economic and political milestone between the two sides of the taiwan strait ecfa also comes on the heels of other positive developments between taiwan and china which include the establishment of direct commercial flights increased tourism in both directions and an agreement from beijing to allow taiwan observer status in the world health assembly yet curiously in the arena of the chinese military buildup opposite taiwan there has been no progress quite to the contrary the aggressive people s liberation army pla buildup has continued unabated in the area of ballistic missiles alone analysts estimate approximately 1 500 missiles are arrayed against the people of taiwan why have we not seen even a modest symbolic step on china s part commensurate with improvements in the economic and political spheres to reduce the military intimidation it imposes on the people of taiwan understanding why the buildup continues informs policy decisions the obama administration must face top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk there are four possible explanations for the continuing chinese military buildup the first is that china s fundamental approach to taiwan carrots and sticks has not changed further beijing has no intent whatsoever to diminish the tools of intimidation and coercion in which so much investment has been made beijing s leaders understand sentiments in taiwan better than we often give credit and the fact remains that in the absence of military threat the people of taiwan would support independence over the so called status quo taiwan s own mainland affairs council s polling suggest that the number of people in taiwan who support status quo now and taiwan independence later represent a majority and has continued to grow thus chinese leaders are forced to conclude that they must retain the military threat to keep taiwan in check the second possible explanation is that the civilian leaders in china are unwilling or perhaps even unable to challenge pla leadership many china analysts note growing strains in civil military relations in china some of the most sensitive issues between military and civilian leadership relate to the pla budget and justification for its continued growth were the pla to acquiesce on taiwan it knows its resources could be threatened it is plausible that chinese civilian leaders are choosing not to have this fight with the pla the third possible explanation is that the military buildup opposite taiwan is really aimed at priorities well beyond taiwan the capabilities designed to threaten taiwan have other uses perhaps even against u s treaty allies such as japan and finally a fourth possible explanation is that china might be willing to pull back missiles and reduce the threat but it is waiting for the right time and the right deal the first three explanations are not mutually exclusive and may provide a mutually reinforcing rationale for the continued buildup yet for the fourth possible explanation to be true the first three must all be overcome in short there are strong forces at play that may prevent chinese civilian leaders from saying let s make a deal why does this matter to the united states if the pla military buildup opposite taiwan continues apace the need to provide taiwan with weapons for self defense also continues this should be manageable if washington doesn t lose its nerve the u s approach over the course of many years has been to make weapons available to taiwan so that taipei s leaders have the confidence to go to the negotiating table with beijing this approach is paying off see ecfa and other recent developments but some would have us abandon it just when benefits are being reaped taiwan s president ma ying jeou understands this very well and has consistently asked the u s to make more modern weapons available to taiwan but does washington understand this either through willful misdirection some in the u s recently advocated reduced sales to taiwan because they believe china is pulling back or through naivete others believe china will soon reduce the threat to taiwan so the u s shouldn t incite china with further arms sales the obama administration appears to be on the verge of altering an approach to taiwan and to the asia pacific region as a whole that has served our interests well the obama administration has gone to great lengths to deny a taiwan arms sales freeze is in place perhaps protesting a bit too much why does the administration continue a fiction that taiwan has not formally requested more f 16 fighters why do mid and junior level officials within the obama administration allude to instructions from senior leadership to hold congressional notifications on taiwan arms sales and not to expect another major sale in 2010 it is important that the obama administration understand what is driving china s military buildup and why there is strong rationale for the pla s threatening posture opposite taiwan to grow more provocative it also is important that the obama administration understand the u s role in supporting long term peace and stability in the taiwan strait even after ecfa a strong and capable
