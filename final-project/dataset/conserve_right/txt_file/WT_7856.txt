icbms at the yangfang training ground near beijing the site has been used in the past as a gathering point for large military parades participation in the large prc anniversary military parade is usually a strong indicator that a weapon is operational said rick fisher a china military affairs expert mr fisher who closely monitors chinese military developments said the entry into service of the

concerns two versions of the fiscal 2020 defense authorization bill contain language that would ban using taxpayer funds to buy chinese buses or train cars the house version of the defense bill where democrats are in charge would prohibit the u s government from buying chinese rail cars but does not ban the use of taxpayer funds to purchase chinese electric buses the bill produced in the republican majority senate contains a ban on purchases of all chinese made transportation products including both railcars and buses the senate version sources say is an effort to prevent the purchase of electric buses made by a chinese firm byd which has a record of poor quality in its products the national security concerns are based on fears the chinese made buses and trains come with location trackers and other gear that could be used to spy on americans the house version prohibits transit agencies from buying railcars an estimated 18 billion market from chinese state owned state controlled or state subsidized firms the senate bill also includes buses sen john cornyn texas republican is pushing to keep the blanket ban on chinese transportation products his home district includes the dallas based trinity industries inc a major domestic railcar manufacturer the house version is being pushed by house ways and means committee chairman richard neal massachusetts democrat
