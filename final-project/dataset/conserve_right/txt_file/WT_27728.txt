tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn the president s budget no longer plays much of a practical role in the federal spending process but all sides are still looking forward to monday s release of his 2020 blueprint as an important political statement mr trump is more than a month behind the deadline with the government shutdown having skewed the schedule and monday s release is just a first draft with the detailed volumes still to come a week later it will give congress a sense for his overall trajectory on spending and taxes though given how little weight his past two budgets carried or indeed those of the obama administration some lawmakers squinted to find the relevance in the annual exercise top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens well i guess i could say that it s part of the tradition of the country and the congress so to that extent it s worthwhile said house budget committee chairman john a yarmuth kentucky democrat in terms of its ultimate impact it doesn t have much relevance the request is set to include at least 8 6 billion in new money for u s mexico border wall construction a request top democrats said sunday that congress will reject the budget is projected to balance over 15 years in the president s plan which assumes the economy will grow by an average of about 3 percent over the next decade according to a senior administration official the president s budget is part of the 1974 budget act which modernized how congress spends taxpayers money the white house submits its plan spanning thousands of pages and charts for where nearly every dollar could be spent then congress runs it through the wringer the house and senate work on their own budgets and eventually congress writes the spending bills that actually dole out the money increasingly there s a major disconnect between the beginning and the end of that process i ve said for a couple of decades now that the president s budget is a list of suggestions congress is in charge of budgeting said senate budget committee chairman mike b enzi wyoming republican mr enzi said the volumes of data the government publishing office will churn out on budget day once a major event for newspapers lobbyists and lawmakers are overkill at this point a letter of suggestions would be more helpful and more read he said but democrats say that if nothing else mr trump s budget will offer them a useful contrast as he gears up for re election in 2020 and both parties jockey to defend their respective majorities in the house and senate i think it s an indication of the priorities and the values of the president and from our perspective that s a great contrast we d love to run based on that mr yarmuth said past trump blueprints called for tax cuts repeal of obamacare a boost in defense money and deep domestic spending cuts he s gotten tax cuts and the military spending increases but failed to repeal obamacare and has seen congress roundly reject his moves to slash domestic spending the last two years mr trump accepted a deal he got his military spending increases but had to accept nearly commensurate domestic spending increases the white house is aiming to break that equivalency this year the budget request is set to cut domestic discretionary spending by about 5 percent and increase money for the military to 750 billion about 174 billion of which would come from a special overseas war fund that doesn t count against budget caps gop lawmakers say they re prepared to back the president up even if it does rely on the war funding gimmick defense is a priority that can t just be a number pulled out of the air it has to be based on what the threats are said rep chris stewart utah republican and if we can do that without at the same time plussing up everything else then that s something i would support rep james p mcgovern massachusetts democrat said the president s plan is unlikely to get much traction on capitol hill i don t think the majority of the people in this country are as callous as the president he said i think they want a leader with a conscience and the one thing he has demonstrated over and over again is he doesn t have one sen sheldon whitehouse said presidents budgets have outlived their time i m sure it s useless the rhode island democrat said of mr trump s upcoming plan that s not just a slap at the trump administration although his budgets are completely unfathomably bad even when the obama white house did this we d vote unanimously against them mr yarmuth and mr enzi are already in the process of crafting their own respective 2020 budget plans but it seems unlikely the house and senate will settle on a final agreement given the acrimony of the newly divided congress miracles happen i guess mr yarmuth said practically speaking lawmakers appear to be more focused on striking another deal to lift the discretionary spending caps congress has lived under and worked arou
