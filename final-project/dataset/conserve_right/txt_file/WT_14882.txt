qualitatively and quantitatively improving its strategic missile forces the report states beijing will likely continue to invest considerable resources to maintain a limited nuclear force to ensure the people s liberation army can deliver a damaging retaliatory nuclear strike top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the report states for the first time that china appears to be developing a third road mobile icbm possibly capable of carrying a multiple independently targetable re entry vehicle additionally the report provides new details on china s efforts to develop missile defenses and says china conducted a warhead intercept test as part of the system china also has built its first jin class ballistic missile submarine that appears ready but its missile the jl 2 a variant of the df 31 is still being flight tested a disclosure in the annual assessment reveals china s deep underground facilities in the north that is connected with more than 3 000 miles of tunnels the facilities are used for storing and hiding missiles and nuclear warheads and for command bunkers hardened against nuclear attacks the facilities were built on the chinese belief that the weapons and headquarters are less vulnerable to attack the chinese military has been using the underground facilities since the early 1950s u s officials said most details of chinese nuclear arms previously were kept secret china s strategic missile force the second artillery corps sac has developed and utilized underground facilities since deploying its oldest liquid fueled missile systems and continues to utilize them to protect and conceal their newest and most modern solid fueled mobile missiles the report says the facilities include an obscure tunnel network stretching more than 3 000 miles the report said china s underground nuclear sites are based on beijing s assumption that it might have to absorb an initial nuclear blow prior to engaging in nuclear counterattack the report says according to the newsletter the diplomat a recent presentation at the naval war college disclosed that the underground facilities were made public by china s state run cctv in march 2008 the television network showed some of the tunneling at a location in mountainous northern hubei province the facilities reportedly are located hundreds of yards below ground although secrecy and ambiguity remain china s predominant approach in the nuclear realm occasional disclosure of information on some missile related underground facilities is consistent with an effort to send strategic signals on the credibility of its limited nuclear arsenal the report says the published reports have shown images of tunnels modern network based security and control centers and advanced camouflage measures the report says the underground military facilities also are used to protect and hide command posts and communications sites to store weapons and equipment and to protect people richard fisher a china military affairs analyst said the report is significant for listing strategic nuclear forces that show an estimated increase of up to 25 new icbms some with multiple warheads in a year and the first references to china s program for nationwide missile defenses taken together a well protected growing icbm force that will soon have active defenses should be of great concern to the united states said mr fisher of the international assessment and strategy center china will not reveal its missile buildup plans or its anti ballistic missile plans so this simply is not the time to be considering further cuts in the u s nuclear force as is the obama administration s intention mr fisher said china s hints and unofficial signs for decades that it does not seek large nuclear forces are not credible and are in line with similar disinformation themes such as china s claims that it is not preparing for space warfare not selling arms to rogue states and not seeking global hegemony chinese military officials on at least two occasions since 1995 have threatened to use nuclear weapons directly or indirectly against the united states in october 1995 gen xiong guangkai said of any conflict over taiwan that if you hit us we can hit back the general then said that in the end you care more about los angeles than you do about taipei reported to the white house at the time as a threat to use nuclear weapons in 2005 gen zhu chenghu told reporters in beijing that if the u s military used conventionally armed weapons on chinese territory we will have to respond with nuclear weapons china s military in january rebuffed an appeal from defense secretary robert m gates to hold strategic nuclear talks a classified state department cable from beijing in 2008 quoted chinese assistant foreign minister he yafei as telling visiting u s officials that china does not favor displaying the same transparency regarding nuclear weapons holdings or delivery platforms that the united states u k and france have shown since doing so would eliminate the value of china s strategic deterrent on missile defenses the report for the first time revealed that china is developing a nationwide umbrella of nonexplosive high speed interceptors that can hit missiles and other aerospace vehicles at heights of up to 50 miles china frequently criticizes the similar u s missile defense system as undermining stability china also is continuing to develop anti satellite weapons that were first tested in 2007 causing a debris field in space that continues to threaten orbiting spacecraft the report says china continues to develop and refine this system which is one component of a multidimensional program to limit or prevent the use of space based assets by potential adversaries during times of crisis
