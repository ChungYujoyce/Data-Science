 sign in joe biden s shoot from the lip appeal could prevail manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion you can observe a lot by just watching yogi berra or joe biden the media fixation on the largest republican field of presidential candidates in history misses the very real crisis democrats are facing as their slam dunk nominee s campaign unravels before their eyes a year ago virtually everyone agreed that hillary rodham clinton would not only be easily nominated but was the odds on favorite to succeed president obama now with the fbi on her tail a string of less than inspiring appearances and interviews and polls showing her fading democrats are faced with the question of what to do if her campaign collapses vermont sen bernard sanders has been the main problem for her until recently he s surged in the polls on the strength of his populist socialist message and closed the gap to just a few points in some early state polls with hillary s approval ratings especially on the issue of trustworthiness in the tank some in the democratic party and especially the obama white house have been casting about for a more viable candidate many of them liken mr sanders challenge of mrs clinton to minnesota sen eugene mccarthy s crusade against lyndon johnson in 1968 by demonstrating that in essence the emperor wore no clothes mccarthy opened the door to more serious alternatives to the failed president top stories you are not going to die from covid 19 australian researchers see virus design manipulation coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history vice president joe biden s name is now being discussed as a potentially viable alternative and not just by joe and his friends it is even believed by many in washington that mr obama s political team which like their boss has never held mrs clinton in high regard have been periodically fueling the biden speculation mr obama s spokesperson has said that picking joe biden was the best political decision the president had ever made better one can only assume than selecting mrs clinton as his secretary of state it has even been reported that the president has given mr biden his blessing to run if he runs and wins both the nomination and the presidency joe biden would be the oldest american ever elected president but to do that he would first have to overcome his well earned reputation for political foot in mouth disease although mr biden himself has been unusually restrained he has made it clear that he is at least contemplating getting into the race the late arlen specter who served with mr biden in the senate for years and rode the amtrak train to washington with him used to quip that he didn t get to start talking until after the train left wilmington where mr biden departed it s not just that joe biden talks he s the yogi berra the loveable king of malaprops of american politics he s a perpetual gaffe machine remember it was joe who famously observed the number one job facing the middle class happens to be as barack says a three letter word jobs j o b s it was joe who said when the stock market crashed franklin roosevelt got on the television and didn t just talk about the princes of greed of course franklin roosevelt didn t become president until long after the stock market crashed and television wasn t even available to the public in 1929 not all of mr biden s verbal miscues have been as humorous it was joe biden who said stand up and let em see you to a wheelchair bound state senator his famous lifting of a speech from a british member of parliament neil kinnock to use as part of his own biography made him a laughing stock and helped put an end to his presidential hopes in 1988 like yogi for all of his famed verbal hiccups mr biden still comes across as affable even likeable it s easy to see voters voting him the candidate with whom they d most like to share a beer but harder to envision them voting to put him in the oval office still he might like donald trump be able to parlay his lack of verbal polish into electoral success this year with voters fed up with tightly scripted vocally perfect candidates reading other people s words the fact that hillary rodham clinton won t answer reporters questions and is at her best only in prepackaged video pieces has become a real problem for her ultimately voters will see the real hillary and wonder who the heck she is voters are looking for authenticity and mr biden s shoot from the lip style may be appealing maybe he ll even be tempted to plagiarize from yogi who once claimed i never said most of the things i said especially his famous make no mistake about this hillary rodham clinton is as qualified or more qualified than i am to be vice president of the united states of america and quite frankly it might have been a better pick than me there s an old chinese curse popularized by robert f kennedy and junior soprano may you live in interesting times the most interesting of political times will be 2016 as yogi or maybe joe would say it ain t over till it s over charlie gerow is a political and public relations consultant in harrisburg pa manage newsletters copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint
