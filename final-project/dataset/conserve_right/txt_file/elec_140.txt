hollande roundly defeated the national front s marine le pen who campaigned on an anti immigration big government platform le pen s candidacy was about more than membership of the european union or the merits of an open society but about the liberal pro market values that have lifted billions out of poverty in the last half century her defeat is not yet a win for globalization or economic liberalization the problems are still there analyst antonio barroso told reason last month and it s the challenge of these leaders particularly macron to alleviate some of these problems in the next five years otherwise we ll be in the same position next time neither is macron s victory a victory yet for globalization or free markets and it s certainly not a win for barack obama the french media or the west as msnbc s joy ann reid suggested it s barely a win for the eu which is still bungling brexit negotiations and facing a loss of popularity across the continent even countries that have joined the eu more recently than western european ones and have been historically enthusiastic like poland have elected euroskeptic governments macron must now commit to the kind of economic reforms that get the french government which accounts for 57 percent of gdp and carries a gdp to debt ratio of 100 percent out of the way alleviating the economic pain it causes and dispelling the appeal of simplistic populists these are reforms the eu has sometimes suggested but they are not the kinds of reforms wholeheartedly supported by other factions commenters like reid insist the french election is a victory for hollande becomes the first president in the history of the french fifth republic not to seek a second term the socialist started his presidency rejecting his predecessor s attempts at reform but eventually appeared to come to understand the need for reforms and liberalization to rehabilitate the french economy in 2015 the hollande government passed a set of reforms that were known as the macron law which included such provisions as making it easier to lay off employees and allowing more stores to stay open on sundays and in the evenings the law was passed without a vote in the parliament which macron defended from criticism of being anti democratic is it democratic to keep procrastinating macron said at the time there is a moment when you have to act macron s proposed reforms during the presidential campaign were not as well defined or bold as that of the republicans francois fillon who became embroiled in a scandal over hiring family members for no show government jobs in the end the second round presidential election was the first that did not include a member of either of france s major two parties the socialists and the party now known as the republicans le pen s loss was not unexpected she trailed by about 20 points in head to head polling against macron and ultimately finished nearly 25 percent behind him comparisons of le pen to both brexit because of her opposition to the eu or donald trump because of their shared rhetoric on immigration and radical islamic terrorism are misguided brexit was a referendum on british membership in the european union untethered from specific policy agendas which will be worked out in the june parliamentary elections there and beyond and trump despite his populist pro entitlement rhetoric is not the kind of anti capitalist that le pen made herself out to be le pen was able to perform better than any previous national front candidate though in a strategic move she technically left the party weeks before the election because in the last decade she has tried to distance herself and her party from the kind of anti semitism and racism of her father jean marie le pen who disowned her after she suspended his party membership the younger le pen as economist emmanuel martin explained to us last month also ditched any lip service to smaller government instead she embraced the welfare state winning over much of the old french communist party and many trade unionists along the way le pen s success as far as it went is a symptom of decades of anti free market rhetoric where the same economic interventionists and central planners who thwart the progress brought on by globalization blame the forces they seek to stop on their own failures the growing support for illiberal economically backward policies across the political spectrum in the west is a troubling product of that rhetoric ironically it comes while many latin american countries as the economist s intelligence unit pointed out earlier this year are returning to the sober policies of pro market center right candidates after years of populist leftists who have left their populations worse off than they were next trump s

otherwise we ll be in the same position next time bets anyone place yer bets i m sure european nations will move towards free markets and limited government real soon they have a pretty strong record of defeating socialism given that le pen s best performance was with a the youth vote and b women and her worst performance was with the over 65 vote i suspect the globalist faction is going to find itself in an tighter situation by 2022 i hope so the globalist anti us sovereignty crowd has high jacked the left wing politics in america today i am so happy that i never have hear those most ominous words president crooked hillary but i fear the establishments globalist movement and wholly owned msm that is alive and well as much as ever beware this battle is won but the globalist msm fights on if president trump s only accomplishment ever was to beat all possible odds against both political parties and the entire left wing and v r w c and the entire globalist establishment and their establishment msm to save our national sovereignty he may have become our absolute presidential all time mvp on january 20 2017 if president trump s only accomplishment ever was to beat all possible odds against both political parties and the entire left wing and v r w c and the entire globalist establishment and their establishment msm to save our national sovereignty he may have become our absolute presidential all time mvp on january 20 2017 absolutely that victory can t be understated it proves at least a remnant of our political power as voters still exists i m making over 7k a month working part time i kept hearing other people tell me how much money they can make online so i decided to look into it well it was all true and has totally changed my life this is what i do http www webcash10 com pretty cool how every news outlet calls this election a win for the moderate left guy over the crazy right win la pen what is right wing about gaining communist support and appealing to big government and entitlements there is no such thing as right wing in politics at least not as far as actual elected officials are concerned people are still stupid enough to think that the nazi s national socialists were a right wing faction just because they could call hitler s atrocities the opposite of the peace loving rational communists the fascists are all about government collusion and cronyism if i recall correctly obama was quite good at that and trump is well on his way politics is such a hilarious and disgusting game played out on the lemming sheep who lap up everything they are told basically you have free market capitalism and those who are intelligent enough to know that that is our best hope to strive for then you have everything else under the sun which ultimately is a force of marxist thought or just blatant corruption to start with leave the right britney alone basically you have free market capitalism and those who are intelligent enough to know that that is our best hope to strive for then you have everything else under the sun which ultimately is a force of marxist thought or just blatant corruption to start with and the question is rarely to never which one will win almost always how far will the former be bent and contorted in order to accommodate the latter yep and the pols will gladly use the discontent to blame capitalism because nothing says votes like the plight of the luddite who cannot hold a real job sure but the latter is also bent contorted to accommodate the former yes but what happens when international committees government get bigger through pushing free trade deals and agreement rounds ie gatt i don t disagree entirely free market capitalism is a key factor but i would like to see more r d go into enough redistribution of our u s gnp go to preserving and vitalizing a strong middle class i think employee owned industrial industry at home in the lower 48 could help immensely no better time than now with rebuilding our domestic labor force at better wages on everyone s mind to encourage putting us back into it middle class and the money where the mouth is we bailed out the banks time to repay the favor so even more time and money is suddenly going to find you that magic benevolent redistribution scheme that s pure idiocy people without money need to be free to find their own ways to acquire and build resources people with these good ideas are in the way just step the fuck aside le pen s candidacy was about more than membership of the european union or the merits of an open society but about the liberal pro market values that have lifted billions out of poverty in the last half century what fucking difference will pro market values matter if your entire country is muslim and you live under sharia and the constant threat of terrorism i cannot take libertarians seriously don t worry we do take trumpistas like you and their predilection for hysterical fearmongering very seriously they burnt down the museum destroyed the war memorial and made my children into sex slaves but at least i have muh nap and low taxes libertarians not the war memorial which european country is living under sharia law it s always right around the corner isn t it the spanish libertarian juan ramon rallo wrote on his facebook page what did survive last sunday in france was a socialdemocratic consensus facing an unhinged threat from a fascist like nationalism nothing more than that it s thus very difficult for a libertarian to be exited by macron except as someone who defeated a much worse alternative sometimes not moving backwards looks like progress no one expects that spanish libertarian oh uh nevermind cb spanish libertarians exist does not compute only white people can be libertarian alt right spanish people aren t white i think you re thinking of hispanic but that is classified as an ethnicity and not a race fyi spanish people are not hispanic there are rumors to the effect that spanish people aren t really white same with sicilians something about moorish blood or something there are rumors to the effect that spanish people aren t really white same with sicilians something about moorish blood or something there are rumors to the effect that spanish people aren t really white same with sicilians something about moorish blood or something there are rumors to the effect that spanish people aren t really white same with sicilians something about moorish blood or something ok that s a bizarre justification for the comment what rumors fyi genetics is not based off of rumors from some guy on twitter fe wakawaka spanish people aren t white they aren t waspy the only kind of white that coulter likes i don t really know anything about macron but he sounds like a garden variety crony capitalist catering progressive sure he might be better than the socialists on free market reforms in france but i bet he will aso deliver a heavy dose of finger waving nannyism he s an ex rothschild investment banker socialist party member and flipped between government economic positions and his banking ties oh and his gilf wife is 64 i know the french tend to be much more open minded about having affairs and sexuality in general but it does strike me as a bit weird that this macron guy married his former teacher who is nearly 25 years older than him not that there is anything wrong with that but what does it say about his character that he seems to need a permanent mommy figure i assume the old lady is just a beard and that either he s another anthony weiner going after teenage girls or he prefers the company of men as marge simpson famously said he prefers the company of men i thought the same thing but didn t think that was a big deal for the french they don t seem to mind if a guy goes after teenage girls either just ask roman polanski i m sure he is simply a whore for that old bag s money and or access to prestige or some nefarious reason he is a politician after all no story there other than the obvious macron must now commit to the kind of economic reforms that get the french government which accounts for 57 percent of gdp and carries a gdp to debt ratio of 100 percent out of the way snort the law was passed without a vote in the parliament which macron defended from criticism of being anti democratic is it democratic to keep procrastinating macron said at the time there is a moment when you have to act well hang on now i can see how this could be viewed as victory for barack obama le pen s success as far as it went is a symptom of decades of anti free market rhetoric where the same economic interventionists and central planners who thwart the progress brought on by globalization blame the forces they seek to stop on their own failures the growing support for illiberal economically backward policies across the political spectrum in the west is a troubling product of that rhetoric this bears double emphasis the white working class that backed trump in michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania is none other than the same union labor vote which destroyed their own industries by making them uncompetitive in global markets they scapegoat immigration and trade for problems brought about by decades of institutionalized unionization of american industry particularly in exactly the places that backed trump the most this a problem of the failed policies of the left and what is effectively a left wing national socialist takeover of the republican party decades of telling people that unions are awesome and capitalists are the enemy and workers should all go on strike to demand higher wages benefits and the government should force business to negotiate with them destroyed the american manufacturing base not trade not immigration not automation the fucking unions did it and they have still not learned that lesson decades of telling people that unions are awesome and capitalists are the enemy and workers should all go on strike to demand higher wages benefits and the government should force business to negotiate with them destroyed the american manufacturing base unions haven t had much of a good rep in this country since public sector unions became more prominent in the labor movement also one could argue that refusing to negotiate with a union is a violation of the workers right to free association and nobody told anybody that the capitalists are the enemy people just naturally figured that out by themselves not trade not immigration not automation the fucking unions did it and they have still not learned that lesson if that s the case why the hell is the manufacturing sector in germany stronger than ours the germans are rather pro union and have laws that actually require companies to staff their supervisory boards with elected union reps if unions are the cause of deindustrialization it seems to me that germany should have been hardest hit as the economic engine of europe germany is not seeing the same reactionism let s stop calling it mere populism as in other european states like france this is telling as the economic engine of europe this is why i think germany oughta get split in two again north and south maybe maybe throw them a bone by letting them do another anschluss this is the third time that they ve tried to gain control over europe and the first that it s actually succeeded o do you want to get good income at home do you not know how to start earnings on internet there are some popular methods to earn huge income at your home but when people try that they bump

eu s likely to die horribly in the next decade anyway or voting for macron s free market reforms would actually just be a vote for eu authoritarianism and planned economy ten to fifteen years down the road re macron victory not yet a win for globalization or economic reform europe one big happy socialist family that is more than willing to give their hard earned money to bureaucrats politicians and their cronies so they can loot their respective treasuries while simultaneously further enslave their unbelievably naive and economic illiterate masses still addicted to the lies of socialism yeah us europeans never know anything for sure only you big american guys know the real literal truth bout the economy and stuff not like any economic ideas have ever been born in europe that s for sure the problem with the eu is that it s a top down structure with centralized decision making unless the eu undergoes a huge change in this regard prepare for more of the same kinds of extreme politicians rising to the surface to feed more fear and sow more doubt it doesn t take a rational platform to succeed when the general tone is reactionism against the eu and elitism just being post war europe isn t enough anymore people do have real grievances regarding the eu but they ll continue to get awful answers from reactionaries until some fundamental change comes http www bigoliveforpcfreedownload com
