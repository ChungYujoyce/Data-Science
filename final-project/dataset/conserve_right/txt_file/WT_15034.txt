apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion i haven t read dr henry kissinger s latest book on china but as someone who for most of his adult life has lived in china s shadow thinking about and exchanging ideas with students of that civilization i was interested but now i leave evaluating the work to scholars as some have already begun to do that has come about because i heard the good doctor recently laying out a strategy for accommodation with china one could excuse the cacophony of bromides many fallacious dr kissinger trotted out in a recent wide ranging npr interview time was short the interlocutor unskilled and the subject matter vast but here is the crux of what he had to say top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore through thousands of years of chinese history i know no example where outside pressures about the domestic structure of china produced domestic changes in in china this is stupefying a misconception so wrong it puts into question any analysis dr kissinger might otherwise make in fact although obviously a most original civilization china nevertheless like all other societies has been affected often in revolutionary fashion by outside forces space prohibits even an outline of such convoluted episodes but let me cite three chronologically dispersed examples in the first century a d indian buddhism entered china it not only upended chinese metaphysics but introduced such everyday artifacts as bridges tea and the chair as a result of a humiliating defeat by the british in the first opium war 1839 42 taiping a heterogeneous christian sect led two decades of bloody revolt before it was subdued by china s alien imperial rulers the manchu with the help of foreign military state levies shifted from land to trade and military power from central armies to regional warlords slavery polygamy and foot binding were banned if not eliminated most importantly the taiping reaction to foreign intervention ended china s isolation in 1949 after decades of japanese invasion the chinese communists established a unified government modeled on the soviet union to be massively aided for almost two decades by moscow while conventional wisdom now holds that the chinese communists have shed all but the rhetorical trappings of marxism leninism the economy remains largely in government hands a complete break with china s centuries of market economics that concept ironically was passed to europeans as laissez faire by late 16th century european jesuits in beijing dr kissinger s formulation is no blooper it underpins his proposed strategy for dealing with beijings growing power it equates to his 1970s call for detente in the cold war that was to be an acceptance of soviet power in exchange for a hoped for extended period of relaxed tension that strategy proved precarious until moscow imploded in 1990 in no small part as a result of the more confrontational tactics adopted by president reagan historical analogies are misleading and often dangerous but can be marginally useful china today does constitute a somewhat similar problem while no sane person in the west and japan advocates military engagement not to recognize that american interests are jeopardized by an increasingly powerful hostile china is to ignore reality ignoring reality indeed has been until now washington s modus operandi the u s has made great efforts to bring china into the highest world councils with beijing responding by courting pariah regimes that threaten peace and stability washington has pursued free trade and investment with china while beijing responds with unfair trade practices protection for state corporations and markets and financial manipulation washington has sought open exchange of military information and provided security for an expanding china trade but beijing rejects transparency and secretly pursues a rapid military buildup against an unidentified enemy these american policies have strengthened the power and influence of a highly vulnerable chinese regime one facing great economic ambiguities and unpredictable political challenges washington is now re examining how to restrain what could well be a formidable new aggressive power it must not repeat the long prelude to world war ii when east asia storm signals were largely ignored then too involving a burgeoning commercial relationship with a rising asian power japan avoiding a repeat of mistakes requires extensive intensive and knowledgeable debate about beijing s capacities and goals and americas abilities to meet them dr kissinger contributes little to this gargantuan undertaking sol sanders veteran foreign correspondent and analyst writes weekly on the convergence of politics business and economics he can be reached at sol sanders cox net he also blogs at htt
