over the entire resource rich south china sea china has privately called the sea its driveway and is moving its advanced naval forces including ships aircraft and submarines into the region the pentagon announced in november that it would deploy 2 500 marines to a base on the northern tip of australia close to the south china sea another indicator of support for air sea battle is the pentagon s decision to keep 11 aircraft carrier strike groups after considering going down to 10 the budget also preserves funds for u s bombers and cruise missile upgrades on submarines despite those efforts the navy is retiring nine warships used in carrier strike groups and amphibious operations the pentagon budget also would kill plans to build 16 more warships by 2017 additionally the budget

the dangers posed by china s growing economic and military power during the visit this week of chinese vice president xi jinping vice president joseph r biden who recently took the lead on u s china policy from the state department and other agencies said during a meeting with mr xi on tuesday we believe that a rising china is a positive development not only for china but also for the united states and the world mr biden didn t say why but in remarks before the u s chamber of commerce he suggested there had been progress on currency and trade concerns such as rampant intellectual property theft china s propaganda theme for the xi visit was that the united states needs to build trust with the world s most populous communist ruled state no mention was made by mr obama mr biden secretary of state hillary rodham clinton or defense secretary leon e panetta of china s continuing problematic activities that have raised concerns within the defense and intelligence communities among the specific issues are continuing arms proliferation by china to rogue regimes such as iran syria and north korea and support for syria s regime that has engaged in a bloody crackdown that has claimed the lives of thousands of civilians china s military buildup continues apace and was not mentioned in public by any senior administration official the worries include china s anti satellite missile systems that can cripple u s war fighting capabilities and china s large scale strategic nuclear buildup a subject china refuses to discuss in formal or informal talks by far the most worrisome problem is china s relentless cyberassaults on u s computer networks both in the government and the private sector the subject was raised by army gen martin dempsey chairman of the joint chiefs of staff during a senate armed services committee hearing on the defense budget tuesday asked about china s people s liberation army pla cyberattacks on business and national security infrastructure gen dempsey said i believe someone in china is hacking into our systems and stealing technology and intellectual property which at this point is a crime i can t attribute it directly to the pla gen

cyberresponse he said sen lindsay graham south carolina republican told the general that he was having lunch with mr xi after the hearing and wanted to know whether the chairman had anything to say to him happy valentine s day gen dempsey replied stealth defense cuts the obama administration s total defense budget request of 613 billion carefully couched the slashes in spending to make it appear that the cuts represented a modest reduction of about 1 percent or about 5 2 billion however republican congressional aides said the spending request masks the fact that compared with the base budget request submitted a year ago the budget is 45 3 billion less aides said the budget is carefully drafted to avoid making the cuts look severe during the presidential election year a tactic that resonated with most mainstream news media outlets playing the budget story as requesting only relatively small cuts the budget will increase year to year between fiscal 2013 and 2017 but actual funding will decline yearly by 0 3 percent also the cuts are front loaded so that more than half will be made in the next five years totaling 259 4 billion of the 487 billion mandated by the budget control act a third of the cuts over five years will come from slashing 76 billion from weapons modernization programs 24 percent will be taken from an anticipated 61 billion in what the pentagon calls bureaucratic efficiencies and 53 billion is expected from cutting force structure force cuts include eliminating at least eight army brigade combat teams six marine corps combat battalions and
