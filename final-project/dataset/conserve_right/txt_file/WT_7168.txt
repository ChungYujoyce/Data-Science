forever why someonewouldseek to do this has many answers albeit few good ones especially in the hands of the chinese communist party ccp whethercovid 19was introduced to the world by mistake or by design has yet to be determined we may never prove it entirely but we do know this top chinese virology expert shizhengli widely known for her research in bat related coronaviruses worked atthewuhan institute of virology and publishednumerous reports on animal virusesthat can attack humans according to georgetown epidemiologist daniel lucey the first case of wuhan virus occurred in november 2019

slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century even though ccp officials lied having us believe that all cases originated at thehuanan market a third of theoriginal casessomehowwerecontractedwithout anyconnection to the market butwhilethe lancet medical journalwas questioning the wet

the wuhan region in october 2019 for the military world games thus infecting the local population nice try but none of the roughly 300 service members or staff tested positive for covid 19 anywhereelse these actions are considered crimes the least of which arenegligent homicide or involuntary manslaughter what do you do when you realize you ve been living with someone that sattempting

china s active and willful disregard for life at worst we went towarin afghanistan for a fraction of the lives those terrorists took from us it s long overduethat we hold chinaresponsible for its destabilizing and pugilistic actions a good start would be repaying us for the billions of dollars in sovereign debton whichchinahasdefaulted since world war ii that could certainly serve as the down payment on whatarguablywillbe trillions of dollars in pandemic damagesdirectly caused by the chinese communist party and we need to collect all of it regarding the chinese communists americamust
