apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic democrats already have lined up possible charges if they choose to pursue impeachment 2 0 still pending is a wide open probe launched by rep adam b schiff california democrat mr schiff has been investigating president trump his family and businesses the trump organization over the congressman s suspicions of blackmail money laundering and bribery republican staffers say the inquiry was put on hold last fall pending the ukraine impeachment proceedings led by mr schiff but there is no sign mr schiff has given up trying to prove mr trump is corrupt and if the president is impeached again the charges would likely come from this probe informed sources said top stories hogan says maryland can begin testing residents for covid 19 without appointment symptoms dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk mr trump alluded to a new impeachment push thursday so we will probably have to do it again because these people have gone stone cold crazy but i have beaten him all my life and i will beat him again if i have to mr trump said at a post senate acquittal celebration at the white house but what they are doing is very unfair house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat said thursday that trump investigations will go on meanwhile house judiciary committee chairman jerrold nadler of new york said after wednesday s senate acquittal that it s likely the ukraine probe will go on his committee also has been investigating any trump russia election conspiracy mr trump said of mr nadler i always beat him and i had to beat him another time and i will probably have to beat him again because if they find that i happen to walk across the street and maybe go against the light or something let s impeach him of course they re going to try again said pam bondi a former florida attorney general and member of the president s senate trial defense team on fox news the unwillingness of the democrats to accept the results of their gross abuse of their constitutional power is a crime against the public trust john m dowd mr trump s former defense counsel told the washington times mr schiff chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence announced an anti trump staff investigation on feb 6 2019 upon taking control of the committee some of his allegations mirror claims pushed by opposition research firm fusion gps and its co founder glenn simpson organizers of the discredited democratic party funded dossier spread all over washington mr schiff s trump plans came one month before former special counsel robert mueller released an extensive report whose bottom line was no trump russia election conspiracy mr schiff s allegations which remain under investigation money laundering mr schiff said during the prior congress the committee began to pursue credible reports of money laundering and financial compromise related to the business interests of president trump his family and his associates the president s actions and posture towards russia during the campaign transition and administration have only heightened fears of foreign financial or other leverage over president trump and underscore the need to determine whether he or those in his administration have acted in service of foreign interests since taking office the mueller report didn t mention any financial ties between mr trump and the kremlin mr trump s former attorney michael cohen told the committee he knew of no russia money flowing into the trump organization the president s real estate development firm russia conspiracy mr schiff said the extent of any links and or coordination between the russian government or related foreign actors and individuals associated with donald trump s campaign transition administration or business interests in furtherance of the russian government s interests blackmail mr schiff said whether any foreign actor has sought to compromise or holds leverage financial or otherwise over donald trump his family his business or his associates whether president trump his family or his associates are or were at any time at heightened risk of or vulnerable to foreign exploitation inducement manipulation pressure or coercion or have sought to influence u s government policy in service of foreign interests in the year since mr schiff released this road map there have been no leaks to the media perhaps an indication he had not found evidence before he shifted to impeachment mr schiff s spokesman didn t respond to message seeking comment none of these allegations surfaced in the mueller report nor during the schiff led impeachment drive nothing stopping them gop staffers say that mr schiff has not given up on proving money laundering which supposedly revolves around his bank deutsche bank and russia or perhaps around an aborted bid to build a hotel in moscow in 2015 16 schiff will try to redeem himself by continuing his investigations accompanied by the usual slew of misleading leaks to masochistic reporters into trump s connections to both russia and ukraine one republican staffer told the washington times he ll probably go back after trump russia money laundering which is one of schiff s favorite conspiracy theories he doesn t know if it s russians laundering money for trump through the nra trump properties deutsche bank or the trump tower moscow project but he s convinced that somewhere somehow something happened one of fusion gps s allegations is that russians provided illegal campaign donations to the national rifle association s political action committee the nra denied this in letters to the senate meanwhile mr nadler put together a legal staff that has accused mr trump of transgressions outside the ukraine storyline lawyers norman eisen and barry h berke have depicted mr trump as a criminal and liar involved in a number of conspiracies they wrote that trump people could be implicated in russian online trolling and for aiding and abetting computer hacking in announcing mr eisen a former obama administration attorney and mr berke a longtime democratic donor as consultants mr nadler released 81 letters to trump associates demanding various documents mr nadler also has been investigating whether mr trump obstructed justice in the mueller probe but did not include that offense in his impeachment articles mr nadler has not announced an end to these probes mr mueller brought no conspiracy charges against any trump ally just because president trump has been acquitted by the senate paradoxically that doesn t mean the congressional investigations will end j d gordon a trump campaign national security adviser told the times the house committees will keep on pursuing obstruction allegations related to trump russia and keep digging for new details on trump ukraine that s in addition to their wide ranging probes on his taxes bank loans and financial history plus anything else that might help build a case in the media for a historic
