 at first blush associating barack obama with deficits of any sort seems like a complete non story after all this is the president who has presided over four consecutive trillion plus dollar deficits after pledging to slice that number in half by the end of this term he s also the man whose unanimously rejected fy 2013 budget would literally never balance generating additional deficits as far as the eye can see nevertheless seeing red ink splattered on obama s re election campaign s balance sheet still feels strange this group once boasted that it would raise a billion dollars for this cycle and despite obama s recent implications to the contrary the facts show that his operation widely outspent his opponent s in the last election so what to make of this president obama outspent mitt romney 2 to 1 in june even as mr romney far outraised him according to campaign reports filed on friday with the federal election commission leaving mr obama and the democratic party with significantly less cash on hand than mr romney and the republicans as polls show a head to head race mr obama and the democratic national committee spent 70 8 million in june including about 38 million on television advertising as the president s campaign sought to batter mr romney over his ties to bain capital the private equity firm mr romney and the republican national committee spent 38 8 million including about 11 million on television advertising more than double what mr romney s campaign spent in may but far less than mr obama in terms of direct contributions the obama campaign reported more than 46 million in june and total spending of 58 million a 12 million gap still as kevin reported over the weekend obama s claim of being victimized by overwhelming republican money isn t exactly accurate the president continues to crush romney in spending overall and in swing states much of this advantage can be attributed to campaign laws which do not permit romney to spend his recent cash spike until after he officially becomes the republican nominee in late august with the law and the calendar on his side for the moment obama has poured roughly 100 million into overwhelmingly negative ads hoping to define his opponent in voters minds obama donors may be wondering about their return on investment national journal notices that polling trends suggest that obama hasn t managed to seize the moment another red flag for team obama is the president s crumbling favorability ratings a troubling departure from his previous strength the question the media should be asking is not how much obama s bain attacks are hurting romney it s whether obama s bain attacks are hurting obama i ll leave you with this related nugget reported by the weekly standard over the weekend remember the one s big may re elect kickoff event in columbus his campaign spent nearly 93 000 to rent a large arena and ended up with thousands of empty seats this turnout fell well short of chicago s expectations hyped expectations disappointing results huge expenditures and resulting deficits sound familiar alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
