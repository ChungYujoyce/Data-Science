27 percent in the united states according to boston consulting group in addition chinese electricity costs rose 66 percent more than twice the united states increase the start of large scale u s shale gas production has helped contain u s electricity costs and the value of china s currency has risen more than 30 percent against the u s dollar over the past decade the higher yuan has raised the cost of chinese goods sold abroad and conversely made u s goods more affordable in china those rising costs have cut china s competitive edge in 2004 manufacturing cost 14 percent less in china than in the united states that advantage has narrowed to 5 percent if the trend toward higher wages energy costs and a higher currency continues boston consulting predicts u s manufacturing will be less expensive
