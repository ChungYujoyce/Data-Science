sanders sits down with bret baier following the debate in the most contentious democratic debate thus far a winnowed field of 10 democratic candidates took the stage in houston thursday night and sparred over hot button issues such as health care and immigration notably this was the first time that frontrunners sen elizabeth warren and former vice president joe biden shared the debate stage at the end of the night joebiden emerged as thewinner and warren and sen bernie sanders were the surprise losers warren and biden exhibited stark differences on style policy and vision for the democratic party embodying two opposing theories of what the party should be debate descends into melee over health care obama socialism as dems struggle to show unity this divide was apparent during an explosive debate over health care during which biden went on the attack against warren d mass and sen bernie sanders i vt for the hidden costs associated with their medicare for all plans warren deflected when asked if middle class taxes will go up to pay for medicare for all saying total costs would go down but not explicitly stating whether taxes for middle class families would increase what we apos re talking about here is what apos s going to happen in families apos pockets warren said this is about candor honesty biden retorted there will be a deductible in your paycheck someone making 60 grand with three kids they apos re going to end up paying 5 000 more surprising loser elizabeth warren though many were watching warren expecting her to deliver a knockout performance the senator fell somewhat short of that expectation while this will likely not impact warren s standing in the presidential race at this early stage which according to most polls is a close second behind biden she did not have the debate moment that many were anticipating she was a surprise loser when the evening was over aside from biden s generally strong performance he compellingly and convincingly delivered his core message of restoring protecting and rebuilding the obama biden record winner joe biden on the other hand the first 30 minutes of the debate during the health care discussion were arguably biden s best moments on the campaign trail to date though the former vice president s performance was not perfect he exhibited a much needed display of strength and preparedness he was the night apos s big winner aside from biden s generally strong performance he compellingly and convincingly delivered his core message of restoring protecting and rebuilding the obama biden record the senator says she apos s for bernie well i apos m for barack biden said about warren apos s support for medicare for all referencing last month s debate when warren said she completely agreed with sanders on medicare for all at the previous debate several progressive candidates took aim at former president obama s legacy on health care as a way to attack biden on his record however in a marked reversal both warren and sen kamala harris of california who sharply criticized obama in the last debate praised the former president for the positive systematic changes to health care that came as a result of obamacare indeed if there was an absentee winner of the debate it was obama aside from biden one of the clearest and most concise health care arguments came from sen amy klobuchar of minnesota who has polled consistently in the low single digits and had yet to have a strong debate moment before thursday night klobuchar said that although sanders may have written the medicare for all bill she actually read the bill noting that under sanders plan we will no longer have private insurance as we know it resulting in millions of americans losing their private insurance similar to previous debates the discussion of immigration had biden on the defensive over the 3 million undocumented immigrants that were deported under the obama administration former housing and urban development secretary julian castro in particular took aim at biden using the moment to attack biden for taking credit for positive elements of the obama legacy and distancing himself from criticism
