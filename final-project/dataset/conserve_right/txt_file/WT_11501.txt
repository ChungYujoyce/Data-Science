ed for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion as chinese battleships advance in the south china sea breaking news that 147 people in tibet have now set their bodies on fire to protest the chinese communist occupation of their homeland adds to fearful tremors racing through asia about china s rise tibet one of china s most prized possessions is a war zone and this poses a great danger to stability in asia in 1973 my father sen daniel patrick moynihan was appointed u s ambassador to india we met tibetan exiles learned of china s conquest of tibet which enlarged communist china s landmass by nearly 50 percent and poses a security threat to india with chinese armies stationed on its himalayan borders for the first time in history for many years i worked with radio free asia and in the 1990s i was a consultant to the international campaign for tibet ict founded in washington in 1988 ict has for many years been seen as the voice of tibet in washington many americans donate generously to ict with trust that their hard earned dollars advance ict s goal protecting human rights and democratic freedoms for the people of tibet but as tibet burns it is time to assess whether ict is achieving its objectives lodi gyari former chief envoy of his holiness the dalai lama last year resigned from his position at director of ict and other staff changes were made many are wondering why richard gere ict board chairman installed matteo mecacci a former italian parliamentarian whose resume shows work in eastern europe but nothing in asia to operate the world s largest and best funded tibet advocacy organization top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots mr mecacci is a prolific blogger in a recent letter to ict donors mr mecacci wrote too many people think of tibet as shangri la a himalayan paradise where everyone lives in peace and harmony nothing could be farther from the truth in a perfect world tibetans would be living in peace and you could stand down your 2015 gift will help give tibetans hope for an end to their suffering and the start of a brighter peaceful future this sounds promising but mr mecacci does not explain exactly how giving money to ict will accomplish this lofty goal ict is hardly a cost effective model of a non profit organization representing a small penniless refugee community indian government surveys report that 150 000 tibetan refugees are trapped in disintegrating settlements with poor often broken families living on less than 1 500 a year ict s annual operating budget is 3 6 million ict s annual report and charity navigator reveal that it spends most of each dollar on overhead including 44 percent for fundraising the 1 6 million spent on fundraising each year reflects a breathtaking level of inefficiency while ict s 2014 financial statements have not been released mr mecacci s annual salary is alleged to be 150 000 based on ict s 2013 tax filing mr mecacci earned 16 800 for less than one month s work in december 2013 and ict spent 640 000 on just one direct mail company in 2002 ict helped push through one substantive bill the tibet policy act that was 13 years ago ict publishes records of human rights abuses in tibet which sadly but plainly have no power to alter china s oppressive rule over of the tibetan people but ict is not addressing the crisis of statelessness that is overwhelming tibetans in exile refugees are especially vulnerable to exploitation bribery and coercion and tibetans are no exception i have interviewed many tibetans in new york city trapped in an illegal alien underground desperate to escape refugee status in india or nepal illegal passport rings operating from india trafficking tibetans to the united states and the proliferation of fake asylum claims have harmed the reputation of tibetans with american officials in 2005 the fake nun scandal erupted when sonam chodon a tibetan from nepal claimed that she was a buddhist nun fleeing persecution in china became a media sensation and was granted asylum but was later charged with using a fake passport and lying to authorities a u s diplomat told me there is a lot of sympathy for the tibetan people but in the past two decades so many have come to the u s on tourist or student visas then immediately claimed asylum used fake papers broken the rules in other ways there is a clear lack of leadership in 1990 the state dept issued 1 000 immigrant visas to tibetans but in 25 years ict has not successfully advanced any legislation allowing more tibetans to resettle in the united states or taken the lead in providing legal counsel about rights and procedures whereby refugees can legally immigrate none of these matters are addressed in mr mecacci s blogs for the many millions of dollars that have flowed through ict over 25 years the story of china s strategic and resource advantage gained by tibet s capture has received scant attention or analysis in january 2014 i testified before the u s house foreign affairs committee about the explosion of chinese hydro dam construction on tibet s rivers and the environmental catastrophe looming over the nations of south and southeast asia which are nourished by tibet s waters afterward members of congress scientists and military officials approached me in evident shock to ask how come we never heard any of this before i was stunned the international campaign for tibet failed to get the basic facts about china s control of tibet the water tower of asia one of the greatest crises facing the 21st century on the desks of congress and the pentagon many tibet support groups are concerned that ict has no clear purpose other than self preservation raising funds to pay for trips to asia comfortable salaries and maintenance of an elegant townhouse in dupont circle officially assessed to be worth 2 7 million many activists groups have done far more on far less but ict remains the top funded tibet organization in america richard gere as head the ict board has said he wants to focus on chinese outreach dialogue and peace this is a noble aspiration but it is more a sentiment than a strategy at this late date ict must make a better case for funding than mr mecacci s breathless and exclamatory message you give me hope about tibet more important you give hope to tibetans for a better future promoting comforting stereotypes of cheerful but needy tibetan refugees is a disservice to the tibetan people and obscures the hard geopolitical facts about what china s dams mines and armies are doing to tibet s environment asia s waters and the region s stability the real story needs to be told maura moynihan daughter of the late sen daniel patrick moynihan has been
