apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap truth can be a casualty when president donald trump talks about deaths from the coronavirus in the united states he s claimed that the united states is on par with germany in keeping down covid 19 deaths which is not the case in mortality reports he s brushed off projections that deaths in his country will double from earlier forecasts misrepresenting how the numbers were calculated these distortions emerged over the past week alongside his relentless bragging about the u s testing system which failed in the crucial early weeks and remains globally subpar pushing to get the country back to normal trump also suggested that children are safe from the coronavirus ignoring the several thousand kids known to have been sickened by it some gravely top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state a look at his remarks and how they compare with the facts death counts trump on pandemic deaths now germany we re very close to germany we have a very good relationship with germany germany has done very good they have a very low mortality rate like we do we have a low mortality rate also remarks thursday in meeting with gov greg abbott r texas the facts the u s is not in germany s league in this regard the u s is experiencing far more reported covid 19 deaths as a proportion of its population than is germany the u s has reported covid 19 deaths at a rate of 234 per 1 million people for germany that rate is 90 deaths per million the u s surpasses many other countries in reported deaths per million too and it leads the world in deaths from the virus overall because countries track covid 19 deaths somewhat differently exact conclusions can t be reached when comparing nations the mortality rate is a different measure from deaths per million it refers to what percentage of people who get the disease die from it the answer is as yet unknown and there are several reasons for that first the count changes every day as new infections and deaths are recorded more important every country is testing differently knowing the real denominator the true number of people who become infected is key to determining what portion of them die some countries the u s among them have had trouble making enough tests available a test shortage means the sickest get tested first even with a good supply of tests someone who s otherwise healthy and has mild symptoms may not be tested and thus go uncounted trump and frankly if you took new york out of the equation we would really have a low mortality rate remarks with abbott the facts new york being part of the u s cannot be subtracted from it to make the numbers look better it s true that new york has experienced far more covid 19 deaths than has any other state trump asked about a white house endorsed model now showing 134 000 deaths from the coronavirus by august doubling its previous prediction those projections are with no mitigation we are doing mitigation remarks to reporters tuesday the facts that s incorrect the projections by the institute for health metrics and evaluation do take into account social distancing and other mitigation which have begun to be loosened in several states at trump s urging the institute based at the university of washington said its revised estimates released monday reflect the recent reopening of many states and relaxing of social distancing restrictions its initial estimates assumed longer stay at home orders lasting through may the revised projections reflect rising mobility in most u s states as well as the easing of social distancing measures expected in 31 states by may 11 indicating that growing contacts among people will promote transmission of the coronavirus the institute said our model now assumes that mandates that are currently still in place and have not been scheduled to be relaxed will stay in place through at least august 4 it added on its website officials on the white house coronavirus task force have praised the institute s work and cited its research in their briefings testing trump in any event we have great testing capacity and have performed 6 5 million tests which is more than every country in the world combined tweet monday the facts this was not remotely true when he said it and it s no closer to the truth now the u s has tested far fewer people than all other countries combined it also lags dozens of countries in testing its population proportionally together just three countries russia germany and italy had reported more tests than the u s when trump tweeted that remains the case as of late friday the u s had reported conducting more than 8 3 million tests since the pandemic began that compared with more than 18 7 million tests by the other countries in the top 10 of the testing count the u s was followed by russia germany italy spain britain india france turkey and united arab emirates children covid 19 trump with young children and children we d like to see the schools open early next season and on time it s incredible how the it s very unique how the children aren t affected but people that have problems and older people are can be very badly hurt injured or die from this problem remarks with native american leaders tuesday in phoenix trump you see how well children seem to do it s incredible we realize how strong children are right remarks with nurses wednesday trump it affects older people it infects if you have any problem heart diabetes even a little weak heart a little diabetes a little this thing is vicious and it can take you out and it can take you out very strongly but children do very well remarks may 3 on fox news the facts his suggestion that children are in the clear is false to say they do very well with the disease is more accurate based on what is known so far his implication that the risk is limited to the old and sick is incorrect it s true kids get sick less often than do adults and tend to be less ill when they do get sick but his statements overlook severe covid 19 illnesses and at least several deaths of children in the u s and they gloss over the fact that kids can spread disease without showing symptoms themselves the centers for disease control and prevention studied the pandemic s effect on different ages in the u s early on and reviewed preliminary research in china where the coronavirus started it said social distancing is important for children too for their own safety and that of others whereas most covid 19 cases in children are not severe serious covid 19 illness resulting in hospitalization still occurs in this age group the cdc study says at the beginning of april the cdc analyzed nearly 150 000 laboratory confirmed u s covid 19 cases and found nearly 2 600 children with the disease since then the number of confirmed cases overall in the u s has rocketed making the april findings very preliminary the pediatric cases that were found at the time though relatively few spanned all ages of childhood the median age of children sick with covid 19 was 11 more than 5 perhaps as many as 20 required hospitalization people 18 to 64 were by far the largest age group sickened by the virus 76 of the confirmed cases studied by the cdc covid 19 was not and is not limited to the oldest people even if they are the most vulnerable age group associated press writers lauran neergaard and meghan
