to enjoy all the benefits of our website get the new statesman s world review email in the 1970s and 80s german lawyers and lawmakers began to discuss the principle of vorsorge foresight the adoption by decision makers of precautionary measures when scientific evidence about an environmental or health hazard is uncertain and the stakes are high the principle was formally introduced in a 1984 german federal government report to the bundestag and its influence grew in 1992 it was incorporated into both the un rio declaration on environment and development and the maastricht treaty for years this principle has been under attack especially from influential right wing think tanks close to governments in london and washington such as the legatum institute and the heritage foundation the charge goes like this the precautionary principle pp is anti scientific it implies the stifling of necessary risk takingand brought to its logical extreme complete paralysis even greater dangers harms and costs can be incurred by the failure to take risks to put it more crudely it is a perfect example of the pro regulatory anti free enterprise dogma that many feel dominates thinking in brussels this concerted attack has been pretty successful although the pp is enshrined in article 191 of the treaty on the functioning of the eu and applied in fields as diverse as health protection biodiversity management and emerging technologies there has been little discussion of it recently even in the context of brexit where one might have assumed it would loom large it constitutes one of the main dividing lines between eu and us approaches to health and environmental regulation including the different approaches to genetically modified crops and neonicotinoid pesticides but covid 19 has provided a moment of opportunity for the pp it resurfaced last month in a guardian articleby academics nassim nicholas taleb and yaneer bar yamm in which they called for a simple exercise of the precautionary principle in a domain where it mattered interconnected complex systems have some attributes that allow some things to cascade out of control delivering extreme outcomes rather than making decisions using complex models based on untested assumptions they argued the uk government should have acted with simplicity and robustness people do not stop to consider possible responses to an avalanche they simply get out of its way this metaphor captures both the strengths and the apparent imprecision of the pp it can be summed up in the classical wisdom of the hippocratic oath first do no harm or a folk nostrum such as better safe than sorry maybe it is better to talk about precautionary principles or a precautionary approach than a single principle which theorists have struggled to define these questions have spawned a vast academic literature but what is fundamentally right and useful and also radical about the pp what does a precautionary approach to the coronavirus crisis look like and which countries have adopted it first comes a speedy acknowledgement of the potential gravity of the threat even before knowing precisely how many people might be infected and become seriously ill this was the approach taken in a number of east asian countries and territories taiwan singapore south korea hong kong and after the initial perhaps fatal attempt to suppress news of the virus china all of these states had learned from their experience of sars in the early 2000s the steps taken rapid and extensive testing contact tracing and isolation social distancing and caution in taiwan s capital taipei the metro has been a sea of masks since february were already prepared and proven part of the precautionary approach is simply being prepared for a disaster which is quite likely to strike no government could say it hadn t been warned about a coming pandemic quite the opposite approach was taken in the uk us and among other countries brazil there was an astonishing lack of preparedness in relation to testing and even essential medical kit even when the first cases occurred in both countries donald trump and boris johnson were inclined to procrastinate and play down the threat as recently as late march trump suggested the us could be opened up and just raring to go by easter the british government despite claiming to be guided by the science issued unclear messages regarding social distancing it was extremely slow to implement testing at scale it was suggested that policy was being guided by the goal of herd immunity and also by nudge theory promoted by the former nudge unit within the cabinet office now the privatised behavioural insights team the uk approach was not precautionary it relied on theories never tested in the context of a major public health emergency rather than robust practical measures proven to be effective and recommended by the who taleb and bar yam also discerned the influence of dominic cummings with his faith in scientism rather than science and it appears a belief that most problems can be solved by algorithms behind all this lurks a failure to decide whether the primary role of the state is to protect its citizens the precautionary approach or to promote their economic chances while the pp has been closely associated with the eu since it first emerged in germany and is enshrined in eu treaties eu countries have had a mixed record in dealing with covid 19 italy and spain currently and tragically have the highest death tolls in the world germany has fared far better aggressive testing and a high provision of
