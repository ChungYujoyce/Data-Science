apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic an active duty army officer is urging a thorough house cleaning of army generals and a restructuring of the service after more than a decade of leadership failures the u s army s generals as a group have lost the ability to effectively function at the high level required of those upon whom we place the responsibility for safeguarding our nation army lt col daniel l davis stated in an article published online by armed forces journal in col davis view senior leaders have produced a 20 year record of organizational acquisitional and strategic failures top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed these failures have been accompanied by the hallmarks of an organization unable and unwilling to fix itself aggressive resistance to the reporting of problems suppression of failed test results public declarations of success where none was justified and the absence of accountability he wrote to compound the problem the army is preparing to reorganize the service into smaller and less capable forces as threats become more unpredictable and adversaries more dangerous col davis said the purge of generals should be similar to what occurred 70 years ago when army chief of staff gen george c marshall found an officer corps ill suited for winning world war ii he forced scores of generals into retirement today s times like marshall s call for a reformation of the general officer corps col davis said recent army failures include the canceled comanche helicopter that cost 6 9 billion the canceled crusader mobile cannon that wasted 7 billion and the future combat system scrapped after 20 billion was spent on it high budget programs currently facing problems include the ground combat vehicle program and the joint tactical radio system the army also has failed to properly modernize its decades old division structure col davis said the modular brigade combat team bct system was introduced despite concerns it would produce less capable forces after spending nearly nine years and reportedly 75 billion on the reorganization army leaders are now trying to reverse course by returning the third battalion to the bct col davis said on combat operations col davis stated that since 2004 senior military leaders claimed combat successes in afghanistan despite substantial evidence the conflict is not being won and a stalemate is likely another major concern is that after a decade of counterinsurgency warfare the army is not ready for a future state on state war he said china in particular has been preparing for decades for a future conflict and the united states needs to be prepared for contingencies involving a modernized chinese military in short during a decade in which the u s army and marine corps have been focused almost exclusively on counterinsurgency and small unit warfare a new generation of chinese military leaders has deepened its understanding and application of conventional warfare col davis said the army s strategic guidance for 2013 states that the service is preparing to deal with the asia pacific but lacks specifics he said there is little in the way of explaining what missions the army will need to be prepared for beyond the bumper sticker of across the range of military operations col davis noted what is needed now is real change not mere cutting al qaeda in sinai as the military crackdown on civil unrest continues in egypt al qaeda linked terrorists are quietly building networks in the sinai peninsula israel s government in the past played down the threat and egypt s military currently is engaged in covert military operations there a u s official said the al qaeda threat in the sinai was brought home to the israelis this week on tuesday terrorists fired a missile at the israeli city of eilat the rocket was intercepted by israel s iron dome anti missile interceptors ansar bayt al maqdis the terrorist group that operates in the sinai carried out the attack the rocket assault followed an israeli drone strike on the group that killed four terrorists several days earlier as they were preparing to fire a rocket into israel egyptian military and security forces meanwhile have stepped up air strikes and other operations in the sinai against the terrorists since the recent military takeover that ousted egyptian president mohammed morsi egyptian military spokesman ahmad ali stated in a facebook post aug 11 that the military is working covertly to pursue terrorists and criminals in the sinai china precision strike china s military is building conventional precision guided missiles in an effort to become asia s hegemon and force the u s military to operate thousands of miles from china s coasts according to a study made public this week china s growing arsenal of highly accurate land based ballistic missiles is the most conspicuous element of beijing s anti access area denial weapons writes former pentagon official barry d watts in a report produced by the center for strategic and budgetary assessments china s unique df 21d anti ship ballistic missile which can hit aircraft carriers 1 200 miles out at sea is the weapon causing the greatest concern to the u s navy he states in the report the evolution of precision strike however mr watts says the new missile faces challenges in coordinating its strike capabilities at long distances against maneuvering ships it would take a df 21d about 10 minutes to reach a nuclear powered carrier moving at 30 knots the warship could cover five miles during the flight requiring the precision guided missile s maneuverable warhead to cover 79 square miles during the attack the chinese military s over the horizon radars could detect and track a carrier strike group well out in the western pacific but the long wavelengths of those radars would not provide the accuracy needed for target updates against a fast moving naval combatant he states the chinese would need reconnaissance satellites to guide the missile china currently is deploying navigation satellites china s goal is to force u s air and naval forces to operate up to 1 500 miles from china complicating u s efforts to knock out chinese facilities in a conflict including those located in thousands of miles of underground tunnels mr watts offers several steps to meet the challenge they include developing high energy lasers to knock out missiles using sea mines to divert chinese military efforts to minesweeping operations adopting alternative satellite systems to reduce reliance on large and vulnerable satellites fielding new low yield highly accurate nuclear warheads for use against underground facilities mr watts states that the u s military has shown little inclination to develop new operational and organization steps to deal with the threat instead the military services have largely taken evolving american capabilities for reconnaissance strike and layered them onto existing operational concep
