tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap newtown charleston orlando parkland and now after mass shootings in el paso texas and dayton ohio congress again is confronted with the question of what if anything lawmakers should do to combat the scourge of gun violence afflicting the country while both parties are calling for action the retreat to familiar political corners was swift democrats demanded quick approval of gun control legislation some of it already passed by the house while republicans looked elsewhere for answers focusing on mental health and violent video games top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning with congress away from washington for a five week recess and the parties intractably divided the odds appear stacked in favor of gridlock but democrats and some republicans said this time can and should be different while no law will end mass shootings entirely it s time for congress to act to help keep our communities safer said sen pat toomey r pa as he vowed to again push bipartisan legislation to expand background checks to all commercial firearm sales toomey and his co sponsor sen joe manchin d w va each spoke with president donald trump about the background checks bill and a separate proposal making it easier to take guns away from people believed to be a danger to themselves or others trump showed a willingness to work with us on background checks and other measures toomey told reporters in a conference call he was very constructive toomey and manchin have tried to pass a background check bill since 2013 in the aftermath of the sandy hook school shooting and could not even muster a senate vote last year manchin called mass shootings and other gun violence tragic american problems and said it was past time for congress to take action other democrats put the burden on trump saying he should demand senate majority leader mitch mcconnell put a house passed bill strengthening background checks up for a vote senate democratic leader chuck schumer said the senate gop leader is blocking gun safety reforms that more than 90 of americans support he and house speaker nancy pelosi said mcconnell r ky should call the senate into emergency session to take immediate action on the house passed bill which would require federal background checks for all firearms sales and transfers including those sold online or at gun shows another bill allows an expanded 10 day review for gun purchases the house approved the bills in february but they have not come up for consideration in the republican controlled senate on a conference call monday pelosi told democratic lawmakers they have a golden opportunity to save lives by pressuring trump and mcconnell to act according to a democratic aide who was granted anonymity to discuss the private session the house stands ready to return to pass legislation if the senate sends us back an amended bipartisan bill or if other legislation is ready for house action pelosi said later in a letter to colleagues senate republicans are prepared to do our part mcconnell said in a statement monday he spoke with gop committee leaders including judiciary committee chairman lindsey graham and encouraged them to look for bipartisan solutions to protect our communities without infringing on americans constitutional rights mcconnell said in a brief white house speech trump condemned the weekend shootings in texas and ohio that left 31 people dead as barbaric crimes against all humanity and called for bipartisan cooperation to respond to an epidemic of gun violence he signaled opposition to large scale gun control efforts saying hatred pulls the trigger not the gun we vow to act with urgent resolve trump said trump offered a slightly different message earlier in the day tweeting that republicans and democrats must come together and get strong background checks perhaps marrying this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform we must have something good if not great come out of these two tragic events it was not clear how or why he was connecting the issues trump s omission of background checks in his white house remarks showed he was already backing away from his morning tweet democrats said it took less than three hours for the president to back off his call for stronger background check legislation pelosi and schumer said in a joint statement when he can t talk about guns when he talks about gun violence it shows the president remains prisoner to the gun lobby especially the national rifle association congress has proven unable to pass substantial gun violence legislation despite the frequency of mass shootings in large part because of resistance from republicans particularly in the gop controlled senate but in a show of bipartisanship graham r s c and sen richard blumenthal d conn announced an agreement to create a federal grant program to help states that adopt red flag protection order laws to take guns away from people believed to be a danger to themselves or others a similar bill did not come up for a vote in the senate last year the grants would enlist mental health professionals to help determine which cases need to be acted on graham said adding that while the program allows for quick action it requires judicial review trump signaled openness to red flag laws in his white house speech saying we must make sure that those judged to pose a grave risk to public safety do not have access to firearms and that if they do those firearms can be taken through rapid due process in a statement the nra offered deepest sympathies to the families and victims and said it is committed to the safe and lawful use of firearms by gun owners we will not participate in the politicizing of these tragedies but as always we will work in good faith to pursue real solutions that protect us all from people who commit these horrific acts the nra said a spokesman for rep bennie thompson d miss chairman of the house homeland security committee said the panel is planning to hold hearings on domestic terrorism when lawmakers return next month
