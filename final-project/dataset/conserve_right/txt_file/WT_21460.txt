apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the conflict between iran and the united states has moved into a new and potentially deadly phase this latest round of tension was accentuated with the attack by iran of two oil tankers in the strait of hormuz president trump responded by building the american military presence in the region to send a clear message to iran to avoid military confrontation iran missed the point on june 20 iran shot down a u s navy unmanned surveillance aircraft over the persian gulf in a provocative move that invited an american response observers were certain this would result in a u s military strike on iranian targets in the region but when that retaliation was imminent the president pulled back his critics in the media who reliably call him a warmonger now say he blinked in the face of iranian aggression he did not blink he thought the very thing strategic leaders do when crafting a proper response to provocative acts by enemy forces top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time american sanctions on iran are working imposing them after mr trump ended the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa caused iran s economy to plummet unrest in the country is rising and with it pressure on iran s terror mullahs to maintain control and ultimately their power over the people there responding to the pressure iran lashed out with its attack of a u s drone hoping to get america to respond militarily that military response which would have been deadly accurate would also have caused much death and destruction moreover it would have also played nicely into the hands of the mullahs who would be quick to rouse the passions of the people to justify further iranian aggression to the president s credit he saw the situation clearly he had his position clearly staked out with rising pressure that caused iran to act imprudently the president s response was prudence seeking to maintain his advantage now as an aggrieved nation restraining itself from armed conflict when it was fully justified in responding militarily and the president s choice like a python gripping prey mr trump has applied yet more pressure in the form of additional sanctions the latest round of punishment is aimed at denying iran s leadership access to financial resources while blocking them from the u s financial system or having access to their assets in the united states it will surely result in more pain for the iranian leadership who have placed iran and its beleaguered population people who are weary of deprivation on a collision course with the united states the president isn t blinking he s thinking a principle in military strategy is to reinforce success that means continue to apply pressure where it is working and that is precisely what the president has done his decision not to escalate now was an effort to demonstrate to iran s petulant leadership that the american quiver is filled with many arrows the president s use of a targeted cyber intrusion in recent days to disrupt iran s infrastructure has shown them there is no limit to how the united states can require a steep price for bad behavior coupled with the newest round of sanctions iran s leaders are now struggling over what to do in response but like the prey in the clutches of a python the more the unfortunate victim struggles the tighter the python grips it the united states is squeezing the life out of the iranian economy and by extension the viability of the mullah dictator it is likely that iran will once again respond militarily if their reaction invites a military response by the united states those strikes can and will likely have devastating results iran is as the military terms it a target rich environment from military assets on or near the persian gulf to iranian terror surrogates in lebanon syria and other areas throughout the middle east to strategic targets like military headquarters and oil infrastructure iran is greatly exposed a coordinated attack by the united states would be devastatingly accurate mr trump knows this so too does iran s supreme leader who may have stumbled onto the inconvenient truth that mr trump has boxed him in badly this week ayatollah ali khamenei admitted that if we agree in negotiations to their demands they will make the nation miserable and if we don t they will go on creating political frenzy fueling propaganda and applying pressure iran says it will start enriching uranium at a higher levels in july such a move will be yet another provocation as iran continues its brinkmanship strategy this would be unwise any move toward overt proliferation a very dangerous action will not only have the attention of the united stats but israel as well in the meantime the mullahs are both vexed and perplexed what will the united states do next a visit to the tehran zoological garden reptile house during feeding time might answer that question l scott lingamfelter a retired u s army colonel combat veteran and middle east foreign area officer served in the virginia general
