tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion a meeting between kim jong un and president trump in singapore in june is presented by the white house as something of a triumph by the president for defusing the possibility of conflict on the korean peninsula defusing conflict particularly in the nuclear age is always a good idea but is another meeting between mr kim and the president really the way to do it the long history of negotiations with communist leaders is drearily familiar lengthy and laborious discussions with much delayed outcomes if successful at all the north korean dictator has scored heavily thus far top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens by seducing washington into direct negotiations something the united states has studiously avoided for years mr kim has lifted his country from a bankrupt communist satellite state totally dependent on chinese and russian aid and presumably policy guidance to one of international power as an aspiring equal to the world s no 1 only a few months ago it was obvious north korea faced a desperate situation the u s blockade which some of the allies and even in a way the united nations were observing had further crippled the fragile north korean economy a quarter of which is dedicated to its military of almost a million men 5 500 000 more reserves in a population of 26 million south korea with double that population maintains a standing army of 600 000 with a reserve of 3 100 000 there are of course some 25 000 u s military permanently based in south korea the pyongyang government was able to skirt the sanctions to some extent through worldwide black market operations dealing with pariah nations such as iran but it was china itself facing a declining growth rate and increasing economic woes which faced dealing with the increasingly heavy economic burden of north korea japanese military and diplomatic gossip says that a catastrophic accident has severely damaged north korea s nuclear missile ambitions not only were essential parts of the weapons infrastructure killed but a number of essential north korean nuclear missile technocrats died as well this the speculation goes was the reason for the recent absence of north korean missile testing and not the eagerness to meet the united states again to negotiate a further reduction of tension and to bask in peace whether the japanese gossip is correct can t be easily learned but what is known is that there is scant logic in north korea s push for more negotiations with the united states just now if the north koreans are sincere in negotiating with the united states to reduce their nuclear and missile programs they would inevitably have to disassemble a cruel and oppressive regime pyongyang has shown some signs of changing attitudes but it has made no further major concessions beyond abandoning certain tests and missile launches over japan in fact says a report by the u n nuclear watchdog organization north korea is continuing to work on its nuclear weapons program raising questions over the regime s commitment to denuclearization it s the destruction of the north s nuclear warfare capabilities that is the aim of american policymakers in one of the most specific reports on pyongyang s nuclear activities the international atomic energy agency cites the enrichment of uranium and construction at the country s main nuclear site the continuation and further development of north korea s nuclear program and related statements by the regime are a cause for grave concern the agency said indeed nearly everything about north korea is a cause for grave concern american policy makers and president trump must keep that firmly in mind another trump kim photo op would be more than a waste of time in singapore or anyw
