apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap congress is returning from a two week recess on tuesday but some lawmakers barely left washington three house committees investigating impeachment worked through the break issuing multiple subpoenas and holding depositions with state department officials relevant to the inquiry democrats are investigating president donald trump s dealings with ukraine and exploring whether he abused his office by seeking dirt from a foreign country on former vice president joe biden a leading democratic contender for the 2020 white house nomination and trump s political rival that work will intensify when congress gets back house speaker nancy pelosi d calif has said she wants the committees to work expeditiously as democrats gather evidence and prepare to make a final decision on whether to vote to impeach the president top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed the impeachment probe was sparked by a whistleblower who revealed that trump asked ukraine s new president volodymyr zelenskiy on a july telephone call to investigate biden s family and ukraine s role of in the 2016 election that put trump in office the calls to investigate joe biden and son hunter have come without evidence of wrongdoing by either biden in either country trump has defended his conduct as perfect and said he will refuse to comply with the inquiry flurry of subpoenas and depositions despite trump s assertions that he won t cooperate some members of his administration are participating anyway staff and lawmakers from the house intelligence committee the house oversight and reform committee and the house foreign affairs committee have called in several state department witnesses they have already heard from two kurt volker a former envoy to ukraine and marie yovanovitch a former ambassador to ukraine fiona hill a former white house adviser who focused on russia is expected to appear in private on monday with plans for gordon sondland the u s ambassador to the european union to follow on thursday sondland didn t show up for a scheduled deposition last week after the state department directed him not to come but his lawyer said he would comply with a subpoena issued by the committees afterward democrats want to ask sondland about text messages provided by volker that show the two of them acting as intermediaries as trump urged ukraine to start the investigations the committees are also seeking closed door depositions with george kent the deputy assistant secretary of state in the european and eurasian bureau and ulrich brechbuhl a state department counselor the panels have subpoenaed or requested documents from the white house the defense department the white house office of management and budget vice president mike pence energy secretary rick perry trump personal lawyer rudy giuliani and two giuliani associates the deadlines for most of those requests are this coming week the whistleblower the chairman of the house intelligence committee rep adam schiff d calif suggested sunday that the committee may not need to hear from the whistleblower after weeks of negotiations to obtain the person s testimony the talks have centered on how to protect the whistleblower who is publicly unknown and prevent retaliation given that trump has said he wants to know the person s identity congressional aides have even suggested somehow disguising the whistleblower so that person s identity wouldn t be revealed schiff said it may not be necessary to take steps that could risk disclosing the person s identity to find out more about the july telephone call the white house released a rough transcript of the call last month given that we already have the call record we don t need the whistleblower who wasn t on the call to tell us what took place during the call schiff said on cbs face the nation we have the best evidence of that democrats stick to their strategy pelosi has been unflappable while republicans have criticized her for declining to hold a vote to authorize the impeachment inquiry the constitution doesn t require one but the house held such votes during the impeachment investigations of presidents richard nixon and bill clinton in a conference call with the democratic caucus on friday the issue didn t even come up according to a person familiar with that private call who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss it still some democrats have suggested that a vote couldn t hurt my own opinion is that we ought to just take this off the table because it s such a nonissue and there s no doubt in my mind that of course if nancy pelosi does that she will have the votes and that will pass said democratic rep jim himes of connecticut a member of the intelligence committee but it s not required he said sunday on abc s this week court battles democrats had a victory on friday when a federal appeals court ruled that trump s financial records must be turned over to the house the u s court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit said lawmakers should get the documents they have subpoenaed from the accounting firm mazars usa which has provided services to the president trump went to court to prevent mazars from turning over the material the house oversight and reform committee subpoenaed records from mazars in april they include documents from 2011 to 2018 that the house wants for investigation into the president s reporting of his finances and potential conflicts of interest the committee chairman rep elijah cummings d md said on the friday call with pelosi that democrats expect the trump administration will do everything in its power to slow down the legal process he predicted the case will go to the supreme court it s unclear whether democrats will fight any of their impeachment battles in court that might not be necessary because witnesses have begun to comply with subpoenas despite trump s orders republicans protest republicans have little recourse in the impeachment inquiry but they have focused their ire on democrats and defended the president they are expected to step up those efforts in the coming weeks trump and republicans on the investigating committees have said the white house should have more rights in the inquiry for example the ability for his lawyers to be present for interviews and to cross examine witnesses this process is a joke
