obama is fostering u s economic and military decline while simultaneously empowering beijing s rise to superpower status china s communists are on the march unless americans wake up to the growing threat both internal and external our victory in the cold war will have been useless this is the disturbing theme of bowing to beijing how barack obama is hastening america s decline and ushering a century of chinese domination by brett m decker editorial page editor of the washington times and william c triplett ii a best selling author and renowned china analyst lucid concise and comprehensively researched the book is a fire bell in the night it is a dire warning that china has become what america once was to great britain the ambitious upstart determined to eclipse the global colossus the result will be not only the end of the american moment but the triumph of a belligerent authoritarian communism hostile to democracy and the west china s leaders are engaged in a war against america they view us as a threat to their regime and way of life hence they have embarked on a systematic long term program to surpass us militarily economically and politically mr decker said in an interview they are willing to do anything purchase our national debt steal our intellectual property spend obscene amounts to buy influence in washington engage in extensive espionage in our government and large corporations and sell sensitive missile and nuclear technology to our mortal enemies to defeat us and the obama administration is turning a blind eye the authors reveal that beijing believes it is in a life and death struggle against america for years china s ruthless communist regime has been committing hostile aggressive acts stealing valuable military technology blatantly violating patent and intellectual property laws manipulating its currency to artificially boost exports to the united states lying about the nature and extent of its massive military buildup sending spies into the highest echelons of our government and private sector hacking into our computer networks waging cyberwarfare purchasing stakes in major banks and cultivating our economic dependence on chinese business in response mr obama has embraced the chinese dragon in january 2011 he acceded to chinese demands and gave a state dinner honoring president hu jintao mr obama praised mr hu as a statesman and welcomed china s prominent role in world affairs it was a craven surrender the authors point out that while he was communist party chief in tibet mr hu oversaw the slaughter of hundreds of tibetan buddhist monks moreover he has ruled china with an iron fist thousands of dissidents have been murdered or rot in jail the media is heavily censored free speech is nonexistent basic human rights are abrogated routinely the country s christians falun gong and muslims face state sanctioned persecution tens of millions are in gulags being used as slave labor to drive china s booming economy mr hu staunchly supports beijing s genocidal one child policy which has led to millions of forced abortions and has coerced countless women to be sterilized against their will he is not a progressive visionary rather he is a butcher this is the man mr obama toasts and to whom he bows at a major nuclear summit in 2010 mr obama bent over and bowed fully to mr hu the chinese leader did not reciprocate in fact his face and body language conveyed the opposite contempt the protocol breech is nuts and frequent as president mr obama is constantly abnegating himself to foreign leaders the emperor of japan the king of saudi arabia the queen of england there is almost no one to whom he will not bow domestically he has bowed to new jersey gov chris christie and even to the democratic mayor of tampa bay it is odd the authors say mr obama even has bowed repeatedly to midlevel chinese functionaries his submissive behavior does more than demean and degrade the presidency for the authors it rightly signifies washington s growing subservience to beijing under mr obama america s national debt has soared to nearly 15 trillion obamacare the massive stimulus crippling regulations and the reckless borrowing and public spending have brought us to the brink of bankruptcy the private sector has been shackled economic sclerosis has set in our military lacks the dynamic economy necessary to sustain our global standing mr obama has significantly weakened american power china is filling the vacuum beijing now owns more than 1 3 trillion of u s debt it annually runs huge trade surpluses flooding our market with everything from toys to computers to manufacturing products america s industrial base is being wiped out as we become the world s greatest debtor nation china is amassing more than 3 trillion in hard currency reserves its economy is exploding fueling annual growth rates averaging 10 percent for nearly two decades the authors show however that the red dragon s rise is anything but peaceful beijing is embarking on a huge almost unprecedented military buildup it possesses the largest armed force on the planet it has 2 3 million men in uniform compared to 1 4 million in the united states if one includes reservists and paramilitary forces the total number is close to 5 million china is expanding its nuclear arsenal it is constructing a world class navy to dominate the western pacific it menaces its democratic neighbors taiwan japan and south korea along with its client state of north korea china has sold missiles and vital nuclear technology to iran syria and venezuela aiding and abetting our archadversaries it is spearheading a global anti american axis when confronted with the overwhelming evidence of chinese expansionism and nefarious duplicity the obama administration has refused to take action the reason is simple america is turning into an economic vassal of china we can no longer afford to upset never mind challenge our new imperial master instead we must bow this is mr obama s real enduring and shameful legacy we didn t win the cold war communist china did jeffrey t kuhner is a columnist at the washington times and
