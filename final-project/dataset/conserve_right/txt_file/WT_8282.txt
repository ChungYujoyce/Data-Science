and china believe that we re in a cold war and that conflict is inevitable if true that would be tragic not only for the united states and china but for the world more must be done now to ensure that this does not happen that u s china bilateral relations cease its current downward spiral and move in a more positive direction the nixon 1972 visit to china was a bold and brilliant move the visit was welcomed by mao zedong who since 1965 was hoping to improve relations with the united states in part to mitigate the existential threat from an aggressive soviet union relations with china improved quickly with liaison offices in 1973 and the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979 the united states was there for china and its new leader deng xiaoping who took over in december 1978 deng inherited a china in political and economic disarray his immediate goal was to quickly address china s failed economic system and he looked to the united states for help with capital investments and joint ventures thousands of chinese students were encouraged to study in the united states hoping that even a small percentage of these students would return to china to provide the intellectual know how to help cure china s ailing economy indeed it was the united states that was there for china and deng providing economic and political support this support continued for the next two decades culminating in 2001 with china s entry into the world trade organization wto top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender this period of good bilateral relations included cooperation on a number of international security issues working with china we defeated the soviet union in afghanistan the beginning of the unraveling of the soviet empire there was cooperation with china on efforts to counter nuclear proliferation terrorism narcotics and piracy on the sea these efforts helped to provide for the common good helped to defeat the enemies of the people the irony now is that people in the united states and china believe we re in a cold war a constant refrain from many in china is that the united states is trying to contain china fearing that china eventually will overtake the united states conversely many in the united states believe that china wants to be a regional and global hegemon replacing the united states as a world leader trade talks with china continue with efforts to address the significant trade deficit of 378 billion we have with china but the overall amount of trade 737 billion we conduct with china clearly tells us that our respective economies are interdependent no doubt our trade deficit has to be addressed in addition to ip theft currency manipulation market access and unfair trading practices with u s companies competing against state owned

s occupation and militarization of islands in the south china sea its ongoing tension with taiwan and the human rights excesses in xinjiang province with its treatment of the uighurs bilateral relations are worsening its global ambitions and overseas basing are other issues of immediate concern the irony should be clear to all of us china reached out to the united states in 1972 because it feared a war with the soviet union to include the possible use of nuclear weapons diplomatic relations with the united states were established and working with the united states and others china was instrumental in defeating the soviets in afghanistan a prelude to the end of the soviet empire now in 2019 we re witnessing rapprochement between china and russia to include joint military exercises something has to be done to change this negative trajectory assuming change is possible currently the united states and china conduct a number of ministerial and lower level meetings and exchanges dealing with security and trade to date it appears that these sessions haven t been effective it appears that these meetings are limited by protocol and chinese suspicion and by such a divergence of views that there s little real genuine dialogue and an absence of trust something has to be done now establishing routine sub ministerial meetings between professionals from state department defense department treasury justice and the intelligence community is advisable both countries should send their best officers to these meetings to at a minimum build ties and establish trust at these working level meetings the issues for which we have divergent views should be discussed with the goal of a path to resolution equally important however will be a dialogue on a multitude of security issues for which china and the united states should cooperate like proliferation international organized crime pandemics etc we cooperated in the 80s and 90s with good results it s possible we can cooperate again for the betterment of both countries and mankind a new and comprehensive strategy to address issues with china should be one of the highest priorities for the leadership in washington and beijing if we don t act now our countries will grow farther apart and conflict of some type will be inevitable joseph r detrani was the former special envoy for negotiations with north korea the views
