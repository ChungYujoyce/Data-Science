rider a lyrical elegiac western about a lakota rodeo rider brady jandreau whose career is threatened by a head injury each stars pine ridge non professional actors playing versions of themselves an approach that lends an unfiltered authenticity to an often mythic american genre earthly and soulful zhao s films find pain and beauty in humble lives lived close to the land they take cinema somewhere new and somewhere real there are just all these rules about how films can be made today it becomes like a bubble an industry that s quite detached from reality in many ways zhao said in a recent interview by phone from a remote arizona road independent film has suffered from that the films particularly the rider which sony pictures classics will release friday have made the 35 year old zhao a breakout filmmaker and an in demand director when she was given a 50 000 grant earmarked for female filmmakers at the film independent spirit awards in march ava duvernay said introducing zhao her work burns so bright it burns my eyes the rider has been a quiet sensation on the festival circuit since winning the top prize of cannes directors fortnight last year it s prompted comparisons to early terrence malick films like the more painterly frontier drama days of heaven zhao grants malick is a touchstone people are like you must know terry right zhao says laughing i always say actually no if you see him please tell him he s got a fan alongside the 22 year old jandreau the rider co stars most of the people in his life his autistic sister lilly his father tim and many of his friends including bull rider lane scott who was paralyzed from a 2013 car crash zhao became intrigued about making a movie about jandreau while watching him recovered from a head injury when he was trampled during a rodeo competition despite the risk of re injury he refused to give up riding they first met when jandreau a talented and sensitive horse trainer taught zhao how to ride i never met anybody from china i never met a director i didn t know anything about movies said jandreau speaking from his home in south dakota he lives there with his wife and their 8 month old daughter on a recent afternoon he spoke on the phone after checking on a just born calf chloe wasn t scared to get on a horse so i shouldn t be scared to say a line or whatever the hell said jandreau zhao gives jandreau more credit i m not as good at riding horses as he is at acting she says i figured if he can manipulate the emotions of a horse he can probably do that with the audience i just had a feeling he might be good zhao came up with the story a month before shooting shaping it around jandreau s own experiences for jandreau not being able to ride was an existential threat it s all i love he says it s all i do he was able to ride on a horse by himself he says since he was a year a half old a very well trained horse says jandreau i was still in a diaper it s been much the same for his daughter jandreau estimates she s been riding 40 times already on 20 different horses she s also been on a lot of planes with the rider the jandreaus have traveled to paris new york los angeles austin and elsewhere jandreau who has started a horse breeding and training program since shooting the film also would like to keep acting a goal supported by the rave reviews he s received i ve actually auditioned for a couple things said jandreau looking forward to acting again hopefully if things go well i guess zhao is juggling a handful of projects unsure which will be next for her one is a historic western about a black sheriff another is set 5 000 years in the future in china so no more real life for a while she jokes but zhao senses a lot of opportunity coming her way i feel like the industry really wants to support female filmmakers it feels a lot more open than a year ago says zhao but at the same time i m also very careful because the people who jump on the bandwagon now will jump off when the next social issue becomes popular there s a huge shift she adds there s some part of it that s going to stick zhao will likely work with professional actors in the future but even in larger productions she expects to continue to look beyond the usual head shots even the historic western and the sci fi i m going to want to include unfamiliar faces and unconventional casting says zhao i think it throws everybody off a little bit including myself and that s a good thing follow ap fil
