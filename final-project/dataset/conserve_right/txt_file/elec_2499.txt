perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong a few weeks ago sen ted cruz dropped a surprise in the middle of a casual policy discussion with a prominent conservative activist the freshman texas senator predicted that longtime republican attorney ben ginsberg would serve as his campaign lawyer should mr cruz run for the 2016 gop presidential nomination the statement caught the supporter by surprise mr cruz after all has become one of the senate s most stubborn nonconformists unafraid to buck his party s leadership while laying out his own vision of conservatism with from the hip speeches that require no prepared text see also ted cruz outlines 10 priorities for a gop led congress we should lead boldly mr ginsberg on the other hand is the quintessential establishment gop figure a carefully scripted campaign lawyer who has served as counsel for the likes of the republican national committee the bush cheney campaign and mitt romney s presidential bids the episode related by a participant in the conversation is a not so subtle reminder that the first primary of the 2016 presidential nomination contest the race to hire battle tested campaign staff is already well under way even before the final ballots of this year s midterm election are counted it s also a reminder that staff are often hired for their experience and technical expertise and not to win a popularity contest with voters mr cruz has already shored up his staff by hiring veteran congressional aide paul teller as a top senate aide giving him a steady hand to make sure his congressional actions don t rock his presidential ambitions the freshman texas senator isn t alone in lining up battle tested staff for a possible 2016 run dr ben carson the pediatric neurosurgeon turned conservative sensation has already announced that houston businessman and longtime gop activist terry giles would serve as his campaign chairman should he get in the race and dr carson has hired veteran fundraising and email strategist mike murray to oversee his digital fundraising and outreach efforts sen rand paul of kentucky also has begun building a national infrastructure for the primaries choosing former iowa gop chairman steve grubbs to run his efforts in the first caucus state and respected gop strategist mike biundo to oversee his efforts in new england including the first primary state of new hampshire along with securing staff the 2016 hopefuls also get to use this year s election to earn chits from politicians mr cruz mr paul and house budget committee chairman paul ryan the 2012 gop vice presidential nominee have campaigned and raised money tirelessly for their party s 2014 candidates such groundwork is common for any white house hopeful but the early 2016 gop field has three candidates in mr paul mr cruz and dr carson whose appeal has been built on being washington outsiders willing to buck shun and even ridicule the establishment in washington the art of collecting chits and hiring staffers can at times run contrary to those storylines mr paul for instance was forced early this year to throw his support behind fellow kentuckian mitch mcconnell in a tough senate primary against a more conservative challenger and later in mr mcconnell s re election race against democratic challenger alison lundergan grimes as senate minority leader mr mcconnell at times has tried to cut deals with the white house and senate democrats that over the years have alienated some conservative activists mr paul s support initially generated some rumblings among anti establishment activists discontent mr cruz recently transferred 250 000 in funds from his political operations to the national republican senatorial committee the campaign arm of the republican senate establishment and mr cruz s potential courtship of mr ginsberg has the potential to create its own discontent some grass roots conservative activists are still angry at mr ginsberg for what they see as his efforts to restrain their access and influence to the establishment mr ginsberg for instance engineered a power play on behalf of mr romney at the 2012 republican presidential nominating convention persuading delegates to adopt rules changes that transferred power from the primary and caucus voters in the states to the putative presidential nominee at convention time for many religious and social conservatives mr ginsberg s biggest transgression is his 2013 signing of a brief sent to the u s supreme court in support of same sex marriage a policy mr cruz opposes ginsberg s work has left a bad taste in the mouths of not just newly active republicans but in many gop conservatives who have been fighting these battles for a very long time said carolyn mclarty of oklahoma the chairwoman of the republican national committee s resolutions committee morton blackwell a republican national committee member from virginia added i would consider that very unfortunate if mr cruz brought mr ginsberg aboard for a 2016 race in fact a ginsberg cruz alliance in 2016 wouldn t be that far fetched given the two men s history mr cruz helped george w bush s 2000 campaign assemble the legal all star team of future supreme court chief justice john g roberts superattorney mike garvin future solicitor general ted olson and mr ginsberg to help win the florida recount dispute and mr cruz hired mr ginsberg to be his campaign attorney for his successful 2012 run for the senate right now mr cruz already has a campaign finance attorney the well regarded washington lawyer cleta mitchell aides said they had not heard about the ginsberg anecdote and know of no hiring yet though they left a future door open cruz spokesman catherine frazier said in an interview that her boss and mr ginsberg are good friends they have worked together in the past and it is certainly possible they could work together again but we have made no hires to that end mr ginsberg did not return repeated calls to his office seeking comment in the end veteran campaign observers say candidates don t hire staff to win popularity contests but rather to get the best talent on the market for each critical job in a campaign on that front mr ginsberg is regarded as a campaign finance legal eagle mississippi republican national committee member henry barbour last year called mr ginsberg the go to lawyer for republican federal campaigns anyone running for president would do well to have him on their team texas gov rick perry another 2016 hopeful recently hired mr ginsberg as part of his defense team against a state criminal indictment that claims mr perry had abused his powers as governor i wouldn t think courting ginsberg poses a problem for cruz said springfield illinois attorney terry campo a former reagan administration official it shows cruz doesn t intend to be regarded as a fringe candidate mr campo called the idea of mr cruz eventually making mr ginsberg his 2016 campaign lawyer a shrewd tactical move it heads off having ginsberg one of the top convention rules people working the rules against cruz said mr campo ben is one of the top campaign finance lawyers the party has
