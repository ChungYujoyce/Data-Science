democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots in the nearly three years since the u s military welcomed transgender people into the armed forces they have largely served

navy seals said muller who will not be testifying but is a plaintiff in one of four lawsuits challenging the ban we ve been here and we will continue to be here regardless in what capacity is up to the administration trump has cited tremendous medical costs as a reason for the ban according to new data from the defense department provided to the house armed services committee ahead of the hearing the military has spent about 8 million on transgender care since 2016 the military s annual health care budget tops 50 billion the associated press obtained the data wednesday the hearing will be held by a subcommittee chaired by democratic rep jackie speier who introduced bipartisan legislation in february that would prohibit the department of defense from denying the enlistment or continued service of transgender people if trump s ban takes effect similar legislation was introduced in the senate it s unclear whether the legislation would be voted on as a stand alone bill or be
