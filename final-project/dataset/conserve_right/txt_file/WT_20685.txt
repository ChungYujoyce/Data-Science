tweet wednesday trump promised the lincoln memorial program will be the show of a lifetime white house officials have stressed that trump s remarks will be patriotic but the president often finds it difficult to stay on any kind of script but tracie lenihan of spokane washington an independent said she didn t understand why military equipment is part of the festivities i think it cost a lot of money and i m not sure what it really has to do with the fourth of july she said i don t hate it i m just confused medea benjamin co founder of the codepink anti war group said use of the bradley fighting vehicles reflected the politicization of july fourth and the militarization of july fourth and we resent this we want it to be a holiday where people are having their picnics and they re watching their fireworks and it s all peaceful and united she said instead her group will be fielding a balloon depicting trump as an angry diaper clad baby but because of flight restrictions officials would not let the group pump it with helium to make it fly higher and be more visible rep betty mccollum d minn who is among lawmakers overseeing the interior department which has jurisdiction over the national mall and federal parks said it was absolutely outrageous that the administration will use park money to help defray thursday s event costs the national park service plans to use nearly 2 5 million intended to help improve parks nationwide the washington post reported late tuesday citing anonymous sources these fees are not a slush fund for this administration to use at will mccollum said in a statement she promised a congressional hearing trump and the event s organizers could be on the hook to reimburse the government millions of dollars if he goes into campaign mode in violation of federal appropriations law and the hatch act which bars politicking on government time said walter shaub who left the office of government ethics in 2017 after clashing with the white house over ethics and disclosure issues there s not a history of disciplined speaking engagements where he sticks to a script shaub said of trump trump originally wanted a parade with military tanks and other machinery rolling through downtown washington ever since he was enthralled by a two hour procession of french military tanks and fighter jets in paris on bastille day in july 2017 later that year trump said he d have a similar parade in washington on the fourth of july 2018 and would top the paris show the event ended up being pushed to veterans day which conflicted with one of trump s trips abroad before it was scuttled after cost estimates exceeding 90 million were made public in february trump tweeted for the public to hold the date for this fourth of july washington has held an independence day celebration for decades featuring a parade along constitution avenue a concert on the capitol lawn with music by the national symphony orchestra and fireworks beginning at dusk near the washington monument trump altered the lineup by adding his speech moving the fireworks closer to the lincoln memorial and summoning the tanks and warplanes associated press
