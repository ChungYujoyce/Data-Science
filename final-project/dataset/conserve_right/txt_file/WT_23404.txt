bipartisan bill to expand background checks for gun purchases house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer said trump s urgent personal intervention is needed to stem the endless massacres of our fellow americans by gunfire they implored trump in a letter released monday to seize this moment when your leadership and influence over republicans in congress on the issue

horrific spread of gun violence the democrats said top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the letter came as congress returned to the capitol from a six week break with gun violence legislation at the top of the agenda following a spate of mass shootings that killed dozens of people a group of u s mayors including some where mass shootings occurred met with white house officials and individual lawmakers to urge approval of a house passed bill to expand background checks the bill approved in february would expand background checks to cover private sales such as one that allowed a texas shooting suspect to purchase his weapon before killing seven people last month senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has made it clear that he won t take action on guns without trump s commitment to sign a bill into law but trump has flip flopped on guns first suggesting he d be open to background checks legislation or other measures to try to stem gun violence only to backtrack after speaking to the national rifle association and others in the gun lobby mcconnell a kentucky republican wants to avoid a politically uncomfortable situation of forcing republicans to vote on gun control bills only to have trump reject them nan whaley the mayor of dayton ohio who has emerged as a leading gun control advocate following a mass shooting that killed nine people in her city last month said members of the u s

gun violence she said bryan barnett the mayor of rochester hills michigan and president of the mayors conference called the white house meeting helpful and said white house officials listened intently to the groups concerns barnett a republican said background checks are on the table as part of a suite of solutions the white house is considering background checks have strong support in his republican leaning city barnett said as i drop my kids off at school in a republican region and in a line of minivans and suvs nine out of 10 of those folks don t have a problem with background checks he said it s not something that curtails their ability to own and operate a gun freely it s something they understand that we have to do as americans because we are part of a greater society missouri sen roy blunt a member of gop leadership said sunday that trump needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do asked monday when he will release his plan to address gun violence

forward on gun control two people in washington can make sure the background checks bill passes donald trump and mitch mcconnell schumer said it is totally up to them they can t escape responsibility

away she said what courage does it take to support legislation that will save lives pennsylvania sen pat toomey a republican who is working with west virginia democratic sen joe manchin on a bill to
