in recent months the rebel soldiers known as the free syrian army have grown bolder attacking regime troops and trying establish control in pro opposition areas bringing heavier government response

for mr assad to hand over his powers to his vice president and allow creation of a unity government the resolution would have expressed support for that arab league plan which mr assad has rejected as an alternative the u s proposal for a formal grouping of nations backing the opposition could be similar to the contact group on libya which oversaw international help for opponents of the late

syrian national council burhan ghalioun said a coalition might give the fsa support if necessary to protect the syrian people arab nations and other backers of the security council resolution expressed their anger and frustration at the double veto during an international security conference in the german city of munich qatar s minister for international cooperation khaled al attiyah said the vetoes sent a very bad signal to assad that there is a license to kill tunisian prime minister hamadi jebali urged other arab nations to follow the step his country took saturday and expel syrian

damascus would not push ahead with announced reforms which include a new constitution allowing the formation of new political parties and parliamentary elections it said the international community
