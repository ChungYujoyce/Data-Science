apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic news analysis hunter biden s sweetheart foreign business deals are creating a big problem for his father s presidential campaign providing powerful ammunition for president trump and for democratic rivals running on anti establishment and anti corruption platforms former vice president joseph r biden has deflected questions about alleged self dealing when he was in the white house and his son served on the board of a ukrainian gas company he fired back with claims that mr trump was the one who abused oval office power by asking kyiv to open a corruption investigation see also lindsey graham calls for doj probe of biden ukraine connection there is enough smoke here i have never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings here s what i know trump should be investigated mr biden snapped at reporters saturday on the campaign trail in des moines iowa but hunter biden s plum job in ukraine raised eyebrows in washington and around the world as soon as he landed it in 2014 during the height of tensions over the russian annexation of crimea after seizing the territory from ukraine the appointment of the vice president s son to a ukrainian oil board looks nepotistic at best nefarious at worst the washington post s adam taylor wrote at the time hunter biden 49 is a yale educated lawyer his drug use and romantic romps have been fodder for the tabloids for years the navy reserves booted him from the service for testing positive for cocaine in february 2014 a month before was hired by the ukraine oil company months later when the story went public hunter biden said he was embarrassed that his drug use resulted in an administrative discharge from the military i respect the navy s decision with the love and support of my family i m moving forward he said in july he explained to the new yorker magazine that he began dating hallie biden the widow of his deceased brother beau after going on a crack cocaine binge the cozy arrangement for hunter biden in ukraine underscores the former vice president s standing as a creature of the political establishment whose family benefited from inside the beltway perks the narrative plays directly into the hands of sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts whose crusade against washington corruption has helped make her the leading alternative to mr biden for the democratic presidential nomination too many politicians in both parties have convinced themselves that playing the money for influence game is the only way to get things done ms warren said recently at a massive campaign rally in new york no more business as usual let s attack the corruption head on if the nomination race becomes a contest between mr biden and ms warren which appears increasingly likely then mr biden will have to answer more questions about his son and ukraine the appearance of impropriety worsened in 2016 when the then vice president visited kyiv and threatened to withhold 1 billion in u s loan guarantees unless the country s leaders fired ukraine s chief prosecutor for purported corruption the prosecutor also happened to be investigating ukrainian gas company burisma holdings where hunter biden sat on the board and ran the company s legal unit mr trump and his private attorney former new york mayor rudolph w giuliani acknowledged that they had been asking kyiv to look into possible corruption involving the bidens they insist it is a legitimate request vice president biden did a terrible thing the way he put it mr trump told reporters sunday i m not looking to hurt him with respect to his son joe s got a lot of problems joe s got enough problems but what he said was a terrible thing he described mr biden s action three years ago in kyiv as a quid pro quo it was an offer it was beyond an offer mr trump said it was something where he said i m not going to give billions of dollars to ukraine unless they remove this prosecutor and they removed the prosecutor supposedly in one hour ironically mr trump and mr biden are accusing each other of the same thing using white house power against ukraine for personal gain last week most news organizations were focused on accusations from a u s intelligence community whistleblower who accused mr trump of misconduct for pressuring kyiv privately to investigate the biden family s dealings in ukraine reporters might not be able to keep ignoring the biden ukraine corruption angle senate judiciary committee chairman lindsey graham south carolina republican called sunday for a justice department investigation of the biden ukraine connection the investigation should be as far reaching and aggressive as the russia probe that targeted mr trump s 2016 campaign mr graham said joe biden said everybody s looked at this and found nothing who is everybody nobody has looked at the ukraine and the bidens mr graham said on fox news sunday morning futures there is enough smoke here he said was there a relationship between the vice president s family and the ukraine business world that was inappropriate i don t know somebody other than me needs to look at it and i don t trust the media to get to the bottom of it he demanded that the investigation extend to ukraine s possible involvement in the 2016 election including leaking information that discredited trump campaign chairman paul manafort and contributed to his conviction for tax and bank fraud as a result of the russia probe can you imagine if this was the trump family doing business like this mr graham said i like joe biden i like him a lot but you
