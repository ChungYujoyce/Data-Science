criticism by labeling a prominent minority congressman as himself racist and accusing democrats of trying to play the race card trump assailed rep elijah cummings d md as a racist after the president s criticisms of the congressman s majority black district in the baltimore area as a rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live drew widespread condemnation from democrats as race baiting trump insisted there was nothing racist about his criticism and tweeted back if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore

added he offered no detail to back up his accusation of racism against cummings the president s comments capped a weekend of attacks on cummings the powerful chairman of the house oversight and reform committee and marked his latest rhetorical shot against non white lawmakers exacerbating racial tensions two weeks ago trump caused a nationwide uproar with racist tweets directed at four democratic congresswomen of color heading into the 2020 elections the president is trying to tap into anxieties about demographic and cultural changes in the nation in the belief that the divided country he leads will simply choose sides over issues such as race a white house aide said sunday that trump was frustrated by the democrats unrelenting investigations and talk of impeachment and swung hard at cummings and his district because the president believes such capitol hill critics are neglecting serious problems at home in their zeal to undermine his presidency acting chief of staff mick mulvaney insisted in two national television interviews that trump was not making racist comments but mulvaney a former congressman himself said he understood why some people could perceive trump s words as racist mulvaney said trump s words were exaggerated for effect does the president speak hyperbolically absolutely and meant to draw attention to democratic backed investigations of the republican president and his team in washington instead of helping people back home they re focusing on scandal in washington d c which is the exact opposite of what they said they would do when they ran for election in 2018 mulvaney said pointing at democrats who now control the house he asserted that trump s barbs were a reaction to what the president considered to be inaccurate statements by cummings about conditions in which children are being held in detention at the u s mexico border at a hearing last week cummings accused a top administration official of wrongly calling reports of filthy overcrowded border facilities unsubstantiated when the president hears lies like that he s going to fight back mulvaney said democratic presidential candidate juli n castro countered that trump was engaging in racial priming using this language and taking actions to try and get people to move into their camps by racial and ethnic identity that s how he thinks he won in 2016 and that s how he thinks he s going to win in 2020 castro said trump s tweets saturday also charged that cummings district which includes johns hopkins hospital the social security administration and the national headquarters of the naacp is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the united states condemnation followed from democrats over the weekend including some of the party s presidential candidates statements from a spokesman for maryland s republican governor and from the lieutenant governor defended cummings district and its people trump unbowed resumed the verbal volleying sunday there is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that elijah cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of baltimore itself dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts shame mulvaney argued that trump would criticize any lawmaker no matter the person s race in a similar way if trump felt that individual spoke unfairly about the president s policies to mulvaney trump was right to raise the challenges faced in cummings district at the same time that cummings and other democrats are chasing down the russia investigation undertaken by robert mueller and pursuing this bizarre impeachment crusade nonetheless the chief of staff said he understood why some people view trump s comments as racist but that doesn t mean that it is racist the president is pushing back against what he sees is wrong he added it s how he s done it in the past and he ll continue to do it in the future cummings is leading multiple investigations of the president s governmental dealings in his direct response to trump on twitter cummings said mr president i go home to my district daily each morning i wake up and i go and fight for my neighbors it is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch but it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents cummings has also drawn the president s ire
