apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic jinan china ap fallen chinese politician bo xilai assailed his wife and his former right hand man in four days of testimony ending sunday rejecting accusations of corruption and shielding a murderer in a trial that has offered a glimpse into the shady inner workings of china s elite a court heard allegations over the weekend that mr bo abused his power as the communist party secretary of the southern megacity of chongqing to block an investigation into his wife s murder of a british businessman as well as to hide his aide s embarrassing flight to a u s consulate mr bo told the jinan intermediate people s court on sunday that his former right hand man chongqing police chief wang lijun constantly lied in his testimony he said mr wang was a person of very vile quality who lied in court and muddied the waters top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds mr bo acknowledged that he made mistakes in the handling of the incidents that triggered the nation s biggest political scandal in decades and brought shame on the communist party but he denied criminal misconduct after testimony concluded sunday the court said all evidence in the trial had been presented the trial was adjourned until monday when closing arguments are expected to take place the communist party is using the trial to cement mr bo s downfall and wrap up a scandal that hangs over the party s recently installed new leadership as it tries to cement its authority and fully focus on tackling serious economic and social challenges mr bo s downfall also has been widely perceived as the result of his defeat in party infighting ahead of china s once a decade leadership transition last fall in a rare show of openness the court has been publicizing details of the trial in a bid to lend credibility to what is widely seen as a political show trial mr bo in return has refrained from using the trial as a stage on which to denounce the administration and the opponents who purged him which would likely be the leadership s worst nightmare so far the worst has been avoided said ding xueliang a chinese politics expert at the hong kong university of science and technology he s been trying to play the game within the limitations set up by the chinese leadership he does not talk about politically sensitive things even though everybody inside and outside china knows that he s in trouble for politics still the ousted leader mounted an unexpectedly spirited defense against charges of abuse of power and of netting 4 3 million through corruption recanting earlier confessions and rarely expressing contrition as he sought to lay the blame for most of the misdeeds on his wife and others he deftly cross examined witnesses and was selectively unable to recall key details when the questioning turned to him it appeared to be mr bo s last ditch effort to repair the damage the scandal wrought on the clean populist image he had so carefully cultivated for years and might have caught by surprise prosecutors who were armed with the confessions and other evidence today s society faces acute contradictions and people tend to involuntarily sympathize with those who are being attacked by the authorities so he s been able to portray himself as a victim as a defeated hero said zhang lifan a chinese historian and political analyst courtroom revelations have painted a colorful picture of how mr bo s alleged misconduct enriched his family he s accused of providing political favors to a businessman xu ming in return for having him at his family s beck and call according to mr bo s wife mr xu gave the family expensive gifts that included a villa in france and international airfare to three continents mr bo is also accused of funneling 800 000 in government funds from a secret project mr bo threw his wife gu kailai under the bus for much of the corruption charges and even some aspects of the abuse of power allegation calling her crazy after she testified against him he said he could not be held responsible for crimes she committed without his knowledge but chinese officialdom is familiar with the strategy of spreading out an officeholder s illicit assets and wealth among relatives and trusted friends so mr bo s defense is unlikely to convince the public said mr ding the chinese politics expert the trial laid out how gu hatched a complicated plan with the help of two foreigners to hide the family s ownership of the french villa worth millions and set up a chain of associates through which government funds could be embezzled discreetly it was the first time such a high ranking family has put down the operation step by step mr ding said this case has taught us so much about the dynamics and mechanisms in most chinese corruption cases testimony also revealed how one of the foreigners neil heywood demanded more money by threatening the safety of mr bo s son and to expose the family gu later killed him and received a suspended death sentence for the murder the court also heard evidence over the weekend about the events surrounding the attempted u s defection bid by mr wang the police chief in february 2012 an incident that blew the scandal into the open mr wang said he fled to the consulate fearing for his safety after he told mr bo that the politician s wife had murdered a british associate mr bo told the court that he reacted angrily to mr wang s report slapping him in the face and smashing a cup in fury because he initially thought mr wang was framing his wife for the crime i thought he was being duplicitous i have zero tolerance for duplicity mr bo said i slapped him in the face mr wang who testified saturday said the violent confrontation with mr bo his subsequent removal as police chief and the disappearance of his subordinates who were investigating the murder spurred him to flee to american officials he said mr bo did not slap him as much as punch him hard causing his mouth to bleed it was dangerous at the time mr wang told the court i was subject to violence and my staff working closely with me and those working on the case disappeared mr wang said he believed mr bo had ordered an investigation into the police officers involved i
