to enjoy all the benefits of our website amid rumours about his health the north korean leader has not been seen for days get the new statesman s morning call email on monday the us national security adviser robert o brien confirmed that the us was keeping a close eye on rumours suggesting that kim jong un was gravely ill these had begun following reports from north korean defectors in south korea that he had undergone heart surgery on 12 april after which the north korean leader had missed the day of the sun commemorations of his grandfather s death on 15 april last week the rumours were played down by the south korean authorities who suggested that he was touring provincial areas and by donald trump who at his white house briefing yesterday called the rumours of kim s ill health fake news yet still several unanswered questions remain question one where is kim jong un the north korean leader has now not been seen in public since it is believed 11 april his absence at the unusually low key 15 april commemorations was particularly striking as his grandfather kim il sung was the country s founder and revered as a near deity there with rumours swirling about his health there have been reports of panic buying within north korea one might expect a healthy kim to quash them by making an appearance conversely when kim s father kim jong il died the news was covered up for two days as china brokered the succession there have reportedly been signs of activity at a north korean military facility used to train for parades also watch for any signs of changed flight activity between beijing and pyongyang question two does south korea know something it is not sharing publicly chad o carroll ceo of the korea risk group reports that seoul last week briefed reporters on north korean missile tests hours after the fact typically such tests are announced instantly o carroll also finds it odd that the briefing included details of standard north korean air activity about which they only rarely talk something seems to be up he concludes question three is the us government contrary to trump s comment in fact still taking the illness rumours seriously aircraft spots a twitter account monitoring air traffic on wednesday tracked multiple us surveillance flights over north korea such flights reports vice are not uncommon but are not usually trackable suggesting the us government may be trying to pressure the north korean leadership into revealing what is happening by making them visible question four is china preparing for a humanitarian crisis a well placed source has said that china is buying up large quantities of rice and cooking oil through commodity trading front companies despite it having no obvious additional domestic requirements for these food supplies this is to stress just one source and the claim has not been verified but if correct it might suggest beijing is preparing for a possible refugee crisis should the regime in pyongyang collapse if kim jong un is incapacitated or dies such action would indeed be prudent kim yo jong kim s sister and his close ally would be the natural successor but it is uncertain whether this patriarchal military dictatorship would accept a female leader on the other hand the north korean system is built on near religious veneration of the family of kim il sung on which read this 2018 profile of the kim dynasty by our commissioning editor gavin jacobson which might dissolve should say an army general stage a coup a potentially disastrous power struggle within this nuclear armed state cannot be discounted to be clear nothing about this is confirmed and as o carroll notes there have been no signs of regime commotion in pyongyang or dandong the main border crossing between north korea and china kim may be well or ill but recovering but he is overweight and known to live unhealthily and something does indeed seem to be up if north korea s leader is so ill that he can no longer control the regime or if he dies or is already dead the world will be presented with another enormously destabilising event at the very moment when it can least afford it the rumours were
