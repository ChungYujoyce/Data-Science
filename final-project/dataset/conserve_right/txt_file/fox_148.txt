meredith for us at the white house where they will be another coronavirus briefing at 4 30 this afternoon mark thanks so much joining us now a key player in the negotiations for a coronavirus relief bill the treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday good to see you you were up on capitol hill all day yesterday you aposre expected to be up there again today we hear that this package is now 1 8 trillion and may go above it is this going to get done and if so when will it get done steven mnuchin treasury secretary well thank you for having me here and i do think it will get done we aposve been working around the clock in the senate with republicans and the democrats i aposve been speaking to mitch mcconnell chuck schumer the speaker and i think we have a fundamental understanding and we look forward to wrapping it up today let me just walk you through the highlights of the package because the president is very determined to protect american workers we aposve ordered a major part of the economy to shut down and the president wants to protect them so the first part are what i call small business retention loans if you aposre a small business you aposll get two weeks of cash flow to pay your workers you need to retain them you will also get some overhead and if you do that those loans will be forgiven that aposs about half of our workforce that will allow small businesses to keep people and make sure when we open the economy they aposre up and running the second part is direct deposits the average direct deposit or check for a family of four will be approximately 3 000 this you can think of this as a bridge for them to get through this quickly roberts uh huh mnuchin the third component is enhanced unemployment insurance for people that are laid off due to the coronavirus and the fourth component is a significant package working with the federal reserve we aposll have up to 4 trillion of liquidity that we can use to support the economy and that aposs those are broad based lending programs under section 133 we can leverage our equity working with the federal reserve and then on top of that the president is determined hospitals need money there aposs a very significant amount of money for hospitals and medical professionals roberts last i heard for the hospitals it was 110 billion is that what you aposre looking at still mnuchin that aposs approximately we aposre negotiating the final numbers but we want to make sure the hospitals have money the best way to get through this is for us to win this war with this virus roberts let me ask you this question because liquidity is key here and what we aposve heard so far with this bill and maybe it aposs changed in the last 24 hours that was that liquidity assistance really was sectoral a lot of it go to the airlines cruise ship industry hotel industry now the auto industry has got its handout as well whereas you there are people who say there really needs to be broad based across the entire economy where are you on that front mnuchin well i think as you know when they started this was a bit unique to the airlines industry since we had shut down most of airline travel but now that we aposre we shut down major parts of the economy this liquidity facility is a broad based liquidity facility working with the fed so there is a small component for airlines national security companies but there aposs a very broad based as i said we we can lever up to 4 trillion to help everything from small businesses to big businesses get through the next 90 to 120 days as we win this war roberts let me ask you about this direct deposit you said 3 000 for a family of four that aposs about 1 000 per adult 500 per child that was one of the formulas that was floating around last week senator bernie sanders of vermont also continues to be a presidential candidate saying that aposs nowhere near enough listen to how he put it begin video clip sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate what in god aposs name does a 600 check or a 2 000 check mean one time when you are unemployed yes it may get you through three weeks maybe stretch it you get through a month but that is nowhere near what the working people of this country need and should have end video clip roberts mr secretary you aposve suggested in the past and other white house officials have as well that this idea of a direct payment may come into different tranches one on april the 6th and another one maybe on may 18th are you still looking at that or is this a one time only payment mnuchin well for now in this legislation it is one payment but let me say these three pieces all tied together workers will get money through the small business program again through retention they will get money through unemployment and they will get effectively this bridge check payment which is really a direct deposit so these three programs all look very quickly and if for whatever reason you know ten weeks from now this virus we haven apost won this we aposll go back to congress again but i think we aposre injecting a lot of liquidity into the system and hardworking americans know that the president wants to protect them and we aposre doing everything to support them roberts i was going to just ask you that question that is what is the time frame in which this stimulus package is designed to work is it six weeks eight weeks you mention just a second ago 10 weeks mnuchin i well first of all i hope this gets passed on monday because we need the money now you know i would say we are looking at this from anywhere to a 10 to 12 week scenario but again the situation is moving quickly we need to get the money into the economy now if we do that we think we can stabilize the economy we aposre putting a lot of money into the hospitals and you know i think the president has every expectation that this is going to look a lot better four or eight weeks from now roberts right so if this does go beyond ten weeks because i mean we aposve seen what the infection curve is like in south korea we aposve seen it in china we don apost know what it aposs like here in the united states particularly in new york city if after 10 weeks businesses still have to remain closed and nobody is flying on the airlines you aposre staying in hotel rooms can you keep going back to the well larry kudlow has suggested that with interest rates the way they are borrowing is basically a bottomless pit but i mean how much debt can you take on to address this mnuchin well i think the good news is the u s economy is strong ok we stopped major parts of it but when we get through this virus as i aposve said i think you aposre going to see the u s economy come back to the strength we have great companies we have great workers what we need to do is have a bridge to get through this and this isn apost the financial crisis that aposs going to go on for years so i aposve been listening to the medical professionals i think there aposs a lot of advances that are being made different types of treatments we aposre going to do whatever we need to do to win this war and i think this bill gives us a lot of money to create a lot of liquidity in the system and protect americans and if this lasts longer we aposll come back again roberts all right you said that the economy is strong you expect it to bounce back but how long can we stay in the situation we are in now before this temporary damage becomes permanent because there are a lot of smaller businesses that are going under day by day because they can apost stay open they can apost pay their people and even the financial assistance isn apost going to help them out mnuchin well this financial assistance will help them out so approximately 50 percent of the economy is small businesses and what we aposre doing here is we aposre providing liquidity for those small businesses many of which have zero revenues to give them money to pay their workers to pay their rent to pay their electricity roberts but is that going to cover everybody i mean there were an awful lot of small businesses here mnuchin that will cover you know kind of roughly half of the private workforce and yes in most cases it aposs companies 500 or less but yes that aposs going to cover roughly half the workforce and as i said for bigger companies we have liquidity facilities we aposll have enhanced unemployment insurance again just for the coronavirus but we want to make sure that workers are paid roberts are we currently mr secretary in a recession mnuchin i think that aposs a technically question that in this situation is not terribly relevant you know are we going to have reduced economic activity this quarter absolutely i think next quarter a lot depends on how quickly the curve of the medical situation works ph but you know when people focus on recessions it aposs normally because of a prolonged economic environment this is a very unique situation that we aposve never had before this is the government has self imposed shutting down large parts of the economy and as soon as we can get the medical situation under control we aposre going to reopen it and to the extent we aposve kept all these small businesses in business we aposve kept workers with them when we reopen the economy the economy is going to bounce back significantly roberts the washington post reported yesterday that the intelligence community was giving the white house warnings back in january and early february that the situation coming out of china was very very serious and would likely end up in a pandemic were were you over at the treasury department ever warned that something like this was coming down the pike because the initial white house reaction appeared to be oh don apost worry it aposs over there in china i was told why do we need to respond robustly because there aposs only 16 cases here were you ever warned early on by the intelligence community that this was coming mnuchin you know i want to be careful talking about specific intelligence but but let me be clear and this is not just in the u s this is this is around the world nobody expected this to take off at the rate it did and even as you know i aposve now been on the task force listening to the medical professionals for a long period of time i said a few weeks ago you know i felt comfortable traveling on commercial airfare i did roberts uh huh mnuchin the situation has changed very quickly and the president has responded to that you know as we saw the spread here we shut down airline travel abroad with europe that was a very important move and as we see in states we aposve been working with the states in recommending this so i don apost think anybody should second guess the government actions this has been moving very quickly and i think we aposve responded appropriately roberts the defense production act the president basically activated it but he hasn apost yet put it into practice but we have states like michigan and so many others and i aposm going to talk to the governor of michigan coming up a little bit later who are in desperate need of medical supplies general motors is volunteering to make ventilators but does the president need to pull the trigger on the defense production act and say industry get out there and make this equipment because we aposre running behind this is only going to get worse before it gets better and we need you to step up to the plate now mnuchin well i know the task force is very focused on supply chains quite frankly i aposm full time focused right now on the economic side of this we have other people working on the supply chains but i have every confidence that the president has these powers he aposs working with private industry and we aposre expediting this as quickly as possible roberts just before we go when do you expect to vote on this fiscal stimulus package mnuchin monday morning roberts all right secretary mnuchin as always thanks for your time and see you at the white house tomorrow we aposll keep an eye on the action on capitol hill mnuchin thank you very much roberts coming up next we aposll ask the former cdc director tom frieden whether the american health system has the tools it needs to fight the virus commercial break john roberts fox host our next guest on fox news sunday says it aposs time to adapt to a new normal as the country confronts the realities of coronavirus and says there is a long road ahead joining us now is the former director of the centers for disease control dr tom frieden dr frieden welcome back to fox news sunday and on a personal level good to see you we interacted a lot when i was in atlanta both of us were there good to see you again tom frieden former director centers for disease control good to see you roberts so let me ask you first of all where do you think we are are are are heading with this with the number of infections arising where on the infection curve are we are are we expecting tens of thousands of cases in the next few days and weeks or are we expecting hundreds of thousands of cases frieden well first off we aposre in different places in different parts of the u s and different parts of the world and that aposs why it aposs so important that state and local health departments and governments have a key role here in tracking what aposs happening locally not only with the virus but with the health care system and advising people on what to do here in new york city where i am today we are really telling everyone stay home and in new york city where the hospitals are getting overwhelmed we aposre saying if you have mild illness don apost get tested stay home because it aposs not going to change anything even if you aposre positive we aposre going to say stay home and if you go out there to get tested you may use up testing supplies use up protective equipment use up time and effort of the health care workers and if you aposre not infected you might get infected if you are infected you might infect someone else so mild illness new york city today stay home where we aposre going first off really important to get one key concept it takes on average five or six days from the time someone gets infected to when they get sick and about another week before they get very sick so the severe cases we aposre seeing today are people who were infected ten to 14 days ago that means that for the next 10 to 14 days we aposre likely to continue to see a big increase in cases in places like new york city that aposs why we aposre so worried about health care becoming overwhelmed and keeping our health care workers as safe as possible roberts doctor mike ryan of the world health organization says that lockdowns are not enough reading a quote for him he says what we really need to focus on is finding those who are sick those who have the virus and isolate them find their contacts and isolate them but i was talking to somebody at the cdc just on friday who told me that the cdc is not really doing a whole lot of contact racing anymore because now the disease is so widespread frieden it depends on where you are in a place like new york city where we have tens of thousands of infections maybe hundreds of thousands already finding the sources of cases and the contacts isn apost going to work what you want to do is drive down new infections by these social distancing stay home wash your hands don apost shake hands stay at least six feet away from almost everyone and then over the next two to three weeks we might expect to see after that starts with a lag of a couple of weeks for the previously infected people a drive down of cases and that aposs when you restart really aggressive testing contact racing isolation ultimately what you want to do is tamp down cases and anywhere in the country anywhere in the world where cases are just coming in you want to try to find the new cases anyone who aposs sick isolate identify the contacts so that they can be quarantined and isolated if they become sick roberts and we know that you have personal experience with that as well in the ebola crisis of a number of years ago as well isolating people treating them in terms of a vaccine we know that we aposre still at least probably a year away but there is some promising therapies that seem to be on the horizon one of them is an old friend that was used as an anti malarial agent it was given to every u s gi pretty much who went to vietnam during the vietnam war chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine some evidence that in combination with a very common antibiotic azithromycin it can shorten the course of disease but there seems to be some debate over whether or not that should be deployed president trump very bullish on it dr anthony fauci of the national institutes of allergy and infectious disease a little more circumspect let aposs listen to both of them talking about it here begin video clip dr anthony fauci director national institute of allergy and infectious disease we aposre trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the american people available at the same time that we do it under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it aposs truly safe and truly effective donald trump president of the united states i aposm probably more of a fan of that than maybe than anybody this early but we aposve you know i aposve seen things that are impressive and we aposll see we aposre going to know soon we aposre going to know soon and including safety end video clip roberts so the president has said dr frieden what the hell do you have to lose we aposve got this treatment that we aposve got this drug that aposs out there we aposve known it for almost 70 years now do you think it should be tried should it be deployed frieden we all hope there will be good treatment for people will severe infection with this virus because that would make a big difference recently just last week two of the best antiviral drugs were tried in combination and they didn apost show any impact things seem promising but until you study them until you really figure out does it work we don apost know so absolutely i think we should urgently figure out whether chloroquine hydroxychloroquine azithromycin have an impact on the outcomes of disease we have three goals here reduce the number of infections improve the outcomes in people who have infection and reduce the societal and economic harms of this pandemic roberts you say that there aposs too big stories coming in the next week what do you see coming down the tracks frieden sadly in places like new york city and elsewhere i aposm afraid we will see an increasing number of health care workers infected some of whom make get severely ill and the potential that we will overwhelm some of our intensive care capacity that aposs what i aposm most concerned about for the coming week the models that we aposve seen and the trends that we aposre seeing are extremely concerning remember i said it aposs about seven 10 14 days from the time of infection to severe illness that means the severe illness we aposre seeing now was a result of infections that happened almost two weeks ago and i those last two weeks there aposs been an escalating number of cases so the possibility of having tremendous stress on our health care system our intensive care units our nurses our doctors transports everyone who works in the health care system than with that more risks of infections in health care more risks of patients dying that aposs very concerning and that aposs why in new york city and elsewhere people are scrambling to try to scale up the capacity to care for patients safely but that aposs not easy to do this is very involved intensive care roberts when when you were the director of the cdc you were always on the front lines we saw you there in africa in all of your protective equipment as you were looking at what was going on with the ebola crisis firsthand are you concerned that the centers for disease control has been sidelined somewhat in the in the in the public aspect of this i mean we haven apost seen dr redfield for days now frieden i would feel a lot safer if it were clear that the cdc is both at the table where the decisions are being made and at the podium where they aposre being explained the cdc is the nation aposs leading health protection agency one of the centers within the cdc is the national center for immunization respiratory disease they have more than 700 medical professionals who are experts in the understanding control of infectious diseases and in order to do more and protect people more we need their full involvement fighting this without cdc central to the responses has never been done with an infectious disease threat in the u s before and it aposs like fighting with one hand tied behind your back roberts the president is getting high marks from people like governor cuomo of new york governor newsom of california for working with the states on on trying to combat this this virus you aposve been watching there from your perch in new york city what this white house has been doing how would you grade the president aposs response because he has been criticized by people as well frieden this is not a time for grading this is a time for all of us to work together for every part of the federal government for individuals for people to pull together against a common enemy a dangerous microbe there aposs something everyone can do stay home wash your hands don apost go out of your sick there aposs something that our health care system needs to do prepare for a safer surge to care for patients and also key people who need their medications for hypertension or diabetes or other illnesses keep them safe and on medications through telemedicine my refilled prescriptions all of us can play a role and one thing we have to do more is to understand this virus and how it aposs spreading and how to control it better the better we understand it the better we can protect people roberts let me quickly if i could dr frieden come back to where we started because you you didn apost give me a number at the beginning do you believe we aposll see tens of thousands of cases or hundreds of thousands of cases here in the united states frieden i think we already have many times more cases than have been detected in places like new york city we already have tens or hundreds of thousands of infections there aposs no doubt from the information that apos we aposre seeing the challenge is what can we do today that aposs going to slow down this really exponential phase of the increase this accelerating pandemic and that aposs possible by people staying home avoiding social contact roberts yes frieden we aposre all in this together and what each one of us does can protect all of us roberts one one real quick question if i could any idea how long this is going to last frieden very hard to predict what aposs going to happen this is unprecedented it aposs never happened before but we do have by working together within us the ability to change the trajectory of this pandemic what will happen in the coming months only the coming months will tell but what we do is within our power roberts dr frieden always good to see you thanks for taking the time appreciate it frieden nice to speak with you again john roberts up next coronavirus halts auto production and now one automaker is gearing up to help produce much needed ventilators we aposll discuss that and more with the michigan governor gretchen whitmer coming up next commercial break john roberts fox anchor all 50 states are currently in states of emergency including michigan which of course is home to the nation aposs auto industry joining us now from east lansing is the governor of michigan gretchen whitmer governor welcome to fox news sunday thanks for joining us i know it aposs difficult times and your time is very valuable we appreciate you spending some of it with us gov gretchen whitmer d mi happy to be here roberts so latest count in the state of michigan just shy of 800 cases though i imagine at the next count it will be over that some eight deaths in your state as well how are you fairing at this point whitmer well you know we i have the same challenge that states across the country are having we need more test kits it is hard to really make an educated decision and to know what you aposre really confronting without data and that all is reliant on test kits we have too few test kits we have from the from the get go as the same as you know any other state and that aposs really important we aposve right now got to prioritize those who are perhaps the most medically vulnerable for testing and that doesn apost really give you enough data to feel like you aposre making decisions that are based on on fact and science and so we aposre moving forward we aposre trying to be aggressive as many other states have we closed schools very early i aposve i yesterday closed nail salons and tattoo parlors as well as you know last week closing other businesses in michigan because it aposs really important that we aposre taking this seriously and mitigating the spread or we will overwhelm our healthcare systems and more people will lose their lives and our economy will suffer even longer so we aposve got to be aggressive now roberts the question we or at least the point that we keep hearing from the white house is only the sickest people or people who are really symptomatic should be tested do you do you think the tested testing should be broadened out so that we know maybe people who are asymptomatic might be carriers whitmer absolutely i think that the most important thing that we need is data we should be testing everyone who can who comes in so that we can really understand if there clusters are there geographic areas that we need to make priorities are there lessons to be learned how many people are being hospitalized of those that test positive in michigan yesterday there aposs a report that we aposve got an infant that tested positive we know that our young people are suffering severe lung damage as older people are and and so this is there aposs so much that we need to learn in such a short period of time and testing is a fundamental crucial component of that roberts i saw that report of a one month old in macomb county who has tested positive for coronavirus which would which would seem to go against a lot of what we aposve been hearing that there seems to be some sort of natural resistance among the youngest people out there i aposm told that you aposre hoping for south korea here not italy when it comes to the spread of this disease in terms of limiting the spread how are you doing whitmer well you know we aposve taken some aggressive actions we aposve been on the front edge of that and i aposve continually checked in with my fellow governors larry hogan republican from maryland or mike dewine just to the south of me in ohio as well as j b pritzker and my my fellow midwesterners like tim walz it aposs important that we aposre learning from one another that we aposre sharing information i was on the phone most of the morning yesterday with experts from around the country we have got to be aggressive on the frontend or we are going to get overwhelmed in our healthcare systems and then everything is going to be overwhelmed and that aposs why it aposs important that we aposre aggressive it aposs important that we aposre listening to scientists and doctors and making decisions based on on the best facts available always in the interest of the public health roberts where are you governor on this idea of a stay at home order like the state of california like new york state others are considering it as well whitmer yes so i you know things are moving fast we aposre getting information hourly and i mean it will continue to climb and so we are always evaluating we aposve got an ongoing debate about what the next step is and i would anticipate additional steps being taken because we aposve got to be serious about this roberts one thing that kind of puzzles me is that you you have limited groups of people to 50 or fewer yet there was an exemption for places of worship why would a place of worship be any less likely to transmit disease in a larger gathering than another place would whitmer it aposs not it aposs not and we aposre discouraging people from gathering at all and we aposre encouraging everyone to stay home roberts so why this exemption whitmer well you know the separation of church and state and the republican legislature asked me to clarify that we are you know that that aposs a that that aposs an area that we don apost have the ability to directly enforce and control we are encouraging people though do not congregate do not go to church on sunday and sit next to people that you know could be spreading the the covid 19 you yourself can be carrying it and you might not even know it that aposd be the worst thing in the world is to go to church to worship and to sit next to someone and infect them and have them suffer life you know life threatening consequences because of you know this decision roberts all right so so the state of michigan obviously the home of the auto industry like the airlines like the cruise lines like the hotel industry do you believe that the auto industry is going to need some sort of financial assistance here to get through the next however many weeks that we aposre dealing with this whitmer well you know the auto industry has been the backbone of our economy and this nation and certainly that aposs the truth here in michigan from supply the whole supply chain employs a lot of people in this state and so when it shuts down it aposs not an easy decision to make i applaud the big three working with the uaw for making the that decision but at the end of the day we aposve got to make sure that we can still be competitive that we can still be on the cutting edge of mobility and solving the problems that we aposre confronting as a globe and so the auto industry has to be right up there with any other industry that is able to access loans and to get some assistance during these times roberts as we mentioned general motors has offered to retool to make ventilators which may help to increase the supply are you experiencing shortages in your state whitmer we are we anticipate an incredible need for ventilators just as every other state aposs anticipating we aposre actively trying to find ventilators or re you know bring ventilators back online that perhaps were retired so the fact that gm is is really serious about moving into that space right now this is a global crisis this is an automaker that helped make us the you know arsony ph the arsony of democracy arsenal of democracy when we were in the war this is something that we have a battle on our hands and it aposs got to be all hands on deck so we aposre grateful for their leadership roberts you know both sides here are calling for politics to be left out of this as we respond to it but the president was very critical of you the other day tweeting quote failing michigan governor must work harder and must much be much more proactive we aposre pushing her to get the job done i stand with michigan what aren apost you doing governor that you could be doing more of i i know that republicans in your state have said maybe extend unemployment insurance to people who are working part time unemployment insurance to contract workers allow canadian doctors to practice in the united states allow online work by students to count suspend fees for hunting and fishing licenses so that more people would get outdoors as opposed to stay indoors allow bars and restaurants to sell take out liquor what what do you is there more that you could be doing what are considering doing whitmer well i think the irony of of the attack on twitter is that we aposve actually been a lot more aggressive than the federal government we aposve been taking this very seriously he aposs responding to my criticism that they didn apost do the preparation that they needed to do on the frontend that aposs why we have a shortage of tests that aposs why we have people who don apost take this seriously because for a long time we were told that it wasn apost to be taken seriously this is what we aposre up against we have to have truth in in communication we have to be making decisions based on science and facts we can apost have half truths or hyperbole convince people that this isn apost to be taken seriously if you aposre not serious you aposre woefully uneducated about what we are confronting as a nation and that aposs why i aposm trying to implore everyone to take this seriously do your part every one of us whether you aposre asymptomatic and healthy today or you aposre someone who aposs medically vulnerable has to do your part washing your hands social distancing all of the practices from the cdc i aposve been so impressed with dr fauci roberts ok whitmer but everyone needs to really listen to him everyone roberts that that said that said governor are there other steps that you could be taking that you aposre not taking right now whitmer so you know we aposve been aggressive i was one of the first governors to call off school for a period of time i was the first one of the first to close down a lot of different restaurants and businesses roberts but but what about but what about these other what about these what about these other items though like extending unemployment insurance benefits bringing in canadian doctors hunting and fishing license suspension fees gov whitmer yes i single handedly extended unemployment benefits in one of my emergency orders from 20 weeks to 26 so we can help people who are unemployed i called on the white house to make sure that we had an extension on the travel ban between the united states and canada for this front line medical workers roberts ok but i aposm sorry i aposm sorry governor but but ok but what about going forward what else are you thinking about whitmer oh we aposre we aposre obviously sharing as much information with my fellow governors so that we aposre making smart decisions moving forward there are additional steps that we are going to continue to take and we aposll be rolling those out today tomorrow throughout the week as we ascertain precisely where we can make a difference and how we can take additional steps to flatten the curve we aposve been aggressive in michigan we aposre going to continue to be roberts governor whitmer we certainly wish you all the luck in the world as you fight this challenge thanks so much for joining us this morning really appreciate you taking the time whitmer thank you be well roberts up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the impact of coronavirus on the nation aposs health economy and the race for the white house commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i have a very good relationship with china and with president xi i have great respect for president xi i consider him to be a friend of mine it aposs unfortunate that this got out of control it came from china it got out of control end video clip roberts president trump on friday defending his calling of the coronavirus the chinese virus despite growing calls that the phrase is a racial slur and his election campaign following suit an e mail from the trump war room accusing democratic frontrunner joe biden of siding with the chinese as the race for 2020 takes shape it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove former dnc chairwoman donna brazile and dr marty makary professor of johns hopkins school of public health and now a fox news contributor good morning all donna brazile fox news contributor good morning roberts karl let me start with you because you you lived through both of these at the white house is is this a 9 11 moment or a katrina moment for president trump karl rove fox news contributor well i guess what you mean by that is this a moment in which the american people respond and say the administration aposs doing the right thing or say you failed roberts correct rove and we don apost know because we looked out now we look back now and call them moments but like on 9 11 it was not only the response on 9 11 itself the which ended with the president aposs remarks from the oval office but it was the visit to the mosque on wednesday it was the national cathedral speech it was the iconic moment in new york it was the with the with the bullhorn i hear you the whole world hears you it was the visit to the to the world series and it was that planning and the execution of the effort in afghanistan so this is this like that will be a series of moments it will be a judgment that will be made by the american people as this goes along and as the administration is seen to be making the right steps or not making the right steps so far so good though abc ipsos poll last week trump handling of the coronavirus crisis approved 55 disapprove 43 that was this week the week before was 43 54 disapprove so the president aposs had a pretty quick turnaround for a guy who aposs never been above 50 percent in a gallup poll the initial reaction seems to be the american people see him as doing the right things and this is a situation where the democrats make a mistake if they overreach this attack for example calling it xenophobic and racist to call it the chinese virus it emanated from china and china lied to the world about what was going on there china has launched an attack blaming this on the united states their ambassador in south africa went out and said america created this virus a foreign ministry official said the u s army let it loose a concerted organized effort by the chinese government and the democrats appear to be sort of in a weird place by saying don apost call it china don apost call it the china virus did they call barack obama racist when his when he was briefed about mers the middle east respiratory syndrome and his press spokesman said it went out and said oh yes the president received a briefing today about the pre emergence of mers in the united states we think we can contain it roberts yes rove you know it aposs just an overreach that that that is that is really a bad a bad mishandling of this moment roberts well well let aposs well let aposs get donna brazile to to respond to that and and the fact donna as well that the president has been praised by new york governor cuomo and gavin newsom from california while he aposs also receiving all of this criticism what aposs your take on it brazile first of all we are faced with a a global pandemic that is deadly and also i believe it calls upon our leaders national leaders local leaders to work collectively to speak as often as possible with one voice i think the reason why many americans including myself are very concerned about labeling it as a chinese virus is because this is not the time to sow discord and division we have to provide the kind of leadership that the american people understand that we stay at home so that we can not just protect ourselves and our families but our communities that our public health personnel are on the front lines and they need equipment they need materials in order to do their jobs and to protect their lives this is a time where you look for leadership not division not dividing and i understand the the the normal response to going to a poll driven what i call mania but right now we we want straight answers from our leaders we want to know how we can protect ourselves and protect our economy as well as our own lives and livelihood so i just want to say because i came out of my home in my neighborhood today and i came out because i am concerned as an american citizen karl and i worked very close together after katrina to make sure that we did not you know have this so called partisan moment roberts yes brazile we had to we had to work together and that aposs what we must do today work together if we aposre going to stop this pandemic from destroying who we are as a country and who we are as individual citizens as well roberts on on the subject of leadership let me go to dr makary what should the federal role be in all of this dr makary to assist states or or lead the way and and how do you view what the white house is doing dr marty makary fox news contributor well first of all many government leaders are doing the right thing but the problem is some of america still is in denial that we even have a problem you know we live in a very opinionated country but this is not fantasy football here these are facts and this is data and what aposs happening in italy will happen in the united states they had 793 deaths in the last 24 hours i saw your interview with dr frieden just now i don apost think he answered your question about how many cases we aposre we aposre going to have here roberts yes yes makary we aposre going to have hundreds of thousands of deaths and we aposre going to have millions of people with the infection that aposs based on the data of italy extrapolated to our population what they aposre experiencing now is over 4 000 americans dying per day when we get to their point in the infection we aposve got the governor of oklahoma taking selfies in crowded food courts saying he doesn apost want to do any restrictions on friday we aposve got hospitals that still have been doing elective surgery all this week using valuable gowns and masks so we aposve got the scientific battle but we need to do the public awareness to really make a big dent here and to try to flatten the curve roberts we only have one minute left because everyone was espousing so much their opinions on this which we love it was great but let me ask you this question karl and donna brazile do you believe that this and the way that it unfolds could have a real impact on donald trump aposs re election chances rove oh absolutely it aposs going to have an effect on everybody in the political drama but bernie sanders is basically dead in the water he needs to have big rallies to keep his movement going roberts can apost do that rove joe biden is reduced to being on the sideline and then we have president trump aposs fate fate is going to determine be determined by how well he is seen as handling this crisis roberts donna brazile no question it will be a referendum on his leadership during this moment of crisis and how i think the american people will judge him if he can tell the truth and to make us believe him i think that aposs a moment for the president to try to take advantage of this opportunity to try to heal and bring us together roberts dr makary real quick answer should the president continue to push to get hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine out there i need 10 seconds makary yes look there aposs a study from france showing it there may be of benefit the idea that it aposs just anecdotal is is not really true there is some data out there and when someone aposs on a ventilator about to die why not give them a chance with a medication that safe roberts we aposve got to go panel thanks so much we aposll see you again next sunday brazile thank you roberts coming up next our power player of the week the wife of an nfl hall of famer who carried the ball to help older retired players get their dues stay with us commercial break roberts last fall we brought you the story of an nfl wife fighting to make sure the players from seasons past get there due for the league that they helped to build here aposs chris wallace with his power player of the week begin videotape lisa marie riggins advocate for nfl pension parity you have very proud families and proud men who aren apost going to beg and i aposve tried to create a way to be a voice without exposing them in an uncomfortable way chris wallace fox anchor lisa marie riggins is talking about fair fairness for athletes in retirement a nonprofit she helped set up last year to advocate for former pro football players she has the support of hall of famer like dick butkus franco harris and her husband john riggins john riggins nfl hall of famer i mean i aposm getting by all right for now but there aposs a lot of guys out there that aren apost and they deserve a little bit better than what they aposve been shown unidentified male it aposs another green bay touchdown wallace the problem is players who retired before 1993 have a whole different set of benefits than player who retire now a pre apos93 player in the league seven years gets a pension of about 25 000 a year and nothing else the current player gets more than double that pension health care a 401 k and other benefits l riggins we are asking for parity and in one benefit wallace on camera pensions l riggins pension wallace you aposre not asking for the health care l riggins

the league and the players association l riggins i have not gotten any direct reaction wallace voice over lisa marie says some older players even household names to football fans are suffering from the physical and cognitive effects of the game and don apost have the money to take care of themselves or their families l riggins i just saw this sad sad despair that was growing amongst friends and people i care about and how do you stand by and watch it if there aposs something you can at least try to do wallace lisa marie and john met when he was a college student and he was still a player l riggins i thought he was one of the more exciting charismatic dynamic people i aposd ever i aposd ever seen wallace on camera so you were smitten from l riggins i was smitten i didn apost know they made people like john wallace voice over they aposve been married 23 years and lisa marie who started as an actress has been a lawyer for more than a decade wallace on camera does she know john riggins the bad boy or had you mellowed by the time you two met j riggins oh no she still knows who that guy is he hasn apost showed up for quite a while but you know he aposs always around i mean you

tremendous satisfaction knowing that there are these 4 500 players and their families that will have a check that they earned that is commensurate with their contributions that something will improve their quality of life and it will be a thanks for everything that they did they were not forgott
