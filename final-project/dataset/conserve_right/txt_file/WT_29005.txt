tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap president donald trump said saturday that military action against iran was still an option for its downing of an unmanned u s military aircraft but amid heightened tensions he dangled the prospect of eventually becoming an unlikely best friend of america s longtime middle eastern adversary trump also said we very much appreciate that iran s revolutionary guard chose not to target a u s spy plane carrying more than 30 people the president s softer tone saturday marked a stark contrast to the anti iran rhetoric he employed throughout the presidential campaign and presidency including his use of punishing economic sanctions in an attempt to pressure iran to give up its quest to build nuclear weapons top stories

of knowingly targeting the plane and he reiterated that he aborted a planned military strike set for thursday after learning approximately 150 iranians would be killed everybody was saying i m a war monger and now they say i m a dove and i think i m neither if you want to know the truth trump told reporters i m a man with common sense and that s what we need in this country is common sense but i didn t like the idea of them knowingly shooting down an unmanned drone and then we kill 150 people he added i don t want to kill 150 iranians i don t want to kill 150 of anything or anybody unless it
