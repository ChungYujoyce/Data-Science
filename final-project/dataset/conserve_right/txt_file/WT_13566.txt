 flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion there s a new class of members in the foreign aid club with china at the head at this summer s fifth conference of the forum on africa china cooperation the red dragon pledged 20 billion of new aid to the developing continent that is more than spare change the chinese commitment is symbolic of the dramatic paradigm shift taking place in foreign aid in the past decade the brics economies brazil russia india china and south africa are lending to countries that for decades relied on the organization for economic cooperation and development development assistance committee oecd dac a group of western and like minded states commonly referred to as traditional donors increasingly aid is emanating not only from the brics a second tier of emerging donors south korea venezuela indonesia saudi arabia and turkey to name a few also are playing a more prominent role in foreign aid while the figures are hazy a working paper by the center for global development indicates that emerging powers contribute between 11 billion and 42 billion in aid each year china the largest emerging donor gives out more money today than the world bank according to the council on foreign relations elizabeth c economy while the sheer volume is astounding the reach of assistance also is expanding top

than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed many emerging donors have provided aid for decades much in the form of technical cooperation and knowledge sharing often to countries in their own backyard india for instance trained thousands of civilian and defense professionals through a technical and economic program since the early 60s south africa brazil and oil rich arab states have been channeling aid to projects and programs in africa south america and across the middle east respectively for decades a new and fundamental transformation is taking shape emerging donors are becoming more tactical and organized india for decades the largest recipient of development aid announced in 2011 that it would establish its own development agency and shell out about 11 billion over the next seven years according to indian officials the new agency will be modeled around the u s agency for international development and will ensure that delivery is transparent and effective similarly south africa has proposed a development agency that promises to be efficient and flexible among the new club of donors china is the most watched and most criticized its disregard for good governance and environmental standards and continued relations with rogue and pariah states are widely condemned it has been criticized for disorganization and irregular aid disbursements by both traditional donors and recipient nations this is changing slowly as well in april 2011 china released its first white paper on foreign aid an unambiguous effort to outline its mission and showcase how its activities have been part of a concerted and thought out national policy on aid emerging powers are not shy about disclosing that their interest in foreign aid is both humanitarian and strategic aspirations to play a more prominent role on the global stage are at the forefront the use of soft power to gain political leverage is fast becoming an essential policy tool regarding the launch of south africa s new development agency an official openly noted that the agency was not only a reflection of altruistic motives but of how to advance south africa s own interests similarly india and brazil have been candid about loosening their purse strings to win political favors at the united nations especially to gain a coveted seat on the u n security council at their end recipient countries no doubt have welcomed the new money enthusiastically the 2008 global financial crisis in particular provided a unique opportunity for emerging powers to step in as europe and the united states crumbled into a prolonged recession their foreign aid budgets have contracted since beyond the money itself aid from the emerging powers is delivered faster and comes with no strings attached in addition a study by the economic strategy institute says china s sheer competence and speed with which it is able to negotiate and execute its development programs is an important element of its appeal moreover emerging donors have effectively marketed their dual role status as donors and recipients further adding to the appeal of south south cooperation that said there are plenty of reasons for traditional donors to stay in business first data on emerging donor assistance is hugely unreliable while there are reports and estimations of disbursement figures these are not monitored adequately and many figures simply are not disclosed as a result uncertainty remains about whether countries and even specific sectors are receiving the aid they need along the same lines loans and investments from emerging donors do not undergo the same scrutiny and may lack monitoring to enforce environmental and human rights standards in contrast oecd dac evaluates projects based on impact sustainability effectiveness efficiency and relevance second aid from emerging countries is still largely regional or based on a shared identity this may change but as of yet the largest disbursements for brazil are to portuguese speaking countries and within the caribbean india s largest disbursement is to bangladesh saudi arabia s primary focus is within the middle east and so forth there are large swaths of regions not precluding emerging donors themselves that are still in need of crucial foreign aid from traditional donors finally competition is not bad so far the west with the exceptionof five of the 22 countries of the oecd dac have failed to muster the political will to meet aid commitments of 0 7 of gross national income pledged at the 2005 group of eight gleneagles summit fresh actors may result in more
