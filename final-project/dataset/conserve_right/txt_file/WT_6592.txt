tsai ing wen of the pro independence democratic progressive party dpp has surged in polls and is now favored to win a second four year term in a race with opposition kuomintang kmt party candidate han kuo yu taiwan s past presidential elections were more focused on domestic issues such as health care mass transit graft and corruption pension reform and taxes but beijing s mishandling of hong kong s pro democracy mass demonstrations which have stretched over six months and show no signs of abating has brought the threat posed by china to the forefront for voters top stories oregon becomes first

for coronavirus global survey the result is that the candidate china most opposes because of her pro independence policies has garnered widespread popular support before the onset of the hong kong protests in june ms tsai was hurt by charges of cronyism in political appointments and her push for legislation legalizing same sex marriage then in december a hard line speech by chinese president xi jinping triggered fears of mainland coercion in taiwan mr xi warned that reunification of the mainland and taiwan where nationalists fled during a civil war decades ago is inevitable we are willing to create broad space for peaceful reunification but will leave no room for any form of separatist activities mr xi declared we make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of using all necessary means the means include an estimated 1 200 chinese missiles deployed within range of taiwan that are a potent reminder of a potential conflict the xi speech was seen as a blunt rejection of ms tsai s promise that taiwan would never adopt the chinese reunification formulation known as one country two systems ms tsai noted in an october speech that the policy had left hong kong on the edge of disorder china is still threatening to impose its one country two systems model for taiwan their diplomatic offensives and military coercion pose a serious challenge to regional stability and peace ms tsai said when freedom and democracy are challenged and when the republic of china s existence and development are threatened we must stand up and defend ourselves that message appears to resonate with taiwanese voters who polls say favor the anti communist policies over those of the kmt s more accommodationist stance opinion polls show ms tsai leading mr han 53 to 20 a

beijing sought to encroach on the former british colony s legal system draft legislation would have allowed for judicial extradition to china where the communist party controls the courts the hong kong protests have set back beijing s efforts toward reunification a senior state department official said this week that the trump administration was concerned about chinese meddling in the taiwanese election but added that the process appears stable we haven t seen any indications at least certainly not from the taiwanese of any nefarious activity the senior official told reporters adding that the u s policy goal is to encourage a functioning and proven democratic process in taiwan the u s takes no interest in who wins the official added the fact that the process stays sacrosanct is what s important as it is in our own election process the key to addressing external election interference is to educate the population as far as i can tell the taiwanese are aware of the potential for that sort of interference the official said observers say revelations of chinese election meddling have hardened voters views against such activity john tkacik a former state department official closely involved in taiwanese issues said chinese intelligence agencies and the united front work department beijing s influence agency have aggressively sought to influence voters in taiwan through disinformation and social media that produced unexpected political setbacks for the dpp in local and municipal elections last year in these last days of taiwan s 2020 general election voters are now well aware of what the chinese did mr tkacik said they are far more sophisticated about fake news than in november of 2018 and taiwan opinion polling reflects that voters won t be fooled again this time mr tkacik said china has not abandoned its efforts to sway opinion in taiwan but that its cyberwarfare and social media disinformation campaign is becoming more sophisticated and subtle and no doubt the chinese as well as others will attempt similar infiltration of american media in the coming months he said ray burghardt a former chairman of the board of trustees at the american institute in taiwan said the recent hong kong elections that swept pro beijing legislators out of office have had a profound impact on saturday s vote beijing s one country two systems was already unpopular in taiwan mr burghardt said the hong kong situation has left that formula totally discredited even han kuo yu has rejected one country two systems but the hong kong situation has made his enthusiasm about improving relations with mainland china look much less appealing to taiwan voters than it did in 2018 when he was elected kaohsiung mayor under president trump the united states has increased ties with taiwan by authorizing greater travel by high level u s officials and selling billions of dollars in new weapons including the first sales of f 16 jets since the 1980s the kmt s mr han who was elected mayor of the southern city of kaohsiung in november 2018 has battled criticism that he and the kmt are too accommodating to china and details about covert chinese election support from a chinese defector in australia have fueled further suspicions mr han has come under fire for advocating closer ties with china despite denouncing the one country two systems formulation mr han initially gained widespread support and emerged as a more populist candidate but he has been unable to dispel concerns about his pro beijing views which many fear will lead to a mainland takeover of taiwan as kaohsiung mayor he has sought to build stronger tourism and business ties with china his campaign slogans emphasize the chinese family and that the island which beijing regards as a breakaway province is safe and prosperous ms tsai s policy toward beijing is like a runaway train mr han told taiwan news in october tsai s cross strait policy is simply hatred of china self harm to taiwan chinese support the chinese defector wang liqiang disclosed in a 17 page document obtained by the washington times that china s military intelligence service provided 1 44 million to support mr han s campaign and other pro china political activities in taiwan mr han denied the accusations and said in response that he would withdraw from the presidential race if it were proved he accepted any money from the chinese communist party the defector also said the chinese have launched covert influence operations using taiwanese news media and on social media platforms attacking the dpp a most typical case was that donations were made to han kuo yu through many so called overseas donations mr wang stated over 2 9 million was donated in the name of overseas donations from hong kong and many of the funds were sent out through me the defector said that if the pro mainland kmt wins the presidential election the outcome will boost china s bargaining power in its trade war with the u s taiwanese authorities are investigating the defector s claims but have not commented publicly a chinese couple identified by mr wang as the spy master and his wife behind the chinese influence operations in taiwan and hong kong have been detained in taiwan china at one point shifted its backing of mr han to foxconn founder terry gou because beijing believed he would be easier to control the statement said mr gou pulled out of the presidential race in september taiwan s government has been closely monitoring chinese election meddling a september report by the national security council stated that beijing has recently carried out a relentless campaign of military diplomatic economic and political threats and intimidation against taiwan the report said the stepped up pressure was a response to ms tsai s rejection of reunification on china s terms china s fears that hong kong protests would spread to china and growing sentiment in taiwan against the mainland many feel that china s attempt to sway this upcoming election constitutes the most serious challenge to taiwan s national sovereignty and democratic political system in the past several decades the report said australia s the age newspaper disclosed wednesday that mr wang was pressured to recant his disclosures about chinese election meddling and other covert influence operations mr wang was told through two intermediaries one in taiwan and one in china that his family would be spared punishment and his debts repaid if he issued a public statement retracting his claims which he first made in november the newspaper reported that the chinese wanted mr wang to go public in a video to falsely claim that
