mischaracterized the record on hillary clinton s defense of her husband and her own treatment of women when he brought up bill clinton s sexual history and other episodes of the past clinton didn t give a square account of the fallout from her email practices a look at some of the claims in the second presidential debate trump asked whether the predatory behavior with women that he described in a 2005 video amounted to sexual assault no i didn t say that at all see also locker room talk prompts clinton attacks trump apologies the facts he certainly didn t own up to sexual assault in his boastful remarks in 2005 but he clearly described groping and kissing women without their permission using his celebrity to impose himself on them i don t even wait he bragged in the video and when you re a star they let you do it you can do anything he went on grab them by the p you can do anything he described a specific sexual advance toward a married woman i moved on her like a bitch but i couldn t get there trump on hillary clinton s behavior when as a young public defender she was assigned to represent an accused child rapist she s seen on two separate occasions laughing at the girl who was raped kathy shelton that young woman is here with us tonight the facts at no point was clinton seen laughing at the victim in 1975 at the age of 12 shelton was sexually assaulted in northwest arkansas clinton was asked by a judge overseeing the case to represent her alleged attacker after the prosecution lost key evidence clinton s client entered a plea to a lesser charge in an interview a decade later clinton expressed horror at the crime but was recorded on tape laughing about procedural details of the case the audio has been seized on by conservative groups looking to attack clinton s presidential candidacy but does not convey mirth at the girl s fate trump on women linked to bill clinton sexually hillary clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously the facts there is no clear independent evidence that hillary clinton viciously attacked women who alleged or confirmed sexual contact with her husband to be sure in the 1992 democratic primaries she was deeply involved in the clinton campaign s effort to discredit one accuser actress gennifer flowers who alleged she had a long running affair with bill clinton both clintons acknowledged past troubles in their marriage but sought to undermine flowers claims bill clinton later acknowledged in a 1998 court deposition that he had a sexual encounter with flowers hillary clinton was also quoted over the years making disparaging comments about other women linked with her husband what is lacking is proof that she engineered efforts to smear their reputation diane blair a political science professor and long time hillary clinton friend who died in 2000 left behind an account of private interviews with hillary clinton in which she told her during the monica lewinsky affair that she considered the former white house intern a narcissistic loony toon clinton after a yearlong investigation there is no evidence that anyone hacked the server i was using and there is no evidence that anyone can point to at all that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands the facts maybe maybe not while there s indeed no direct explicit evidence that classified information was leaked or that her server was breached it was nevertheless connected to the internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers and the public may never know who saw them fbi director james comey has said we assess it is possible that hostile actors gained access to secretary clinton s personal e mail account the associated press previously discovered that her private server which has been a major campaign issue for clinton and the focus of u s investigations appeared to allow users to connect to it openly over the internet and control it remotely that practice experts said wasn t intended to be used without additional protective measures and was the subject of u s government warnings at the time over attacks from even amateur hackers since the ap in early 2013 traced her server to her home in chappaqua new york clinton hasn t fully explained who administered her server if it received software updates to plug security holes or if it was monitored for unauthorized access it s also unclear what if any encryption software clinton s server may have used to communicate with official u s government email accounts comey has said clinton and her staff were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive highly classified information but he said the fbi won t recommend criminal charges against clinton for use of the server while she was secretary of state and closed the investigation trump on bill clinton he lost his license he had to pay an 850 000 fine the facts trump s facts are at best jumbled in 1998 lawyers for bill clinton settled with former arkansas state employee paul jones for 850 000 in her four year lawsuit alleging sexual harassment it was not a fine and there was no finding or admission of wrongdoing trump erred in describing the legal consequences of that case in a related case before the arkansas state supreme court clinton was fined 25 000 and his arkansas law license was suspended for five years clinton also faced disbarment before the u s supreme court but he opted to resign from the court s practice instead of facing any penalties clinton we are now for the first time ever energy independent the facts clinton inaccurately overstates the case for the first time in decades the united states gets more energy domestically than it imports but it is not yet energy independent as the country continues to rely on oil imports from the mideast and elsewhere estimates vary as to when the u s might achieve energy independence domestic oil production has greatly increased in recent years and at the same time oil imports as a percentage of consumption have dropped according to the u s energy information administration oil imports have dropped from 3 58 billion barrels in 2008 to 2 68 billion barrels in 2015 trump she clinton wants to go to a single payer plan which would be a disaster she wants to go to single payer which means the government basically rules everything the facts it s vermont sen bernie sanders not clinton who supports a canada style government run health care system while clinton s health care proposals would expand the government s role in the health care system she s not talking about dismantling the current system which is a hybrid of employer sponsored coverage government programs like medicare and medicaid and individually purchased insurance as president clinton would push for a government sponsored insurance plan in the health care markets created by president barack obama s health care law as an alternative to private insurance but those markets currently cover about 11 million people while about 155 million have job based coverage in excerpts from clinton s paid speeches she gave behind closed doors though she did praise canada s universal coverage and said that single payer systems were as good or better when it came to basic medical care but she also noted drawbacks of such health care systems such as longer wait times for procedures trump i would not have had our troops in iraq the facts trump actually offered lukewarm support for invading iraq before the war began he s repeatedly and erroneously claimed to have come out against the war before it started telling howard stern in september 2002 yeah i guess so when asked if he would back an invasion this time his claim was slightly different that if he had been president at the time he would not have invaded it s conceivable at least that he would have taken a position in office at odds with his stance as a private citizen a few months before the march 2003 invasion he did tell fox news that the economy and threats from north korea posed greater problems than iraq trump i don t like assad at all but assad is killing isis russia is killing isis the facts only partially true syria s president bashar assad considers the islamic state group to be among numerous terrorist groups that threaten his government his overstretched military is mainly focused on combating syrian opposition groups some of which are supported by the united states assad does use air power against is held areas and his ground forces are engaged in fighting with the extremists in deir el zour in the east trump asked whether he had ever sexually assaulted a woman no i have not the facts he s been accused of it but a case has not been proved trump s first wife ivana trump accused him of rape in a deposition in the early 1990s she later said she didn t mean it literally but rather that she felt violated trump was also sued for sexual harassment in 1997 by jill harth a woman who along with her romantic partner was pitching trump to get involved in a pin up competition in the early 1990s in a recent interview with the new york times harth said trump ran his hands up her skirt during dinner in 1992 and on another occasion she said trump tried to force himself on her in his daughter ivanka s bedroom next thing i know he s pushing me against a wall and has his hands all over me harth told the newspaper harth dropped her harassment lawsuit against trump after he settled a separate breach of contract lawsuit trump has denied harth s allegations trump she is raising your taxes and i am lowering your taxes she s raising everybody s taxes massively clinton he would end up raising taxes on middle class families the facts clinton is not raising taxes on everybody nearly all of hillary clinton s proposed tax increases would affect the wealthiest 5 percent of americans according to the nonpartisan tax policy center trump is proposing massive tax cuts for both individuals and businesses yet it s not clear that all americans would benefit the conservative tax foundation estimates that the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers would see their after tax income rise from 0 8 percent to 1 9 percent the wealthiest 1 percent would see their after tax incomes rise at least 10 2 percent to 16 percent yet clinton may be right that trump s proposals would increase taxes on many middle and lower income families trump s plan eliminates the personal exemption which currently allows households to reduce their taxable income by 4 050 for each member of the household including children he would replace that with higher deductions but for many single parents and families with three or more children the standard deduction wouldn t be large enough to offset the loss of personal exemptions trump asked whether his tweets directing people to check out a sex tape showed discipline it wasn t check out a sex tape the facts yes it was trump tweeted check out sex tape and past of former 1996 miss universe alicia machado a woman whom clinton discussed in the first presidential debate as an example of trump s derogatory comments about women machado has publicly supported clinton and criticized trump for body shaming her by calling her miss piggy and threatening to take away her crown for gaining weight the video trump appeared to be referring to was from a spanish reality show in 2005 machado who was a contestant on the show was filmed in bed under the covers with a male contestant and speaking sexually about his body parts the grainy footage doesn t show nudity though machado has said that she was having sex in the footage clinton if we repeal obama s health care law as donald has proposed all of those benefits i have mentioned are lost to everybody and then we will have to start all over again the facts clinton is essentially correct congressional republicans have promised their replacement plan for obama s health care law would provide coverage for the uninsured but they have not provided enough detail to allow a rigorous comparison a complete repeal of the health care law would wipe the slate clean and lawmakers would have to start over republicans have expressed support for some goals of the health care law such as assuring that people with health problems can get coverage but whether a gop replacement plan would work as well remains to be seen trump s own plan was recently evaluated by the commonwealth fund and the rand corporation and the analysis found would increase the number of uninsured people by about 20 million associated press
