apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the free trade consensus of the previous two decades has frayed under president obama and while he has pushed through some low level agreements he has fallen far short of his predecessors on this key driver of the nation s economy and analysts say the u s is lagging behind many of its chief competitors last fall mr obama pushed through congress and signed trade deals with colombia panama and south korea but the agreements were negotiated primarily under president george w bush and scholars give mr bush credit for them mr obama s chief accomplishment is continuing talks on the trans pacific partnership entering a 14th round of negotiations which would be historic when or if it is completed but the deal is moving slowly and mr obama s continued participation has provoked concern among many of his staunchest democratic allies in congress and labor unions top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches to find real breakthroughs on trade some analysts say the nation simply needs a new president the u s isn t going to make progress on trade until we get another president i don t know if mitt romney is the answer but obama clearly is not said peter morici a professor and international trade scholar at the university of maryland mr obama s lackluster record on trade an increasing target of the romney campaign stands in stark contrast to those of his predecessors mr bush signed free trade agreements with more than a dozen countries including australia peru singapore and bahrain president clinton s first term included the signing of the north american free trade agreement with canada and mexico the establishment of permanent normal trade relations with china and the birth of the world trade organization obama vs romney mr romney the presumptive republican presidential nominee increasingly has turned to trade as an attack line against mr obama while the obama administration has failed to achieve any new deals he says the rest of the world is moving full steam ahead since 2007 the european union has finalized or negotiated more than 20 deals china has signed or negotiated nearly 20 even the few trade success stories of the obama administration were results of political motivation said dan ikenson director of the cato institute s steifel center for trade policy studies mr ikenson said it was one of the few areas where the president could try to move to the political middle after the 2010 congressional elections the three agreements he got signed were on the shelf during his first couple of years but after the shellacking he took in the midterm elections he said what does business want mr ikenson said administration officials dispute that characterization pointing to the fact that despite political opposition from within his own party mr obama guided the three deals past the finish line indeed the president had to face down fierce criticism from some top democrats but made some alterations to the agreements and won overwhelming approval from congress including from house minority leader nancy pelosi california democrat a spokeswoman for u s trade representative ron kirk said tuesday that the administration also is exploring trade deals with the european union and continuing negotiations with other countries in the world trade organization pacific hopes the white house also is banking on the eventual implementation of the trans pacific partnership a free trade agreement among the u s canada mexico singapore vietnam malaysia new zealand and others the member nations held their 13th round of talks in san diego this month and mr kirk hailed substantial progress toward opening more asian markets for american goods the 14th round of talks will commence in september this would be a big deal for us in a couple of senses said jeffrey j schott a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics and a specialist in international trade policy for one this is not just a free trade agreement with a couple of small countries by the time the deal closes you re going to have perhaps 13 countries that account for a huge economic area and a large amount of trade involved it also gives us a chance to upgrade the agreements we already have with a couple of countries such as mexico and canada he said but the deal also has raised objections from a variety of factions including several key obama constituencies such as labor unions and university professors although we would welcome the trans pacific partnership that creates good jobs american canadian and mexican workers cannot afford another corporate directed trade agreement such as nafta labor leaders from the afl cio the canadian labour congress and mexico s national union of workers said in a joint statement this month the academic world also has reservations about the agreement chief among them the fear that u s intellectual property laws would be superseded by those in other nations involved with the trans pacific deal the details of the agreement s intellectual property statutes have been kept largely under wraps said sean flynn a law professor at american university and one of more than 30 academics who signed a letter to mr kirk this year calling for the obama administration and other governments at the negotiating table to be more transparent they re doing this through a very secretive process he told the washington times very few of the stakeholders affected especially consumers and a whole host of competitors from businesses to copyright and patent holding companies are being consulted on this confronting china while the trans pacific partnership could become a political success for mr obama and a boon for american businesses u s failure to adequately deal with china s currency manipulation analysts say is holding up the agreement china is bullying obama that s why it s taking so long we can t get other nations to buy into our model because they re watching china bully us said mr morici the university of maryland scholar the romney campaign has zeroed on mr obama s economic policy toward china claiming the nation s massive borrowing from the burgeoning asian superpower has removed any leverage that the u s might have had mr romney has vowed to declare china a currency manipulator and has said the two nations are already essentially in a trade war others say the white house has dealt with china as best it can the obama administration has brought at least seven cases against china before the world trade organization the most recent was a complaint that the nation was violating the rules by discriminating against u s bank card suppliers a wto panel on monday ruled in favor of the u s and white house spokesman jay carney cast the decision as evidence that the obama administration has maintained a hard line he said the ruling was a win in the administration s determination to go after china s efforts to distort global trade rules it s good politics these days analysts say to criticize others handling of what has become a delicate economic relationship with china but words are far different from actions and whether mr romney would truly take a tougher stance isn t a sure thing mr morici said it isn t clear that romney wo
