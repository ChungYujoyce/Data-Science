a job fair at the marriott hotel in colonie n y ap the final monthly jobs report before election day offered a mixed bag of economic evidence that quickly became political putty for the presidential candidates with the unemployment rate ticking up to 7 9 percent but the economy adding a better than expected 171 000 jobs at the same time the number of unemployed grew by 170 000 roughly the same amount to 12 3 million the october numbers allow president obama to argue the economy is technically growing under his watch but they also allow mitt romney to argue that the new jobs are not making much of a dent in the unemployment problem both campaigns quickly set to work putting their spin on data that if nothing else underscores the slow pace of the recovery that apos s 9 million jobs short of what obama promised romney said at a rally in wisconsin shortly before noon unemployment is higher today than when barack obama took office the rate was 7 8 percent the month obama took office today apos s increase in the unemployment rate is a sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill romney said in a separate written statement when i apos m president i apos m going to make real changes that lead to a real recovery so that the next four years are better than the last former bureau of labor statistics chief keith hall told fox business network that at this rate we apos re still talking nine or 10 years before the economy gets back to normal but obama speaking in hilliard ohio pointed to the report as another sign the economy is moving in the right direction despite the challenges remaining we apos ve made real progress but we are here today because we know we apos ve got more work to do obama said as long as there apos s a single american who wants a job and can apos t find one as long as there are families working harder but falling behind our fight goes on alan b krueger chairman of the white house council of economic advisers said today apos s employment report provides further evidence that the u s economy is continuing to heal from the wounds inflicted by the worst downturn since the great depression the numbers stand as the last major economic report before election day capping what has effectively been a two year campaign focused largely on jobs or the lack of jobs while the growth has been slow over the long term the president can argue the economy has expanded albeit modestly federal figures show that since october 2011 the number of unemployed has shrunk by 1 5 million despite the uptick last month still that number does not count those not currently looking for work and the latest report shows roughly 6 5 million people are in that category despite still wanting a job the prior september jobs report came as a surprise showing the unemployment rate dropping to 7 8 percent dipping below 8 percent for the first time since obama took office however economists on both sides of the aisle questioned the accuracy of the number and republicans continued to claim that job growth is not nearly where it needs to be the october report showed the rate ticking up in part because more people were joining the workforce the report reflected growth across a number of sectors including health care and retail and construction mining though lost 9 000 jobs last month and average hourly earnings dropped by a penny to 23 58 obama has said all along that there apos s more work to do but has argued that electing romney would turn back the clock on the recovery still the president said shortly after taking office that failing to right the economy in three years would mean a one term proposition ohio sen rob portman a top romney surrogate reminded voters that the 7 9 percent rate is far higher than what the administration initially predicted he promised sweeping reforms that would boost our hurting economy including a trillion dollar stimulus package that would reduce unemployment to 5 4 percent and policies to reduce the deficit in half by now he said romney has called for a new course and has described the president as out of ideas on thursday he repeatedly mocked obama for proposing a so called department of business i just don apos t think another cabinet chair is going to create the jobs that america needs romney said in doswell va part of a daylong swing through the battleground state romney plans to hit rallies in both wisconsin and ohio on friday obama will attend three campaign events in ohio get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every
