husband is doing his and angel templeton s level best to destabilize them the more successful he is the more imperiled his wife s horse competition becomes interestingly mr buckley makes angel tough as she is on the outside more likable and vulnerable than myndi with whom bird has no offspring while angel is raising her 8 year old son appropriately named barry goldwater templeton on her own four years ago in reviewing supreme courtship for this newspaper i wrote mr buckley is a very funny writer who comes up with novel situations see previous books like thank you for smoking and boomsday among others but his humor is of the very broad variety with a lot more slap than stick based on the evidence in they eat puppies don t they i d like to qualify that his humor is still broad but less so and there are many genuinely funny scenes and observations as christopher buckley ages i detect more of his late father william f s wry sly humor perhaps in time readers will even detect between the lines that mischievous twinkle and grin john greenya
