found the washington based dialogue china said the think tank and the offer to the confucius institute were meant to publicize dissenting perspectives on china that have trouble being heard in the u s

party and that is what they are doing now he accused the institute of trying to influence young people to promote the ideology of the communist party and of stifling conversation on topics that the chinese government deems sensitive this is not an educational problem it is a political problem the whole american government and society needs to be more alert of these dangers he said rep michael t
