apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic singapore ap military brass shopping at asia s biggest defense expo this week have drones high on their to buy list but for u s manufacturers including general atomics which makes the predator hunter killer there s one problem they can only sell to a few countries because of tight export restrictions the controls give rival drone makers from countries such as israel and china a chance to win more business in the growing global market for unmanned aerial vehicles which one group forecasts to more than double in the next decade u s arms makers have been lobbying the government for several years to loosen the restrictions so they can sell their systems to more countries they fear their established market is shrinking as domestic

most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time american aerospace companies are showing off the latest missiles attack helicopters and fighter jets at the singapore airshow but they may find foreign rivals have the upper hand in cutting more deals for drones also known as unmanned aerial vehicles there are countries like israel and china that have weapons capable aircraft and they can sell so it definitely hampers us with business not just in this region but around the world because we cannot compete said billy gililland president of systems integration at general atomics aeronautical systems inc the company s predator and reaper are among the world s most widely deployed drones they can loiter in the air for long periods to give their operators more time to verify targets before firing precision guided warheads exports of drones are tightly controlled by an agreement signed by members of a group called the missile technology control regime which includes the united states britain canada france germany italy and japan the group has since expanded to 34 countries but israel and china aren t members the 1987 agreement was originally intended to curb the spread of ballistic missiles present day concern about spreading advanced weaponized drone technology to countries or groups hostile to the u s is a factor in keeping the american restrictions in place officials at companies such as northrop grumman which makes the high altitude global hawk argue the restrictions hurt competitiveness in a market that teal group co forecasts to expand to 11 6 billion in 2023 from 5 2 billion last year at the same time human rights groups and some u s politicians have been increasingly critical of drone strikes for killing civilians israeli drone makers including elbit systems ltd and israel aviation industries ltd or iai had big displays at the singapore airshow iai

asia is a growing market for iai said sharly ben chetrit its executive vice president of marketing he said israel also has its own restrictions on exports i can assure you that we are adhering to the most strict licensing policy in israel i don t think we have it easier he said china s state owned companies have developed dozens of drones including the wing loong or pterodactyl which bears a striking resemblance to the predator a scale model was on display at the airshow s chinese booth where a salesman said it could carry two air to ground missiles weighing a combined 100 kilograms it not only has strike capability but can be used for reconnaissance america also has this type of uav he said he declined to give his name or say how much it cost staff said no officials were available to be interviewed china s rapidly maturing drone capabilities alarm experts china is positioning itself so that any country on the planet that for political or financial reasons is restricted from
