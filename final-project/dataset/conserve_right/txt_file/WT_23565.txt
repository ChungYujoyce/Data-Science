amount of coverage on robert mueller s investigation of president trump a study released monday found that the three networks produced more than 38 hours of russia collusion coverage and 92 percent of it was negative in tone and content abc cbs and nbc evening newscasts produced a combined 2 284 minutes of collusion coverage most of it 1 909 minutes following mueller s appointment on may 17 2017 that s an average of roughly three minutes a night every night for an astonishing 791 days a level of coverage normally associated only with a major war or a presidential election writes rich noyes senior editor of newsbusters org a conservative press watchdog the networks fixation on scandal over substance is one reason their coverage of the president has been so preposterously lopsided from january 1 through march 21 of this year the spin of trump coverage on the evening newscasts has been 92 percent negative vs just eight percent positive even worse than the 90 percent negative coverage we calculated in 2017 and 2018 mr noyes said referring to two previous studies the organization conducted as much as any of their hyperbolic spin the massive onslaught of coverage during the past two years starkly reveals the media s mindset now that the investigation they relentlessly touted has ended with an outcome favorable to the president they despise it does seem a good time for a reckoning
