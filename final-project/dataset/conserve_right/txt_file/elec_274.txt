campaign on thursday calling the man who wishes to succeed him as the gop s presidential nominee a phony and a fraud who is playing americans for suckers the 2016 front runner fired back calling romney a failed candidate who begged him for his endorsement when he ran four years ago trump indeed endorsed romney in the 2012 race romney though delivered a scathing speech at the university of utah about the prospect of a trump presidency in what amounted to perhaps the most full throated effort yet by a member of the so called republican establishment to thwart trump s march to the nomination as one businessman to another romney even mocked trump s record of building companies rattling off some of his lesser known ventures like trump mortgage and saying he d be bad for american workers a business genius he is not he said more broadly romney called this a time for choosing the party s 2012 presidential nominee issued a stark warning that trump s policies would lead to recession and make america and the world less safe and said the only serious policy proposals are coming from the other republican candidates on the field i understand the anger americans feel today romney said but added here apos s what i know donald trump is a phony a fraud his promises are as worthless as a degree from trump university he apos s playing the american public for suckers he gets a free ride to the white house and all we get is a lousy hat romney also claimed trump if nominated would enable hillary clinton to be elected president the speech comes ahead of the fox news republican primary debate thursday night at 9 p m et in detroit the candidates apos first showdown since super tuesday trump swiftly responded to the ex gop nominee taking to twitter to claim he s the only one who can beat hillary clinton and recalling romney s record in the presidential elections so far i am not a mitt romney who doesn apos t know how to win trump tweeted he added failed candidate mitt romney who ran one of the worst races in presidential history is working with the establishment to bury a big r win and speaking on msnbc trump once again would not rule out mounting an independent bid trump spokeswoman katrina pierson also countered romney s criticism of her candidate s business record pointing to romney s substantially smaller reported net worth mitt romney has no right to say donald trump has failed in business she told fox business network she predicted the american people will rally to trump and said this is the establishment circling the wagons the address thursday amounted to an astonishing full court press by romney to stop trump from winning the party s nomination until now romney has mostly criticized trump via twitter and media interviews but this is his most robust effort yet to rally the party and primary voters against the gop front runner romney cast his alarm bell warnings thursday in dire terms suggesting nothing less than the character of the nation is at stake and saying trump s brand of anger has led other nations into the abyss he said trump lacks the temperament to be president rebuking him for bullying and greed and misogyny he borrowed a phrase from marco rubio calling trump a con man to boot on the sidelines the party s 2008 nominee also seemed to join with romney in expressing concerns i share the concerns about donald trump that my friend and former republican nominee mitt romney described in his speech today sen john mccain r ariz said in a statement urging voters to think long and hard about who they want to be our next commander in chief and leader of the free world 2016 candidate ohio gov john kasich also gave romney a twitter thumbs up tweeting well said after the speech romney has not yet endorsed a candidate in the race or moved any closer publicly to reconsidering a run himself romney weighed another white house run at the beginning of 2015 before deciding against the move reportedly after being out raised by former florida gov jeb bush who has since suspended his campaign despite his decision not to run there has been widespread media speculation that he could be tempted back into the race in the case of a contested republican convention as a last gasp way to derail trump the speech comes after trump racked up a string of super tuesday wins building a wide though not insurmountable delegate lead over closest rivals ted cruz and marco rubio the former massachusetts governor has become increasingly vocal in his opposition to the business mogul last week romney told fox news neil cavuto that he believes there may be a bombshell in trump s tax returns and called for trump to release his returns as soon as possible he reiterated that call on thursday he later criticized trump for not immediately disavowing the support of former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke although trump did later disavow duke romney called his response disqualifying and disgusting trump responded to romney with barbs of his own calling him one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of republican politics get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news
