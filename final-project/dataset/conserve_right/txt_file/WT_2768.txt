apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic house democrats and the trump administration are squaring off in federal court over the impeachment probe testing the bounds of congressional oversight and executive privilege in a pair of cases that could reshape the balance of power between each end of pennsylvania avenue in the first round panels of mostly republican appointed judges last week expressed skepticism of arguments made by president trump s justice department that the courts should stay on the sidelines because the house already impeached the president the house judiciary committee filed the two lawsuits to compel testimony from former white house counsel don mcgahn and to gain access to secret grand jury material from former special counsel robert mueller s russian collusion probe top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey losses for the trump administration in the cases could limit his effort to keep his current and former advisers from talking to democrats as they mull more articles of impeachment the two sides faced off in back to back hearings before the d c circuit court of appeals each three judge panel was comprised of two judges appointed by republican presidents including mr trump however that did not seem to help the justice department lawyers who were peppered with aggressive questions in the first case justice department attorney hashim moopan urged the appellate court to stay out of the impeachment fight asking it to stay on the sidelines in the mcgahn dispute he said the court should not insert itself into the dispute between the executive and legislative branches this court should not be referring whether the president is acting totally unusual or congress is acting totally unusual he told the three judge panel mr moopan said if the courts weigh in on whether mr mcgahn should testify it risks politicizing itself and undermining the public confidence the house judiciary committee last year subpoenaed mr mcgahn saying it wanted to hear about mr trump s attempt to fire mr mueller committee democrats say the attempted removal of mr mueller could amount to obstruction of justice necessitating additional articles of impeachment mr trump pressured mr mcgahn to fire the special counsel over alleged conflicts of interest according to the mueller report mr mcghan refused to lower the ax and nearly resigned in protest mr mcgahn left the administration in 2018 more than a year after he was pushed to fire the special counsel the administration has ordered current and former officials not to comply with congressional subpoenas for testimony and documents mr mcgahn has complied bucking the subpoena the judges republican appointee thomas griffith and democrat appointee judith rogers peppered mr moopan with questions about why the courts should be sidelined mr moopan said democrats could pass a statute to enforce the subpoena as part of the give and take in the political process it takes two said judge rogers drawing laughter from the courtroom we re at the point now where there is no cooperation megan barbero an attorney for the judiciary committee democrats said the court must rule because staying out of the fight would give the executive branch too much power ms barbero also said the committee needs mr mcgahn s testimony for additional investigations into mr trump she said congress has remained in the fight for the mcgahn testimony because of impeachment democrats have repeatedly said the bid to fire mr mueller amounted to obstruction of justice if this material reveals new evidence supporting the conclusion that president trump committed impeachable offenses that are not covered by the articles adopted by the house the committee will proceed accordingly including if necessary by considering whether to recommend new articles of impeachment ms barbero said judge griffith questioned why congress needed to hear from mr mcgahn as impeachment is about the president s dealings with ukraine and did not arise from the mueller investigation mcghan was long gone by then judge griffith said of mr trump s controversial july 25 phone call with the ukrainian president that is at the center of the impeachment fight although one of the two articles of impeachment passed by the house last month was for obstruction of congress mr trump has not been impeached on obstruction of justice charges historically the federal courts try to stay away from disputes between congress and the executive branch and the justice department said it would be inappropriate for the court to weigh in on the case because of the impeachment saga in november a federal judge on a different court ordered mr mcgahn to testify declaring in a 118 page opinion that presidents are not kings and no one is above the law the doubleheader restarted friday as two of the judges from the mcgahn case with a new judge heard arguments over house democrats bid to obtain mr mueller s grand jury materials the new judge was neomi rao who is a trump appointee she replaced karen lecraft henderson an appointee of president george w bush house lawyer douglas letter emphasized the need for the court to decide the dispute because it avoids further conflict between co equal branches of government mr letter said absent a court decision the fight over mueller grand jury material could turn into a gunbattle between the house sergeant at arms and attorney general william barr judge rao argued the court has never released grand jury material to congress but mr letter responded the committee has a history of protecting grand jury information he said the committee has yet to publicly release the watergate road map which was the grand jury material turned over to congress during the nixon administration mark freeman a justice department lawyer said democrats need to meet a higher threshold to demonstrate a need for the materials it does not follow that what they say they need they get he told the court based on questions posed by the judges the court might consider sending that case back to a lower court for more analysis specifying the exact material sought by lawmakers and
