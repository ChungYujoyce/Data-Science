apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a significant study of american news coverage reveals what many people already suspect journalism has jettisoned the use of public language references to authority and event based reporting in favor of personal perspective narration and subjectivity so says the rand corporation which tracked almost three decades of news coverage produced by a wide ranging group of 15 different news organizations u s based journalism has gradually shifted away from objective news and offers more opinion based content that appeals to emotion and relies heavily on argumentation and advocacy the report said in a unique analysis on news discourse and presentation researchers found that the changes occurred over a 28 year period 1989 to 2017 as journalism expanded

different news platforms the study noted top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus

the report part of an ongoing series titled truth decay that tracks the declining role of facts and analysis in civil discourse and its effect on american life news consumers can now see how the news has changed over the years and keep that in mind when making choices about which media outlets to rely on for news ms kavanagh advised among the findings broadcasters once relied on complex and academic language then shifted to less pre planned coverage cable news dedicated more time to opinion coverage and argumentative language the study found newspapers have changed the least over time with content slightly shifting from a more academic style to one that is more narrative as for digital journalism the report found that online content is more personal and direct narrating key social and policy issues through personal points of view and subjective references the research said unexpected cnbc headline opposites attract even steve bannon and tom friedman agree trump is right to

that several large u s cities have banned the sale of fur apparel in the name of animal rights the thought occurred to me that i could support a ban on killing small furry animals if they also banned

of attending a four year private institution in the u s hit 48 510 last year more than double what it was less than two decades ago reports michael b sauter an analyst with wallstreet 24 7 a news site in 1971 a four year education at a private college in the united states cost less than one tenth what it does today even after adjusting for inflation a year of private college costs more than two and a half times what it did back then this means college prices are disproportionately high for potential undergraduates at a wide array of institutions and not just at the most expensive college in each state the analyst writes as an exercise in history or possibly a reality check mr sauter pored over data from the college board a nonprofit associated with american postsecondary institutions to determine average costs of attending four year public and private colleges each year since 1971 including tuition fees and room and board here is a sampling of what he found across the decades in 1971
