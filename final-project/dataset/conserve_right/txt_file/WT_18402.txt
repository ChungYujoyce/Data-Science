on should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hong kong hong kong leaders said they would remove demonstrators from the city s main streets monday as divisions appeared among pro democracy activists who have nearly shut down the financial district in nine days of protest against china s communist government chief executive leung chun ying the city s top official who has refused protesters demands to resign warned in a televised address about use of force to deal with the demonstrators there are many problems to be resolved in society but the right way is through rational communication not fighting in the streets mr leung said we will take all necessary actions to restore social order so that government staff can resume work monday morning and provide services to the public see also hong kong becomes a fresh foreign policy puzzle for obama some groups of protesters near the main government district agreed to abandon the area and dismantle barricades sunday while others refused to leave the area the government said it would do whatever is necessary to ensure 3 000 civil servants would have full access to their offices monday meanwhile some student protest leaders agreed to talks with hong kong s leadership about political reforms as to whether the government will keep its word we will just have to see said the hong kong federation of students the umbrella group leading the protest in the meantime all we can do is preliminary preparations see also beijing should let hong kong be hong kong but the federation vowed to continue protests until details of the talks are worked out if the government uses force to clear away protesters there will be no room for dialogue lester shum one of the group s leaders told reporters demonstrations over the weekend swelled to massive levels with tens of thousands shouting democracy now some protesters said that despite the leadership s threat and prospect of negotiations they would not go home until the chief executive resigned and the city was granted free elections everyone is hoping for a change said chan yat lok cola a student at hong kong university of science and technology who has been protesting for days the society belongs to the people we don t need a government which ignores our voices the demonstrators partial withdrawal appeared to be part of a strategy to regroup in another part of town protesters were urged to shift to hong kong s admiralty shopping and business district a central location near the government s main offices that has served as informal headquarters for the protesters the associated press reported alex chow another student leader said he was not worried about the crowd dwindling as people prepared to return to work and school monday because people need rest but they will come out again it doesn t mean the movement is diminishing many people still support it mr chow said analysts said the situation is quickly reaching an impasse china is watching the situation warily and calling the demonstrations illegal but has not intervened hong kong s leadership which cracked down on the protesters with tear gas and batons late last month is worried that further violence would inflame tensions and bring more people into the streets in sympathy at the moment there is not a clear leader of the protesters who can negotiate a compromise with the hong kong leadership so it is difficult to hold any kind of negotiation to solve this situation said nadine godehardt an asian affairs analyst at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin this needs to happen at some point also the goal asking the chief executive to step down is more an emotional demand than a realistic one ms godehardt said it does not make sense because if he steps down someone else comes in but the system does not change the situation remained volatile across the harbor in hong kong s mong kok district a shopping area where ugly confrontations erupted friday and saturday after opponents of the protesters tried to force them out ap reported many demonstrators heeded calls to head home or shift to the admiralty area a few hundred however appeared determined to stay in mong kok late sunday police officers carrying guns patrolled the area and at least one officer was seen carrying tear gas canisters protests began late last month when students boycotted classes to demand free elections in 2017 as china promised when it took over the british colony in 1997 beijing granted hong kong certain civil liberties via a mini constitution and elections for its top post but in proposed guidelines for the vote published in late august china s leadership granted the one man one vote rule but rejected an open nomination process for candidates for the city s leadership post of chief executive china wants to limit the number of candidates and make sure those selected are vetted by a committee the way it currently is done by pro beijing elites essentially leaving the top post under the control of the mainland communist party that is not acceptable to those on the streets in this umbrella revolution named for the protesters use of umbrellas to deflect pepper spray used by police it is unclear how long the protests will continue with divisions appearing among groups supporters of the government hit the streets for the first time over the weekend wearing blue ribbons and chanting support our police skirmishes erupted but they were broken up by police and sometimes the protesters themselves about a dozen people were injured and 19 arrested over the weekend police officials said some said they were tired of the disruption and believe the skirmishes and divisions put the city in a negative light but they were adamant about staying on the streets i don t support occupying central at all said protester johnson poon however i support the movement on the whole because i don t want to enjoy the fruits of possible success without doing anything for that this article is based in
