200 midterm elections ballots we need to create the kind of confidence in america that makes it so that everybody goes back to work said kevin hassett a white house adviser and former chair of the council of economic advisers and that confidence is going to require testing and confidence that your workplace is a healthy place but also confidence in the economy at the white house officials believe they ve entered a new chapter of the pandemic response moving from crisis mode to sustained mitigation and management it began last thursday with the release of guidelines to governors for how to safely reopen their states trump and vice president mike pence celebrated americans for successfully flattening the curve of the epidemic a day later a phalanx of the administration s top medical

verge of passing an almost 500 billion relief bill to bolster small businesses trump flatly promised americans that there will no repeat of the national lockdown we will not go through what we went through for the last two months he said it s a sharp shift in rhetoric after trump and allies stressed the threat of an invisible enemy to persuade people to abide by social distancing recommendations the american people have also been scarred by the daunting death toll and images of body bags piled up in refrigerated trailers moving from fear to acceptance will take confidence in government medical professionals and businesses at a time when faith in those institutions is low white house aides say restoring confidence will require the same whole of america approach that slowed the virus spread it s one thing for government to say ok it s safe to go out new york gov andrew cuomo a democrat said tuesday if people don t believe it s safe they re not going to go while there have been isolated protests in states aimed at lifting aggressive stay at home measures most americans don t believe it will be safe to ease the restrictions anytime soon according to a new survey from the associated press norc center for public affairs research trump predicted earlier this month that the economy would take off like a rocket ship once we get back to business but experts say the recovery will be far slower it ll be a very gradual process regardless of what a governor says or the president says said dr robert blendon a harvard professor of health policy and political analysis he said the history of lockdowns particularly the quarantine of more than 25 000 people around toronto in 2003 to slow the spread of sars shows that it will take weeks even months for people to develop the confidence to resume normal activity blendon also warned that a predicted second wave of covid 19 could reverse any gains made in the interim it s not just government but individual businesses that will need to convince employees and consumers that it s safe to return once they decide to reopen the white house expects businesses will advertise to the public about the safety measures they are putting in place when they reopen said larry kudlow the director of the national economic council he said the white house is also considering asking congress to provide liability protection for employers in case their workers or customers fall sick we want small businesses to have some confidence that if they do reopen they ll stay open kudlow said the outbreak has infected over 2 5 million people and killed about 180 000 around the world including more than 46 000 in the u s according to a tally compiled by johns hopkins university from official government figures though the true numbers are believed to be far higher mark schlesinger a yale professor of health policy said it s going to take time for people to re equilibrate emotionally and it s very hard to predict how long even if people worried about their economic situation want to get back to work there may be permanent behavioral changes in how people do business and interact as a society at the white house the administration is adjusting its posture away from drastic containment measures to managing virus flareups and bottlenecks in testing or supplies and officials hope to use the daily white house briefings to inundate americans with facts and figures on testing and therapeutics blanketing television with graphics of flattening and declining curves and statistics on the number of testing kits available white house officials also are planning to step up travel in coming weeks as a visual representation of reopening pence has traveled to colorado and wisconsin in recent days and trump is pushing aides to get him back on the road there are still plenty of caution flags there s a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through centers for disease control and prevention director robert redfield told the washington post in an interview tuesday we re going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time we ve got to be very careful trump said tuesday of a potential second wave which in some predictions could hit just weeks before the november elections we don t want that to happen it could happen i think we stamp it out if it does happen instead white house aides hope that people accept a new normal that envisions short term disruptions when there are covid 19 cases causing routine week long school or office closures but not panic but blendon said people will watch the cases and listen to the major public health leaders and if there s a conflict that
