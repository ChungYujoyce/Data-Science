national review the league of morons a key coronavirus question do we want god beauty in babette s feast john wayne the hero we need now why museums should reopen now a strongly worded heterodox view i ve found that if you ask a sensible priest or nun these days what habit might help for prayer and sanity during quarantine they tend to say the liturgy of the hours the liturgy of the hours is known as the prayer of the church you wake up and you pray you stop at midday and you pray in the evening you pray and before you go to sleep too when you pray night prayer or compline you really take a look at your day and ask god to forgive you where you need forgiveness you can even stop mid morning and mid afternoon if you choose you live your life guided by prayer it all serves as many beautiful things including a reminder that there s something more than what we can see including andrew cuomo s and donald trump s next press conference there is something greater something beyond even the question of when you can stop sheltering in place or of when you and your husband wind up with jobs again maybe the busier you are with homeschooling suddenly and somewhat permanently the more important it is that you find something that isn t simply a numbing agent to be a stable part of your life i mention all this because never in my life have i found praying the liturgy of the hours more important i ve been praying it for the better part of a decade now at least and while i always find it powerful maybe i ve never felt so obviously and consistently challenged there are times in recent days when i want to push back a little but you really can t for too long because the longer you pray the longer you realize that you really do believe this the most penetrating to the depths of the soul part of the liturgy of the hours tends to be the psalms and if you read the book of psalms at all you realize that they hit on just about every human emotion and i can t be the only person experiencing just about every human emotion these days the greatest gift the prayer of the church has been over this past week especially is its encouragement with hope easter is really an octave so every day of the week after easter sunday is another easter they are solemnities time for joyous celebration now joyous celebration takes a different tone these days and yet what a need we have for it to make a commitment to the liturgy of the hours is to make a commitment to hope each day these days it makes you sing alleluia even if you are not feeling it and if you are not feeling it it is all the more important to sing it there were definitely days during the week after easter when i did not want to even think about it again that s probably when it s most important my stubbornness in quarantine is consistent with a trend i ve been watching in my own praying of the liturgy of the hours and in living in the liturgical life of the church in recent years almost every good friday i don t want to leave good friday i don t want to move past this central reality of the christian faith that jesus died for love of us that s a life changing reality but then so is the whole story that he was born for us and that he rose from the dead if you are christian these are tenets of faith that can t ever be a sideshow these are our identity this is who our god is and this is who we are in him but every year i feel like those 40 days of lent are not quite enough i get to good friday and realize that there have been distractions i get to good friday and i want to spend the rest of my life doing penance for all the thoughtless things i ve done all the sins that made clear it wasn t a crowd two millennia ago that crucified christ it was me that s devastating when you think about it too long which is why the church in her wisdom as we say does not keep us there forever yes we should be reflecting on jesus s death daily but the story in its wholeness is crucial so the priests and nuns i ve surveyed are right i ll testify to it if you are looking for a way to pray to help with your faith and hope and love and joy and peace and even sanity the liturgy of the hours is a help maybe commit to morning and evening prayer or go to magnificat com which has a shorter adaptation of both one of the opportunities we have during this time is to take advantage of things that are being made available for free in some cases and so much is online think of all the masses and other prayer services being livestreamed if you ve been curious and want something to help with hope take a look at magnificat com or divine office or ibreviary reliable aids in my life for a long while now if you re feeling a little uneasy know you are not alone and consider believing that none of us are we will need this habit and vision going forward this column is based on one available throughandrews mcmeel universal s newspaper enterprise association jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup
