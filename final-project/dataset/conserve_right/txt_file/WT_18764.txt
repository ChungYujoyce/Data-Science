ed for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion creating facts on the ground means changing reality through actions rather than diplomacy china s rulers have gone further over the last 18 months they have been creating ground over 2 000 new acres of islands more than 600 miles from china s coast many built atop rocks and reefs claimed by their neighbors including the philippines an important american ally in recent days the chinese have been installing landing strips helipads harbors radar installations artillery pieces and other weapons what makes this real estate so valuable location location location the south china sea is home to some of the world s busiest and most strategic shipping lanes a rich fishing area and possibly large undersea oil and natural gas reserves china apparently intends to assert its sovereignty and control over all this and maybe over the airspace above as well just last week a u s navy surveillance plane flying above the areas was told by the chinese navy to please go away to avoid misunderstanding the pilot did not comply china s neighbors are looking to the obama administration for help addressing asian leaders attending a meeting in singapore last weekend defense secretary ashton carter called for an immediate and lasting halt to china s activities he added that the chinese were out of step with international norms a perhaps unfortunate reminder of secretary of state john kerry s reproach to russia s vladimir putin last year for behaving in 19th century fashion mr carter also repeated what has become a favorite obama administration shibboleth we all know there is no military solution top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century actually it s not clear that the chinese know that last week on cctv a chinese government television station commentator han bin said conflict was inevitable unless the united states backs down regarding china s artificial archipelago my instant analysis the chinese believe they can win without fighting to quote the ancient chinese military strategist sun tzu they figure that a diplomatic solution will require at most giving war weary americans a face saving way to back down at the end of the day the obama administration will call whatever the chinese agree to do or not do a good deal and of course the only alternative to war any similarity between this scenario and the pattern followed during the long drawn out negotiations with iran is not purely coincidental america s enemies and adversaries have been learning from that process just as iran earlier went to school on washington s failed negotiations with the despots who run north korea and who now possess nuclear weapons and are developing increasingly sophisticated missiles to deliver them to tantalizing targets one might argue that at this fraught moment the biggest fish we have to fry are not in the south china sea for president obama to make that argument however would be difficult given his much vaunted pivot to asia back in 2011 skeptics saw that as a way for him to turn his back on the middle east but most foreign policy analysts gave the administration the benefit of the doubt scholar kenneth lieberthal of the liberal brookings institution said the white house was sending a message that the united states intended to play a leadership role in asia for decades to come to fulfill that promise mr lieberthal emphasized the president would need to establish a strong and credible american presence across asia to both encourage constructive chinese behavior and to provide confidence to other countries in the region that they need not yield to potential chinese regional hegemony so far at least mission not accomplished once again precedents will be set iran s rulers have long claimed that the strait of hormuz the strategic passage from the persian gulf to open ocean through which flows more than a third of the petroleum traded by sea is not an international waterway but rather their territorial waters in recent weeks they ve been harassing international shipping in the strait to drive home the point among the reasons they re backing houthi rebels in yemen i believe is their desire also to control the bab el mandeb the chokepoint for the red sea which leads north to egypt s suez canal a grip on both the persian gulf and the red sea would give iran enormous power over much of the middle east and considerable leverage over europe the u s navy has the muscle to enforce international maritime law the question is whether u s political leaders have the will confidence has not been bolstered by plans to reduce america s military budget by more than 1 trillion over the decade ahead china s military though currently no match for that of the u s is likely to receive annual double digit budget increases over the years ahead in 2010 at a regional meeting in hanoi then secretary of state hillary rodham clinton affirmed america s commitment to freedom of the seas the united states she added believes all maritime claims must be supported by claims to land features china s new waterfront properties meet that criterion in a most audacious fashion which reminds me in his second book the audacity of hope mr obama mused i wonder sometimes whether men and women in fact are capable of learning from history his administration has more than six years of history to learn from and less than two years left to act upon that knowledge in asia the middle east and other regions where america s credibility is now seriously open to question clifford d may is president of the foundation for defense of democracies and a columnist for the washing
