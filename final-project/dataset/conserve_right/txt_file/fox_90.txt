fox news sunday guest host i m bill hemmer in for chris wallace another major staff shake up the president s key strategies leaving the white house begin videotape donald trump president of the united states i like mr bannon he aposs a friend of mine but mr bannon came on very late you know that hemmer we ll break down what aposs next for the trump administration with his former trump deputy campaign manager david bossie then terror hitting an american ally yet again at least 13 dead including one american in barcelona rex tillerson secretary of state terrorists around the world should know that united states and our allies are resolved to find you and bring you to justice hemmer we ll discuss how the u s is fighting the war on terror with senator ben cardin the top democrat on the foreign relations committee plus as steve bannon joins the list of ousted white house staffers we will ask our sunday panel how the shake up will affect the president aposs agenda and those who put him in the white house all right now on fox news sunday end videotape hemmer and hello from fox news in washington the president parting ways with his top strategist steve bannon after the week that saw the president get harsh criticism from both sides after the violence in charlottesville so where does the white house go from here with me now former trump deputy campaign manager david bossie and david welcome to fox news sunday bossie thanks for having me hemmer first appearance as a guest what took you so long david bossie former trump deputy campaign manager the invitation lost in the mail hemmer well listen it s my first time too so thank you for being here today how big of a loss is this for president trump bossie well the president is his own agenda setter he has been his own strategist for many many years and he lets everybody know that don apost get me wrong steve bannon was an integral part of the white house but this president understands how he got elected he is the one who formulated really the agenda and the issues that we really ran on and steve and i steve called me in august of last year when he took over the campaign and i came and joined the campaign in late august so again i was somebody who came in late but we help the president it was the president aposs ideas it has always been the president aposs agenda 100 percent for years and years he aposs been talking about these issues hemmer ok just the other day the president said this about steve bannon begin video clip trump i like mr bannon he aposs a friend of mine but mr bannon came on very late you know that i went through 17 senators governors and i won all the primaries mr bannon came on much later than that and i like him he aposs a good man end video clip hemmer that was that was tuesday what changed bossie i don apost think anything has changed i think every staff member serves at the pleasure of the president there are different chapters in every presidency and staff changes do occur i do believe that steve bannon is going to be a very loyal soldier to the president as it relates to his agenda from the outside now he is going to be hemmer you do you do believe that bossie i ve talked to steve many times he s going to be a very important voice for the president as it relates to leaning into congress specifically in trying to really get the failure of leadership in the house and in the senate to stand up and really take a hold of the president aposs agenda which is really if we re looking at seven months on into this administration one of the biggest challenges the president s had they wanted it all to be leaning on the president when in fact it aposs a failure of leadership in the house and senate hemmer let me get to that relationship in a moment but who wanted bannon out bossie well look you know there are a host and there has been and we aposve all read about and seen about the different factions within the white house staff there always is in every presidency there are factions there aposs no difference here and so this is not it s the one thing that i ve learned from steve in the last couple days is in his opinion for the future this is not personal to him this is about the president aposs agenda and the president succeeding on that winning agenda that got him elected last november hemmer the reason i ask is that there are reports it s been said secretary kelly the new chief of staff wanted people that only fit into the category that wanted to support president trump did steve bannon fit in that category bossie well i 100 percent i don apost believe for a minute that steve bannon has gone against the president aposs agenda in any way shape or form hemmer so anyone who would anyone who would suggest that he was working for himself as opposed to president would wrong bossie general kelly obviously the new chief of staff coming in has broad authority to make changes as he sees fit and he aposs going to continue to do that he wants to have and run a shop that he creates this is something that the reason that steve offered his resignation was to give that to give the general an opportunity to have a clean slate i think much like much like reince priebus and sean spicer before him hemmer ok there is an interview late friday night that steve bannon did with the weekly standard in part he said the following the trump presidency that we fought for and won is over we still have a huge movement and we will make something of this trump presidency but that presidency is over what does he mean bossie i specifically believe that he means that congress has failed what i was mentioning before that mitch mcconnell and paul ryan have to step up have to give us meaningful tax reform have to get repeal and replace of obamacare done a host of legislative you know accomplishments that the president ran on and won on and as a matter of fact the reason that paul ryan and mitch mcconnell are the leaders are because of the issues that president trump won on so crosstalk hemmer ok with regard to that now bannon said the following also in that interview the republican establishment has no interest in trump success on this they re not populists they re not nationalist they have no interest in this program zero you agree with that bossie i agree that the house and senate leadership has not bought into the president aposs agenda fully and i think the record of the last seven months bears that out we need to have house and senate leaders come to the white house and work with the president on his agenda tax reform let aposs just talk about the economy for a moment our economy is ready to roll the president has added 1 million new jobs no one else the president with hope growth and opportunity an agenda and a belief that every american can have an opportunity in their future and their children aposs future that we have the lowest unemployment rate 4 3 percent in over 16 years the stock markets the dow is at an all time high if we can get meaningful tax reform and tax relief for the american people this economy is going to be growing at 2 percent 3 percent 4 percent very shortly last quarter it was a 2 6 percent that in the president aposs doing that aposs the president bringing jobs home getting corporations to want to hire again stability getting rid of these ridiculous over burdensome regulatory issues that the obama administration just burdened business with hemmer and republicans in congress may suggest that the white house has not given the leadership that s necessary to push those issues over bossie sure hemmer the finish line what bannon argued in piece is that the effort on obamacare was half hearted what is the responsibility of the white house to lead on these issues bossie you know no one is saying the president is not leading i think that there aposs a lack of leadership on one side of pennsylvania avenue and so look we want everybody to work together i do i want i want the house and the senate and the white house to work together to get these issues on the table and legislative accomplishments through the house and senate that the president can be proud of and sign hemmer he also referred to west wing democrats and as you sit here today there are supporters all across the country maybe they are in pennsylvania ohio michigan wisconsin and they stood in long lines and they turned blue counties to red in support of donald trump how much assurance can you give them today that what they worked for will not be thrown away bossie well that aposs easy the president of the united states is 100 percent committed to the agenda that he ran on and won on the agenda of better education better jobs better job opportunities and repeal and replace obamacare to give the american people that hope growth and opportunity that he promised during the campaign that we have to get done over the next year hemmer remember candidate trump said he was going to come to washington d c and he said he was going to drain the swamp did the swamp did the swamp win this week david bossie no no no no he look the president is fully committed to draining the swamp he is in the throes of that fight right now but the swamp as you drain the water those creatures come out and that is really what this is about the president is fighting every day that broken status quo on both sides of the aisle the broken status quo that has got us a 20 trillion debt that we re going to have to increase the debt ceiling again next month this is this is something where we need to have meaningful reforms that the president ran on and won on and i m fully committed to helping them get there hemmer thank you for being here today david bossie thank you for your time and more to come in a moment here we ll bring in our sunday group on how steve bannon aposs departure will affect the president s relationship with his base that s next commercial break begin video clip steve bannon former white house chief strategist if you think you aposre getting your country back without a fight you are sadly mistaken every day every day it is going to be a fight donald trump president of the united states he is not a racist i can tell you that he aposs a good person he actually gets a very unfair press in that regard but we ll see what happens with mr bannon but he aposs a good person and i think the press treats him frankly very unfairly end video clip hemmer so first there s steve bannon addressing cpac february this past year and then president trump on tuesday defending steve bannon but stopping short of offering full confidence here in washington it is time now for our sunday group charles hurt opinion editor for the washington times juan williams columnist for the hill bob woodward from the washington post and former national security council staffer gillian turner good sunday to all of your and thank you for being here today the president tweeted this yesterday on steve bannon i want to thank steve bannon he writes for his service he came to the campaign during my run against crooked hillary clinton it was great thanks s bob woodward take us inside the west wing how does it change now without bannon bob woodward associate editor the washington post well remember bannon was the chief strategist and as the chief strategist he failed because there was no strategy a strategy is you have to not just be a word person you have to be somebody who comes out and says ok we re going from here to here it aposs going to take time and this is the plan and that aposs not the way bannon thought somebody who would make some very loud declarations to serve this purpose it aposs very interesting and important general kelly as a former four star is a strategic thinker you have to be that in the military and you have to have a plan now whether it aposs going to work we ll see but that aposs the idea hemmer ok now charlie there has been a lot of reaction steve king republican from iowa conservative side said the following at the wall street journal who is going to defend the conservative republican agenda he said we are seeing democrats and leftist team up with the never trumpers it denies the will of the people it undermines the republic if election results are not honored is he right charlie hurt opinion editor the washington times i think that i think he absolutely is right and i think that there aposs a real concern across the country about just that but you know in terms of steve bannon leaving you know and i think bob is exactly right in a lot of ways you know bannon is a disruptor he aposs not an insider he aposs an outsider he aposs very good charging the gates from the outside and i think he will return to doing just that and that aposs why he was very valuable to donald trump in the election i think he certainly helped get donald trump elected that aposs not to say that he is somehow trumps brain or anything like that donald trump and steve bannon arrived you know in agreement on so many of these issues independent of one another but they both believe them and i think that in that respect the trump agenda is in good hands the question is will republicans on capitol hill defend the conservative values hemmer so just back to the main pointer to his base did they lose this week hurt no i don apost think that they did i think that because trump is still in the white house trump still believes everything that he believed when he ran in the campaign we have seen him hold fast on things like the environment illegal immigration international trade he has not wavered on any of those things so no i don apost think that they lost i think that if anything they may have gained a very loud powerful voice on the outside who is now unrestrained from you know white house considerations hemmer you wonder if he was ever restrained steve bannon would argue that no one is going to restrain him i thought it was interesting to hear newt gingrich with me on a friday morning in a bigger picture a bigger sense for this white house when he said this about president trump begin video clip newt gingrich former house speaker he aposs in a position right now where he is much more isolated than he realizes on the hill he has far more people willing to sit to one side and not help him right now that he needs to think about what has not worked and you don t get down to 35 percent range of approval and have people in your own party shooting at you and conclude that everything is going fine end video clip hemmer well newt gingrich came on our program to deliver a message juan was that message received juan williams fox news political analyst i don apost know i think that newt is pretty close to the president i think the president coming on fox i think the president might be watching but this is an important message because there are people who are enablers if you will bill for the president who tell him everything is going ok you are still president trump you still have the energy you still have the agenda but if you look at things like trade if you look at immigration if you look even bannon wanted said you know we should have higher taxes on the rich that aposs not in keeping with so much of the agenda that s in the white house and it certainly hasn apost been satisfied in terms of any legislative accomplishment on the part of this white house and that aposs why newt says you re isolated on the hill you aposre fighting the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell you aposre having fights with jeff flake you have bob corker the senator from tennessee who has been a royal trump supporter coming out and say this president not doesn apost look stable doesn t look like he has the competence necessary going into the fall going into fights over the size of the debt limit on the budget these are troubling signs inside the republican party for president trump at this juncture hemmer there are very interesting pieces already out today about that very topic gillian how do you think this goes from here gillian turner former white house national security council well i think speaker gingrich sort of hit the nail on the head this week when he told you that if the president wants this kind of stability for his administration that juan is talking about meaning he aposs not hemorrhaging key advisors every week what he needs to do is institute some message discipline that was the first key thing the other key thing speaker gingrich said to you is that if somehow the president can get the republican congress to rally around him to get in line behind him everything going forward will be smooth sailing you know unicorns and rainbows and things like that but to me what the key thing is is actually right now first getting the white house in line behind the president to get on board with his message and i think with steve bannon out the president really has a shot at that maybe for the first time during his presidency because to me the hallmark the calling card of steve bannon has been sort of this weaponization of leaked information it aposs something that he certainly not the first person to bring to the white house but he was able to bring it in an incredibly destructive way so that people felt that just the threat of leaked information was enough to deter them and stir them off course so if we get rid of that at least for now i think the president has a real shot at reining in the administration hemmer you know bob you think about that i mean you were with president bush during one of the lowest points of his presidency and i m not suggesting this is a low point for donald trump we re going to get to that a bit later but you wrote the book bush s war i mean these were heady times during the iraq war when you listen to newt gingrich and talk about the approval rating whether legitimate or not how do presidents turned it around bob woodward associate editor the washington post well first of all you have to get something that aposs a win as trump frequently talks about at the way you get a win is not executive orders you ve got to do something with congress and you can apost work and get things done if you have a war between trump and the republican leaders somebody has got to heal that breach and if you don apost you re not going to move forward and that aposs where the strategic thinking sorry you aposve got to plan and if they re going to say you know you don apost get everything you want so they re going to have to pick one or two of these things and try to get them and it s going to be a big hemmer which one woodward well hemmer which one do they pick woodward tax reform infrastructure phenomenally popular we ll see but trump is going to have to also restrain himself in these tweets in these statements he needs to be friendly with the republicans hemmer i thought you were about to say presidential you used a different word this time go ahead charlie woodward no no but you need you know this is about human relations as everything hemmer but they re not going to take away the twitter feed charlie hurt opinion editor the washington times no no and i don apost think that that will solve everything either and certainly the president deserves some bit of the blame but listen to juan run through the list of things that people in the hill have said it aposs kind of shocking to sit back and think about it you know talk about you know throwing rocks out of a glass house i mean these are people who for seven years these republicans for seven years campaigned on repealing obamacare and then when they finally got an opportunity to do it it turns out they have no plan they have no ability to do it whatsoever so while they are sitting there criticizing donald trump i think in some cases unfairly my goodness why are they taking care of their own business they ve got a lot of problems up there hemmer well with regard to that steve bannon said this in the washington post yesterday if the republican party on capitol hill gets behind the president on his plans and not there it will be sweetness and light be one big happy family no administration in history has been so divided among itself about the direction about where it should go that is a loaded quote juan juan williams fox news political analyst well i mean that aposs why steve bannon said from his perspective this presidency is over which is a shocking thing to say i mean coming from steve bannon and the idea that bannon now goes on the outside and i think bannon will have a large megaphone i think not only breitbart but i think he is going to have lots of allies in the conservative media who are echoing the idea that we ve got to keep the pressure up on donald trump so right wing talk radio the media i don t know sometimes you look at drudge you think drudge and some people are getting a little antsy about what aposs going on but the key for bannon will be does he join let s say with the mercers a very big philanthropic conservative family in trying to create an ever bigger megaphone to force donald trump to his agenda again hemmer well the other thing speaker gingrich said in the interview is the second book that donald trump wrote was called the art of the comeback and he suggested in that segment that he should reread it that aposs from speaker gingrich who i ve referred to is likely trying to send a message panel hang on in a moment here see you a little later in our broadcast today next though after another deadly terror attack in europe questions about whether this kind of act can be prevented the top democrat in foreign relations senator ben cardin will join us live next commercial break hemmer coming up president trump takes heat for his response to the attack in virginia begin video clip trump i think there aposs blame on both sides and i have no doubt about it and you don apost have any doubt about it either end video clip hemmer we ll ask our sunday panel how he brings a voice of unity to a country looking for it coming up commercial break hemmer that is just a look at the gruesome scene on thursday at the van rather mowed down many in barcelona s most popular district that attack leaving at least 13 dead including one american more than 120 injured are we getting any better at detecting these attacks before they happen with me now the top democrat on the foreign relations committee senator ben cardin senator cardin welcome back here to fox news sunday sen ben cardin d md foreign relations committee bill it aposs good to be with you thank you hemmer i ve got a number of things i want to go through in the next 10 minutes or so let aposs move through these as best we can first on spain it is clear there was a well established network operating around barcelona what can you tell our viewers about your level of confidence about being able to stop these networks before they kill whether it aposs abroad or here at home cardin first our prayers go out to the family of the victims and we you hope those that are injured will make a full recovery what the trump administration needs to do is articulate a strategy that uses all the tools in our military and diplomatic toolbox working with our allies and not just shrink this caliphate of isis and related groups but to stop the exporting of terrorism in europe and beyond i think we need to have an articulated strategy that is well understood that uses all of the means as our intelligence community our military our diplomacy working with our allies so that we can share information what happened in spain looks like it was well coordinated we need to be better at tracking these things down before they occur hemmer reports suggest the cia told authorities in barcelona two months ago to be on the lookout and nothing changed a house blew up on wednesday night and still there was no action taken so what is the level of confidence again whether it aposs in europe or here at home that we re making any progress on this senator cardin well you know when we stop terroristic activities from taking place these are victories that we don t always report about when we are not successful obviously the tragedies that occur we see them on the news clearly something was missed here and we have to find out how that was missed the united states working with our allies need to make sure that we follow up on the information that we have it aposs unacceptable to see the signs that we saw in spain and still the tragedies took place hemmer what is still a developing story and there will be developments throughout the day and the week to come let aposs move to north korea twelve days ago the president got the world aposs attention when he said this begin video clip trump north korea best not make any more threats to the united states they will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen end video clip hemmer and then a week later in fact this past tuesday the north korean regime said it would not take aim at guam the president followed on wednesday with this tweet kim jong un of north korea made a very wise and well reasoned decision the alternative would have been both catastrophic and unacceptable senator did the president win this round cardin no not at all in fact i think he accelerated the point what we want to do is prevent north korea from furthering its nuclear weapons program obviously if they take any aggressive actions against the united states or any of our allies we will respond and protect our allies and our country what we want to do is have a diplomatic solution that will pull back north korea aposs nuclear program if we have seen no sign of that by what the president has done we need the unity of international community what the president did i think jeopardizes our relationship with china in trying to get china to put more pressure on north korea so no i don apost think he advanced our objective hemmer well apparently that diplomacy is underway and more on that in the moment but just back to the question the white house gets no credit for keeping this where it is right now cardin the white house needs to articulate a north korean strategy that we can work with the international community with the objective of ending a nuclear weapons program in north korea that aposs what our objective needs to be hemmer i want to call this comment from steve bannon aposs this past week he said the following there aposs no military solution to north korea aposs nuclear threats forget it until somebody solves the part of the equation that shows me that 10 million people in seoul don apost die in the first 30 minutes from conventional weapons i don apost know what you aposre talking about there aposs no military solution here they got us do we have to accept a nuclear north korea cardin no i don apost think we have to accept a nuclear north korea i do think and i rarely agree with mr bannon i think though his point about the military is absolutely accurate a military solution to north korea will be catastrophic as far as the casualties involved what it means is we have to have a different strategy with china china can turn the screws on north korea to a point where north korea has no choice but to negotiate a change path in regards to their nuclear program it starts with a freeze and then with pullback north korea wants to protect its regime china can provide that type of protection without north korea having a nuclear weapon there are ways for this to move forward admittedly it aposs extremely difficult but it requires us to use diplomacy in a way that strengthens our ties with china hemmer i aposve heard you mention diplomacy several times in 1995 bill clinton tried diplomacy and we also offered north korea 400 million in aid in 2005 president bush traded more aid to try and get a deal we are 22 years later can apost we admit that diplomacy senator has failed cardin well we certainly have not been successful in a north korean strategy that is absolutely factually correct what we do have though is a common agenda with china china does not want a nuclear north korea but china does not want a unified korean peninsula under south korea so what china and north korea have in common is the protection of the current north korean regime we can work with china because our objective is not to eliminate the regime in north korea our objective is to eliminate its nuclear weapons program if we focus on that working with china there is a way forward it is difficult but what are the options where are the other options do we allowed north korea to become a nuclear weapons state with unclear as to how they will use that to go against american values and interest that aposs not acceptable do we use a military solution where literally hundreds of thousands of people could be killed that aposs not a feasible solution so we have to go down the path that gives us the best chance of a positive outcome hemmer ok on afghanistan we may get a decision on this this week we know vice president mike pence h r mcmaster favor putting more troops on the ground in afghanistan you aposve been pushing for fewer troops for about six years now and i wonder if you have more in common with the president on that idea that you thought because he appears to be reluctant there aposs also this idea out there about putting a private security company to keep watch on the terrorists in afghanistan today my question is 16 years down the road 700 billion spent is it time to be open to new ideas cardin well i don apost know if i aposm in agreement with the president because i haven apost heard what the president aposs plan is in afghanistan i haven apost seen an articulated strategy we aposve invested a great deal in afghanistan our objective needs to be that we have a regime in afghanistan that can maintain some semblance of security so that we don apost see growing terrorist organizations again within afghanistan that aposs our objective should we use private contract troops absolutely not there aposs no accountability there that aposs not the purpose for private contractors no we should not do that should we put more military in again this is not the u s fight i don apost believe putting more american soldiers in afghanistan is the answer we really do need to work to fill the void so voids don apost are created are not created so that there aposs opportunity for afghanistan to have a stable central government hemmer let aposs come back here in our country now and talk about this monument debate it hit quite close to your home state of maryland this past week the president asked the following question about it begin video clip trump this week it aposs robert e lee i notice that stonewall jackson aposs coming down i wonder is it george washington next week and is it thomas jefferson the week after you know you open you really do have to ask yourself where does it stop end video clip hemmer your state of maryland removed statues in annapolis and in baltimore in the middle of the night this past week do you think this is the best way to handle history cardin well first of all i think the president aposs gotten this all wrong as to how what we aposre trying to do we aposre not changing history we want to learn from history there aposs no question about that that aposs an important aspect you don apost need a monument to learn history monuments are put up for different purposes some are more modern than others monuments should represent the contemporary needs of our society and i think what baltimore did and what maryland is doing is appropriate but we will not avoid history and we certainly want to learn from history hemmer all right there is a prominent democratic lawmaker in maryland a democrat who leads the state senate he was arguing in a letter to your governor larry hogan this past week that the addition of a statue is the appropriate way to go and he suggested the late justice thurgood marshall and he made the argument the following way a very public and purposeful compromise to give balance to the state house grounds recognizing our state and our country have a flawed history what aposs wrong with that argument when you consider learning about all of our complex american history senator cardin well i want our i want our young people to learn from all parts of our history in maryland we have antietam battlefield which is a place where i hope people will go and visit and learn from it the tragic history of our civil war we have the harriet tubman national park where people can go and learn about the underground railroad we have places in maryland that i think are critically important to learn the good bad and ugly about america aposs history and our path towards our democratic society you don apost need to have a monument that aposs offensive to certain parts of our history being glorified in order to fully appreciate the history of our country hemmer mike miller aposs making the case we need more monuments cardin well you know we have lots of monuments that people rarely visit i think the important point is let aposs find effective ways so people can understand the struggles of america and again i point out the harriet tubman national park hemmer understood cardin it aposs a wonderful place to visit i aposm going to be there later today hemmer all right enjoy your visit there senator really appreciate your time today thank you ben cardin the democrat from maryland cardin thank you hemmer thank you for being there in the moment we aposll bring back our panel to talk about the president after virginia what does he say now did he miss a chance to bring the country together we aposll get to all of that in a moment plus what would you like to talk to the panel about go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we just might use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs including the kkk neo nazis white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans i think there aposs blame on both sides and i have no doubt about it and you don apost have any doubt about it either end video clip hemmer so that was president trump this past week two different days first on monday then on tuesday explaining his point of view after the attacks in charlottesville and the violence we watched unfold there back with the panel now charlie bob gillian juan happy sunday there are those in this town who are saying this was the worst week yet for this president well i remember the debate over john mccain and the gold star families and access hollywood i my question would be is this week any different juan williams well you know it does seem like this presidency aposs been around for more than eight months wouldn apost you say i aposm just getting tired of all the winning the winning is just driving me nuts but i but you aposre right i mean it is a weak moment if you look at the poll numbers which is what i would look at i aposd say this president aposs astonishingly low for a man who aposs just elected less than a year ago but gillian turner former white house national security council it aposs an historical low right is it not williams it aposs a historical well you could well it depends if you it aposs not a historical low versus all presidents gillian but it aposs a historical low in terms of a man who aposs been in office for seven plus months it aposs just we aposve never seen that so that in that sense low but you aposre right i mean it just seems to be like one thing after another i feel like a fire hydrant aposs hitting me sometimes you said he aposs a great quote giver and news maker it aposs nonstop and i you we talk about john kelly the chief of staff trying to get control can he get control of the hemmer well we aposre going to see we aposre going to see about that as this issue moves forward but i think this is the normal for washington now and we aposll see whether or not that changes bob is shaking his head in disagreement bob woodward the washington post i think this is different i think president trump aposs remarks post charlottesville really show and suggest that he does not understand what it aposs like to be black hispanic or a minority in america now he has said hemmer that aposs a strong that aposs a strong statement bob woodward well yes but that aposs from the words it is provable now people who know him best and work with him say this is not trump this is not really what he believes ok the president having reported on these things controversies scandals for 45 years this is something that doesn apost go away it needs to be clarified he needs to say in a very straightforward way this is what i believe and this is why there is a role and we all know this for idealism in the american presidency he needs to tap into that his nature is to be a fighter a combatant this is something where he can at least those who know him best will say he is and he has set himself he is not a racist he is not an anti semite ok those words are really shocking when i heard those i thought this is the president of the united states talking there aposs a way to clarify and tap into that idealism to to walk away from it is not an inaudible hemmer let me come back let me come back to that charlie from facebook donna writes the following how on earth can be expected to unite the country when the media democrats liberals never trumpers et cetera keep pounding away at every word he says and doesn apost say that reflects exactly what his supporters think and feel charles hurt the washington times sure hemmer and like in the president hurt and also for the previous eight years it aposs not like we had a president who did a very good job of uniting the country after unfortunate incidents like this and the president has made very clear that he has denounced these evil groups with no in no uncertain terms and so the idea that he hasn apost done that is strange to me i grew up down in virginia not far from charlottesville literally my entire life we have argued about these statues and i can tell you that never in i cannot remember a single time when it was it ever became violent or you know their tempers flare people are very passionate about it but there aren apost racists and there aren apost you know it none these people that came from the outside to create this mayhem in charlottesville they aposre the only ones winning right now and it aposs a very very bad for our country and this notion and that we have an entire party that is built on the notion that america is a racist place and it aposs not and it aposs a very damaging thing to perpetuate when i cover detroit public schools for five years and when i think of a black kid in detroit public schools being told given the message from day one that this is a racist country you aposll never survive because of the color of your skin you are sentencing that child to a very bleak future the truth is that we have problems we have disagreements but we this is the freest best country on earth with unlimited opportunities and to tell a kid anything other than that i think is about as bad as racism hemmer very well stated very well stated juan we talk about race a lot you and i personally and we have for a decade now the democrats and the left have offered a lot of criticism this past week where is the message of unity from democrats coming now other than throwing more daggers and more critiques at what they perceive is happening now williams well i think it has to be that you stand up and when you see something and that is morally wrong and i think the president aposs words when he came back and said you know that you know both sides have some blame here suggests that an equivalence that many people don apost buy into so yesterday in boston you saw an incredible turnout for people saying we stand against the message coming from the alt right from the white supremacists and the neo nazis when you see the ceos of major companies pull away from the president despite the arguments over tax reform that are coming that aposs a pretty big sign when you see the heads of the u s military units come out and say we are unified we do not buy into any of these messages don apost confuse what the president said with what we aposre saying i think that aposs a pretty strong message that they feel that if you look back to 9 11 with president bush or you look at after the challenger disaster ronald reagan that somehow this moral moment was a failure for president trump he did not represent what bob woodward was calling our nation aposs ideals that somehow that sense of common bond was a failure so for democrats to call it out is energizing their base bill hemmer gillian i want you to respond to this this takes us back to late fall 2015 candidate trump watch begin video clip trump i aposm going to unify this country is totally divided barack obama has divided this country unbelievably and it aposs all it aposs all hatred what can i tell you i aposve never seen anything like it now i aposm going to unify the country i aposll be unifier i think i aposll bring people together and that includes blacks and whites and everything i think people will come together end video clip hemmer so that was october and november of 2015 two tweets late yesterday afternoon from the president our great country has been divided for decades sometimes you need protests in order to heal and we will heal and be stronger than ever before he went on with regard to boston yesterday afternoon i want to applaud the many protesters in boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate our country will soon come together as one gillian what do you make of that now turner so the media largely accused the president this week of dithering in his response to what happened in charlottesville last week but i actually disagree with that analysis of the situation i think president trump made a calculated strategic decision about how he was going to approach what had happened and what his response was going to be like unfortunately it is misguided i think it was a miscalculation but if you aposre the president of the united states and you aposre facing a nation that is internally divided that is warning among itself i think there aposs two options in front of you one is you can try and bring unity by and this is appropriate in certain situations by saying you know what everybody shares a certain burden here everybody factors into the blame there is nobody who gets out of this scot free without blood on their hands without culpability the other the other approach you can take here is to try and bring unity by standing firmly with one side and president trump this week chose the former and i think that was a huge strategic mistake but i don apost think that analysts do a service to what happened by accusing him of not thinking through this of dithering and equivocating i think he just made a miscalculated move hemmer i aposm trying to figure out turner perhaps inaudible of racists perhaps that aposs a racist inaudible hemmer you know and charlie with regard to your comments from earlier where the monument issue goes ultimately cindy writes on facebook bob the following why not sit in the oval office and speak from the heart about this issue all right that goes back to your point is that something you would inaudible woodward exactly but this is not about monuments this is about not just the words of the president but his fundamental attitude and you aposre absolutely right this is a miscalculation and it aposs actually more than a miscalculation now the danger in this for critics of the president people in the media democrats and as is pointed out many many republicans are not standing with the president on this and some of his most severe critics are republican but he tone cannot be self righteousness oh we get it you don apost get it there can apost be and unfortunately there often is this kind of smugness oh yes i aposve got it right i think we all need all step back from that and the president needs to seize that opportunity whether you call it a mistake or a miscalculation hemmer we aposre going to leave it there charlie thank you bob woodward gillian juan williams thanks to all of you for being here on this sunday in our moment our power player of the week washington saying goodbye to one of its biggest celebrities commercial break hemmer four years ago the national zoo welcomed its miracle baby panda bao bao but as we told you months ago she aposs all grown up now here

preparations to send her to a new life in china first stop a scale brandy smith the way to an panda aposs heart is a little bit of honey water wallace on camera that a girl smith and that way she

water and hand signals she put her paw out for a blood test smith that aposs where the vein is in a panda aposs arm and you can see the staff are pressing that vein so she aposs used to it wallace

reaction you can have smith she aposs a little bit sleepy this morning wallace voice over we go back a long way with her well three years anyway when baby bao bao was just six months old she weighed 25 pounds then not 200 and i was one of the first outsiders who got to feed her smith you can see if she wants some wallace on camera oh she aposs liking that a little bit smith she looks very grown up when she does this wallace i for one am very proud of her unidentified male don apost put your hands to close so wallace i got that that aposs not a problem wallace voice over feeding bao bao now is a different proposition wallace on camera three years ago bao bao remember here we come here we go you like that huh huh wow bao bao you aposve grown up smith so you aposve just made a panda very happy wallace voice over but bao bao aposs main task is to get used to the crate that will be her home for the 16 hour nonstop federal express flight to the panda center at chengdu wallace on camera why do you think her farewell is such a big deal smith sometimes people say that pandas receive too much attention right but this is what it takes to save an endangered species wallace voice over bao bao is part of that success story the panda population has increased 17 percent over a decade but for the folks who have taken care of her these last few years her leaving is still emotional smith of course i am she aposs my girl but it i think of it like a child go
