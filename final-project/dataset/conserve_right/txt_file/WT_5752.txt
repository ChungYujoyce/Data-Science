for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion it can be inexplicable to witness the behavior of liberals as they appear fixated on their hatred for president trump and conservatives in general and their apparent need to constantly publicly declare it but there is an explanation at least in some of the very public cases of trump derangement syndrome the requirement to prove one s fealty to trump hating leftist overlords impacts more people than you realize case in point a twitter exchange between ambassador to germany richard grenell and tennis great martina navratilova while on the surface it might appear to be one of the thousands of idiotic attacks on a trump supporter we see on social media every day this one provides a window into what the left has done to the very people they claim to support and champion top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots in her tweets ms navratilova publicly accused mr grenell of being sick and ok with the slaughter of civilians one would think to tweet something so awful at someone she must have seen a comment revealing some sort of monstrous inhumanity but no the tennis legend was responding in the bizarre unhinged fashion to a very moving message from mr grenell about his partner s visit to normandy with his grandfather he tweeted in normandy where a hero grandfather tells his grandson what it was like to be a 19 yr old ohio teenager arriving in france to fight the nazis mattlashey and merle lashey are lucky so many buried here never got to have a family sacrifice freedomisntfree ms navratilova s response you tweet this while our troops are under fire thanks to your guy trump have you any idea about what is going on in syria now crickets mr grenell who is known for being honest and direct was both in his response to her attack my 95 yr old grandfather visits normandy for the first time after he landed there as a 19 yr old teenager and you ridicule his moment seek help immediately you have trumpderangementsyndrome greatestgeneration the response is what we ve all grown to expect from those who see everything through the prism of their hatred for mr trump think about the timing she tweeted back i am not the sick one here i thank your grandfather for fighting for our country same cannot be said for you but i guess you re ok with the slaughter of civilians in syria thanks to your guy impeach45 and there it is all boiling down for her as a sad virtue signaling to the left that she s thinking correctly and can be trusted to parrot the narrative we all know the ambassador s work and his history and it s safe to say ms navratilova does too he is not only our representative in germany but he has also recently been appointed as our special u s envoy to the serbia and kosovo peace talks moreover he is leading the trump administration s project to decriminalize homosexuality around the globe as a testament to what the left does to the very people they claim to represent ms navratilova has been reduced to sniping at another gay person who is actually doing work to improve the lives of everyone and working to literally save the lives of gay people in countries that remain determined to imprison and even kill them what s especially sad in this exchange is it illustrates how the left creates a void of common decency including in ms navratilova who is arguably one of the greatest athletes of the modern era as an openly gay woman she also has served as an inspiration and role model for many but her bizarre and disconnected attack on mr grenell can be explained i contend as part of her continuing effort to prove her fealty to the left s trump hating leftist overlords earlier this year she committed the crime of expressing an unapproved opinion and was targeted by the rabid left for disappearance and cancellation her crime in a sunday times of london opinion piece in february of this year ms navratilova wrote of her opposition to transgendered women competing in women s sports the 18 time grand slam champion immediately came under an attack meant to destroy her work and reputation she has been labeled as transphobic removed from an lgbtq nonprofit she served on and remains the target of disparaging commentary by leftists and activists she herself noted in the offending op ed the growing tendency of transgendered activists to denounce anyone who argues against them and to label them all as transphobes which she declared was another form of tyranny according to a report by nbc news and that s exactly what happened after unrelenting efforts to cancel her ms navratilova eventually apologized and then in june an outsports headline confirmed the re education of martina perhaps i don t know as much as i thought martina navratilova talks about her new trans athlete documentary the tennis legend who once called trans women cheaters hints that she may be more open minded now which brings us back to attacking mr grenell on social media for celebrating his world war ii grandfather as an excuse to rage against mr trump ms navratilova appears to still be trying to prove herself to her community punishers moreover the strategy of the bullies on the left to destroy an icon like her is meant to send a message to every other liberal don t you dare step out of line or you will pay a horrible price this from people who scream every day that mr trump and conservatives are the threat to personal freedom tammy bruce president of independent women s voice author and fox news
