apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump is falsely assigning blame to governors and the obama administration for shortages in coronavirus testing for much of the week he was pretender to a throne that didn t exist as he claimed king like powers over the pandemic response and congress but by the weekend he was again saying governors called the shots and they are the ones to blame not the federal government not him for any testing problems he says governors aren t using all the testing capacity that the federal government has created it s not true top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time meanwhile trump denied praising china s openness in the pandemic when he s on record doing so repeatedly and declared victory over what he calls relatively low death rates in the u s but that s too soon to tell a look at his recent rhetoric and its relationship with reality testing trump on governors urging wider availability of virus tests they don t want to use all of the capacity that we ve created we have tremendous capacity they know that the governors know that the democrat governors know that they re the ones that are complaining news briefing saturday the facts trump s assertion that governors are not using already available testing capacity is contradicted by one of his top health advisers he s also wrong that democrats are the only ones expressing concerns about the adequacy of covid 19 testing several republican governors also point to problems dr anthony fauci the federal government s top infectious disease expert told the associated press that the u s does not yet have the critical testing and tracing procedures needed to begin reopening the nation s economy we have to have something in place that is efficient and that we can rely on and we re not there yet fauci a member of the white house s coronavirus task force said tuesday among fauci s top concerns that there will be new outbreaks in locations where social distancing has eased and that public health officials don t yet have the capabilities to rapidly test for the virus isolate any new cases and track down everyone that an infected person came into contact with his concerns are echoed by several republicans wyoming gov mark gordon a republican on friday said his state s testing capacity was inadequate and urged a larger role for the federal government he said states have been competing with each other to try to get more testing supplies a process he described as a slog it s a perilous set of circumstances trying to figure out how to make this work and until we ve got the testing up to speed which has got to be part of the federal government stepping in and helping we re just not going to be there ohio gov mike dewine a republican plans to keep applying pressure on the food and drug administration to address the rationing of a key component that is necessary to produce tests he said full testing capacity can t be reached unless it is more widely distributed republican maryland gov larry hogan on sunday called the lack of virus testing probably the no 1 problem in america and has been from the beginning of this crisis and i can tell you i talk to governors on both sides of the aisle nearly every single day he said on cnn s state of the union the administration i think is trying to ramp up testing and trying they are doing some things with respect to private labs but to try to push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing somehow we aren t doing our job is just absolutely false trump some partisan voices are attempting to politicize the issue of testing which they shouldn t be doing because i inherited broken junk news briefing saturday trump we inherited a broken terrible system news briefing saturday the facts his repeated insistence that the obama administration is to blame for initial delays in testing is wrong the novel coronavirus did not exist until late last year so there was no test to inherit the centers for disease control and prevention instead struggled to develop its own test for the coronavirus in january later discovering problems in its kits sent to state and county public health labs in early february it took the cdc more than two weeks to come up with a fix to the test kits leading to delays in diagnoses through february a critical month when the virus took root in the u s not until feb 29 did the fda decide to allow labs to develop and use their own coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them speeding up the supply previously the fda had only authorized use of a government test developed by the cdc meantime the u s bypassed a test that the world health organization quickly made available internationally trump has said that test was flawed it wasn t death rates trump the united states has produced dramatically better health outcomes than any other country on a per capita basis our mortality rate is far lower than other nations of western europe with the lone exception of possibly germany you hear we have more death but we re a much bigger country than any of those countries by far news briefing saturday the facts his suggestion that the u s response to the coronavirus has been better than many other countries because its mortality rate is far lower is unsupported and misleading in each country for instance the age and overall health of the population are important factors many countries in western europe such as italy have an older population than the u s and seniors are at an especially high risk of death from covid 19 beyond age underlying health conditions increase risk too indeed an ap analysis of available state and local data found nearly one third of u s deaths are among african americans with black people representing about 14 of the population in the areas covered in the analysis health conditions such as obesity diabetes and asthma are more common in the black community but more broadly it s too early to know the real death rate from covid 19 in any country look at a count kept by johns hopkins university and you can divide the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases the math nevertheless provides a completely unreliable measurement of death rates and the johns hopkins tally is not intended to be that first the count changes every day as new infections and deaths are recorded more important every country is testing differently knowing the real denominator the true number of people who become infected is key to determining what portion of them die some countries the u s among them have had trouble making enough tests available when there s a shortage of tests the sickest get tested first even with a good supply of tests someone who s otherwise healthy and has mild symptoms may not be tested and thus go uncounted the only way to tell how many went uncounted early on is to do a completely different kind of testing blood tests of the population to find how many people bear immune system antibodies to the virus something only now starting in selected places trump china has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the invisible enemy it is far higher than that and far higher than the u s not even close tweet friday the facts it s the reverse more than 4 600 recorded deaths in china compared with more than 36 000 in the united states and the notion that china can overtake the u s in a final accounting of the dead is a long shot right now even with the upward revision friday of chinese deaths which was not a doubling as trump claimed the recorded u s death toll is about seven times higher than china s according to the count by johns hopkins university as of friday night and china has more than four times more people the full picture is not known in either country trump routinely manipulates information to make the u s response to the coronavirus pandemic look better than it is china s secretive leadership obscured the severity of the crisis for crucial weeks and its numbers remain in question as well deaths from the virus have not been fully reported in either country because the pandemic is still raging in the u s and still being accounted for in china but for china to surpass the u s in this count it would have to be underreporting deaths by the tens of thousands and deaths in the u s would have to nosedive from the current trend and projections china vs us trump china was supposed to catch us for years i ve heard by 2019 china will catch us there s only one problem trump got elected in 2016 that was a big difference and we were going leaps and bounds above china news briefing saturday the facts no matter who got elected in 2016 trump or democrat hillary clinton china s economy could not have caught up to america s even if the u s economy had not grown at all since 2016 china s gross domestic product the broadest measure of economic output would have had to have surged by 79 in three years to pull even with america s that comes to growth of more than 21 a year something even china s super charged economy has never approached before the coronavirus outbreak the chinese economy had been slowly narrowing the gap because every year it grows much faster than america s in 2019 for example the international monetary fund predicted chinese gdp to increase 6 2 more than double the 2 6 growth it expects for the united states the global pandemic isn t expected to change that trend line last week the imf said the u s economy will fall 5 9 this year and china s will manage to grow 1 2 that means china has got a long way to go to surpass the u s whether trump is president or not executive authority trump some in the fake news media are saying that it is the governors decision to open up the states not that of the president of the united states the federal government let it be fully understood that this is incorrect it is the decision of the president tweets on april 13 trump asked about his level of authority to reopen the country i have the ultimate authority they can t do anything without the approval of the president of the united states news briefing on april 13 the facts the federal government did not close down the country and won t be reopening it restrictions on public gatherings workplaces mobility store operations schools and more were ordered by states and communities not washington the federal government has imposed border controls otherwise its social distancing actions are mostly recommendations not mandates the federal emergency management agency knocking down a series of false rumors about the coronavirus makes clear that states and cities are responsible for announcing curfews shelters in place or other restrictions and safety measures trump has argued that states and communities imposed restrictions because he let them and that he can overrule their decisions constitutional experts disagree the president can un declare his national emergency declarations which freed up federal funds and provided assistance to state and local governments said walter dellinger a former acting u s solicitor general but he has no federal statutory or constitutional power to override steps taken by governors and mayors under state law he has never understood that he lacks a general power to rule by decree the federal government does have broad constitutional authority over states on things that cross state lines and involve the entire nation such as regulating interstate commerce and immigration levying taxes or declaring war what trump is proposing however is different he is wading into states sharply defined powers to protect public health asked what authority he had to make such an assertion of presidential power trump promised earlier in the week that he would provide a legal memorandum supporting his view by thursday he hadn t and he told governors that day they could reopen states when they deem appropriate trump if the house will not agree to that adjournment i will exercise my constitutional authority to adjourn both chambers of congress news briefing wednesday the facts his power to adjourn congress is highly questionable the constitution does not spell out a unilateral power for the president to adjourn congress it states only that he can decide on adjournment if there is a dispute over that matter between the house and senate such a disagreement does not exist nor is it likely to arise constitutional scholar jonathan turley said on twitter the constitution gives a president authority in extraordinary occasions to convene or adjourn congress but he said this power has never been used and should not be used now trump is unhappy that congress has refused to fully adjourn during most breaks because congress is still formally in session trump can t circumvent congress and unilaterally put his nominees for various positions to work in the jobs he wants them to have lawmakers also used the tactic of holding off on adjournment to thwart some of president barack obama s nominees doug andres a spokesman for senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky said mcconnell will find ways to confirm nominees essential to the pandemic response but senate rules will require that the democratic leader sen chuck schumer of new york give consent to move forward on them world health organization trump explaining in part why he is freezing money to the world health organization the who willingly took china s assurances to face value and they took it just at face value and defended the actions of the chinese government even praising china for its so called transparency i don t think so news briefing tuesday trump asked about his past praise of china i don t talk about china s transparency news briefing tuesday the facts he did praise china s transparency as well as its overall performance in the pandemic while it s true that who director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus complimented china s response trump early on similarly took china s assurances at face value in a cnbc interview on jan 22 trump was asked if he trusted information from china about the coronavirus i do trump said i have a great relationship with president xi two days later he was even more effusive china has been working very hard to contain the coronavirus he tweeted the united states greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency it will all work out well i want to thank president xi trump kept up the compliments when asked several times in february about whether data from china can be trusted he called xi extremely capable and said he s doing a very good job with a very very tough situation such praise faded as the pandemic hit hard in the u s and the federal response stumbled the time was ripe for scapegoats it also become clearer that china had not been forthcoming at the start on march 21 trump said of his earlier remarks china was transparent at that time but when we saw what happened they could have been transparent much earlier than they were in any event his denial that he ever praised china s openness is false
