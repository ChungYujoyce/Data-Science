 sign in measuring obama against reagan shows there is no comparison manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion hillary clinton wants americans to believe the economy does better with a democratic president than a republican in the white house that is simply false unless a president presides over an absolute economic disaster as did george w bush or herbert hoover comparing one with another is tricky business so much depends on the circumstances each inherits and the state of the wider global economy top stories australian researchers see virus design manipulation purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history the best apples to apples comparison is between the rather difficult conditions presidents reagan and obama inherited and how the fortunes of america s families then progressed with reagan relying on conservative prescriptions and mr obama on activist government to stimulate growth mr obama took office during a terrible financial crisis and endured a punishing recession unemployment peaked at 10 percent in his first term but since then the economy has reclaimed and added 13 2 million jobs and employment is up about 10 percent the gipper faced tough times too double digit unemployment and interest rates and a bruising recession unemployment peaked at 10 8 percent but subsequently the economy added more than 17 2 million jobs and employment rose about 20 percent the reason reagan was able to create so many more jobs in a much smaller economy is simple it wasn t just lower taxes and less spending but rather more reliance on private decision making to guide recovery he cleared a path for businesses large and small to invest as they deemed fit and raise wages as they decided they could afford and he encouraged the unemployed to get out and look for work mr obama by contrast has sought to micromanage business through an explosion of regulations and to pacify a middle class under siege and americans underemployed or not working at all with giveaways ranging from free contraception to forgiving college debt from subsidies for solar energy projects and mandatory health insurance to incessant preaching that ordinary folks are victims of racism sexism and the evil machinations of the well off through the first 25 quarters of mr obama s recovery gross domestic product gdp growth has averaged 2 2 percent whereas during the comparable period for reagan gdp advanced at a 4 6 percent annual pace and whereas reagan s social safety net assisted the unemployed mr obama s pays the unemployed to be idle the 7 million men between the ages of 25 and 54 who are neither employed nor are looking for work are rewarded with food stamps the earned income tax credit if their spouse is a low income worker and federal health care subsidies and even virtually free health care through medicaid in many states for folks refusing to do anything productive with their lives mr obama is offering an even more attractive benefit free money in the form of a government pension despite the fact that americans are living healthier and longer lives and work is generally less physically challenging the percentage of adults ages 16 to 64 certified as permanently incapable of working by the social security disability insurance program now stands at 5 1 percent about double the figure in reagan s day a broken appeals system offers a decided advantage to those crafty applicants who hire a lawyer a situation the obama administration refuses to fix for hardworking families the results are predictable annual family incomes have declined about 1 650 during the obama years whereas they increased 3 900 during reagan s tenure hillary is offering americans more of the same higher taxes to pay for more government giveaways and more micromanagement in the form of regulation of private sector decisions on wages for the indolent this is the second age of pericles but for those who toil for their daily bread hillary s pronouncements that americans would be better off doubling down on mr obama s economic policies doesn t bear the test of facts peter morici is an economist and business professor at the university of maryland and a national columnist manage newsletters copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view comments click to hide terms of use privacy policy manage newsletters
