center looks like a walmart because they have so many diapers and food products to care for these families mr bash told fox news what that means is that you have fewer agents in the field that means we ll get a lot of people sneaking into the country not only economic migrants but drug smugglers gang members ms 13 this is industry of smuggling aliens into the country a 100 million industry mr
