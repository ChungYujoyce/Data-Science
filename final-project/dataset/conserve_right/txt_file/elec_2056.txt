here in new hampshire is enormously important the whole country is not only looking at new hampshire in fact the whole world is looking at new hampshire thepopulist senator from vermont who s making his second straight white house run is in the driver s seat sitting atop the final public opinion polls drawing large and energetic crowds in the closing days and sporting arguably the largest grassroots get out the vote operation in the granite state after getting out of iowa s caucuses with essentially a tie with 2020 nomination rival buttigieg expectations are high for sanders in a state where he shares home field advantage with fellow progressive standard bearer sen elizabeth warren of massachusetts as he did in iowa sanders is stressing to his supporters that if we have the highest voter turnout in new hampshire primary history i am confident that we are going to win here in new hampshire and if we win here in new hampshire we apos re going to set the pace to win nevada and south carolina and california but meeting expectations in a state where he crushed eventual nominee hillary clinton four years ago is crucial for sanders sanders closed out his bid in the first primary state with a massive rally and concert that drew over 7 500 to the university of new hampshire at durham which was by far the largest crowd for any democratic presidential candidate in new hampshire this cycle he was joined by rep alexandria ocasio cortez and a bunch of other high profile surrogates new hampshire remains bernie s to lose he dominated in 2016 and his coalition seems confident again that said if he doesn t win it s a huge hit to the sanders path emphasized longtime democratic strategist sean downey a national adviser on sen cory booker of new jersey s now defunct 2020 presidential bid and a veteran of numerous political campaigns in new hampshire the final poll position in nh ahead of tuesday apos s primary sanders declared victory in iowa where the results dribbled in for days after a reporting debacle on caucus night by pointing to his lead in the raw vote totals coming out of the caucus precinct sites buttigieg the former south bend indiana mayor also claimed victory spotlighting his narrow edge in the percentage of state delegates won and for buttigieg like sanders a strong finish in new hampshire is vital for his hopes of capturing the nomination buttigieg was also stressing the importance of the primary telling supporters the eve of the primary that tuesday will be a historic night that will set the course for the party and the rest of the world we are lucky and unlucky enough to be in a point of history where it will be recorded what we did the 38 year old candidate the youngest in the field told supporters on the primary eve that tuesday will be a historic night that will set the course for the party and the rest of the world buttigieg closed in on sanders in the polls in the days after the iowa caucuses but one of the two tracking polls suggested that the candidate saw his numbers drop over the weekend that wasn t reflected on the campaign trail as buttigieg drew more than 5 000 people to his events on sunday buttigieg has struggled to resonate with african american and latino voters and with the white house race moving next to nevada and south carolina which have much more diverse electorates a strong finish in new hampshire is paramount for buttigieg pointing to the calendar ahead downey emphasized that mayor pete s situation here is urgent given his real lack of traction in the south and out west the latest from fox news on the 2020 presidential campaign illustrating the tension between the top two contenders buttigieg once again took aim at sanders on monday saying that at a moment when our country is so divided we can apos t risk further polarizing the american people that apos s why i apos m very concerned about the suggestion that either you got to be for revolution or you must be for the status quo because that vision of politics as all or nothing is a vision that most of us can apos t see where we fit in sanders who s funding his massive campaign war chest through small dollar grassroots donation took jabs at buttigieg and former vice president joe biden saying they have dozens and dozens of billionairescontributing to their campaigns the former vice president s message on monday night to his supporters stick with me 24 hours and we re going to be just fine we re going to win this nomination biden s said he s not writing off new hampshire but it sure looks like he s lowering expectations i took a hit in iowa and i m probably going to take a hit here biden said in a striking moment at the top of friday night s prime time democratic presidential nomination debate asked the next day by fox news if he was writing off the granite state the former vice president fired back saying i m not writing off new hampshire i m going to campaign like hell here in new hampshire as i m going to do in nevada in south carolina and beyond look this is just getting going here this is a marathon for biden however at least a third place finish here could becritical if only to prevent an exodus of donors and the possible erosion of his so called firewall of support in the looming south carolina contest with the race for first increasingly looking to be between sanders and buttigieg biden s essentially battling with warren andsen amy klobuchar of minnesota for a top three ticket out of the granite state it apos s a stunning predicament for the candidate who was once the unrivaled front runner for the nomination he apos s long made electability central to his campaign pitch but university of new hampshire pollster andrew smith highlighted that the final unh tracking poll for cnn conducted after biden s lackluster fourth place finish in the iowa caucuses indicate that bernie sanders is seen as the most electable candidate to take on republican president donald trump in november s general election if your candidacy is based on electability once you don t win elections that electability argument dissipates very rapidly smith explained if biden does very poorly in new hampshire going forward those voters in nevada and south carolina are going to look at that electability argument in a very different light because to be electable you need to win elections warren once a co frontrunner in the nomination race is also under the spotlight she faced a deluge of questions the past couple of days from reporters asking how crucial a strong finish in new hampshire is to her white house bid i didn apos t start by doing polls a year ago and i still don apos t do polls responded the senator who famously avoids all talk of her position in the polls warren who s repeatedly avoided saying new hampshire s a must win state has emphasized that the way i see this is it s going to be a long campaign we ve built a campaign to go the distance talking to reporters on her campaign s press bus on monday the candidate told reporters i apos ve been counted down and out for much of my life but she emphasized that you get knocked down you get back up and you keep fighting because it apos s not about me it apos s about the people who are counting on me downey noted that with a full field the difference between third and fourth could be a few points and i d look to strong organizing game and surrogate operations from warren and biden to make things interesting but thanks to a last minute surge add klobuchar to the mix in the fight for third place klobuchar touted on monday that as you probably heard we re on a bit of a surge i woke up this morning to find out that we are third in two polls one of the two final surveys a suffolk university tracking poll for the boston globe and wbz suggested that klobuchar soared nine percentage points over the past two days but the big question is whether klobuchar can capitalize on her late tide of momentum smith cautioned that i don t think though that klobuchar s going to have the organization necessary to take advantage of her debate performance and her performance in iowa and get those people out to vote she doesn t have anywhere near the on the ground organization as the other top candidates adding to the uncertainty ahead of the primary results the fact that granite staters are traditionally late deciders the final polls illustrate the point showing that nearly half of those who are currently backing a candidate suggested that they could change their minds before they vote smith gauged that i would see easily 15 20 of new hampshire democrats making up their mind on primary day and downey said i can t stress this enough new hampshire likes underdogs and will decide late this race isn t over
