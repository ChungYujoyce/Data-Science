prompt investigation into who is responsible for dishing out the national security goods he made the attack just a day after sen dianne feinstein chairwoman of the senate select committee on intelligence suggested that she too suspected the leaks came from someone in the white house on tuesday however the california democrat tried to take back her remarks saying she doesn t know and should not have speculated mr romney s attacks in a speech to the veterans of foreign wars marks a rare turn away from domestic issues and to foreign policy the republican candidate also blames the

democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the attack on the white house about leaks underscored a potential lingering problem for mr obama who in the past month has found himself on the defensive over several news stories including one about a covert u s cyberattack on iran s nuclear program and another on the so called terrorist kill list that appear to hinge on top secret information led by sen john mccain of arizona mr obama s opponent in the 2008 election republicans have argued that the administration leaked the material to make the president look good and that a special counsel should dig into the matter rather than the two u s attorneys who attorney general eric h holder jr tapped to lead an internal investigation this conduct is contemptible mr romney said of the leaks of classified information it betrays our national interest it compromises our men and women in the field and it demands a full and prompt investigation by a special prosecutor with explanation and consequence asked about the remarks white house press secretary jay carney said he wouldn t comment in the middle of the investigation by the two u s attorneys but that mr obama condemns leaking as a general matter the president has made abundantly clear that he has no tolerance for leaks and he thinks leaks are damaging to our national security interests mr carney said on monday mrs feinstein seemed to bolster mr romney s case in a speech to the world affairs council she said that the white house has to understand that some of this is coming from their ranks mrs feinstein released a statement tuesday saying she had gone too far in her speculation on the source of the leaks and criticized mr romney for using her to attack the president i was asked whether the white house might be responsible for recent national security leaks she said i stated that i did not believe the president leaked classified information i shouldn t have speculated beyond that because the fact of the matter is i don t know the source of the leaks noting mr holder s appointment of two u s attorneys to investigate the leaks mrs feinstein said she is disappointed that mr romney used her comments to accuse the white house of not being more forthcoming i know we are in campaign season but i hope the investigation proceeds without political accusation or interference from anyone she said but mr romney showed no sign of letting up what kind of white house would reveal classified material for political gain i ll tell you right now mine won t he said mr romney delivered his speech to the vfw meeting in reno nev a day after mr obama s own appearance where he rattled off what he saw as his administration s accomplishments returning the troops from iraq killing osama bin laden and other top al qaeda leaders and putting the nation on a course to leave afghanistan in 2014 he claimed that republicans want to hide their support of the debt deal last year that set into motion the 1 2 billion in defense and domestic spending cuts which will take effect jan 1 if congress fails to find common ground on alternative spending reductions instead of making tough choices to reduce the deficit they d rather protect tax cuts for some of the wealthiest americans even if it risks big cuts in our military mr obama said mr romney tried to turn the tables tuesday blaming mr obama for the budget impasse this is not the time for the president s radical cuts in the military he said mr romney is preparing for a three nation overseas trip that includes meetings this week and next with top leaders in england poland and israel the trek will put him on par with what many democrats see as one of the president s strong points one thing the governor did not talk about today was al qaeda and osama bin laden vice president joseph r biden said after the speech that s not surprising when he last ran for president gov romney was asked what he would do about bin laden he said then it is not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person mr romney instead focused in on the notion that the president s failure to speed up the nation s recovery has diminished its stature the president s policies have made it harder to recover from the deepest recession in 70 years exposed the military to cuts that no one can justify compromised our national security secrets mr romney said and in dealings with other nations he has given trust where it is not earned insult where it is not deserved and apology where it is not due in attempting to reset relations with russia he said mr obama abandoned poland and the czech republic by walking away from the bush era anti ballistic missile system in eastern europe he said russia thanked the united states by arming syrian president bashar assad as he slaughtered the syrian people mr romney also said he would be more supportive of israel and there is no greater danger in the world today than the prospect of the ayatollahs in tehran possessing nuclear weapons capability if elected he said he would fight to ensure that any talks with iran over its disputed nuclear program be based on stopping their enrichment of uranium though the same basic request has been made before the iranian regime claims the right to enrich nuclear material for supposedly peaceful purposes this claim is discredited by years of deception a clear line must be drawn there must be a full suspension of any enrichment period he said without explaining what he would do if iran did not agree to those terms susan crabtree contributed to this report copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint
