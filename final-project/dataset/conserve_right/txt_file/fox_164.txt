boat on the coronavirus don apost look at me look at everyone especially the experts first let aposs talk about those who told us to go about our daily lives and not to panic gutfeld on gov cuomo and the nursing home scandal they were wrong but with good intentions they thought it was for our own good to lie to us they knew this virus was bad news but doctors are trained in giving bad news so the bad doesn apost create more bad being in panic mode makes you less likely to focus on important information to use a clumsy analogy america is the patient and the experts had to give bad news to america without freaking it out the diagnosis you aposre gonna get sick and part of you isn apost gonna make it hopefully you will lose no more than a toe but it could be more initially this was a highly contagious deadly disease with no therapeutics in sight no vaccine no drugs and what aposs just as bad no real information tosoothe our itching curiosity china wasn apost forthcoming to use another clumsy analogy china and its wuhan virusare like the guy at a bar who keeps saying that pulsing thing on his lip isn apost a sore so experts had bad news for patient america and they relied on their experience as deliverers of bad news when you give it you have to deliver it in a way that reduces the panic panic leads to fear which leads to hopelessness hoarding then savagery this is why themedical experts did notlevel with us on a few things in the back of their minds they saw us as dumb animals incapable of facing a pandemic head on to buy everyone time so hopefully we might become psychologically ready they said a few things that were false those things were these were not mean spirited lies or even cover your ass lies they were simply well meaning responses that the future proved misguided let aposs tackle each error first telling people to live life normally a suggestion not just from andrew cuomo bill de blasio but top doctors too early on was a soothing line designed to keep a population stable while the experts figure out the plan when the crap does hit the fan itwas meant to buy time maybethey felt that panic will only make our response worse as the true reality sets in for me i aposm not sure that aposs a good strategy i was panicking early on and i think my panicking helped i went on the five and said shut downtravel now i wouldn apost have done that if i wasn apost panicked and remember i aposm a skeptic in general so while their deflection is understandable maybe we could have benefited from a little panic not a lot but a little a little panic might have prevented new york from placing the sick and contagious among the vulnerable in rest homes which led to an increase in deaths as for experts telling you that there was no proof masks help you reduce transmission that claim on its face no pun makes little sense why the hell do people wear them in hospitals it s such an absurd lie i have to ask why tell it well the experts operated on a sufficiently plausible belief that if you or i were wearing a mask it would mean fewer masks fornurses or caregivers i accepted that lie completely they also said that we the united republic of morons wouldn t know how to use a mask effectively which is hilarious given that even a dolt like me can operate a car and an electric toothbrush we know masks reduce transmission after all you cover your mouth with your arm not the hand when you cough or sneeze any obstacle even one with a high fallibility rate of prevention creates some friction between your action a cough and a consequence droplets ending up on your friend even a crappy fence is better than no fence a burglar loses time and effort navigating that fence it apossthe same thing with masks and viruses doctors and nurses don apost wear masks because it aposs halloween barriers work problem was no one could get masks in mass quantities we don apostneed millions we really need billions we didn apost have that the experts didn apost want to tap that resource out so they told us we didn apost need them now we realize that masks were needed and could have cut viral transmission if the experts had leveled with us and said you know what we don t have enough masks for you guys we need them for health workers meanwhile try making one of your own something reusable there are youtube videos that show you how to make one yourself if an expert has said that in january perhaps may would look a whole lot better but hindsight is 2020 and most people who engage in it are hind minds meaning they have their heads up their asses until it s safe for them to blame someone they hate i ve noticed this a lot and it prompted me to come up with gutfeld s law which states if you ve offered no advice on how to deal with an oncoming problem you lose your spot at the table for discussion when the problem hits it s easy to condemn people for wanting to go back to work when you re working and don t feel the need to say when we should return the people who do this will look at people who offer advice on returning to workas callous monsters who want to see people die these amateurs belong to what s known as the kiddie table if a person cannot comprehend that every decision carries a risk not simply a benefit then they must not be allowed at the adult s table they must be quarantined because not only are they hindering the adults who must make such brave but routine decisions they are cowardly too they don t want any skin in the game but they want to punish you for having the guts to do what they can t which is to share the risk when s e cupp castigated chris christie for his sober reflection that people will die when we return to work she was merely mimicking the infantile response of so many sheep that comprise her pathetic industry none of her shrill mindless peers could say when a civilization must return to life but they could certainly condemn you as evil for taking the adult stand and offering a suggestion based on the facts of future suffering i have taken a look at all these shameless hacks who ve called people callous or grandma killers and i can t find a single one who had the guts to suggest what to do next instead they sit in their home studios and wag their fingers at people especially at those who desperately want to get back to work those people don t have the luxury of a chris cuomo or cupp or any of these like minded clowns meaning a job that pays during misery hence my second rule you can t leave the kid s table until you tell us what you re willing to risk so back to lies the last lie that the flu kills more people so clearly coronavirus isn t as big of a deal it was also good intentionedbut misleading first we re told that the flu killed 34 000people last year and 60 000the prior year we aren t sure how real those numbers are but that debate is for another time regardless this rhetorical response was meant to contextualize our priorities and there aposs a good reason for that here aposs why if you don apost contextualize death and risk you are forever paralyzed you can never leave the house even though people die daily in their homes falls poisonings fires choking hence the life alert commercials but the contextualization is often taken incorrectly people love to compare the coronavirus to car accidents the comparison doesn apost downplay the deaths from the virus however instead it reveals how humans make decisions that accept risk every day cars are missiles made of metal in which you readily place yourself and your family these missiles are all around you some driven by careful grandparents texting teens or drunk a holes we lose tens of thousands of loved ones a year in car accidents and have friends and loved ones permanently maimed yet not only do we accept it we love our precious death machines our cities are built to indulge a technology that kills 38 000 people a year within that mentalityis where we solve the coronavirus threat the virus isn apost a car it aposs a car accident a result of life aposs risks car accidents taught us to manage risk it aposs hard to believe that cars never had seat belts i even own one that doesn apost it s from 1957 but it took decades to make buckling up part of daily life airbags are still only a few decades old the coronavirusis the result of biology unleashing something novel into our world of enhanced transport so now that it s here and there is no cure we must manage risks if you look at that threat like the risk of auto collision then proper and permanent hygiene adjustments become the seat belts and airbags in this daily fight against a deadly hazard remember how the beeping noise in your car was there to remind you to strap yourself in we could probably use the same idea when it comes to washing our hands touching faces tossing our dirty masks i also see doorknobs disappearing replaced with doors that require no hand involvement at all of course one way to avoid car accidents and also the virus is to never leave home that s not in the cards unless you have a home studio and a cush job in tv so that aposs likely howwe learn to live with a murderous virus the same way we learned to live with murderous machines this is not a callous thought in fact it aposs the opposite it aposs the adult assessment of life aposs risks which then helps everyone you and me plus our leaders and experts to figure out novel waysto reduce the odds of a novel virus ending our lives the people who keep screaming but people will die if you go back to work love to ignore that people already die when they go to work in their cars thousands of times a year last i want to bring up an interesting phenomenon coined by scott adams called cheryl s law it s based on the wisdom of a restaurant server who noticed that any major change in the daily routine can essentially make business stop meaning if you own a caf and it starts raining in the morning you might not get a customer all day people change their plans but likewise if the weather becomes miraculously sunny and warm then no one shows up your caf either they went to the park but once the change becomes routine then the people return they get used to the rain or the heat and start returning to their daily lives and customers return to the caf i noticed this in my job at the start of the pandemic i along with others repeatedly stressed the importance of unity and cooperation let s put aside our petty political squabbles we d tell ourselves because we have a war to fight against an invisible enemy and you know what it worked for maybe two days the novelty shock of the pandemic like a change in weather might have been enough to quell our normal ideological team sport beefs but after we got used to this new world and the novelty wore off others were back to our old tricks liberals screamed at trump trump mocked them in return pundits started blaming everyone for not seeing this pandemic coming the same pundits who were binging on the impeachment miniseries while the virus exploded cnn mocked people wanting to go back to work while at least one employee violated quarantine the media proved cheryl s law their finger pointing divisiveness stopped until they got bored of the novelty then their pettiness returned in full force and you can bet as the election nears it will only get worse click here to get the opinion newsletter finally if there is
