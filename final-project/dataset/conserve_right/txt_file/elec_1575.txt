chairman of the house democratic caucus in a stunning primary result reaction and analysis on fox news night from mark penn former pollster and adviser to president clinton and derek hunter contributing editor at the daily caller you might not recall the late rep charlie rose d n c or former rep tom reynolds r n y you would certainly remember them if they became speaker of the house it wasn t long ago there was a political scenario where rose and reynolds climbed to the speakership it didn t happen but it looked like a reasonable bet at the time what upended the routes of rose and reynolds to the speaker s suite too many nonlinear unconnected events kind of like a butterfly flapping its wings in asia spawning a f5 tornado in the oklahoma panhandle a pinprick of a phenomenon culminating in an unforeseen consequential conclusion later politics is full of those who were supposed to be there was a time in the early 1990s when many thought rose might succeed house speaker tom foley d wash foley lost re election in 1994 that may have been rose s opening but republicans also wrested control of the house from democrats for the first time in four decades that year rose challenged then house democratic leader dick gephardt d mo for his post gephardt handily defeated rose 150 50 there was a time in the mid 2000s when many congressional handicappers placed good money on tom reynolds to become speaker of the house house majority leader tom delay r texas faced ethics and criminal issues a scandal about a member sending inappropriate text messages to house pages helped torpedo then house speaker dennis hastert r ill years before we learned hastert s other baggage and then republicans lost the house in the 2006 midterms that was the end of speaker reynolds until tuesday night at least one tributary of time depicted the following it s around 1 30 pm et on january 3 2018 the house of representatives just tapped rep joe crowley d n y as speaker to start the 116th congress a blue wave of anti trump sentiment cascaded across voting booths in battleground districts in virginia pennsylvania florida california texas colorado and washington along this particular continuum democrats won the house thanks in part to the success of moderate candidates in their party as a result house minority leader nancy pelosi d calif didn t have the votes to return to the speakership house minority whip steny hoyer d md wasn t in the mix either a few ripples in time away there s another scenario it s january 3rd and crowley starts the new congress as house majority leader or majority whip or perhaps minority leader or minority whip it s all contingent upon a series of probabilities hinging on the midterm elections and the futures of pelosi and hoyer but these narratives won t happen now that s because alexandria ocasio cortez happened to joe crowley tuesday night in the new york democratic primary big things may have been in store for crowley but in the end butterflies in the bronx and queens had other ideas an inflection point for crowley may have come not long after the 2016 midterm election house democrats were hopping mad about pelosi and the abysmal showing by democrats in house contests democrats didn t want to just anoint pelosi as leader again many democrats thought crowley commanded enough sway throughout various wings of the democratic caucus to challenge pelosi then hoyer wouldn t go after pelosi if she ran crowley also elected to sit on the sidelines in the end rep tim ryan d ohio ran snatching 63 votes from pelosi in her bid to return as house minority leader to be sure pelosi would have been tough to beat but that may have been crowley s best shot at climbing the leadership ladder a potential crowley victory would have propelled him to a lofty perch he d be the highest elected democratic official in the land alongside senate minority leader chuck schumer d n y one wonders how much turbulence the butterfly wings could have generated under those circumstances none of this is new consider that former house majority leader eric cantor r va was supposed to succeed former house speaker john boehner r ohio that was the case until rep dave brat r va happened to cantor brat s victory was an inflection point for house republicans boehner had been looking to retire from congress brat s defeat of cantor upended those plans and then when boehner finally did decide to cash it in house majority leader kevin mccarthy r calif mysteriously withdrew arguably short of the votes minutes after mccarthy pulled out house speaker paul ryan r wis declared he wouldn t run for speaker until ryan reversed course two weeks later guiled into the job by gopers they knew the party was on the verge of an internecine bloodbath over who would fill the void most have forgotten there were quixotic campaigns for speaker that fall by rep dan webster r fla and former rep jason chaffetz r utah it s unclear if a webster or chaffetz speakership exists along the folds of time but those membranes are slender compared to the more robust chances of someone like crowley there s a lot of democratic turmoil over pelosi and possibly hoyer right now that s why many believed the timing was perfect for crowley one could certainly never rule out hoyer as a potential successor to pelosi but over the years there was a long list of people not named hoyer who pelosi seemed to groom as potential successors but the political landscape is littered with a lot of democrats who were supposed to be former rep rahm emanuel d ill is now mayor of chicago former rep chris van hollen d md is now sen chris van hollen d md former rep steve israel d n y retired and now writes novels former rep xavier becerra d calif is now california attorney general so crowley is out of the mix nothing abhors a vacuum like politics so imagine the geometric growth of potential for another group of lawmakers now sensing opportunity the aforementioned tim ryan along with reps linda sanchez d calif cheri bustos d ill cedric richmond d la marcia fudge d ohio barbara lee d calif seth moulton d mass pete aguilar d calif hakeem jeffries d n y ruben gallego d ariz katherine clark d mass derek kilmer d wash dan kildee d mich and probably a few others who knows who will wind up where if anywhere at all these democrats haven t even entered the supposed to be phase yet this is why it s nearly impossible to determine who climbs in congressional leadership battles it s particle politics where outcomes are determined at the sub atomic political level fabled science fiction writer harlan ellison just died this week ellison is known for writing what s regarded as the best star trek episode of all time the city on the edge of forever captain kirk travels through a time portal and finds himself in 1930s manhattan kirk falls in love with a depression era social worker played by joan collins kirk has a choice continue the romance or let his love die in a car accident he chooses the latter had she lived collins s character would later form a global pacifist movement collins s survival would inadvertently help the nazis win world war ii but after kirk lets her die time resumes its usual trajectory and the allies defeat the nazis in the war in other words sometimes there are reasons things turn out the way they do tax reform without paul ryan at the helm maybe there s a reason congress didn t revise the tax code for 30 years perhaps pelosi is supposed to return to the speakership to tangle with trump or is that the destiny of steny hoyer and maybe kevin mccarthy is still supposed to be speaker he just wasn t supposed to be house speaker in 2015 charlie rose and tom reynolds and eric cantor and joe crowley all
