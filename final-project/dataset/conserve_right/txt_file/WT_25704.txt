believed to be working for the iranian government have targeted u s government agencies as well as sectors of the economy including finance oil and gas sending waves of spear phishing emails according to representatives of cybersecurity companies crowdstrike and fireeye which regularly track such activity this new campaign appears to have started shortly after the trump administration imposed sanctions on the iranian petrochemical sector this month it was not known if any of the hackers managed to gain access to the targeted networks with the emails which typically mimic legitimate emails but contain malicious software tensions have run high between the two countries since the u s withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with iran last year and began a policy of maximum pressure iran has

the agency has been working with the intelligence community and cybersecurity partners to monitor iranian cyber activity and ensure the u s and its allies are safe what might start as an account compromise where you think you might just lose data can quickly become a situation where you ve lost your whole network krebs said the national security agency would not discuss iranian cyber actions specifically but said in a statement to the ap on friday that there have been serious issues with malicious iranian cyber actions in the past in these times of heightened tensions it is appropriate for everyone to be alert to signs of iranian aggression in cyberspace and ensure appropriate defenses are in place the nsa said iran has long targeted the u s oil and gas sectors and other critical infrastructure but those efforts dropped significantly after the nuclear agreement was signed after trump withdrew the u s from the deal in may 2018 cyber experts said they have seen an increase in iranian hacking efforts this is not a remote war anymore said sergio caltagirone vice president of threat intelligence at dragos inc this is one where iranians could quote unquote bring the war home

the white house did not respond to a request for comment despite the apparent cyber campaign experts say the iranians would not necessarily immediately exploit any access they gain into computer systems and may seek to maintain future capabilities should their relationship with the u s further deteriorate it s important to remember that cyber is not some magic offensive nuke you can fly over
