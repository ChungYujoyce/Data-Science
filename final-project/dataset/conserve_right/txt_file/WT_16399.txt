diplomacy and putting his own stamp on u s foreign policy priorities adm harry b harris the head of u s pacific command will make the trip to thailand on tuesday to open the massive 10 day cobra gold military exercise long the bedrock event in the bilateral alliance adm harris will be the highest ranking u s officer to visit thailand since the 2014 military coup that vaulted prime minister prayuth chan ocha to power in the busy opening weeks of his administration mr trump has said nothing publicly about the u s thai relationship about the obama administration s concerns on human rights and civil liberties or about bangkok s moves to boost ties with china but the admiral s visit announced just before mr trump took office is being watched with extra care for signs of a shifting approach

to signal its displeasure with the state of thai democracy and a high level u s diplomat has not visited in nearly two years but the admiral s presence this week would send a strong signal to the international community that the u s remains engaged strategically in the region as before wrote kavi chongkittavorn a columnist at the nation a thai english language newspaper trump and his foreign policy team have made contradictory remarks on the future of u s foreign agenda in asia generating lots of anxieties among regional leaders thai defense officials are talking up the significance of the visit it is not common for an officer of adm harris rank to attend these sorts of events gen chalermchai sittisart the recently named army commander in chief told the reuters news agency the focus of the military exercises may be according to planners humanitarian operations and disaster management but the real message will be re engagement by the u s with southeast asia under the trump administration pavin chachavalpongpun of the center for southeast asian studies at kyoto university wrote in the japan times late last week like some other authoritarian leaders around the world mr prayuth has reached out to the new american president after a period of frosty ties under mr obama your victory is remarkable and clear evidence that the american people have placed their trust and confidence in you to lead the country forward mr prayuth told mr trump in a congratulatory letter on jan 20 emphasizing more than 180 years of relations between the countries compatible leaders the combative and plain spoken mr prayuth who has a testy relationship with the local press was asked if he saw a similar personality in the new u s president i don t know he replied is that good or not i m not a politician sometimes i speak too sincerely and might not be polite but i actually never hold grudges against anyone i could be angry again but it s my own personality mr trump and mr prayuth apparently have not talked by telephone a senior thai official said i asked my colleagues and they said not yet they haven t talked yet i have no idea why not we might not be on the top of their priority he said asking not to be identified because he was not authorized to discuss the issue thai government officials heard that rex tillerman the former exxon mobil corp chairman who is now mr

amphibious assault along the gulf near bangkok practice evacuations of noncombatants from multiple locations and stage live firing of combined weaponry adm harris attendance at the opening of cobra gold is clearly a further step toward a renormalization of the security relationship gregory poling an asia analyst with the washington based center for strategic and international studies told the military stars and stripes newspaper i think what pacom is trying to do is send a message that we want to get over this hump thai u s relations appeared to improve slightly in the final years of mr
