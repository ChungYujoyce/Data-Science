administration to call the remarks highly irresponsible if the americans draw their missiles and position guided ammunition onto the target zone on china s territory i think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons maj gen zhu chenghu said in yesterday s editions of the financial times and the asian wall street journal the comments were the most explicit statement of strategic intent by a

university we chinese will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all of the cities east of xian in central china of course the americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of cities will be destroyed by the chinese state department spokesman sean mccormack called the remarks highly irresponsible we hope that these are not the views of the chinese government mr mccormack told reporters the united states is not a threat to china we have a broad and deep relationship in which we try to work closely with the chinese government on a variety of issues and i think that the remarks from that one individual are unfortunate the comments come as the pentagon is prepared to release its annual report to congress on china s military the report according to pentagon officials will be the harshest assessment since 2000 on china s arms buildup which includes a rapid deployment of ships aircraft missiles and other high tech weaponry since 2002 gen zhu told the papers that his comments were personal remarks and not official policy and that he did not believe china and the united states will go to war a pentagon official speaking on background said chinese generals normally express
