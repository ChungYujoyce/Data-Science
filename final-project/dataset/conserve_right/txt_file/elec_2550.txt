stands nearby at the start of the third presidential debate at lynn university in boca raton fla ap romney surges to tie obama screams a wall street journal headline republicans are giddy with excitement can it be after months of trailing the likable president obama could mitt romney be about to pull off the rare defeat of an incumbent it may all come down to who turns up to vote on election day the afl cio is gearing up to get out the vote pulling in more than 128 000 volunteers who will knock on doors man the phone banks and blanket the countryside with flyers the naacp the american legion the american federation of teachers the league of women voters planned parenthood everyone is pushing americans to cast a ballot even so barely a majority of americans will likely vote on november 6 in 2008 57 of our voting age population turned out and that was the highest figure since 1968 it s not an impressive showing for the world s most successful democracy by comparison belgium enjoys voter participation of 86 while france logs in at 77 does it matter yes turnout will certainly matter to president obama even though political savants will claim that based on a slew of studies looking at past presidential contests turnout does not decide the outcome the president s chances may well hinge on how many americans take advantage of democracy s greatest privilege historically analyses of presidential elections have found that the results would not have varied much even if everyone in the country cast a ballot in the words of one respected team of researchers political scientists highton and wolfinger simply put voters differ minimally from all citizens outcomes would not change if everyone voted pullquote this year that may not be true where voters have clashed with non voters in the past is on issues of economic redistribution in 1992 academics highton and wolfinger found voters were measurably more conservative than the population as a whole about whether it is important for the government to provide many more services in areas such as health and education even if it means an increase in spending similarly they found that employment preferences for blacks were more popular among the entire sample 21 percent of whom supported this policy compared to 17 percent of voters the divide is not surprising the left leaning organization fair vote which advocates for broader voter participation cites studies that found that 86 of people with incomes above 75 000 claim to have voted in presidential elections as compared with only 52 of people with incomes under 15 000 it is likely that high earners will be less enthusiastic about redistributing the spoils of their efforts than those at the bottom and receiving end of the income spectrum given that mr obama s sole policy in this campaign has been making the wealthy pay their fair share he has to hope for a larger than normal turnout and for that he must motivate voters fair vote says turnout will depend on voter perceptions of the importance of the choice how close the election is and how much different potential outcomes will affect their lives the obama campaign seems to buy this approach in his convention speech the president warned that in the next four years big decisions will be made in washington on jobs the economy taxes and deficits energy education war and peace decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and on our children s lives for decades to come he also claimed that voters face the clearest choice of any time in a generation the obama campaign hopes these scare tactics will boost turnout and they may prove right in the latest wsj nbc poll 55 of those asked said the election will mean a great deal to them that s quite a jump from the 45 who responded similarly in 2004 perceptions that the race is close a perception furthered by recent polls may also help this is problematic for governor romney on the other hand motivation also derives from enthusiasm for a given candidate romney s performances in the debates have ramped up support for the gop contender while mr obama s four year record leaves his followers uninspired the most striking evidence of the latter is a recent study out from the harvard institute of politics which surveyed young people the youth vote was powerful in electing president obama not because so many voted as popular wisdom has it but because the president won young votes by the highest margin 34 percentage points of any democrat candidate in the past 30 years according to the washington post a recent pew survey shows that 63 of young voters intend to vote that compares with 72 four years ago but young romney supporters seem more determined to cast a ballot 65 say they will vote as opposed to 55 of those in obama s corner the recent wsj nbc poll delivered more bad news for the president the percentage of democrats who express high interest in the election is running at about 75 down from nearly 90 in 2008 by contrast some 85 of republicans are charged up close to the 2008 level president obama will hope for a high turnout with lower income folks swelling the electorate however the politicos may be right how many vote on november 6 may not matter who votes though will make all the difference president obama may find that running against governor romney does not inspire the faithful on the other hand running on his dismal record was never an option get the recap of top opinion commentary and original content throughout the week subscribed you ve successfully subscribed
