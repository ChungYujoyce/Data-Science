the democratic party financed anti trump dossier the fired acting fbi director was at times at the center of the dossier s information flow into the bureau as his colleague agent peter strzok opened a probe into the trump campaign on july 31 2016 justice department senior official bruce ohr became the messenger his wife worked at fusion gps the firm that handled dossier writer christopher steele the former british intelligence officer created the dossier dishing all sorts of felony allegations against president trump and his team that remain publicly unproven today top stories democratic

she s a waste of time as deputy director mr mccabe was among the first at the fbi to receive a briefing from mr ohr at fbi headquarters in august 2016 on mr steele s trump russia collusion charges

allegations mr strzok sent agents to london in september 2016 to hear from the ex moscow posted spy in person author mccabe might have stayed mum on the dossier because the entire matter is now under investigation by justice department inspector general michael horowitz he is the same investigator who accused mr mccabe of lying to agents three times during a probe into how the fbi probed hillary clinton s use of a home computer server while secretary of state in his book mr mccabe is generally dismissive of president trump and his white house staff he depicts rep devin nunes california republican as a conduit for mr trump mr nunes headed the house permanent select committee on intelligence in 2017 18 when he opened a new investigation into how the fbi abused the foreign intelligence surveillance act fisa to obtain warrants he rankled mr mccabe by demanding documents some of which the bureau refused to turn over mr nunes proved that the fbi relied greatly on the dossier a product financed by the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee to investigate the other party mr nunes released a statement tuesday andy mccabe was fired from the fbi for lying and leaking and many of the stories he s telling on his book tour are transparently self serving although i cannot comment on the content of gang of eight briefings it s preposterous to deny that the fbi was investigating donald trump from the moment it opened its investigation in mid 2016 mr mccabe tells an anecdote about the new york times and then white house chief of staff reince priebus that is at odds with mr priebus telling the focus was on the times february 2017 banner headline story it said u s intelligence owned a significant amount of phone records and intercepted communications between the trump campaign and russian intelligence for a year before the november election a sure bombshell except it wasn t true here is how mr mccabe described his encounter with mr priebus at the white house the week after my commitment was questioned reince priebus asked me to speak with reporters to refute a story in the new york times when i told him i could not because doing so would violate the fbi s policy of not confirming or denying fisa coverage he told me that i personally and the fbi as a whole were not being good partners mr priebus tells a far different story as he related to fox news howard kurtz after the times s story ran mr mccabe volunteered to mr priebus that the times story was wrong we want you to know that everything in this new york times story is bull mr priebus quoted mr mccabe as saying mr priebus asked if the fbi would tell the public mr mccabe checked at headquarters and said he could not the next thing mr priebus knows is that the fbi is leaking to cnn that the white house pressed the bureau to knock down the story a story mr mccabe had said was wrong mr priebus wondered if the whole encounter had been a setup later that year then fbi director james comey told the senate select committee on intelligence that the times story was so wrong he immediately warned congressional leaders not to cite it that same committee today hasn t found direct
