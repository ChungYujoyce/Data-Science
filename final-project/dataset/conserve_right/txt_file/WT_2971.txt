democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the networks are using these anonymous claims to pass along damning accusations against president trump that cannot be independently verified the analyst also points out that the society of professional journalists and even the new york times stylebook advise that anonymous sources aren t recommended and are considered a last resort here s exactly what the journalists society recommends consider sources motives before promising anonymity reserve anonymity for sources who may face danger retribution or other harm and have information that cannot be obtained elsewhere explain why anonymity was granted yes well put another way every source who talks to a reporter is promoting the facts and spin that best reflects their agenda when president trump or house speaker nancy pelosi speaks on camera viewers can make up their own minds about how much to trust what is said but when a source hides behind the cloak of anonymity that source s agenda is also hidden from the audience mr d agostino advises ready for a vegan president presidents have done many things before taking office the previous

delve into noteworthy a harris poll once asked 3 300 people if they would mind if a u s president or presidential candidate had a visible tattoo the results 6 out of 10 said they couldn t care less about the presence of ink on the nation s commander in chief meanwhile in korea seems like old times north korea has conducted its 12 weapons test this year firing off a pair of short range projectiles which traveled 230 miles into the east sea according to south korea s joint chiefs of staff make no mistake if there is no change in the current trajectory of u s north korea relations there is only one possible outcome a long range missile or nuclear weapons test by pyongyang that will spark a crisis just like in 2017 the only question would be how president trump would respond says harry j kazianis senior director of korean studies at the center for the national interest a foreign policy think tank north korea has warned time and time again that if there is no mutually acceptable deal on denuclearization by the end of the year they will set out on a new way that new way seems to me what pyongyang always does when it wants attention setting off a crisis that can t be ignored and the best way to do that is early in 2020 test an icbm that can prove once and for all north korea can hit the u s homeland with nuclear weapons he advises meanwhile in new hampshire new
