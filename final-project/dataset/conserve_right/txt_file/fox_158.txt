of staff trigger a firestorm over whether there was a quid pro quo with ukraine rep adam schiff d calif things have just gone from very very bad to much much more rep kevin mccarthy d calif i think

after rivals at the latest democratic debate we aposll ask him what his path to the 2020 nomination plus nancy pelosi and donald trump in their first face off since democrats launched their

about the growing hostilities between the president and the speaker of the house and our power player of the week he found titanic now he wants to solve the mystery of what happened to amelia earhart all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with breaking news president trump announced by tweet last night he aposs backing off his controversial decision to hold the g7 summit next year at his own resort he says the search will now begin for a new site but the president is still under fire even from a growing number of republicans gop congressmen voted by more than 2 1 against his policy in syria white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said the president at a political quid pro quo from usa to ukraine mulvaney later denied he said it and more damaging testimony in the house impeachment investigation in a moment we will talk with the president chief of staff who just flinched when i said that but first let aposs bring in kevin corke with the latest from the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris a precarious pause perhaps describes the tenuous nature of the circumstance on the ground in syria as sporadic skirmishes continue to speckle the region even as we learn much more about the u s strategy for american forces there begin videotape mark esper defense secretary the current game plan is for those forces to reposition into western iraq the ones coming out right that original 1 000 and then two missions one is to help defend iraq and two is to perform a counter isis mission back in washington the impeachment drumbeat reached a fevered pitch as house intelligence committee chair adam schiff interviewed a cascade of trump administration officials but ukraine and a possible quid pro quo tying usa aid to cooperation with a probe into the biden aposs business dealings incredibly the gulf between house democrats and the white house seem to grow when speaker of the house nancy pelosi stormed out of a white house meeting accusing the president of having a meltdown over a bipartisan house vote rebuking his pullout in syria all as the president late saturday rescinded his decision to host next year aposs g7 summit at his resort in miami tweeting based on both media and democrat crazed and irrational hostility we will no longer consider trump national doral miami a reversal that came after withering criticism and accusations of self dealing can you at least understand and acknowledge that the just the appearance of impropriety makes us wince inducing and maybe this is something you maybe want to reconsider mulvaney he got over that a long time ago we absolutely believe this is the best place to have it and we are going to have it there end videotape corke that was then this is now by the way in that tweet chris the president mentioned camp david as a possible location for next year aposs g7 summit it last hosted the g8 back in 2012 chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks from that joining us now for an exclusive interview white house chief of staff mick mulvaney mick welcome back to fox news sunday mulvaney good morning yes i flinched a little bit because that aposs what people are saying that i said but i didn apost say that but i aposm looking forward to the conversation wallace all right let aposs have a conversation mulvaney yes wallace why here aposs my first question why did you say that in that briefing that president trump had ordered a quid po qro ph quid pro quo that investigating the democrats that aid to ukraine depended on investigating the democrats why did you say that mulvaney again that aposs not what i said that aposs what people said i said here aposs what i said i aposll say it again and hopefully people will listen this time there were two reasons that we held up the aid we talked about this at some length the first one was the rampant corruption in ukraine ukraine by the way chris it aposs so bad in ukraine that in 2014 congress passed a law making it making us requiring us to make sure that corruption was moving in the right direction so corruption is a big deal everyone knows it the president was also concerned about whether or not other nations specifically european nations were helping with foreign aid to the ukraine as well we talked about that for quite a while now i did then mention that in the past the president had mentioned for me to time to time about the dnc server he had mentioned the dnc server to other people publicly he even mentioned it to president zelensky in the phone call but it wasn apost connected to the aid and that aposs where i think people got sidetracked this weekend at that press conference wallace but mulvaney two reasons for holding back the aid wallace let me pursue that though mulvaney sure wallace because i believe that anyone listening to what you said in that briefing could come to only one conclusion let aposs play what you said mulvaney sure begin video clip mulvaney did he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the dnc server absolutely no question about that but that aposs it and that aposs what we held up the money reporter what you just described is a quid pro quo it is funding will not flow unless the investigation into the into the democrats apos server happened as well mulvaney we do we do that all the time with foreign policy end video clip wallace you were asked specifically by jonathan karl was investigating democrats one of the conditions for holding up the aide mulvaney yes wallace was that part of the quid pro quo and you said it happens all the time mulvaney yes but go back and watch what i said before that i don apost know if you guys can cue it or not there was a long answer about corruption and a long answer about foreign aid crosstalk wallace no you totally said that mulvaney just like i told you then and then i said the exact same thing i just said now which is that he mentioned in passing yes but the reason that we held back the aid with the two reasons i mentioned and i can prove it to you the aid flowed once we were able to satisfy ourselves that corruption was actually they were doing better with it we got that information from our folks from the conversation with minister ph zelensky and once we were able to establish we had the office of management and budget do research on other countries apos aid to ukraine it turns out they don apost get any lethal aid but they do give a considerable sum of money and nonlethal aid once those two things were cleared the money flowed there was never any connection between the flow of money and the server wallace but mick you know i hate to go through this but you said what you said mulvaney yes wallace and the fact is after that exchange with jonathan karl you were asked another time why the aide was held up what was the condition for the aid and you didn apost mention two conditions you mentioned three conditions and i want to and let aposs listen to all three of them because this you stated it very clearly let aposs listen begin video clip mulvaney three issues for that the corruption in the country whether or not other countries were participating in support of the ukraine and whether or not they were cooperating in an ongoing investigation with our department of justice that aposs completely legitimate end video clip wallace not only did you say that investigating the democrats was one of the three conditions not two that you would just said that you would talk about investigating the democrats was part of the quid pro quo you also said if i may it was part of the justice department investigation into the origins of the russia probe but the fact is that not only did the press think you said it here aposs what a statement that was put out by a senior justice department official if the white house was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation of any investigation at the department of justice that is news to us everybody thinks that that aposs what you said and you didn apost you said right there mulvaney right wallace three points not two mulvaney well and a couple different things you again said just a few seconds ago that i said there was a quid pro quo i never used that language because there is not a quid pro quo but crosstalk wallace you were asked by jonathan karl is you described a quid pro quo and you said that happens all the time mulvaney well and reporters will use their language all the time so my language never said quid pro quo but let aposs get to the heart of the matter go back and look at that list of three things what was i talking about things that was legitimate for the president to do number one it is legitimate for the president to want to know what aposs going on with the ongoing investigation into the server everybody acknowledges that at least i think most normal people do it aposs completely legitimate to ask about that number two it aposs legitimate to tie the aid to corruption it aposs legitimate to tie the aid to foreign aid from other countries that aposs what i was talking about with the three can i see how people took at the wrong way absolutely but i never said there were was quid pro quo because there isn apost again chris you aposve been in these in these briefings you know how back and forth is you know how rapid fire it is look to the facts on the ground things that you can actually sort of certify and what should put this issue to bed is that the money flowed without any connection whatsoever to the dnc server wallace but you in your first answer which i gave you said that aposs why we held up the money first you just said here that it was for two reasons now you aposre acknowledging it was for three reasons if you held up the money for three reasons that was that aposs a quid pro quo mulvaney i am not wallace you got to satisfy us on those now maybe the president backed off that but that was the proposition here mulvaney i aposm not acknowledging there aposs three reasons again let aposs go back wallace you said three reasons mulvaney go back i recognize that go back to what actually happened in the real world and by the way go to the phone call go to the phone call which we aposve released i hope you get a chance to talk about that before the crosstalk wallace i am going to right now mulvaney you go to the phone call the president never mentions the aid at all in the phone call doesn apost say oh by the way i need you to do this this this and this or else the money won apost flow we all know enough about this president that if he feels very strongly about something he aposs going to put that out there directly and that didn apost happen i recognize that folks that i didn apost speak clearly maybe on thursday folks misinterpreted what i said but the facts are absolutely clear and they are there for everyone to see wallace in the briefing you flatly denied any connection between holding up the aide and investigating joe biden and his son right mulvaney correct wallace ok in his phone call with president zelensky however president trump specifically mentions the bidens do me a favor trump lawyer rudy giuliani pushed all summer for ukraine to announce it was investigating burisma the company that paid hunter biden and a former nsc official testified this week before congress john bolton was so disturbed by the way you are directing people to work with rudy giuliani he said quote i am not part of whatever drug deal he was speaking metaphorically mulvaney right wallace of whatever drug deal sondland the u s diplomat and mulvaney are cooking up no question you are following the president aposs orders but your fingerprints are all over linking aid to ukraine with investigating the bidens mulvaney ok no that aposs not true let aposs go i aposll take one of those of the time which is the bolton thing because i read that and i was surprised because john bolton never complained to me about it no one at nsc ever complained to me about anything that was going on i didn apost see sondland aposs testimony this week because none of us have seen sondland aposs testimony which is another story entirely i did get a chance to read his opening statement when he said that bolton never complained to him fiona hill never got a chance to complain to him i think you need to put sort of wallace wait a minute fiona hill is the one who testified that aposs the quote came from her mulvaney who never complained to sondland about what was happening when it was happening wallace no she complained to her boss john bolton mulvaney who did what wallace who said who told her to go immediately to a lawyer mulvaney right wallace at nsc and to complain about it mulvaney who works for john bolton yet john bolton didn apost go say anything to anybody doesn apost that raise a red flag but let aposs go back to the first thing you talk about which is the president aposs phone call because at the end of the day that aposs what this is really about right that aposs why we are here was the president phone call with ukraine and you aposve done the same thing and i don apost blame you personally done the same thing with many news outlets have done you said do me a favor and then immediately to the bidens go look at the transcript of the phone conversation wallace i have mulvaney it aposs do me a favor take a look at the dnc server then he talks about corruption in the ukraine he talks about rudy giuliani the president of the ukraine gets on and he talks about a close cooperation between the countries he talks about corruption he talks about getting a new ambassador to the u s and the president gets on and talks about bill barr the president talks about a new ambassador between our countries and then the very end of that passage mentions the bidens everybody else puts it on tv and says do me a favor look at the bidens and that aposs simply not factually accurate go look at the transcript yourself wallace let aposs turn to syria defense secretary esper overnight has said that those thousand troops who are being moved out of syria are moving to iraq they are not as the president claimed coming home mulvaney well they will eventually i think wallace eventually mulvaney the quickest way to get them out of danger was to get them into iraq keep in mind what you are facing here and i think literally the number was 28 you had 28 u s special forces between tens of thousands of soldiers on one side and tens of thousands of soldiers on the other side and i hope that when we release the letter this week it put it put to the bed this nonsense about how the president supposedly green lighted this invasion nothing would be further from the truth and i think the letter made that painfully clear wallace no no the letter has been released mulvaney it has been but i hope now people realize and it was listen this is what we deal with this administration all the time whether it aposs on the impeachment or it aposs on the ukraine or excuse me on syria is people ph say oh there aposs a green light the president green lighted this and that aposs what the press reports and then we put out facts that absolutely put that to bed and no one comes back and says well we were wrong about that go back to the beginning of the impeachment how did that start oh there were supposedly a transcript with eight references to the bidens and a quid pro quo on foreign aid absolutely false no one ever went back and said we were wrong about that either wallace ok mulvaney so wallace i do i aposm running out of time and i do have several more questions mulvaney lots of things to talk about wallace yes we do i just want to go back to the briefing for one minute after the briefing and all the blowback and the criticism did you ever offer or think to offer the president your resignation mulvaney no absolutely not wallace was that ever discussed mulvaney absolutely positively not wallace ok mulvaney no i aposm listen i aposm very happy working there did i have the perfect press conference no but again the facts were on our side i didn apost get a chance to talk about some of the stuff i wanted to talk about at that press conference which was for example senator menendez sending a letter to the ukraine saying if you don apost cooperate with mueller there will be repercussions for you i haven apost had a chance to talk about talk about a quid pro quo joe biden admitting that he said he was going to cut off funding unless the prosecutor got fired if that aposs not a quid pro quo i don apost know what it is so i haven apost a chance at the presser to do everything i wanted to but i still think i aposm doing a pretty good job as the chief of staff and i think the president agrees wallace there seems to be a growing number of republicans in congress who are if not breaking with the president distancing themselves from the president you had mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader who wrote a scathing article about syria this week i aposm going to put up one of these quotes withdrawing u s forces from syria is a grave strategic mistake and a strategic nightmare for our country house republicans voted against the trump policy in syria 129 60 more than 2 1 and i talked to a very well connected republican in washington this week somebody whose name you would know well who says that if the house votes to impeach and it gets to a trial in the senate there is now a 20 percent chance he believes obviously it aposs just an estimate now a 20 percent chance enough republicans will vote with the democrats to remove the president mulvaney oh that aposs just absurd but let aposs deal with the issue of syria wallace no let aposs deal with the issue of whether republicans you aposre losing your support mulvaney same thing this comment about a 20 percent chance the person clearly doesn apost know what they aposre talking about but talk about the reaction of the republicans and democrats up on the hill to the decision in syria president knew that was going to happen he recognizes the fact that it aposs not a politically popular in this town to make the decision that he made to move the troops out of syria he ran on it he told people he would do this if he won and he aposs doing it now because he won wallace forgive me for interrupting we are running out of time i just want to ask you though is there any concern that the president is losing those support of republicans in congress mulvaney no the president is extraordinary popular back home more popular in the swing districts now that impeachment has started crosstalk wallace i aposm talking about here in washington mulvaney yes but they they have to go home eventually as well so no do i have to understand that there are certain folks especially the neoconservative wing of the party who are upset about the syria decision i absolutely do the president knew that was going to happen again elections have consequences on foreign policy that aposs where we started this conversation and that thankfully they do wallace two final questions one a one of the people who was testifying in congress this week in the house impeachment investigation also said that he was so concerned about hunter biden getting that job in ukraine in 2015 that he went to the vice president staff biden was then vice president and said this looks really bad and that he was turned away your reaction mulvaney good i aposm surprised i haven apost heard about it since my guess is if it happened ph during the trump administration the news media would have reported on it at very next day wallace i aposm asking you about it sir mulvaney i know you are and i appreciate that i aposm hearing about it for the first time i look forward to finding out more about it it aposs the first i aposve heard of that piece of information wallace you had not heard it aposs been reported widely in the last 48 hours mulvaney no i aposve been busy in the last 48 hours chris wallace ok well let me ask you of something else maybe you don apost know this mulvaney yes wallace but president trump has decided after he put you out there in that briefing mulvaney yes wallace to announce doral he is back he aposs decided that he aposs not going to hold it at doral he blames it on quote the hostile media and their democratic partners but again he was getting hammered by republicans so why did he cave mulvaney i we talked about it at great length last night and it aposs not lost on me that if we made the decision on thursday we wouldn apost have had the press conference on thursday regarding regarding everything else but that aposs fine but we did talk about it last night and i honestly think what he is out in the tweet was real the president isn apost one for holding back his feelings and his emotions about something he was honestly surprised at the level of pushback at the end of the day you know he still considers himself to be in the hospitality business and he saw an opportunity to take the biggest leaders from around the world and he wanted to put the absolute best show the best visit that he possibly could and he was very comfortable doing it at doral and i think we aposre all surprised at the level of pushback i think it aposs the right decision to change we aposll have to find someplace else and my guess is we aposll find someplace else that the media won apost like either for another reason wallace i just have to pick up you say he considers himself in the hospitality business mulvaney sure wallace he aposs the president of the united states mulvaney yes but he aposs that aposs his background it aposs like i used to be in the real estate business i don apost know what you used to do before you were in the media wallace nothing that aposs all i aposve ever done mulvaney yes but he wanted to put on a show he wanted to take care of folks that aposs the business he aposs in the hotel business or at least he was before he was the president wallace does he understand forget the media does he understand that it looked lousy mulvaney well i think he knows he thinks people think it looks lousy could we have put on an excellent g7 at doral absolutely will we end up putting on an excellent g7 someplace else yes we will wallace mick thank you thanks for coming in always good to talk with you sir mulvaney it aposs always good to be here thank you sir wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss where the house impeachment investigation stands now and new evidence u s officials were concerned as far back as 2015 about hunter biden aposs business dealings in ukraine commercial break begin video clip trump for three straight years radical democrats have been trying to overthrow the results of a great great election maybe maybe the greatest election in the history of our country end video clip wallace president trump rallying supporters in dallas against the house impeachment investigation and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz fox news political analyst juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman and from the wall street journal kimberley strassel author of the new book resistance at all cost well congressman chaffetz let me start with you how damaging do you think the last week has been to president trump testimony from a number of current and former national security officials that the president had rudy giuliani aposs personal lawyer running off the books operations when it came to ukraine and whatever you make of them mick mulvaney aposs comments about a quid pro quo jason chaffetz former congressman r ut well i wish there was video to show of what was going on in these so called impeachment hearings because they haven apost been open and transparent i think what adam schiff did when he lied he physically lied in front of the committee when he had a chance to go and talk about that i don apost think they aposre laying a glove on donald trump inside the beltway there aposs a frenzy out in the heartland in the dallas texases of the world it aposs not moving the meter at all wallace congresswoman harman how strong is the case that aposs being built against the president jane harman former congresswoman d calif well i aposm not in the room either but to be clear these are depositions they aposre not hearings there are various people were talking under oath republicans and democrats are in the room the questions are primarily being asked by counsel but republicans and democrats had equal time to ask questions crosstalk wallace ok but enough about the process what do you think of the substance harman so you know the substance leaks out and it aposs in the press but i think it hasn apost been a good week for the president two good things happened one is i think sort of kind of good week he backed off on the china tariffs that aposs a big deal because the economy was about to it seems to me soft into a point that it really hurt him but the other sort of kind of big deal is our troops are moving to iraq they are not leaving the area so there will be some counter isis movement that does not mean i think his syria decision made any sense i don apost think so i agree with mitch mcconnell wallace maybe the biggest surprise in my interview with mick mulvaney is he doesn apost seem to have known about the revelations this week about hunter biden hunter biden finally answered questions about his business dealings in ukraine take a look begin video clip interviewer if your last name wasn apost biden do you think you would have been asked to be on the board of burisma hunter biden son of joe biden i don apost know i don apost know probably not i don apost think that there aposs a lot of things that wouldn apost have happened in my life that if my last name wasn apost biden end video clip wallace but kim we also learned that one of those state department officials who testified before the house impeachment investigation this week was so disturbed in 2015 when hunter biden started working for this ukrainian energy company burisma and that at least the appearance if nothing else at least the appearance that it seemed to be self dealing that he went to the vice president himself because biden of course was then vice president and said this really looks bad and he was turned away how big a deal kimberley strassel the wall street journal editorial board yes i mean i think it is a big deal it surprised no one though because prior to the press deciding that this was a whole issue that we aposre not allowed to talk about joe biden did nothing wrong they were writing all the stories about this and quoting former officials who worked for joe biden saying they were uneasy with the situation and they didn apost like that it was happening and so i mean the issue here to me has always been people like to use the word corrupt the issue was always been the appearance question right it aposs the question of whether or not hunter biden was profiting off of his father aposs position you don apost really need to go much further than that and it is hurting joe biden out there with primary voters wallace let aposs pick up on that one because the president who doesn apost like the back down did back down overnight and say well ok i aposm not going to hold the summit next june the g7 summit in doral his own resort there was really a lot of squealing about it from republicans and democrats who said it appeared to be this kind of self dealing do you think one of the reasons that he may have done it is because it would certainly it seemed to blunt his case against joe biden juan williams political analyst i think it did i think the cancellation is a tiny step in the right direction but again this is so blatant and over the top self dealing on the part of the president putting his self interest or as mick mulvaney said to you his history as a man in the hospitality business about the national interest i think that then speaks to behold ukrainian deal but on a larger point i think it aposs one of the campaign promises that he broke he said he was going to divest himself of all business interests so this cancellation is a step in the right direction but think for a second about the idea that he has no problem appointing jared kushner his son in law as some kind of emissary to the middle east and he aposs dealing with the crown prince of saudi arabia a man who aposs killed journalists and making excuses i think this is again this is this is not normal wallace that aposs just a decision and as mick mulvaney said about rudy giuliani the president gets to decide who he wants to do his business that aposs just the policy issue williams i think that again you aposre putting your family in positions of critical policy so it aposs apart from the normal operation of foreign policy in the country it aposs like the shadow foreign policy that was run by giuliani but again to my mind you look at doral the reason i say it aposs part of a pattern chris is doral was a struggling property here is the president saying here i aposm going to help my own business and forever branded as the prestigious pot because of the g7 was held there wallace kim strassel well look this is a very complicated subject i aposm glad that he decided not to do it because i do think it blunts his message about the appearance of conflict with hunter biden there is a very complicated discussion to be had about whether or not donald trump aposs business empire has actually profited from his business ph or more likely as much of the reporting has shown he aposs probably taken a hit i mean there aposs good evidence that his bookings are down out a lot of his places and some wallace nobody made him run for president strassel no no i aposm not saying i mean i aposm just saying i aposm not like arguing oh poor president i aposm just saying look at the numbers you can apost just run around and say oh you know the president is profiting off of his presidency like i think you just have to look at the facts yes wallace but kim it aposs about profit strassel look at the facts wallace the emoluments clause says you can apost take any compensation from a foreign government strassel well we have never had a discussion in the court system about what the emoluments clause actually inaudible williams well i aposm just saying that aposs what it says wallace well there are actually a few court cases right now harman we aposre having it now wallace so we aposll see all right we aposve got to strassel we aposre going to find out wallace folks i aposve got to save time for you for the next panel we have to take a break here up next mayor pete buttigieg joins us here in washington after a debate that has some democrats saying he can compete with joe biden as the centrist voice of the party commercial break wallace coming up mayor pete buttigieg hot off the debate stage where he went toe to toe with his democratic rivals mayor pete buttigieg d ind presidential candidate this is why people here in the midwest are so frustrated with washington in general your signature senator is to have a plan for everything except this end video clip wallace we aposll ask him what aposs his path to the nomination commercial break wallace pete buttigieg is trying to get back into the top tier of 2020 democratic candidates and a strong performance in this week aposs debate paid off with more than 1 million in campaign contributions in the first 24 hours after the debate joining us now is the mayor of south bend indiana and mayor welcome back buttigieg good to be with you wallace let aposs start with your latest poll numbers in the realclearpolitics average of recent surveys you aposre in fourth place nationally at 5 8 percent fourth in iowa with 13 percent and fourth in new hampshire at 8 7 percent as a candidate from the midwest and also looking at those numbers don apost you have to finish in the top at least two or three in iowa or you aposre done buttigieg i think it aposs certainly the case that a strong performance in iowa is going to be critical to us winning the nomination and that aposs what we aposre building toward we aposve got a terrific ground game there over 22 i believe field offices now and 100 organizers and i think a message that aposs really connecting with iowans you know democrats there first and foremost of course want to know that we can defeat and replace president trump also want to know how the policies we aposre putting forward are going to affect their lives and whether it aposs medicare for all who want it or the vision we aposre putting forward on any of a number of issues we find that it aposs resonating but even now there are so many iowans who maybe have it narrowed down to a top three or so but are taking their time evaluating their choices and we aposve got our work cut out for us to close the deal between now and the caucus wallace you have stalled to some degree in the polls as we just pointed out at least nationally ever since that terrible police shooting in south bend indiana this summer and folks noticed a more aggressive performance by you in this last debate taking on elizabeth warren on medicare for all tulsi gabbard on troops in syria and beto o aposrourke on gun buybacks take a look at you begin video clip buttigieg your signature senator is to have a plan for everything except this respectfully congresswoman i think that is dead wrong i don apost need lessons from you on courage political or personal end video clip wallace was that a conscious effort to jumpstart your campaign buttigieg well these are also topics i aposm very passionate about when it comes to what is being done to not just the middle east for example but to american credibility the fact that right now people who put their lives on the line trusting that the united states would have their back and are now betrayed the fact that u s troops in the field feel that their honor has been stolen from them by their commander in chief how can you not be fired up about something like that and this is the season for us to lay out what we care about what we aposre passionate about and what aposs different among each of the candidates and i want to make sure there aposs no question in any voter aposs mind how their life would be different under my presidency than if any of the others were to be elected wallace well one of the distinctions you drew sharply is you said that 2021 if a democrat is elected president the the country can make historic gains on health care and immigration and guns but not you said if they push too far and promise too much do you think that some of the solutions that are being offered whether it aposs on climate change medicare for all by senators warren and sanders are too drastic buttigieg i think that we have a chance to build an american majority around bold action but it is the case that we could wreck that majority through purity tests look take the example of this medicare question i aposm proposing medicare for all who want it it means we create a version of medicare everybody can get access to it and if you get if you want to keep your private plan we aposre ok with that i think that aposs a better policy than kicking people off of their plan but i also think that it aposs something that more americans can get behind and when you think about the condition our country aposs going to be in when this presidency comes to an end one way or the other when you think about how torn apart by politics we aposre going to be how polarized and divided this country is this to me is not a political question it aposs a question of governing the good news is we can govern in a very bold and forward leading direction but we aposve got to make sure we do it in a way that moves toward unifying rather than further polarizing the american people wallace not surprisingly the left is firing back at you when elizabeth warren said that she will not participate in big fundraisers even if she is the democratic nominee against donald trump in next fall you said this let aposs put it on the screen we are not going to beat him trump with pocket change here aposs how congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez responded small dollar grassroots campaigns aka what buttigieg insults here as pocket change out fundraised him by millions our nation aposs leaders should be working to end the era of big money politics not protect it so what do you have to say to aoc buttigieg well first of all you don apost go from mayor of south bend to a competitive presidential candidate without knowing a thing or two about grassroots campaigning my campaign is fueled by the contributions of almost 600 000 individual donors and most of those are small contributions what i aposm saying is that we can apost go into this fight against donald trump with one hand tied behind our back look the president of the united states and his allies just raised 125 million they will pull out all of the stops to stay in power and i think we have a responsibility to the country to make sure that we go into this fight as democrats with everything that we aposve got and not unilaterally disarming we indeed need to end the era of big money politics that aposs why campaign finance reform is so important and it will never happen as long as the folks currently in charge stay there wallace the last time you and i talked was in august and i pointed out to you perhaps not too charitably that you were at zero percent in the polls among african americans there aposs a new poll out in the last few days you aposre now at two percent support among african americans when we last talked you you you described a big outreach to minority communities the african american community why isn apost it working buttigieg look for me this isn apost about the polls this is about making sure that wallace well in the end it is about the polls buttigieg but in order to do well you need to deserve to do well and we aposre focusing on the substance of what i have to offer voters want to know how their lives will be different and in the case of african american voters they want to know what my agenda is for black americans we aposre putting forward the most comprehensive plan of any candidate to tackle systemic racism in this country it aposs everything from empowering black entrepreneurs and fueling business development to making sure we deal with discrimination in housing and in health to cutting incarceration in this country by 50 percent because we know that the criminal justice system disproportionately harms african americans we need to continue making that case it aposs extremely well received whenever i have a chance to offer it up but there are a lot of voters who are still sizing up their options who need to feel like they know you and our job is to do that in a short amount of time wallace i want to press down on this just a little bit because you talk about needing to deserve it and voters trying to understand who you are you were supposed to attend a big fundraiser in chicago on friday and one of the hosts was the same city attorney who worked very hard to block release of this video of police shooting laquan mcdonald the lawyer backed out of of the fundraiser he also donated 5 600 to your campaign particularly at a time when african americans are trying to get to know you isn apost that the kind of mistake mayor that you can apost afford to make buttigieg well this came to my attention in the morning and within an hour it had been taken care of look the situation there and justice and transparency for laquan mcdonald is much more important to me than a campaign contribution and we did the right thing as soon as it came to my attention wallace can you understand where people would say well this is a guy who wants our vote but he was going to take was taking money and was attending a fundraiser being held by this city attorney buttigieg and then we took care of it look i think the biggest question on voter aposs minds is how is my life going to be different especially when that sun comes up that first day after donald trump is president and the agenda that i aposm putting forward the the issues that i want to tackle i think will speak to black voters and to all voters who are seeking a better life in this country and seeking to turn the page from the chaos and the corruption that we aposre living under right now wallace mayor buttigieg thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you safe travels on the campaign trail sir buttigieg good to be with you wallace when we come back turkey agrees to a temporary ceasefire in syria we aposll ask our sunday group what it means for u s interests in the middle east commercial break begin video clip donald trump president the kurds are very happy turkey is very happy the united states is very happy and you know what civilization is very happy it aposs a great thing for civilization end video clip wallace president trump with an optimistic assessment of the cease fire brokered by vice president pence this week in turkey and we aposre back now with the panel congresswoman harman what you think of the deal that the u s made with turkey harman i think sadly pence and his advisors were scrambling on the plane to come up with some kind of announcement that would make sense and i salute pence for trying however i don apost think he succeeded i think a deal under these circumstances was impossible and where we are now is the ceasefire is not holding the kurds our allies who lost 11 000 people on the battlefield we lost six are being massacred there is now a vacuum being filled by isis by syria the syrian government and by russia and guess what israel our our deepest ally in the region is now surrounded by iran on the syrian border by iran making the missiles from libya from lebanon smarter on the lebanese border and by iran and tehran and this is creating an existential threat and leading to really dangerous circumstances and finally isis is regrouping and the isis fighters that are regrouping are from europe and they will get through the turkish border and attack in europe wallace congressman chaffetz even a lot of staunch trump supporter aposs inside the republican party have real problems with the agreement and and the actions by the president in northern syria your thoughts jason chaffetz contributor i think the agreement was good although temporary we aposll see how it stands above and beyond the last few days but the president did the right thing he did exactly what he was campaigning on doing i believe if you if you can apost go and fight and win the war then you bring them home and you know what if the senate and the house feel so strongly then pass a piece of legislation don apost just do some little slap on the hand and right an op ed and say oh tisk tisk mr president wallace you you aposre talking about mitch mcconnell chaffetz yes i aposm saying that they should actually pass a war powers authorization and do that put on your big boy pants and do that but the president aposs doing the right thing wallace and then there was the meeting on syria that was held at the white house this week here aposs the indelible picture of it it ended with president trump calling speaker pelosi depending on the account you heard either a third rate or a third grade politician not a complement in either case and pelosi getting up as you see here and walking out here aposs what they said afterwards begin video clip trump that crazy nancy she is crazy pelosi i pray for the president all the time and i tell them that i pray for his safety and that of his family the now we have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president end video clip wallace juan not only can apost they legislate in congress anymore they aposve apparently can apost even stand to be in each other aposs presence williams no i mean it aposs to me what aposs key here is that i think you see from the house vote that even republicans were shocked out of their silence in in responding to president trump by his decision wallace you think you aposd vote against the president aposs syria policy williams i think you said it earlier 129 republicans voted with the democratic majority so it clearly showed there is bipartisan outrage at allowing our allies the kurds to be slaughtered by the turks in this way with response in response to your question about the meeting i think that nancy pelosi chuck schumer speaker of the house the minority leader in the senate were strong enough to confront the president in the meeting to get in his face and say this is the wrong policy and the president responded with elementary school you know schoolyard bullying third rate politician nancy pelosi is no third rate politician by anybody aposs measure but i think the key here is the policy chris the policy is the problem and to be clear and i think this is in response that congressman chaffetz point this is not about bringing troops home there are only about 150 troops involved the president just sent 2 000 to saudi arabia so i mean to me this is about the president pulling our influence out of there allowing our allies to be slaughtered and compromising america aposs integrity and promise to our allies it aposs a foreign policy quagmire wallace kim i wanted you to address a different aspect of that which is that both sides talk about being able to walk and chew gum at the same time trying to get some things done the one thing they particularly talk about is passing the usmca the u s trade deal with mexico and canada can they get anything done between the impeachment investigation the bitterness from that and the fact that we aposre you could say we aposre all already in a full fledged campaign certainly by the end of the year we aposre in a full fledged campaign strassel right i mean whatever happened in that meeting and the dueling narratives it almost doesn apost matter because what it exposes is what you just said is that when democrats decided they were going to go forward with this impeachment inquiry it created a new dynamic in washington and this is one of the consequences of it i do not see how anyone gets anything done while they aposre in the middle of i mean think of it from the trump white house perspective they aposre trying to remove him from office and that just does make it a very difficult circumstance in which he then sit down shake hands play nice i agree everyone would want there to be progress and i think that the best thing the trump white house could do would be to fact to kind of rise above it and talk about governing and talk about what they aposve accomplished and what they want to accomplish but i aposm not quite sure that is going to be the dynamic going forward harman government funding wallace congresswoman i aposve got less than a minute left does impeachment and politics poison everything does anything get done in washington between now and november 2020 harman well that was the history of the clinton impeachment everything stopped but government funding runs out on november 21st in the middle of whatever it is that we aposre going to see and i think it would be tragic if once again we put federal workers and and the economy through that nightmare so the congress has to pass the budget bills there has to be progress and i think the leadership of congress somehow will find a way forward wallace so the most they can do is keep the government running harman keep the government running right wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week trying to solve the 82
