day mr steele sent two sets of dossier copies to mr simpson who provided them to mr kramer on nov 29 shortly thereafter reporters started contacting mr kramer mr kramer said he doesn t know who tipped

of buzzfeed which he did over the christmas holidays buzzfeed published that copy on jan 10 2017 it forever changed the trump transition and presidency as the sensational charges permeated the news media and were endorsed by some democrats mr steele also urged mr kramer to brief cnn s carl bernstein this meeting also was consequential cnn broke the story that mr comey had briefed president elect trump on the dossier adding weight to the document both of the meetings occurred at mr steele s request mr kramer said mr steele also endorsed providing a dossier copy to the washington post besides buzzfeed and cnn mr kramer briefed and or provided dossier copies to mother jones david corn the washington post s tom hamburger and fred hiatt npr s bob little mcclatchy news service s peter stone and greg gordon abc news reporter brian ross the wall street journal s alan cullison and the guardian newspaper mr kramer testified that the buzzfeed posting shocked him this wasn t supposed to happen this way mr steele told him mr kramer admitted that he lied to mr steele by saying he had played no role initially i panicked and then i felt i could try to do more good and by maintaining contact with mr steele which i thought might end if i had told him he testified he said he continued communicating with mr steele for two more months mr kramer a russia analyst who worked at the mccain institute in washington at the time also made sure that the obama administration knew about the dossier he provided a copy to celeste wallander senior director of russian affairs at the white house

department on ukraine and its political turmoil and threats from russia according to a 2017 declaration in a london court mr steele came to washington in september and october 2016 and met with reporters from the new york times the washington post yahoo news the new yorker and cnn only yahoo produced a story that september mr steele spoke with mr corn via skype days before the election as an unidentified spy source he expressed frustration in the story that the fbi had not moved against mr trump the big difference between the pre and postelection press briefings is that after the election reporters received the actual dossier his dossier told of an extensive conspiracy between the trump campaign and moscow in his court declaration he spoke only of possible coordination a federal judge in florida dismissed mr gubarev s libel lawsuit against buzzfeed ruling that the news website had a right to publish because the government was using the dossier the steele declaration came in mr gubarev s lawsuit against him in london val gurvits mr gubarev s u s attorney said one thing is clear from mr kramer s testimony my surprise stems from the fact that steele claims that it was not his intent to publish the dossier he told the washington times while at the same time he admits to meeting with every reporter under the sun and discussing the dossier with them it is obvious to me that his intent was to make the allegations public by any means possible mr steele is likely still investigating mr trump daniel jones a former aide to sen dianne feinstein california democrat told the fbi that he had raised 50 million from liberal donors to continue investigating the president among those he hired w
