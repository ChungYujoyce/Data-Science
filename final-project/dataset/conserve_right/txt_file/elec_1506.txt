to hear when joe biden cratered in his first official run at the white house in 1987 it was because of a series of borrowed speech passages hand gestures and even biographical details no he didn tderive from a family of coal miners as he once claimed nor was he the first in his clan to ever attend college he lifted those details from a speech by u k labor politician neil kinnock the deceptions nonetheless revealed a political truth ronald reagan had peeled off blue collar voters from the democratic party and it would take a relatable regular sounding joe to lure them back americans may tell themselves they seek candidates who lead but in reality they re more likely to reward politicians like biden who follow where public tastes have already gone you generally don t serve in multiple tiers of elected office for his 47 years longer than pete buttigieg beto o rourke and several other democratic presidential candidates have been alive by getting out ahead of voters comfort zones you get there by being a weather vane joe biden is a political weather vane covered in rust he ll creak in the direction of the prevailing winds eventually apologetically if need be but don t expect the man to point toward some bold new future it s both his main selling point and greatest weakness during the late 1980s and early 90s when the country was at the exhausted end of athree decade risein violent crime biden was right there putting his fingerprints all over what would become america s mass incarceration machine he co sponsored the anti drug abuse act which included much tougher penalties for crack cocaine than for powder cocaine and lamented that 6 out of every 10 criminals who are arrested on drug charges have their cases dropped now that even a law and order republican president ispushing throughcriminal justice reform uncle joe is characterizing his role in the crack powder disparity as a big mistake biden absolutely will follow not lead on legalizing marijuana whichtwo out of three americans andall 12presidential candidates immediately behind him in national polls now support even while serving in the white house with choom gang emeritus barack obama the then veep was still using old timey prohibitionist language calling pot a gateway drug think of every time american public opinion over the past half century swung toward a public policy hysteria many would eventually regret and you ll see joe there zelig like flashing his choppers iraq war check the as characterized by vox s dara lind disastrous forgotten 1996 lawthat created today s immigration problem yep patriot act he s been dining out on that one foryears those of us wary of government power shudder at the sight of politicians with a demonstrated eagerness to wield it when the masses get rowdy and yet biden s finger in the wind ideological pliability can have its uses too most famously in 2012 when he gingerly led his party to the conclusion on marriage equality its voting members had long since held this less than two decades after of course voting for the notoriousdefense of marriage act biden s current high standing in thepollsis a sight to behold for those of us who remember hissix feeble previous flirtationswith the oval office it suggests that in a cycle in which democrats are prioritizing electability more than inany recent election it s precisely joe s rust that makes him attractive with the exception of thevanishingnever trump rump just about every right of center political and policy grouping i m aware of is gearing up for 18 months of trench warfareagainst incipient socialism if trump doesn t win the once trump averse glenn beck recentlywarned we are officially at the end of the country as we know it in a campaign that has already zoomed from medicare for all to the green new deal to even slavery reparations with vertigo inducing speed who among the recognizable half of the democratic field seemsleastlikely to hoist the red banner rust is not after all a useful lubricant for revolution while sen elizabeth warren d mass is out there unveiling giant and costly new policy proposals every 48 hours or so biden just waves off any such commitments sayinghe doesn t have the time to completely lay out all the details of his plans in a political moment so weird that donald trump is president and bernie sanders damn neartook overthe democratic party it may seem counterintuitive to bet on a politician who works so hard at coloring inside the lines but two party systems tend to resemble pendulums after four years of comparative madness maybe americans are looking for a typical politician unprincipled and pandering sure but at least predictable and slow this article originally appeared in thelosangelestimes

cannabis is the one thing donald trump could do to secure his re election it would steal the thunder of several democrat contenders and leave biden completely in the dust and as an added bonus to the president cause heads to explode again fuckin a and the really fun part is trump would be doing so as the law and order candidate to qualify for schedule one a substance must not have any medicinal uses so pulling the devil weed is just obeying the law while that would be a good and logical thing to do no one is voting on that issue or on most of the things the democrats are running on after four years of comparative madness maybe americans are looking for a typical politician unprincipled and pandering sure but at least predictable and slow my exact reasons for firing up a write in campaign for perhaps the most successful progressive candidate we ve ever had fdr now a lot of people might have a problem voting for a liberal who effected so much change and not for the better in our political system but rolling government back to merely fdr level size and scope would actually be an improvement on the current situation and i can absolutely guarantee you that a president fdr will not be introducing big new plans for expanding government as the rest of the field are plotting and truthfully i m not wedded to the idea that it must be fdr i would as readily vote for teddy roosevelt or kennedy doesn t matter or really any dead politician at all over the ones we ve got now sure unless you add in all the laws that were struck down by the s c and over look removing citizens and their families form their homes and locking them up in camps he s policies were more in line with national socialism worried he might come back to finish the job adans you say that as if the rest of his policies were better they weren t progressives as history shows like the gulags or the camps they also over look the fact that fdr s new deal ss medicare and medicaid and going broke in real time i read a left of center leaning economist review of mmt this past weekend one of the progressive economists promoting mmt uses chattel slavery as an example it is in a model of how printing money will work while curbing hyperinflation i ll bet he wet that finger first yeah you ve got to if you want to give someone the old rusty weather vane tail dragger joe vs king kumquat which one would have patted ghost on the head america needs to know biden is far from my first choice however if he ends up getting the democratic nomination all serious libertarians must vote for him as flawed as he is he d be a dramatic improvement over the current version of the gop which is turning the country into a combination of nazi germany and the handmaid s tale d for effort obl you say this all the time but never give examples of why you think that give me some examples of why you think that being a satirist of variable talents i must say obl doesn t need to validate his presuppositions and he does have a tough job here as many of us know what his talents can be and therefore want moar of it every time in his case more is always less but everyone is entitled to his own rice bowl joe biden rusty weather vane joe biden more like rusty trombone or a rusty venture i ll be short frank and very rude joe biden is a fucking ass hole fuck you ass hat frank is a short little rude fucker or is it rude little short fucker little rude short fucker i d imagine it depends on whether he s fucking rudes or shorts a fucking rude little shorty thank you for your replies joe biden neutralizes the two biggest negatives that trump has going for him one hes also been very wrong about nearly every policy and two he s older than trump biden was on the wrong side of busing for christsake he s also a plagiarist so he neutralizes trumps lieing the idea of biden is what s polling well the second he opens his mouth people will remember what a clown the guy is and just think he s the best they have not over the top crazy mofo aka least worst electable that s probably the most depressing part he s the best of the dems and the gop hasn t even got a best has no intention of entertaining any entrants other than the incumbent let s just agree they all suck i often hear how we need the right person to come along and bring us together and lead us down x or y pathway i believe that ship has sailed if any of the great ones washington madison jefferson lincoln were to appear today they would absent anything like slavery or having a kept woman be excoriated for any number of reasons no man woman xi or xer on swooping in on horseback can ever hope to herd the pack of wild cats we and society in general have become remember too that her referred to obama as a clean negro classy relatable regular sounding joe his main talent appearing relatable and regular despite being a guy that has aimed for nothing but political office since adulthood after how many decades people are still buying the act 1987 was 3 decades ago and he was already well enough established in the establishment to make an initially credible run for president i mean you got the first sorta mainstream democrat who is articulate and bright and who isn t all radical and intersectional and is a clean nice looking guy i mean that s a story board man he is old white and male so he is racist sexist and an oppressor q e d i can understand why democrats would be hesitant to take a risk on a diverse candidate when faced with the prospect of trump getting 4 more years to shark week the country but i seriously question the premise of joe s electability he s four years older than trump his principal character trait is being a gaffe machine he touches people inappropriately every public appearance in this campaign has been what a surprise gaffe prone he and bernie need to do the next grumpy old man sequel and get out of the way no country for old men such are our times the gaffe machine will eventually take the electable sheen off of old joe but it may not happen until after he s won the nomination and then he d have to run against the guy with the best words clinton was leading obama in the 2007 polls before the primaries started i suspect old joe may be in the same situation and someone else could break out they are all a nightmare in one way or another anyway things will tighten up once the dem clown car empties of candidates and most of them go back to their ass sniffing lobbyist or politician jobs but he s kicking the shit out of everyone in the polls right now and would instantly bring the upper midwest back into the dem fold because he s probably the only candidate they have who doesn t hate working class white people it s hard to figure out how to appeal to people who think a cheesy grifter with gold toilets is their savior there is plenty of time for creepy uncle joe to something really really stupid sniff the wrong hair grab the wrong shoulders plenty of time according to the media nothing to see here move along his 2007 racist rant in iowa there s less than one percent of the population of iowa that is african american there is probably less than four of five percent that are minorities what is in washington so look it goes back to what you start off with what you re dealing with joe biden 2007 he goes on to posit that african americans do not talk to their children or have anything to do with their lives biden is done game over not if he s the only viable choice vs trump or any other republican that past history bs only comes out of the closet when it s needed finger otherwise he gets a big ole pass and it will haunt him only if his opponent has a similar accusation unless of course it s trump cause that s a whole nother animal i m thinking clinton will resurface they saved hillary s brain well trump got a pass for various comments about blacks for allegations and boasts of inappropriate touching and for completely changing his position on various topics e g planned parenthood so i doubt biden will be affected too badly if you wwwant to used tired dem talking points why don t you get your own reason column i keep hearing that joe biden is the democratic party s only hope in defeating donald trump i have a hard time believing that i would think it would be bernie sanders or elizabeth warren i don t vote for republicans or democrats his wife and kid died he deserves to be president even if he takes that triangulation thing too far source joe biden rusty weather vane reason com apparently considers biden s acceptable
