line have been rebranded enemies of the state amid a sprawling system of surveillance and detention in xinjiang by dake kang associated press beijing ap for 15 years yalqun rozi skillfully navigated state bureaucracies to publish textbooks that taught classic poems and folk tales to millions of his fellow minority uighurs in china s far western region of xinjiang that all changed three years ago when the ruling communist party launched what it says is a campaign against ethnic separatism and religious extremism in xinjiang suddenly even respected public figures like rozi were being arrested caught up in a crackdown that critics have said amounts to cultural genocide an estimated 1 million uighurs have since been detained in internment camps and prisons across the region and advocacy groups say that includes more than 400 prominent academics writers performers and artists critics say the government is targeting intellectuals as a way to dilute or even erase the uighur culture language and identity after being taken away by police in 2016 rozi 54 was sentenced to more than a decade in prison on charges of incitement to subvert state power as one of the first prominent people to be detained rozi s story illustrates how even uighurs who toed the party line and were accepted by the government have been rebranded enemies of the state amid the widening campaign of surveillance and detention underway in xinjiang he was good at communicating with the government he had many friends among government officials said abduweli ayup a linguist who knew rozi through a uighur bookstore ayup once ran he published those books because he has connections with book inspecting officials rozi s friends family and former classmates describe him as sharp disciplined and very careful standing out for his political and business savvy as a college student in the 1980s he stayed away from the pro democracy movements that were roiling china and avoided socializing with known activists he shot to fame among uighurs after tangling with famous writers winning people over during heated debates on television he cultivated ties with state officials that allowed him to write on sensitive topics like islam and uighur identity rozi urged his people to become educated to counter stereotypes of uighurs as backward exotic or extremist it seemed like on tv and in state propaganda all we did was sing and dance rozi s son kamalt rk yalqun said from philadelphia where he and other family members live in exile my father didn t like this label he wanted us to become entrepreneurs scientists intellectuals when the government tapped rozi in 2001 to head a committee in charge of compiling uighur literature textbooks he leapt at the chance he and his family moved into a housing compound with xinjiang education press editors and schooling officials debating world events over dinner with others in the tight knit community of uighur scholars and writers rozi kept a large study overflowing with books shutting himself in on weekends to focus on writing and editing rozi was accustomed to dealing with the government s fears of an independent uighur identity and though he sometimes quarreled with censors his works always made it to publication the family s fortunes and those of the uighurs as a whole took a dramatic turn after a string of terror attacks in xinjiang in 2014 shortly after chinese president xi jinping came to power in response beijing kicked off its suffocating security crackdown rozi was arrested soon after chen quanguo a hard line politician became xinjiang s top official in 2016 and his books were pulled from shelves soon his former colleagues at xinjiang education press began disappearing as did the officials who used to supervise his work colleges held political meetings to denounce problematic textbooks including rozi s calling them treasonous and a great scourge that poisoned uighurs with ideas of splitting china those textbooks weren t political at all kamalt rk said there were things in there about taking pride in being ethnic uighurs and that s what the chinese government was upset with the intensity of beijing s crackdown caught many by surprise shocking even hardened dissidents in retrospect it was a signal said abdurehim dolet rozi s close friend and former business partner who now lives in turkey we all thought this was only temporary that things would get better he was made an example the chinese foreign ministry referred questions about rozi s case to regional authorities who did not respond to a fax for comment experts say the campaign against rozi s books is part of a systematic effort by beijing to distance young uighurs from their language and culture including by putting thousands of uighurs in mandarin only orphanages and boarding schools it s a slow process of cultural reengineering to reshape uighur culture from top to bottom to eradicate most fundamentally the uighur language or to erode it to the extent that among younger generations it might potentially die out said james leibold a scholar of chinese ethnic studies at latrobe university in melbourne today kamalt rk his sister and mother are trying to draw attention to rozi s case from a cramped two bedroom apartment in philadelphia kamalt rk who once had the highest college entrance exam scores in xinjiang and won a spot to study chemistry at china s most prestigious university has put dreams of medical school on hold to support his family he now squeezes in time to lobby members of congress between 14 hour days at a pharmaceutical company testing animal blood samples he s creating a website dedicated to his father and plans one day to finish translating what s left of his father s works into english to show the world why many uighurs consider him among their most significant intellectuals alive one of kamalt rk s biggest regrets is that he didn t take all of his father s textbooks with him when he left china he worries some may be lost forever nobody thought they could be a target that they could vanish one day he said it s shocking that they re gone associated press videojournalis
