to enjoy all the benefits of our website since october at demonstrations and sit ins iraqis have been demanding clean politics real independence and better lives get the new statesman s morning call email baghdad does not have a good reputation check in staff at airports offer sympathy when you tell them where you re going visiting this city is always hard but it s always interesting after the disappointments of 2011 the year of the arab uprisings the middle east s overwhelmingly young population is trying once again for change since october at demonstrations and sit ins iraqis have been demanding clean politics real independence and better lives they have directed a lot of anger at iran their big neighbour that controls so much here hundreds have been shot dead by security forces that include pro iranian militas protesters are following closely the crisis that has enveloped the iranian regime since it shot down the ukrainian airliner hoping it might force the country to weaken its grip on iraq extreme courtesy i arrived not long after the americans killed the iranian general qasem soleimani the blast marks left by the us hellfire missiles were still on the airport road with flowers and photos foreigners like iraqis have to think about their security the british are often lumped in with the americans unsurprisingly after the invasion of iraq in 2003 it keeps feeding into the headlines when the us removed saddam hussein who saw himself as a sunni bulwark iran s regime was handed a new political landscape dominated by fellow shias soleimani was the man who exploited the new opportunities best which was a big reason why the us killed him googletag cmd push function googletag display 1x3 i was a little apprehensive on this trip the first big breaking story i ve done since taking a year off to be treated for cancer but i have always had faith in the essential decency of iraqis a feeling that goes back to 1991 when i was in baghdad reporting on the gulf war the americans and british were bombing the city in a cold winter civilians had no heat light or running water and there was the chance of being killed on 13 february 1991 the us bombed a shelter in amiriyah a middle class suburb of baghdad at least 400 civilians were killed the adult men would leave their families at the shelter every evening and then go home to protect their property by the time i arrived distraught fathers husbands and sons were outside the shelter watching rescuers pull out bodies that were twisted and burned or in charred pieces the pentagon and the ministry of defence said wrongly that it was a command centre the bodies being stacked up in the back of lorries were of women children and old men in their terrible disbelieving grief the men were polite and restrained when i spoke to them it was the same as they searched through piles of bodies i was with a man when he found his wife identifying her only by the rings on her burnt fingers britain was a full partner in the war and defended the amiriyah attack as vehemently as the us i wonder what kind of reception a journalist from baghdad would have had in london at the scene of an iraqi attack that had killed more than 400 civilians iraq was consumed by violence long before the 2003 invasion the raf pioneered the aerial bombing of tribes rebelling against british rule in the 1920s britain
