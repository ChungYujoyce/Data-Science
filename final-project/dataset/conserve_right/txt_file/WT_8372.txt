apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic los angeles ap actress zhao shuzhen who has captivated audiences with her performance as the grandmother in the farewell is essentially unknown to most american audiences go to her imdb page and it looks as though writer director lulu wang s real life family drama is her only credit but that couldn t be further from the truth in her native china the 75 year old is not only a veteran of stage and screen she s also a big star it was a pivotal role for the film and for wang personally the farewell is based on the filmmaker s actual life in which her family discovers that their beloved grandmother is terminally ill decides to keep that fact from her and stages a wedding so they have an excuse to gather everyone together to say goodbye the heart of the film which is currently available on home video and has awards buzz behind it is about the relationship between wang s alter ego billi awkwafina and her grandmother nai nai shuzhen got her first

survey word of mouth led wang to shuzhen who had never acted in an american production before diana lin who had already been cast to play billi s mother recommended her to the director i worked with her before and she was a great person to work with zhao is a great friend as well lin said she was the first person i thought of i used to call her cat y auntie like kitty because the way she smiles is warm and soft and sweet also when i was a little girl probably about 14 i watched her theater plays because we were in the same theater company in harbin city shuzhen fell into acting almost accidentally at age 16 she accompanied a friend to the harbin grand theater in northeast china and ended up auditioning for the drama school as well i didn t intend on becoming an actress she said through a translator on a recent afternoon in los angeles the chief examiner gave me a scenario to play with and i very quickly entered into the mindset of the character and he thought i did a good job but it s not as though at the time i had a particular passion for acting or interest in the career it just sort of happened over the next 40 years she d appear in over 100 plays with the company but it wasn t until china central television cctv launched in 1978 that she d even have the opportunity to start acting in front of a camera after that she started making appearances on various television shows and dramas then in 1993 everything changed when she was cast as the mother on a popular show set during china s cultural revolution people started to recognize me in the street i became very popular and very famous because the show was a big hit she said that was the first time i d experienced being mobbed by fans who wanted my autograph or to take pictures and she hasn t stopped working since but that work never took her to hollywood nor did she even think about trying to make a go of it on her own so when she received word that wang wanted to speak to her about the role she was a little hesitant at first in fact wang was told that they wouldn t be able to even afford her i called and begged her basically and cried wang said i said this is based on my own grandmother and i really need somebody who is as compassionate as she is strong and i feel that you have both of those qualities that makes you sort of iconic to me she feels like my grandmother your grandmother she feels like everybody s grandmother i became very moved and i started crying and it was at that juncture where i said i ll do this shuzhen said i could really sense her love for her grandma as a grandmother to two grandsons from her two daughters it wasn t a stretch i m always concerned with the well being of my grandchildren asking them are you cold are you warm if you re going out drive safely do you have boyfriend or girlfriend yet shuzhen said laughing in fact it is this kind of selflessness that makes her suspect that nai nai didn t even realize she was ill she s not concerned with her own well being she s only concerned with the well being of her children and grandchildren she said she never thinks about herself shuzhen is only now realizing the kind of impact her farewell performance has made stateside making the rounds in los angeles attending awards season parties screenings and doing media appearances i m so grateful and delighted by the attention from the media from the audiences people asking for autographs and pictures she said i know we re supposedly campaigning for awards season we have similar kinds of events and interviews in china but this is la and hollywood as an actor you can t help but be excited and inspired by being here ap film writer jake coyle contributed to this report follow
