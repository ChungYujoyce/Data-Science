aposll ask two members of the bipartisan conference committee trying to find one republican senator john hoeven and democratic congressman henry cuellar plus the trump administration pulls the plug on

security committee all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington virginia governor ralph northam is defying calls for his resignation from the democratic party in his own state and almost all the leading contenders for his party aposs 2020 presidential nomination northam says he is not one of the two people in a clearly racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook and he aposs appealing to virginia voters to give them some time to earn back their trust we begin our coverage with the latest from garrett tenney live outside the governor aposs mansion in richmond garrett garrett tenney correspondent chris in less than 24 hours governor ralph northam went from i aposm sorry to it wasn apost me and his explanation has done very little to quell the calls for his resignation begin videotape northam i am deeply sorry i cannot change the decisions i made nor can i undo the harm that my behavior caused then and today tenney clearly racist and offensive on friday that aposs how governor northam described this picture in his 1984 medical school yearbook which shows one man wearing black face and another in a kkk costume on saturday northam said he never believed it was him in the picture and only apologized because people were upset northam last night i finally had a chance to sit down and look at the photograph in detail it is definitely not me i can tell by looking at it tenney northam admitted he did wear black face for a dance competition that same year dressing up like michael jackson he aposs facing a growing wave of calls from across the political spectrum for him to resign including these from the campaign trail sen kirsten gillibrand d n y he should resign i saw the photo after i saw you guys last night so disturbing so racist sen sherrod brown d oh i have called for him to resign he should tenney if northam were to resign lieutenant governor justin fairfax will become the second african american governor of the commonwealth in a statement he said i cannot condone the actions from his past that at the very least suggest a comfort with virginia aposs darker history of white supremacy racial stereotyping and intimidation end videotape tenney governor northam said he is launching an investigation to determine who the two men in the photo are and to prove to the public that he isn apost one of them using facial recognition technology chris wallace garrett tenney reporting from richmond garrett thanks for that we want to discuss this now with our sunday group who represent a range of political opinions former republican congressman jason chaffetz mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service liz marlantes politics editor of the christian science monitor and jonah goldberg of the national review well mo let me start with you because you have a long experience in virginia democratic politics here is governor northam yesterday asking virginia voters for more time begin video clip northam right now i am simply asking for the opportunity to demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that the person i was is not the man i am today i am asking for the opportunity to earn your forgiveness end video clip wallace mo do you think the governor can survive this scandal do you think he should survive the scandal mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service it aposs hard to see how as you reference i aposve worked in virginia democratic politics for a long time eight statewide campaigns over a dozen year period and one thing that aposs very clear in virginia in virginia today is that issues of race remain complicated they remain raw they remain emotional for so many people to have those issues and those emotions spill over into the governor aposs office of what was once the capital of the confederacy something is hard to come back from i think the governor has mishandled this every single step of the way i don apost know how you can on one night admit that you are in the photo and the next day come back and say i only said that because i didn apost look at it that at least suggests to me that for a moment he thought it was possible that it might have been him that in and of itself is concerning to me and so i think you have seen and i will say this as difficult a day as this is in the commonwealth of virginia and nationally i do feel a little optimism come from it because we have seen a unanimity we have seen people from across the political spectrum come together and say this kind of behavior is not acceptable so in a few united moments we have had as a nation recently i wish we could see that same feeling when it aposs a steve king or somebody else but i do think we are seeing people say let us turn the corner on this and move forward wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and on the northam issue we got this tweet from greg can you describe the compounded media hysteria if this was a conservative governor who supported donald j trump congressman chaffetz how do you answer greg and i have to say in all fairness this story since it broke has been the lead on almost every newscast and as we pointed out almost every potential contender for the 2020 democratic nomination has condemned northam and has called for him to resign jason chaffetz contributor the reaction has been severe and it has been pervasive it aposs hard to believe that it could be any worse but even then i do believe it would be even exponentially worse for somebody who supported donald j trump but at the same time every single democrat that i aposve heard has come out and said that he needs to step down he shouldn apost be in place probably easier for republicans to say that but i aposm glad and proud actually that the democrats are calling out one of their own and at this point i think the governor is being just wholly selfish he can apost govern at this point he aposs going to be terribly ineffective it sounds like they have a decent competent person to step in behind him and he should step down immediately wallace jonah i aposm going to ask the question which may be hopelessly out of date and may seem hopelessly out of touch to some people but as hateful as that photograph from 1984 is and there aposs no question it is hateful it was 35 years ago and this governor does have a pretty good record of reaching out to african americans he has been a member of an african american church it is a just possible in the year 2019 to even consider whether you should judge a person aposs whole life of work against one terrible mistake jonah goldberg national review in principle i absolutely think you should be able to apologize sincerely for this and maybe part of the problem is that a sincere apology would come with a resignation not with what we aposve seen but we are at a moment where we are talking about giving felons second chances because of mistakes they aposve made when they killed people or murdered people or raped people surely if this was a stand alone thing that he did in his past and the contrition was sincere i think we should be able people should get a shot at redemption or at least have their apologies heard the problem is they aposve been so bad this was such a bad handling of this thing where even now he aposs begging for forgiveness while denying it was him and promising a search for the real racists it is a bizarrely convoluted embarrassing handling of something and it just it chums the water in ways that makes it impossible for a lot of people to give him the benefit of the doubt wallace i promise liz i aposm going to bring you in a minute but what about that mo i mean what about the argument let aposs say it even was his picture in 1984 in the medical school yearbook it aposs a terrible mistake it aposs hateful it aposs unacceptable but should we all be judged by the worst thing we ever did elleithee of course i think he has i aposve struggled with this too he has a long distinguished record as a pediatrician and as a veteran and as an elected official and has done so much good for the people of virginia wallace and has reached out to the african american elleithee he aposs reached out to the african american community in very real ways so the notion that you have this one moment from your past to find and invalidate everything else doesn apost sit well with me but i aposm with jonah on this one in that if he had come out on day one and said in a very real way that it was either that it was him and here aposs how i aposm going to regain your trust i think people would listen to him to come out yesterday then and do the about face wallace yes but wait wait to be fair long before the news conference and i certainly agree it was a weird news conference elleithee yes wallace there were people calling for his resignation everybody was calling for his resignation including every democratic potential contender elleithee you know i actually give a lot of credit to the state aposs two senators mark warner and tim kaine who both former governors who condemned the photo immediately and said were going to give the government a chance to speak directly to the people of virginia let him explain to them and do the right thing and after that after yesterday they said you know what he can apost do it wallace ok liz i want to bring you and if i want to broaden this because i want to talk about a somewhat different issue which was that before the story broke the big story involving democrats this last week was that they were being attacked by republicans as dangerous out of touch leftist radicals in virginia of all places a democratic lawmaker was pushing a bill that would make it easier to get late term abortions take a look begin video clip unidentified male where it aposs obvious that a woman is about to give birth she has physical signs that she is about to give birth would that still be a point at which she could request an abortion if she was so certified kathy tran d virginia state delegate my bill would allow that yes end video clip wallace interestingly enough governor northam supported that bill which would make it easier to get late term abortions which was defeated in the statehouse and then there was senator kamala harris who supported medicare for all even saying well maybe we don apost need private insurance anymore take a look at this begin video clip sen kamala harris d calif who of us has not had that situation where you aposve got to wait for approval and the doctor says well i don apost know if your insurance company is going to cover this let aposs eliminate all of that let aposs move on end video clip wallace and some democrats are making dramatic new calls for stiff new increases in taxes on the very wealthy the question is is there a vulnerability for democrats here that they may be going too far to the left and that republicans will be able to paint them as radical or even socialist liz marlantes the christian science monitor absolutely i think you know if you look at the field of 2020 candidates right now there aposs a huge opening for moderate that isn apost being filled at the moment unless i don apost know may be joe biden ends up getting in or something but yes i think the field is going to the left and what we saw this week with howard schultz talking about possibly running as a third party all of that i think points to the fact that there is right now a vacuum in the field for moderate candidates however i was going to say back to the northam thing even if he had handled it correctly from the beginning i think democrats would have been calling for him to be out of there right away because the one thing is they are gearing up for 2020 they do not want to be seen as in any way hypocritical on issues of race or sex they just don apost end i think he would aposve been done even if he aposd handled it perfectly goldberg can i add a quick point on that the question from the viewer about media coverage what if the blackface episode had never happened and it had been a pro life right wing conservative governor who took an equally extreme position from the right on abortion how would the media coverage be different the media coverage of this governor basically rhetorically endorsing infanticide in the eyes of millions of americans was treated as a strange obsession by the mainstream media if a right wing governor said well zero tolerance for any abortion we aposre going to put the doctors in jail we aposre going to put the mom in jail it would be a firestorm of media coverage and that shows the double standard and also how race plays so much differently than some of these other sort of christian pro life culture war issues wallace panel thank you all i don apost usually lead with the panel i aposm glad we did see you all a little later up next president trump says there aposs a good chance he will declare a national emergency to build his border wall if a bipartisan congressional panel can apost hammer out a deal two members of that committee join us next commercial break wallace a congressional conference committee has just 12 more days to strike a deal on border security that president trump will sign before there aposs another government shutdown joining me now two members of that committee from texas democratic congressman henry cuellar whose district sits right on the border with mexico and he says he opposes any money for a new barrier and here in washington republican senator john hoeven he says there has to be money for a wall and gentlemen welcome to both of you to fox news sunday sen john hoeven r n d thanks chris rep henry cuellar d tx thank you so much wallace president trump has been very pessimistic about the prospects that your committee is going to be able to come up with a compromising compromise including funding for the wall and here he is on thursday begin video clip president donald trump i don apost expect much coming out of the committee because i keep hearing the words that we aposll give you what you want but we aposre not going to give you a wall and the problem is if they don apost give us a wall it doesn apost work without a wall it doesn apost work end video clip wallace senator hoeven is this as the president has been saying this week a waste of time what do you think are the prospects the chances that you can come up with a deal he only got 12 days left less than two weeks to give the president something he can sign hoeven well i think the president is trying to push the process along and you know you need to i mean we only have until february 15th i think we can get to a solution but it does need to include barrier funding it needs to include personnel technology and funding for a border barrier wallace congressman cuellar here is speaker pelosi this week begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house there aposs not going to be any wall money in the legislation end video clip wallace congressman is this a semantic game they are not going to support a wall but you would support a barrier where are you on that or is that no physical barrier at all cuellar well you know surely i want to make sure we emphasize the deficiencies that we might be down there more personnel more technology first of all we aposre not going to have a wall now can we look at some sort of enhanced barrier that aposs something we can certainly look at but i have to say living on the border you have to let the local border patrol chief have the say so and let the local communities be involved so they can come up with maybe some sort of enhanced barrier but again washington cannot dictate what sort of barrier and where to put it at wallace well let me make sure i understand though because a lot of the border patrol people have been saying they want to see at least in some areas enhanced barriers so are you saying that you and the other democrats on this conference committee could support the kind of fencing we just put up some pictures of it very tall 30 foot tall fencing that the president has been talking about cuellar no no no notice what i said is that the local border patrol chief should make that local assessment of the threat and then you let the local communities have a say so but washington is not going to say is going to say what sort of barrier they aposre going to have again i don apost believe in the wall i think a wall is a 14th century solution the way the president is saying the president is looking at a false premise he thinks that the only way you secure the border is by having a wall that is a false premise there aposs other ways of securing the border wallace well senator hoeven you hear you are on the same panel with congressman cuellar do you hear the basis for possible deal there or not hoeven that aposs why i proposed at our meeting this week that we bring in the border patrol professionals and were going to do that next week chairman shelby has agreed on the senate side where working to get chairman lowey ph to agree as well and then we want the including the sector chiefs to come in and say why they need border barrier as well as personnel and technology and take some of the politics out of the equation wallace let me continue with you senator hoeven because president trump suggested this week that he may just give up on the work of your committee and declare a national emergency either during or just after his state of the union speech here he is begin video clip trump we will be looking at a national emergency because i don apost think anything is going to happen i think the democrats don apost want border security listen closely to the state of the union i think you aposll find it very exciting end video clip wallace senator hoeven would that be a mistake for the president to preempt and not give you until february 15th to work out a deal and how do you feel about the whole idea of declaring a national emergency in the first place one of your republican colleagues senator rubio says you set that precedent you aposre going to get a democratic president somebody who says well we need national emergency to redirect funds on climate change hoeven well the best solution is getting to one where congress puts together a funding package for border security including all three components that i aposve laid out that is acceptable to the house the senate and to the president that aposs the best solution there have been something like 58 emergencies declared under the national emergency act going all the way back to 1979 and president carter i think 31 of those are still enforced so i think what the president is saying is if we don apost compromise he aposs put compromise on the table real compromise things that democrats want but if we can apost get compromise out of speaker pelosi and get to a good solution then he would be forced to go the national emergency route wallace congressman cuellar we have the state of the union speech on tuesday what will be the response from house democrats in the house chamber on tuesday if the president stands there with nancy pelosi right over his shoulder and declares a national emergency cuellar look when he says there aposs an emergency let me give this analogy if you have a fire if you aposre going to send that a fire department right there you aposre not going to say you know if i don apost get this i will send the fire department if you don apost do this i threaten you with this emergency that aposs not an emergency by nature the way he aposs been laying this out any reasonable judge is going to say this is not an emergency and if you look at the emergency what he talks about you know our border area i live at the border it aposs safer than most areas and i have use numbers before fbi stats will show that the national murder rate is 5 3 murders per 100 000 the border cities are lower than that in fact washington d c is about three or four times more dangerous than laredo my hometown so again he knows it aposs not an emergency he aposs using the threat as leverage to get a wall he aposs not going to get that 14th century solution called the wall it aposs a false premise ph wallace ok let aposs get off the politics both of you and let aposs talk about the merits of the issue and i aposve got some statistics here first of all let aposs talk about the effectiveness of physical barriers when they were put up in the yuma arizona sector arrests for illegal crossings felt 94 percent in three years from 138 000 to 8 000 when barriers went up in san diego arrests fell 80 percent and seven years from over half a million to 100 000 congressman cuellar you voted for fencing in an appropriations bill last year 1 3 billion for fencing so why all this resistance to physical barriers now cuellar well let aposs look at the effectiveness and the cost effectiveness of a wall if you put money crosstalk wallace you keep talking about a wall cuellar no no no wallace wait wait sir let aposs just talk about let aposs just talk about barriers rather than a wall cuellar ok ok let aposs call it a barrier but let aposs call it a fence let aposs go in the middle a fence wallace ok cuellar if you look at the cost let aposs look at the cause of one mile of technology it will cost 1 million to 2 million per mile one mile of fencing is going to cost 25 million to 26 million if you look at every border patrol chief since bush obama and trump when i aposve asked them this question in appropriations how much time does a fence buy you that means how much does it slow them down they all have said quote a few minutes or a few seconds if you look at border patrol union the border patrol before 2012 said that a wall was useless because they can go ahead go under go around and it is a waste of taxpayers dollars wallace ok let me bring in senator hoeven because the president keeps calling this a crisis and i want to look at some statistics on that and this brings up some measures that congressman cuellar talked about in 2000 the border patrol stopped 1 6 million people 19 years ago last year they arrested just a quarter as many less than 400 000 and two thirds of the people here illegally each year are visa overstays not people who cross the border illegally so i guess two questions one is there a crisis on the southern border and two whatever you want to call it would a wall stop it anyway hoeven well it is a crisis and the numbers are going back up if you look we aposre now going back up to 50 000 to 60 000 people coming every month 200 000 over the last four months so you can see this number is going back up and it aposs not just people coming here illegally look at the drug flow look at the human trafficking gangs ms 13 this is something we aposve got to get a handle on and that aposs what you need all three components border barrier as well as technology and personnel it aposs like a three legged stool and the border patrol will tell you that which is why i go back to what i aposm trying to get done and you aposre going to see it happen this week bring the border patrol professionals and let aposs hear from them what they need why they need it wallace ok i aposm going to try to step back for a minute we aposve only got about two minutes left but senator hoeven congressman cuellar talk to each other i mean what aposs the basis for a deal hoeven sure i have been to laredo with congressman cuellar he aposs a good man and i think we can get to a solution here but we are going to have to have all three in a way that we can agree on i aposm certainly willing to fund personnel and technology we aposve got to have some money for barrier as well wallace are you willing to do all of those things congressman cuellar well i certainly want to sit down with senator john and other members because i feel that if we don apost get outside pressure the committee can sit down and work this out appropriators are as you know in washington there aposs republicans democrats and there aposs appropriators both in the house and the senate we can work out a deal i know we can sit down and work it if we just don apost get any outside pressure do what we need to do and i feel that the process as appropriators house and senate democrats republicans we can work something out i feel confident by the way the deadline is february 15th if we have to do something our committee probably has to do something by this coming friday because then you got to print it out and then you aposve got to lay out the bills in the house and the senate so it aposs less than february the 15th for the committee to come up with something wallace all right on that relatively helpful note i aposm going to say congressman cuellar senator hoeven thank you both thanks for joining us today and we aposll be tracking what your committee does over the next week or maybe two weeks thank you both gentlemen hoeven thanks chris cuellar thanks wallace up next the u s pulls out of a missile treaty with russia sparking fears of a new arms race we aposll discuss the fallout of the president aposs split with his intel chiefs and with senate republicans discuss all that with the chair of the senate homeland security committee that aposs next commercial break wallace coming up the u s and russia pull out of a major nuclear arms treaty begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state the piece of paper if it aposs not been complied with is doesn apost reduce the risk it doesn apost take down that threat end video clip wallace we aposll ask the chair of the senate homeland security committee if we aposre headed for a new arms race next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace president trump aposs america first agenda will be on full display tuesday night during his state of the union address on friday he announced plans to pull out of the inf missile treaty a treaty that was signed by ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev during the cold war all this as trump aposs foreign policy is being questioned by some surprising people joining us now from wisconsin republican senator ron johnson chair of the homeland security committee senator let me start with the most recent news both the u s and russia have just announced that they are pulling out of compliance with the medium range missile treaty president trump has been saying that the the russians have been violating that treaty for some period of time the question is though that with no new talks scheduled to try to update the treaty and with the long range ballistic missile treaty running out in two years are we headed for a new arms race sen ron johnson r wiss well good morning chris and of course the the most salient point here is that russia has been violating this treaty for at least six years testing and now we believe deploying these intermediate range nuclear missiles and what aposs so dangerous about these is you know they if something flies out of those batteries it aposs only a couple of minutes before it hits the target probably in the european theater so we have very little warning and all kinds of miscalculations could occur so it aposs unfortunate that vladimir putin has taken this path and that he aposs been violating this treaty but there aposs really no treaty in existence when one person is violating and not even admitting to violating it as well so this is something that aposs just natural our nato and european allies completely back the president aposs move here hopefully in the six month period before you know between the announcement in the final ending of the treaty russia will come to her senses and and verifiably dismantled these batteries wallace let me turn to another subject this week most republican senators broke with president trump on his announcement of a quick withdrawal of some or all u s troops from all u s troops from syria about half from afghanistan here aposs senate majority leader mitch mcconnell a republican who introduced the measure opposing a fast withdraw from those theaters begin video clip sen mitch mcconnell r ky senate majority leader isis and al qaeda have yet to be defeated and american national security interests require continued commitment to our missions there end video clip wallace senator you aposre one of 43 republicans in the senate who voted for the mcconnell amendment opposing the president aposs announced policy you say that we can apost and using your phrase bug out of syria and to do so would be quote very unwise policy johnson well chris i can apost tell you how many times i came on shows like this after president obama decided to bug out of a iraq precipitously and so that isis was able to rise from the thoroughly ph defeated ashes of al qaeda in iraq and i don apost want to be making the same statement six months from now that we bug out of syria unwisely and that isis has reemerged from the defeated isis or ashes of isis in syria we met a bipartisan group of senators met with the co chair of the syrian democratic coalition ms ahmad and you know she had a very compelling case to make they aposve got about 60 000 fighters they represent about 4 million syrians about 2 5 million kurds and about a 1 5 million christians and they want democracy they want peace and she made a very strong case of just having american military people present not even involved in the fighting but as advisors does a it goes a great deal toward providing the peace and stability for that part of syria and i think it would just be tragic if we bugged out left the kurds who by and large have done the fighting and have defeated the isis caliphate the territorial caliphate in isis if we just abandon them to the to the mercies and let aposs you know i use that term loosely of russia and iran and possibly turkey wallace so johnson it would just be unconscionable so so again i think republican senators are sending very strong signals to the president we don apost want to see that happen and i hope he is listening wallace so if he he should be listening when there were 43 of the 53 republican senators voted against his policy which raises the question how serious a split is there between senate republicans and the president on the trump foreign policy johnson well as it relates to pulling out of syria there aposs there aposs a pretty serious split hopefully the president because when he he came to senate lunch he was talking about you know we aposre still going to defeat isis and their airbases from iraq that we can still continue these missions so you know i aposm i aposm not on the ground there i don apost know all the military assets but it aposs a very bad sign when secretary mattis resigns brett mcgurk our envoy there for the defeat of isis also resigns because they simply can apost carry out this policy these are people that are intimately knowledgeable of the conditions of the ground of of are allies there and they simply couldn apost in conscience in good conscience stay in office that aposs a pretty bad sign i hope the president is listening to those people as well wallace well talking about people who are knowledgeable on the ground we saw a remarkable split this week between the president and his own intel chiefs on a number of world hot spots while the president since the summit with kim jong un has said that north korea is no longer a nuclear threat here was the testimony this week by the director of national intelligence dan coats begin video clip dan coats director of national intelligence we currently assess that north korea will seek to retain its wmd capabilities it is unlikely to completely give up its nuclear weapons and production capabilities because its leaders ultimately view nuclear weapons as critical to regime survival end video clip wallace and here are the president and director coats on the threat from isis begin video clip preset we aposve really stepped it up and we have won against isis we aposve beaten them and we aposve beaten them badly dan coats director of national intelligence isis is intent on resurging and still commands thousands of fighters in iraq and syria end video clip wallace they also disagreed the president and in this case cia director gina haspel over whether or not iran is violating the iran nuclear deal what do you make of the president and his own intelligence chiefs at such odds johnson well let me also say that ms ahmad was was also pretty firm in her assurances that isis has sleeper cells existing they are not thoroughly defeated yet now the caliphate the territorial caliphate is gone but you still have those sleeper cells listen i come from the private sector spent 30 years in manufacturing enter public life and i i realized i have the modesty to understand that there aposs an awful lot there aposs an you know so much tradition and history and complexity to some of these foreign policy issues you have to rely on people who have been working these issues for for decades and it aposs just imperative that you actually listen to for example the cia chief the director of national intelligence these people have the real knowledge and you have to listen to them wallace well that wasn apost the president aposs first reaction actually none of his reactions his first reaction was to bash the intel chiefs let me put up a couple of his tweets the intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and na ve perhaps intelligence should go back to school and then after meeting with his chiefs the next day the presidents at this begin video clip preset they said that they were totally misquoted and they were totally it was taken out of context so what i do is i aposd suggest that you call them they said it was fake news end video clip wallace is that healthy i mean as the head of the homeland security committee on the foreign relations committee is does that concern you when the president says there is agreement between him and his intel chiefs on all these key issues when clearly from listening to their testimony there isn apost agreement johnson well you know i just say one instance the what the intelligence chiefs were talking about iran they were saying currently and technically iran is in compliance but i think the president aposs absolutely right of the the this type of danger that iran represents not only to the region but the world i mean they aposre they aposre they aposre continuing to plot terrorist attacks into europe they obviously are fomenting the conflict in yemen and you know they are certainly not helpful in syria they are a real threat to israel and to world peace and stability so technically they may be in compliance with the agreement currently they may not be pursuing nuclear weapons but you know they aposre still fomenting terror they aposre still the largest state sponsor of terror in the world and so i you know again i think maybe that difference was blown way out of proportion wallace i aposve got about a minute left i want to go to one other hotspot there aposs a lot on the international plate right now and that aposs venezuela the president this week announced some dramatic escalations in our campaign against the maduro regime he aposs now backing as a number of other countries are the opposition president from the national assembly and he aposs also imposed some tough new economic sanctions on venezuela how far do you think this country should be prepared to go in trying to topple the maduro regime and would that extend in your judgment to the use of military force johnson well i think the administration aposs really done an admirable job when it comes to their reaction to what aposs happening on the ground it aposs the national assembly probably the closest thing to an open democratic forum in venezuela that voted for you know their assembly president juan guaido to basically run the country now and when you see the protest in the street in support of mr guaido we are just reacting to the conditions on the ground and we are supporting the venezuelan people in trying to shed the just the deprivations of of maduro when wallace it i johnson when you listen to the hit squats going into wallace let me just ask you though because we aposre we aposre running out johnson it just is awful so again i think the administration aposs done a good job wallace and where are you on the use of military force briefly johnson well we certainly have to protect american personnel there and i think that aposs exactly what we aposve done move you know moving troops into colombia i really do think the people of venezuela will take care of the situation and we aposll just take you know we aposll use economic sanctions to support them and i think it aposs appropriate that we do support the people of venezuela wallace have we moved new troops because there was this statement 1 500 troops in colombia in fact have we done so sir johnson well that aposs i aposm just basing it off news reports that would be a prudent action on my you know from my standpoint i hope we have done that wallace senator johnson thank you thanks for your time it aposs always good to talk with you sir johnson have a good day wallace up next we aposll ask our sunday group about the president aposs disagreement with senate republicans and his own intel chiefs and what we can expect from the state of the union all that next commercial break begin video clip mcconnell my amendment would acknowledge the plain fact that al qaeda isis and their affiliates in syria and afghanistan continue to pose a serious threat to us here at home end video clip wallace senate majority leader mitch mcconnell warning president trump against pulling troops out of syria and afghanistan too soon and we aposre back now with the panel well congressman chaffetz 43 of the 53 republicans voted for the mcconnell amendment against the president aposs policy of pulling troops out of syria and afghanistan only three republicans opposed the amendment and seven members didn apost vote at all profiles in courage how significant is the split do you think between senate republicans and the president over the president foreign policy jason chaffetz contributor that was a very strong message to the president but i aposm actually with the president i don apost think we should be in afghanistan and syria in perpetuity i think if the senate wanted to invoke the war powers act and take a strong vote then have the political guts to go ahead and do that but and i think it aposs also good that the president has some tension with his intel chiefs but the president campaigned on this and what i like about him is he aposs always taken the same position on the on these issues wallace but what but what about what about the the intel chiefs saying that there are thousands of fighters still there in syria we aposve only got 2 000 people there i i understand chaffetz yes wallace but i mean it aposs not a huge number and they aposre not on the front lines chaffetz well i really do worry about the kurds but we are able to to fight from from iraq and we do have proximity and we do have the ability but let aposs give president trump a chance i think he aposs had great success in dealing with iran and north korea the world is a safer place and i think trying the president aposs doing it the president aposs way after what 17 years in afghanistan i think that aposs the right way to go wallace this is not the only issue where senate republicans have broken with the president over foreign policy let aposs put up a list yes this last week they opposed him on quick withdrawal from syria and afghanistan before that imposing new sanctions on russia over his objection and also voting voicing support for nato when the president didn apost seem to be doing that last summer liz how big a deal as this this split liz marlantes the christian science monitor well what i found so fascinating particularly about the syria afghanistan vote is that trump aposs actually closer to the 2020 democrats on this issue then he is to his own party and we could end up in a cycle this coming year where there is no major candidate representing that sort of internationalist interventionists point of view in our presidential race and that aposs i can apost remember the last time we had a cycle we could end up with two candidates who are both basically much more isolationist than we aposve ever seen before which is just fascinating wallace i want to turn to the other big split this week between the president and his own intelligence chiefs on the threat from north korea iran isis here is house speaker nancy pelosi begin video clip pelosi one dismaying factor of it all is that the president just doesn apost seem to have the attention span or the desire to hear what the intelligence community has been telling him end video clip wallace jonah what do you make of these disagreements between the president and the intel chiefs who he appointed and the fact that his first reaction was to go after them and bash them as naive and they need to go back to school and then after he met with him to say well they were misquoted and this was fake news jonah goldberg contributor yes so it aposs funny i have profound disagreements with jason about the syria afghanistan stuff but this is somewhere where i aposm a little more sympathetic to to donald trump i do think this was a little overblown in this divide between the intelligence chiefs i don apost think it was fake news i don apost think president trump should have said that but the simple fact is is that the intelligence chiefs are right iran is is in technical compliance because it aposs a great deal for iran on a lot of these things donald trump is the salesman he aposs out there i don apost think he aposs had great success with north korea by any stretch of the imagination but he aposs trying to and so he is trying to make his rhetoric turn into reality so he says he aposs doing great stuff to build momentum the intelligence chiefs they have to have a much more realistic point of view which is he hasn apost done a lot and a lot hasn apost been accomplished and and north korea still wants its nuclear weapons and so it aposs a disconnect between two kinds of of missions the intelligence guys are trying to describe the world as it is donald trump is trying to create a different world than it than it currently is and so it aposs going to see like a big wallace and and what about syria what about syria and and isis where the president says we beat them they aposre gone and you have the director of national intelligence saying they aposre insurging they aposre beginning an insurgency and there are thousands of fighters goldberg yes on their i aposm entirely with the intelligence chiefs i think they aposre entirely right and i think one of the reasons why we saw mitch mcconnell lead this is because mitch mcconnell is not a huge ideologue about foreign policy he aposs hugely committed to getting republicans re elected and himself re elected and what we heard ron johnson earlier say i don apost want to come back on here in six months and talk about how isis is back i think this was almost entirely about self protection because republicans understand if we pull out prematurely there are no other players in the region who really care about fighting isis and isis will come back they aposre in much better shape now than when they were when they first emerged in the middle of the obama administration wallace mo one of the arguments that trump supporters make when this split with the intel chiefs is the intelligence community is not always right and obviously the number one thing they point to is the so called slam dunk that saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction which is what cia director george tenet told bush 43 mo elleithee contributor an overwhelming majority of our intelligence community are dedicated professionals who are really good at what they do do they get everything right absolutely not but they don apost get everything wrong either as this president tends to to portray whenever he disagrees with them and so to to wage a public battle with your own intelligence community which is run by his own appointees seems like a huge concern for a lot of people in the foreign policy and national security community wallace all right in the time we have left there aposs going to be a big event on tuesday and that is the state of the union speech yes the president is finally going to get to make it after his back and forth with nancy pelosi congressman chaffetz this is going to be quite a scene the president there in the well of the house and nancy pelosi and they have really been at it for the last month or so right over his left shoulder how do you expect him to deal with pelosi and the democrats and do you expect him his overall tone to be confrontational or conciliatory chaffetz having sat on the floor for the last ten state of the unions i can tell you that the democrats they are not very disciplined and when president trump who has delivered i think two of his very best speeches as president have been the state of the union i think he aposll do exceptionally well he stays on script he aposs got a good message and he has the microphone for a good hour and a half but i think the democrats will overplay their hand there will be moments when nancy pelosi can apost help herself and the members in the audience they were just downright rude when we were thinking the troops democrats were out there sitting on their hands inaudible do it you watch they will do that same thing on tuesday night wallace but in terms of the president towards pelosi chaffetz yes wallace because he said some tough things about her this week she aposs a disgrace chaffetz yes wallace she aposs back of the country do you expect to hear that our do you expected him to take a softer tone on the very real disagreements they have particularly over the border wall chaffetz i don apost think you can make it personal to nancy pelosi but he has a chance to state his case what is the national security imperative and as long as he does that in a tempered way making the case to the real audience which is the american people he aposll do just fine wallace and do you think democrats will boo him chaffetz oh i think they they will do they will just they can apost help themselves they will overreach and they will be downright rude wallace liz marlantes i don apost know i mean wallace i have to say as a as a person on the air covering it that would be good tv i marlantes i was going to say if i were advising democrats i aposd advise them not a boo because i think the worst thing for trump would be a sort of typical state of the union in other words boring right this is his chance for some sort of reset after the whole shutdown debacle and he kind of you know he needs to have a good speech and it aposs hard to make the state of the union a good speech to be perfectly honest inaudible wallace we aposve got less than a minute left jonah goldberg barack obama and donald trump have shown that state of the unions don apost actually persuade people or move public opinion by this time next sunday the state of the union will seem like the inaudible wallace but having said that it aposs very urgent right now goldberg yes wallace mo elleithee he aposs hobbling into this state of the union he aposs hurting his public opinion is hurting because of the shutdown nancy pelosi kind of owned that whole fight i it was interesting i saw a news clip the other day where a white house aide said that the president may throw in a warm and fuzzy towards nancy pelosi i don apost know what that means he aposs got to appear less strident than he did during the shutdown or else i think his downward spira
