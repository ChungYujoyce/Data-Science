aback by the escalation has said the two governments reached an agreement in 2012 that the status of the doklam area which falls between china and india on a bhutanese plateau would be finalized only through joint consultations involving all parties a look at the key background of the dispute an old quarrel india and china have faced off frequently since fighting a bloody 1962 war that ended with china seizing control of some territory troops from both sides still regularly patrol other unmarked territories though neither side has fired any shots in decades negotiations since 1985 to settle the boundary dispute have seen little success the land they re currently arguing over spans 269 square kilometers 104 square miles on a sparsely populated plateau in western bhutan which has no diplomatic ties with china and coordinates its relations with beijing through new delhi but india and china have rival claims to other himalayan areas as well including 90 000 square kilometers 35 000 square miles in what india considers its state of arunachal pradesh and china refers to as southern tibet as well as 38 000 square kilometers 15 000 square miles of another plateau called aksai chin

china appeared to be trying to pre empt settlement negotiations by establishing a chinese presence in doklam china has been trying for a long time to gain a tactical advantage in this sector having already established dominance along the indian borders at ladakh and arunachal pradesh said security expert uday bhakar a retired indian navy officer the chinese did not expect this resolute indian response and that s why the standoff has continued the dispute was discussed briefly without resolution by chinese president xi jinping and indian prime minister narendra modi on the sidelines of the
