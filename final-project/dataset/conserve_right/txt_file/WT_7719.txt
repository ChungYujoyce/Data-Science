the world the mass of demonstrators who for a second straight day had largely closed down all flights out of the airport barricaded several entrances with luggage carts in an attempt to slow the police approach the seizure of the massive airport was the demonstrators latest escalation in a campaign originally sparked by plans from hong kong s government for an extradition law with beijing

speculation with a twitter post tuesday that said u s intelligence has informed us that the chinese government is moving troops to the border with hong kong everyone should be calm and safe it could not be determined whether mr trump was revealing fresh troop movements or deployments already reported in the media over the weekend and on monday paramilitary police were seen assembling across the border in the city of shenzhen for what officials described as training exercises mr trump also took heat from democratic rivals and some hong kong advocates for not speaking more forcefully against

trump told reporters at the white house i think it will work out and i hope it works out for liberty i hope it works out for everybody including china in recent weeks the protest movement s anger at

press reported that black clad protesters held up signs to appeal to travelers from mainland china and other parts of the world democracy is a good thing one sign said demonstrations over the weekend turned violent and over 700 protesters have been arrested since the demonstrations began in early june earlier in the day chinese state run media released video of armored vehicles reportedly carrying

the u s navy s request for port visits to the city over the next several weeks a pentagon official confirmed to the washington times the uss green bay and uss lake erie were scheduled to visit the port we have a long track record of successful port visits to hong kong and we expect them to continue the official said fear of intervention with few signs the protests are set to subside the likelihood of a heavy handed intervention by beijing is now growing said dan kliman the director of asia pacific security for the center for a new american security but any forceful move could revive memories of the 1989 tiananmen square massacre and deeply stain china s image as it seeks to project itself as a major military force and an emerging global economic superpower china s use of its public security forces or military to quell the hong kong protests would produce long lasting international blowback and irrefutably demonstrate the ideological nature of today s great power competition mr kliman said top chinese officials who go into a major annual leadership conference in the coming days are said to be loath to send troops into the city but are fearful that allowing the protests and defiance to go on would be seen as a sign of weakness in taiwan and other places but beijing s state controlled press has grown increasingly pointed in its commentary on the events in hong kong and openly speculated that the u s government was backing a color revolution in the city along the lines of similar uprisings in ukraine and elsewhere hu xijin the editor in chief of the state backed news outlet global times tweeted that it is hoped hong kong can restore order by itself that is the best end but he added if the development of the situation suggests there is no such hope beijing s intervention will be inevitable it s a hard choice but once it becomes the decision it will be a firm one ms lam the city s embattled chief executive said during a tuesday morning press conference that the riot activities had pushed hong kong to the brink of no return she charged that illegal activity caused damage to the city and it could take a long time for hong kong to recover
