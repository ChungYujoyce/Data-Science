as of this writing the long term effects of the coronavirus pandemic remain uncertain but one possible consequence is an acceleration of the end of the megacity era in its place we may now be witnessing the outlines of a new and necessary dispersion of population not only in the wide open spaces of north america and australia but even in the megacities of the developing world much of this has been driven by high housing prices and growing social disorder in our core cities as well as the steady rise of online commerce and remote working now the fastest growing means of commuting in the united states pandemics naturally thrive in large multicultural cities where people live cheek by jowl and travel to and from other countries is a fact of international tourism and commerce europe s rapidly advancing infection rate is to some extent the product of its weak border controls one of the eu s greatest accomplishments across the continent cities have become the primary centers of infection half of all covid 19 cases in spain for example have occurred in madrid while the milan region with its cosmopolitan population and economy accounts for half of all cases in italy and almost three fifths of the deaths in the us known cases and deaths are overwhelmingly concentrated in the seattle area los angeles san francisco boston and new york gotham with six percent of the us population now accounts by itself for nearly half of the 18 000 cases in the country even the new york times a consistent booster for packing people into small spaces now acknowledges that the city s high densities are responsible for its much higher rate of infection even than relatively dense but far more dispersed areas like los angeles which is equally diverse and global but still consists largely of single family houses in places like new york crowded mass transit systems remain essential to many commuters while suburban exurban and small town residents get around in the sanctuary of their private cars these patterns can be seen in a new report by the mid american think tank heartland forward where i am a senior fellow which shows how relatively slight the impact has been outside of a few large urban centers on the coasts rural areas around the world have been largely spared at least for now the north american hinterlands according to health professionals benefit from less crowding and unwanted human contact living in dispersion may not save you from contagion but being away from people driving around in your own car and having neighbors you know does have its advantages in times like these even the urban cognoscenti have figured this out much as their renaissance predecessors did during typhus and bubonic plague outbreaks wealthy new yorkers today are retreating to their country homes where they struggle with the locals over depleted supplies of essentials back to the dark ages in classical times plagues devastated athens alexandria constantinople and rome along with barbarian invasions they reduced the population of the eternal city from 1 2 million at its height to barely 30 000 by the sixth century outside europe pandemics devastated cities such as cairo canton and harbin following the conquest of the new world the indigenous population suffered massive casualties from exposure to european diseases like smallpox in the late middle ages and the renaissance when urban populations began to resurge particularly in italy dense trading cities suffered the worst outbreaks in contrast as historian william mcneill has noted the impact of pestilence was far less in rural backward reaches of poland or other parts of central europe 1urban pestilence made a comeback during the industrial revolution when the masses suffered from what lewis mumford has called hygienic poverty the emerging big cities in the new world were no better off due to pestilence and inadequate heath care new york s infant mortality rates doubled between 1810 and 1870 2 cities in europe and america had gradually cleaned up by the later parts of the 19th century urban reformers sewer socialists and social democratic governments across europe improved sanitation and water delivery systems and expanded parks equally critical western cities began a conscious un bunching of the population through the introduction of streetcars subways passenger trains and eventually freeways radicals and conservatives alike welcomed the british visionary ebenezer howard s garden city ideal which sought to offer the majority the option of resettling in the more hygienic hinterlands over the ensuing century developers became adept at building cities even in the tropics but it seems clear they have not been able to stop the revival of old hygiene problems this is particularly true in china which has undergone extraordinarily rapid urbanization behind the impressive setting of china s high rise cities many urban residents particularly some of the 200 million migrant workers live in overcrowded neighborhoods with poor sanitation and drinking water many of these workers notes author li sun work in dangerous jobs but have little or no access to healthcare even before covid 19 the inhabitants of highly industrialized cities like wuhan suffered shorter lifespans than those in the countryside dirty conditions and particularly the wet markets common in these cities have been identified for well over a decade as the breeding grounds for respiratory ailments such as mers swine flu and the 2003 sars outbreak more recently even once clean western cities are passively developing ways to incubate pestilence homeless encampments are on the rise throughout europe but the problem is most acute in american cities like san francisco los angeles and seattle these informal settlements attract rats and all sorts of diseases some of which such as typhus are distinctly medieval and arguably far more dangerous than covid 19 the fading megacity once held up as a grand ideal the megacity is increasingly losing its appeal as a way of life chinese science fiction writers increasingly the last redoubt of independent thought in that increasingly totalitarian country envision an urban future that is for most squalid and divided by class there are already deep divisions between those who hold urban residence permits hukou and those relegated to an inferior unprotected status hao jingfang s novella folding beijing for example portrays a megacity sharply divided between the elite the middle ranks and a vast underclass living mainly by recycling the waste generated from the city 3 during my last visit to beijing communist party officials shared their concerns about how these divides could undermine social stability they have already essentially banned new migration into cities such as beijing and shanghai and encourage migrants to move to the less crowded interior or even back to rural villages given the dictatorial nature of the regime it s not shocking that growth is already shifting to second tier cities including some in the interior in far more chaotic india the modi government also supports an ongoing shift to smaller cities and even a push for revitalization of rural villages this reflects a growing concern among indian researchers that the much ballyhooed shining india concentrated in large urban centers increasingly resembles the orbiting world portrayed in the science fiction movie elysium hermetically sealed from the vast majority of the population even without government assistance and often in the face of opposition from planners dispersion has continued to characterize western cities this pattern is well established throughout europe canada and australia and is particularly evident in the united states where since 2010 nearly all population growth has occurred in the urban periphery and smaller cities as a new study from heartland forward demonstrates both immigrants and millennials the key groups behind urban growth are increasingly moving to interior cities and even small towns this is true even in san francisco where nearly half of millennials described themselves as likely to leave the city by the bay a dramatic shift from a decade earlier due in large part to insanely high housing prices and deteriorating conditions on the streets indeed as richard florida has noted the bulk of the new growth of the creative class the well educated millennials critical to the urban renaissance is shifting away from superstar cities the rise in the migration of such prized workers is now two to three times faster in salt lake city pittsburgh cincinnati and grand rapids mi than in regions around new york los angeles or washington d c the growing dispersion of work over the past decade much of the us media and academia have embraced the notion that the future belongs to the high tax high regulation economies clustered on the east and west coasts these trends undermine the notion promoted by writers like neil irwin of the times that cities like new york have the best chance of recruiting superstar employees this is increasingly not the case new technologies make it increasingly easy for companies to work away from dense megacities sparking a process that one british writer has described as counter urbanization for firms connected by the internet it makes sense to locate in suburban regions and smaller towns that are generally safer cleaner and less expensive rather than concentrate in big cities notes economist jed kolko the share of the economy controlled by the five largest metros has declined over the past quarter century this trend was picking up even before the coronavirus pandemic last year austin salt lake city dallas fort worth and phoenix as well as smaller cities like madison wi and boise grew their tech sector twice as quickly as hubs like new york or los angeles there are growing signs that even silicon valley is dispersing evidenced by lyft s move of many key operations to nashville uber s move to establish its second largest office in dallas fort worth and apple s placing of its second largest facility in the suburbs north of austin similar patterns can be seen in europe according to a recent study by economists nima sanandaji and stefan f lster lower costs less crowding and in some places fewer disruptions from migrants and government regulators have created an ideal environment for fledgling tech firms as well as firms from elsewhere interested in placing tech operations in europe tech growth they note is now taking place in more remote places like bratislava which now has the highest percentage of workers in what they define as the brain sector of any european city other rising stars include former soviet dominated cities such as prague bucharest and budapest the transformative role of technology the pandemic which is forcing more people to work remotely will simply enhance an already existing trend in the united states transit use in most cities is stagnant or even down while telecommuting has grown rapidly up 140 percent since 2005 work at home according to the census now exceeds transit usage nationwide and accounts for a greater part of the workforce in greater los angeles north america s second largest urban area in europe the percentage working at home has grown from 7 7 percent in 2008 to nearly 10 percent now in australia where distance is often an issue telecommuting has increased over the last 15 years from eight percent in 2001 to 30 percent last year these numbers may not be consistent and how telecommuters are counted varies sometimes covering people who also work part time in offices but the trend is fairly evident and now seems likely to spread to asia particularly in wake of the current crisis most japanese companies already offer this option in part due to a mounting labor shortage and the growing necessity for children to look after their aging parents with the rise of the virus korean firms like telecommunications giant sk group and many other large firms are shifting to telecommuting this will not work for everyone but thanks to covid 19 its moment may have arrived even before the pandemic the benefits of working remotely were apparent in terms of productivity innovation and lower turnover it appears to be particularly attractive to seniors and educated millennials these digital natives have already accepted the notion that they can accomplish as much at home as in the office as one student told me i don t see the point of driving an hour to go from one computer screen to another in the united states some rural states in particular oklahoma to vermont maine to iowa have developed incentive programs for telecommuters including bonuses for moving and subsidies for establishing a business these often include the option of living in an affordable small town or even a farmstead and still participating in the high end of the global economy which is particularly appealing to experienced older workers as well as young families ultimately the dispersed work model may also be used to combat climate change since working from home can save considerable energy some jobs notably those in hotels airports and theme parks may disappear for violating new norms of social distancing this opens a potential gold mine to firms such as slack now the fastest growing business application on record as well as zoom skype google hangouts and microsoft teams all of which manage real time collaboration on documents spreadsheets presentations and conversations other clear winners include amazon which is hiring 100 000 new workers the food delivery services streaming entertainment services telemedicine and online education providers the long term prospectus neo feudalism or a better new world in the future cities may not be defined as physical places but as what mit s late futurist william mitchell described as cities of bits this is something that did not exist during the middle ages when the most knowledgeable survived in the isolation of monasteries new digital connections could incubate a new urban culture unlike any we have seen as dispersion grows our cities will become flatter and less dense many primary functions food service media business and professional services finance will operate mostly free of unwanted human contact they will be less like le corbusier s super high density radiant city and far more like american architect frank lloyd wright s notion of a broadacre city an expanse of houses and gardens spreading far and wide across the landscape mitchell predicted that these virtual cities could become heavily bifurcated with the wealthy clustered like the socially isolated germ phobic spacers described in isaac asimov s science fiction in hermetically sealed corporate campuses or around university districts 4 the rest of the population could end up living in small apartments constantly worried about infection and living increasingly in virtual reality a new serf class dependent on subsidies or income maintenance provided by the state dispersion might offer a sunnier scenario with people spread out across different regions property would be far less expensive and accessible to the middle classes larger living space could be ideally configured from home based work that would bring back the family oriented capitalism of the early modern era rather than bringing us to a high tech middle ages we could use this crisis to develop a new and more human economic and social model that combines a cosmopolitan outlook with a better and safer way of life joel kotkin is a presidential fellow in urban futures at chapman university in california and executive director of the urban

their renaissance predecessors did during typhus and bubonic plague outbreaks wealthy new yorkers today are retreating to their country homes where they struggle with the locals over depleted supplies of essentials there are huge capacity issues related to cities which aren t discussed enough in our culture even the chinese have problems with it despite the large amounts of wealth they have generated by rezoning in and around cities their 20 largest cities suffer from the same rates of unhappiness that the young in the west report pushed into working in cities to obtain well paying work and then finding all their pay eaten up by endemically high living costs i count my blessings that i live in a rural areas where tractors routinely restrict roads i am only 12 miles from the outskirts of norwich an old provincial capital which serves over 400 000 homes in the surrounding environs i get the best of both worlds a village pond outside my window and a thriving centre of commerce leisure the arts and shopping some very notable exceptions on corona spread in cities hong kong and tokyo asia seems to be able to control the virus more efficiently than europe also in my european country the virus started in a more rural area and not in our multicultural randstad metropolitan area although in absolute numbers the big cities are taking over now obviously it s really too early to predict the end of the megacity it s interesting to see how working from home worked out on a large scale but there are simply so many reasons why people want to live in a big city and then disperse again these reasons may even not always be rational in the first place status or identity could be reasons for example i know america s history is short but waves of urbanisation sub urbanisation and re urbanisation have been going on for centuries in europe and we had fair share of plagues here as well in the end i think these waves will simply continue and extreme sf scenarios like huge globalized city states or a total dispersion are less likely it s really too early to predict the end of the megacity i found the article very interesting and thought provoking but it completely ignored third world cities like lagos and mumbai which show no signs of the dispersion mentioned in the article this is not surprising since much of the dispersion the article talked about requires high technologies nobody is running fibre optics to these guys how can lagos cope with its spiralling population i live in a small 200k city in northern australia from my home or indeed my phone i can access the knowledge and entertainment of the world it takes me 10 minutes to get to my office my wife watches russian tv i have lived briefly in modern cities such as hong kong there are many benefits from such an environment if you are wealthy i would not wish to be poor in such a place i grew up in sydney when i began my working life in 1963 even then public transport took 75 minutes or so to get me to work why would anyone do that if they did not have to i think this article is tapping into the future good one alas the neo feudal thing is not going to wither from geographic dispersion of the cognitive elite i am planning to retire to the old family land in oklahoma although i ll keep this place in the apple this is no city for old men joel kotkin is one of my favorite authors and i agree with much of what he says large cities in the u s particularly those on the coast are becoming third world countries san francisco is a classic example it has more billionaires than any other city they live in posh gated communities and pontificate to the world outside much of which is economically stressed or lives in dire poverty the middle class is literally priced out with rents of 3800 for a s one bedroom apartment and homes that have an median price of 1 44mm meanwhile liberal social policies and lax or absent law enforcement encourage poor and homeless to migrate to the city the idea that we are seeing medieval diseases on san francisco and los angeles is mind blowing to me what kotkin references from asimov is becoming the norm in the coastal cities people who live in hermetically sealed corporate campuses or around university districts the rest of the population could end up living in small apartments constantly worried about infection and living increasingly in virtual reality a new serf class dependent on subsidies or income maintenance provided by the state these cities are also becoming increasingly childless as the middle class moves out however i believe that the telecommuting will be limited we humans are social animals and the move to smaller cities in not accompanied by an increase in telecommuting instead those cities are showing high rates of commercial real estate development and high occupancy rates in office space telecommuting is simply not as effective as working face to face with one another and it is not as much fun but the most important point is that all big cities in the u s do not have the problems of the coastal cities i live in a metropolitan area that is much much bigger than san francisco greater houston but we have few of the problems housing prices are some of the lowest in the country due to construction of new homes and apartments around the periphery of the city in contrast to cities along the coast development of new neighborhoods is encouraged our downtown is clean and the nightlife is vibrant like any big city we have crime but the cops are actually allowed to enforce the laws and large homeless encampments are discouraged i wonder how many of the problems in cities like san francisco are inevitable and how many are self inflicted as a result of the progressive ethos under which they are governed i find the idea of woke urbanites dispersing a kind of epidemic of its own we don t need them infecting rural america no thank you please walls anyone exactly 100 yrs ago a certain russian agronomist alex chayanov wrote his utopia journey of my brother alexej to the peasant land in this futurist utopia the cities had been torn down except the government and administrative offices universities cooperations and some museums and people were living again spread out over the country on and from the land around them everybody with his plot to grow their own food and keep their own hens and a pig for the ham and lard imagine what a fortsight in russia written just after the bolshevik turn over of lenin or perhaps it s time to rethink infinite growth dirk is netherlands halifax is canada they sound nothing alike ray serious microaggression there serious microaggression there i can t get away with anything anymore village pond outside my window i count my blessings as well geary every time the precious says let s sell the place and move to greener pastures i say hang on a few months let s just wait a minute now sit down and rest your feet let me make you a cup of tea children remind us how to play now you know the motivation behind my choice of a nick i ve removed ticks from myself and kids and pets through the years none came close to the size of a dinner plate unless we re talking very high end restaurant with very tiny dinner plates bats are a good idea for mosquito control but at least cook them thoroughly before eating to avoid starting the canadian flu although it would be racist to call such a flu a canadian flu just because it originated in canada i lived in the sf bay area for 14 years from 1996 until 2010 despite being a high tech worker and augmenting my salary with some good stock proceeds housing was out of reach for me i was always astonished as to how expensive homes where in the area i lived in and i looked this up at the time the median income was 97 000 a high amount but it was dwarfed by the median home price which was 1 million at the time even with my tech salary then which was 136 000 homes were completely out of reach i recall viewing a few condos and a townhouse and was shocked by how decrepid and run down they were and often in less than desirable locations like adjacent to a major road or freeway that is one of the pervasive elements of silicon valley that doesn t get enough mention it s not just that the housing is expensive it s that the homes themselves are in terrible shape and often require massive upgrades just to make them liveable the ultimate culprit is the regulatory environment there are huge swaths of silicon valley that could be utilized for housing yet restrictions forbid it a great example is drive on highway 280 north between palo alto and san franciso you will see huge amounts of completely empty land that could be utilized for housing it is an ideal location as well since it would be an effective midpoint between san franciso and the south bay yet nothing is built there the same can be said for large portions of the coastline apart from a few small communities like santa cruz and half moon bay large amounts of the land is untouched ultimately the regulations were put in place by those who built their properties in the 60s 70s and early 80s and then decided they didn t want any other portions of the area to be affected so they could maintain their nice views the end result is that zoning land for housing is nearly impossible rezoning land designated for business parks would also help but that is often not done either and finally due to the earthquake threat building any structure over two stories requires a huge permitting process so you can t build vertically in california you can t build horizontally you can t rezone existing corporate land easily the end result is what you have sky high housing prices and a shortage of available housing the situation is entirely self inflicted 103 more replies pingback the new center thinklab pingback the coming age of dispersion urban reform
