shipments to conflict ridden corners of the globe this intense surge in demand means who warehouses here are running dangerously low on supplies this is the largest operation of its kind in the world for the world health organization by next week the global stockpile here in dubai will be out of goggles any delay in the coming shipment of 2 000 goggles will lead to a delay in the shipment of packages to countries needing these supplies in bulk basically we can t run out said robert blanchard who oversees the emergency operation in dubai for the who we need funding and more important we need raw materials many countries are already struggling to meet their own local demands and have started to impose restrictions on exports of face masks and other protective supplies which impacts supplies internationally due to global shortages in the supply chain right now we re seeing increased demand that has outstripped supplies blanchard said we are now basically kitting them out as soon
