apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic democratic presidential hopeful pete buttigieg said he would expect his department of justice to think for itself when it comes to a potential prosecution of president trump for obstruction of justice after mr trump leaves office that s not quite as far as sen kamala d harris s recent statement that the doj should prosecute mr trump if he s not impeached a sentiment that has gotten pushback from people such as former fbi director james b comey i m just saying it shouldn t be ordered up by the president mr buttigieg said in an interview that aired sunday on cbs s face the nation the whole idea is we re the ones who don t believe that a president ought to be going around calling for their political opponents to be targeted for investigations top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches mr buttigieg the mayor of south bend indiana said if there s suspicion of criminal activity he would expect a justice department that thinks for itself to prosecute the activity and hold everyone accountable with no different treatment for someone because of their political profile in a separate interview he said he thinks the rule of law will ultimately catch up to mr trump it doesn t require the oval office putting any kind of thumb on the scale he said on cnn s state of the union i trust the doj to reach the right determination at least the doj that i would appoint and set up and the less that has to do with directives coming out of the white house the better ms harris one of mr buttigieg s rivals for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination recently said that she would want her justice department to pursue obstruction of justice charges against mr trump after he leaves office if he s not impeached i believe that they would have no choice and that they should yes ms harris said in a recent interview with npr there has to be accountability mr buttigieg was asked on cbs if what ms harris said went too far for him i m thinking about it in terms of the way i would want a doj to work on my watch and part of how it would work is that prosecutorial decisions would not be run out of the oval office he said they would be as far from the political side as possible special counsel robert mueller said recently that he could not exonerate mr trump based on what he found in his investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election but cited a standing justice department policy that prevents a sitting president from being indicted democrats have argued that if mr trump was a private citizen he would have been indicted though attorney general william p barr has said there s not a winnable case against mr trump for his part mr trump dismissed ms harris comments as political oh give me a break she s running for president she s doing horribly she s way down in the polls he said in an interview that aired sunday on abc s this week probably if i were running in her position i d make the same statement without naming any specific candidates mr comey over the weekend warned people vying for public office against engaging in such conversations political candidates and elected officials should not talk about the future prosecution of any individual mr comey tweeted law enforcement decisions must be apolitical mr comey himself announced in july 2016 that while former secretary of state and 2016 democratic nominee hillary clinton was careless in her email practices no reasonable prosecutor would bring a case charging her with mishandling classified information mr barr employed similar logic when he said recently that there s not a winnable case against mr trump for potential obstruction of justice charges stem
