the capitol to the other mr trump slammed the impeachment saga on twitter calling it another con job by the do nothing democrats the house s 228 193 vote to transmit the articles of impeachment also deputized seven democrats to prosecute the case and allocated the use of funds for the trial which is scheduled to begin tuesday that is just two weeks before the president is set to address the nation in front of mrs pelosi s chamber president bill clinton s impeachment trial in 1999 took about six weeks from start to finish that seems like a fairly tight deadline given what we are facing said senate majority whip john thune south dakota republican if we go six days a week once we get started and get through the opening arguments and the questions and the question of witnesses will obviously have to be answered and if people decide they want to call witnesses it could obviously go on for a while sen james lankford oklahoma republican said the trial could be finished in two weeks mr trump is facing two charges mr clinton faced four the feb 4 state of the union address wouldn t be the first time a trial overlapped with the yearly presidential speech mr clinton delivered his 1999 state of the union address on jan 19 the same day his defense team opened its arguments countering the charges against him during the 1999 proceedings the house managers made their arguments over three days and the defense took the same amount of time written questions from senators to both sides were considered over two days if witnesses are called for mr trump s trial the process could go

california will assist the prosecution the impeachment managers and senators will be sworn in by u s chief justice john g roberts jr on thursday but the trial will not officially commence until
