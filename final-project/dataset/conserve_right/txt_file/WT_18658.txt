apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion how china became capitalistby ronald coase and ning wangpalgrave macmillan 100 272 pages a new book by ronald coase age 101 is an event in itself mr coase the 1991 nobel laureate in economics revolutionized the field by challenging conventional wisdom regarding the nature of business firms and how so called public goods can be provided one of his main contributions is the concept of transaction costs which are the costs individuals incur in making an economic exchange in striking contrast to most contemporary economists mr coase did not choose the approach of complicated model making nor did he find delight in crunching numbers instead mr coase wanted to be a scholar of reality he consistently studied markets for what they are rather than for what they might be in this sense he is perhaps the most distinguished contemporary disciple of adam smith mr coase was not among the most prolific economists of the 20th century but he was certainly one of the most influential his new book coauthored with ning wang assistant professor at arizona state university investigates the capitalist awakening of the chinese economy to understand how china became capitalist mr coase and mr wang take a deep look into the chinese mind the authors maintain that china has always been a land of commerce and private entrepreneurship but embraced the institutions of a modern capitalist economy only after one century and a half of self doubt and self denial top stories trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds mr coase and mr wang emphasize how institutional change is not merely the outcome of the interplay of different interests a common vignette of pro market reforms in deng china portrays a ruling class desperately seeking to stay afloat even at the price of watering down its own ideology those who subscribe to this picture argue that such a drift toward pragmatism is best epitomized by deng xiaoping quoting an old sichuan saying it doesn t matter if a cat is black or white so long as it catches mice in this serious attempt to understand how market institutions are breaking through in china lie the hard facts of geography and demography china was simply too big to be run as a centralized economy centralization did exist once in mao s china but only briefly however the central government could never really cope with the size of the country the wide variation in culture and customs and the difficulty in processing information at the needed speed in a way chinese socialism has long been struggling with the fact that as highlighted by mao the territory was so vast and the population was so large that china could not follow the example of the soviet union in concentrating everything in the hands of the central authorities during the 1980s the chinese economy was transformed by four marginal forces private farming township and village enterprises individual entrepreneurship and the special economic zones these played a pivotal role in opening up china to the global market economy shenzen in the southeast corner of the guangdong province was a poor town before becoming the frontline of china s economic integration china would probably have stayed on the intended path to socialism were it not for the marginal revolutions that reintroduced private entrepreneurship to the economy the change was as much institutional as cultural on the institutional side private ownership was restored on the cultural side the chinese political discourse rediscovered the role of thrift self reliance and experimentation entrepreneurship requires risk taking the future is uncertain therefore the entrepreneur bets on his forecasts and intuitions it would be disingenuous to contrast chinese marginal revolutions with the kind of shock therapy that made for a successful transition out of communism in places like poland and the czech republic however these chinese marginal revolutions were certainly no less shocking than shock therapy in eastern europe consider the opening of the stock exchange in shanghai in 1990 one of the 20th century s greatest economists ludwig von mises remarked that there cannot be genuine private ownership of capital without a stock market and there cannot be socialism if such a market is allowed to exist the authors do not assume that china has turned into a liberal democracy nor they do naively believe that its economy can be considered a genuinely free one they acknowledge the oligarchic nature of chinese politics and point to a still depressed and censored market for ideas as a tragedy in itself and an obstacle to future development as the authors note it s a work in progress capitalism with chinese characteristics is very much like traffic in chinese cities chaotic and intimidating for many western tourists yet chinese roads deliver more goods and transport more passengers than those in any other country as china is sure to become a hotly debated focal point in the presidential election this book with its emphasis on markets and history becomes of paramount importance alberto mingardi is an adjunct scholar of the cato
