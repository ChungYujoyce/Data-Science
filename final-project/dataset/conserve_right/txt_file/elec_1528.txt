wrong to nullify the ballot of a so called faithless elector who refused to endorse hillary clinton shannon bream reports on the ruling that could have potential 2020 implications in a major blow to state by state progressive efforts to effectively replace the electoral college with a nationwide popular vote a federal appeals court ruled on tuesday that presidential electors in the electoral college have the absolute right to vote for presidential candidates of their choice democrats have increasingly sought to erase the electoral college apos sinfluence by promoting state laws that would force electors to vote for the national popular vote leader and those laws were now in jeopardy as a result of the court apos s ruling legal experts said the decision however also raised the prospect that electors could legally defect at the last minute and decide the occupant of the white house on their own in dramatic fashion weeks afterelection day the 10th u s circuit court of appeals held that the colorado secretary of state violated the constitution in 2016 when he removed an elector and nullified his vote because the elector refused to cast his ballot for democrat hillary clinton who received a plurality ofthe popular vote both nationally and in colorado the rogue elector was part of an unsuccessful scheme to convince enough members of the electoral college to unite behind an alternative candidate and deny donald trump the presidency the split decision by a three judge panel on the denver appeals court asserted article ii and the twelfth amendment provide presidential electors the right to cast a vote for president and vice president with discretion and the state does not possess countervailing authority to remove an elector and to cancel his vote inresponse to the exercise of that constitutional right the panel continued the electoral college did not exist before ratification of the federal constitution and thus the states could reserve no rights related to it

college more than two dozen states also have laws binding electors to the results of the popular vote in those states but the actual penalties for so called faithless electors are minimal and in many cases non existent the tuesday ruling could spell doom for a new colorado law that effectively signed the state onto the national compact by prohibiting states from forcing their electors to vote for either the national or state popular vote winner or leader other states that have signed onto the compact include rhode island vermont hawaii delaware maryland massachusetts new mexico washington connecticut new jersey illinois california and new york at the same time frank mcnulty an adviser to protect colorado apos s vote which wants voters to overturn the law cautioned that the ruling could also free electors to decide on their own to support the candidate with the most votes nationally or any candidate for that matter it is a double edge decision he said the electoral college system is established in the constitution when voters cast a ballot for president they are actually choosing members of the electoral college called electors who are pledged to that presidential candidate the
