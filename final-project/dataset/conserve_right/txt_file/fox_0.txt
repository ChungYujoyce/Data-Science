fox news in washington president trump capped his 100th day in office with a rally last night in harrisburg pennsylvania touting his accomplishments and goals while the press corps was back in washington for the white house correspondents dinner mr trump was with thousands of supporters and he wasn apost subtle about it begin video clip trump i could not possibly be more thrilled then to be more than 100 miles away from washington spending my evening with all of you and with a much much larger crowd and much better people right end video clip wallace the president reaches the 100 day milestone and as he takes another shot at replacing obamacare pitches for a major tax overhaul and addresses rising tensions with north korea and that aposs where we will begin with president trump aposs national security advisor general h r mcmaster general welcome back to fox news sunday lt gen h r mcmaster national security advisor thanks chris it aposs a pleasure to be here with you wallace president trump said this week that we could end up his words in a major conflict with north korea and hours later saturday morning north korea conducts another ballistic launch isn apost that a deliberate provocation to this president isn apost that open defiance mcmaster it is open defiance it s open defiance of the international community you know north korea poses a great threat to the united states our great allies in the region south korea in particular but also to china and others and so it aposs important i think is for all of us to confront this regime this regime that is pursuing the weaponization of a missile with a nuclear with a nuclear weapon and so this is something that we know we cannot tolerate in terms of a risk to the american people the president has made clear that he is going to resolve this issue one way or the other and what we prefer to do his work with others china included to resolve this situation short of military action wallace both the vice president and the secretary of state have been going around the region in asia and announcing that the era of strategic patience is over now north korea has responded with not one but two ballistic missile tests they both failed but still they went ahead with a missile test doesn apost that mean since you say that the era of strategic patients is over that you have to do something mcmaster well yes we do have to do something and so we have to do something again with partners in the region and globally and that involves enforcement of the u n sanctions that are in place it may mean ratcheting up those sanctions even further and it also means being prepared for military operations if necessary wallace i want to go back to something else the president said because in an interview this weekend with john dickerson on face the nation he said he won apost be happy if north korea conducts a nuclear test do you and the white house distinguish between a nuclear test and a long range missile test do you see one is more threatening mcmaster they are both threatening because developing a nuclear capability has to be matched to a delivery system so it is their the sixth nuclear test is what it would be combined with the ballistic missile program that poses a grave threat to the united states and our citizens as well as our friends and partners in the region wallace you talk about china and the our allies or other regional powers getting involved in this president trump keeps saying he aposs developed a special relationship with president xi that he very much hopes and believes that president xi is going to apply greater pressure ratchet up the pressure on north korea which is a client state having said that here s what the chinese foreign minister said this week at the united nations take a look begin video clip wang yi chinese foreign minister through translator china is not a focal point of the problem on the peninsula and the key to solving the nuclear issue on the peninsula does not lie in the hands of the chinese side end video clip wallace he says north korea is not china aposs responsibility mcmaster well he might want to talk to his president who during the summit with president trump acknowledged that this is a great threat not just to the united states but a may be even more so to china and i think what was most striking about the results of that summit is china s willingness to take ownership of this problem and to recognize that they have to act to help resolve this problem short of a military conflict and so the president i think has been masterful in terms of his development of a relationship with president xi and the discussions that led them to understand that this is a place where u s and chinese interests overlap and at the same time the president has reinvigorated and strengthened our alliances with key nations in the region including south korea and japan wallace do you see china actually doing something mcmaster yes we do see china starting to do something crosstalk mcmaster and you see that in their we ve seen in public statements you aposve seen it in the chinese press you see it with the more strident and stringent enforcement of existing u n sanctions but it is clear more needs to be done we are going to ask china to do more as we do more as our south korean and japanese allies but really all nations have to take a look at this regime it aposs already isolated itself but to further isolate it financially and then also diplomatically to make clear that none of us can accept a north korea with a nuclear weapon and by the way north korea said they re just they re not developing this nuclear weapon just for defensive reasons they said they want to use it to blackmail other nations and they ve be declared that they intent to sell nuclear weapons openly and proliferating nuclear weapons wallace i want to talk about the military option because you are saying that aposs on the table i have been to the region i m sure you aposve been to the region too you go to the demilitarized zone it aposs 30 miles from seoul they have thousands of short range missiles that are aimed at seoul a metropolis of 25 million people also 25 000 u s troops if we were to launch a preemptive strike against their nuclear program their missile program we re talking about human catastrophe aren apost we mcmaster well yes and this is why the president said this is something we don apost want to have to do but what this president has done is he aposs now connected what our military options are with what we re trying to politically for too long those two things were disconnected from each other so you need the viable option the military option to help make what you were doing diplomatically economically with sanctions viable to be able to resolve this problem short of what would be as the president said a major major war and a humanitarian catastrophe wallace but precisely to that point can you envision a situation where north korea becomes such a threat that we re willing to take that risk of a fuselage of short range missiles hitting seoul a metropolis of millions of people mcmaster what the president has first and foremost on his mind is to protect the american people and i don apost think anyone thinks that it would be acceptable to have this kind of regime with nuclear weapons that can target that can range the united states wallace president trump changing just a little bit but same region said this week that south korea should pay for the missile defense system that we have installed there the thaad system 1 billion there is a report today that you called your south korean counterpart and said no the old agreement was that we the united states pay that billion dollars and we re going to stick by that is that true mcmaster well the last thing i would ever do is contradict the president of the united states you know but and that aposs not what it was in fact what i told our south korean counterpart is until any renegotiation that the deal is in place we ll adhere to our word but what the president has asked us to do is to look across all of our alliances and to have appropriate burden sharing responsibility sharing we are looking at that with a great ally south korea we re looking at that with nato and what you ve seen because of the president aposs leadership more and more nations are contributing more to our collective defense wallace so the question of who pays the billion dollars is still up in the air mcmaster the question of what is the relationship on thaad on our defense relationship going forward will be renegotiated as it s going to be with all of our allies because what the president has said is he will prioritize american citizens apos security and interests and to do that we need strong alliances but also to do that effectively and a way that is sustainable economically we need everybody to pay their fair share wallace i want to talk about a couple of other trouble spots around the world the state department has just certified that iran is complying with the nuclear deal the terms of the specific field but it was also made clear that the united states is going to be much tougher when it comes to other iranian actions for instance the support of terrorism but with the west our allies dropping most of their sanctions and now in business doing business eagerly with iran aren apost we the ones who are marginalized i mean even if we wanted to get tough with iran do we really have leverage to enforce our will to back up our threats mcmaster i think we certainly do i think all we have to do is pull the curtain back on iranian behavior this is a regime that is supporting the murderous regime in syria that s committing mass murder of its own people this is a regime that is really applying what you might call a hezbollah model to the greater middle east in which they have weak governments that they want to depended on iran for support while they grow militias and other illegal armed groups outside wallace i don apost doubt that they re bad actors my question is can we enforce sanctions when our allies are not interested in doing that mcmaster well our allies will be interested in doing that and i think what you aposve seen is if what has happened in the last eight years is u s policy has unwittingly maybe empowered iran across the greater middle east and beyond now we are seeing the effect of that with this humanitarian political catastrophe in the greater middle east that iran has helped to foment and so what aposs critical now is a shift in that policy to confront iran and what you aposre seeing is because of the president aposs leadership really strong relationships across the arab world for example and i think that there aposs going to be a tremendous opportunity to confront iran s destructive behavior in the region and beyond the region wallace i ve got two more quick questions for you president trump came into office talk about hoping to improve relations with russia but over these first 100 days and i want to put this up on the screen we aposve learned that russia has violated the inf missile treaty they defended syrian president assad against our claim he used chemical weapons and they are now arming the taliban in afghanistan oftentimes against us in these 100 days general have relations with the kremlin gotten better or worse mcmaster well i don apost think they ve gotten really either better or worse the russian behavior as we aposve seen you know the annexation of crimea the invasion of ukraine the support for this murderous regime in syria and now arming the taliban these are all things that s clearly cut against russian interest especially in connection with the relationship with assad in syria and to arm the taliban none of these groups the taliban groups are not monolithic or homogenous they overlap with others in the taliban s case they overlap with groups like the islamic movement of uzbekistan and then other terrorist groups that posed a great threat to russia so here you have a russian president acting against the russian people aposs interest and doing it i think kind of just reflexively and so can we shift the relationship such that there is room for cooperation in key areas where our interests overlap wallace but you don apost see that now mcmaster you don t see that now i think that s what we are looking for is changes in behavior we need changes in words and the nature of the relationship but what we really need to see is change in behavior wallace final question 100 days end is there a trump doctrine in foreign policy that s taking shape we ve clearly seen that this president is more willing to use force than barack obama was both in the missile strike in syria we got it up on the screen also that huge moab bomb that was dropped in afghanistan but so far general he doesn apost seem to back that up with a clear strategy in fighting isis in winning the war in afghanistan mcmaster his strategy is to advocate for the security and interests of the american people every day and to ensure that we are doing all we can to advance our security and the interest of the american people you see that with the acceleration of the campaign against isis in syria in iraq also you see that with a very effective operations against isis khorasan in afghanistan as well you see that with combining of military force when necessary with diplomatic and economic actions not i mean not regarding military force as separate from what we want to achieve politically and so i would say it aposs competing recognizing that we re in competitions where american vital interests are at stake and advocating for the security of the american people and our interests he also has devolved responsibility down to where it belongs the white house is no longer deploying three helicopters somewhere or having a very strict cap on forces so that you deploy helicopters but don apost send the mechanics with them for example or you contract guards to guard u s infantrymen so he aposs doing things that have made our policy execution much more sensible wallace let the commanders in the field determine what they need mcmaster yes with civilian oversight with policy direction and with the president ensuring that we re combining what we re doing militarily to what we want to achieve politically and our diplomatic and our economic efforts all interconnected wallace general mcmaster thank you thank you for your time today i would love you aposre a straight talker i d love to have you back to talk some more about all of this thank you sir mcmaster thanks chris pleasure to be with you wallace and we ll be tracking what happens in the north korean peninsula this week thank you sir mcmaster thank you wallace coming up senate aposs top democrat chuck schumer gives his assessment of the president aposs first 100 days and responds to charges of democratic obstruction commercial break wallace tens of thousands of demonstrators in the washington heat saturday protesting president trump aposs climate policies on his 100th day in office the president says he is willing to work with democrats on health care and other issues but the top democrat in the senate says mr trump must change his approach if he wants help from the other side of the aisle joining us now from new york the senate democratic leader chuck schumer senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen chuck schumer d ny senate minority leader good to be back chris wallace you and the president had been in quite the war of words these last few days here aposs what the president had to say what about you last night in harrisburg begin video clip donald trump president of the united states schumer is weak on crime and wants to raise your taxes through the roof he is a poor leader known him a long time and he aposs leading the democrats to doom end video clip wallace weak on crime raising taxes leading the democrats to doom your response schumer well look the president name calling doesn apost work let aposs look at values let aposs look at issues i d say the president aposs first hundred days have hardly been a success he aposs broken promises to the working people of america unfulfilled others you know chris when he campaigned he campaigned as a populist against the democratic and republican establishments but he aposs governing like someone from the hard right wealthy special interest let me go over a few areas on trade he promised to be tough backed off on china backed off on mexico on buy america again we have a good strong bill they aposve backed off that a lot of this deal now and infrastructure and water is going to be made overseas on health care he said he covered more people at less cost his bill does just the opposite and maybe the worst is draining the swamp his last days he said wall street won apost be in washington well there are more in this cabinet than others billionaires and there s such closeness i think one of the worst things he did on the swamp is allowing lobbyists to work in the administration on issues they lobbied on and they get waivers that are secret so there aposs been promise after promise that s been either unfulfilled or broken on infrastructure we sent him a trillion dollar plan we haven apost heard a peep out of him we re willing to work with him on issues like this so the bottom line is very simple the president if he works with us particularly on issues like trade and infrastructure we can work but on the issue so far taxes and health care he doesn apost consult us at all he puts together a plan that aposs very hard right special interest wealth oriented and then says your the way to be bipartisan is just support his plan that aposs not how america works chris wallace fox news anchor but senator the trump white house says a lot of what you say and this is not new you aposve been saying this for a while now schumer yes wallace in fact you gave him an f for his first 100 days they d say a lot of your criticism is just not true and let aposs take a look on creating jobs for the middle class they note that he has signed executive orders to cut regulations and red tape pull out of trade deals that he says heard america and to build the keystone and dakota access pipelines on draining the swamp he has imposed a five year lobbying ban on administration officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for foreign countries you say he aposs broken his promises senator but there was a fallout this week and 96 percent of trump voters in the poll said they would vote for him all over only 2 percent said they would not schumer yes well look i think it aposs going to take a while for people to see this but his popularity ratings if you want to measure him overall not just his supporters but with independents and democrats they are way down the lowest of any president and the point being here is that on so many of the major issues they ve gone at it alone have they passed a few executive orders yeah they have most of those are studies on into the future the few that were serious got knocked out by the courts have they repealed a few regulations yes but mainly for coal companies for companies that want to take advantage of workers rights they have broken their promises to the working people of america and americans are seeing that that aposs why his popularity ratings are as lower than any president in history wallace but senator president trump says one of the problems is the constant obstruction by you and your party you know back when republicans were in the minority you liked to call them the party of no today aren apost you schumer well let aposs take his biggest attempt so far health care that wasn apost the democrats he tries to blame the democrats but he didn apost need a single democratic vote to pass it in the house he couldn apost do it he couldn apost do it twice he ought to realize that they ought to back off repealing obamacare we ve said over and over again if he backs off repeal we ll sit down and work with him to improve obamacare let aposs look at his next major issue the tax bill it seems to be a tax bill that s totally aimed at the wealthy interests estate tax get rid of it you know how many people pay the estate tax only each year 5 200 of the various wealthiest americans who have estates over 10 million wallace senator i m going to get through schumer the pass throughs just one more the pass throughs on this on this tax bill would allow hedge fund leaders top wall street lawyers ceos of major corporations to pay 15 percent while their workers pay 20 25 30 percent so he aposs not governing from the middle he aposs governing from a hard right that aposs why his regime has hardly had any major successes with the exception of gorsuch if he changes we could work together wallace ok schumer but he can apost just dictate what he wants not talk to us and say we must support him the country doesn t work my way or the highway crosstalk wallace wait wait you say one more we got there so now let aposs talk about neil gorsuch because that is probably the biggest legislative issue that has come up in these first 100 days the nomination of neil gorsuch to the supreme court the american bar association and some top democratic legal scholars said that he was clearly yes conservative but clearly in the judicial mainstream and a distinguished judge president obama s two nominees sonia sotomayor and elena kagan were both confirmed easily with republican support but with gorsuch senator you led the first partisan filibuster in the history of supreme court nominees that doesn apost sound like cooperation schumer well let me just say this first so did judge roberts and alito under bush get democratic support gorsuch was nurtured and put forward by the heritage foundation and the federalist society ideologically they are so far he is so far to the right and i think the american people will see that as we see his crosstalk schumer let me just say chris you ve got to let me answer this wallace you said farther to the right than ruth bader ginsburg and sonia sotomayor are to the left schumer ok wallace conservative presidents are going to nominate conservative judges and liberal presidents are going to nominate liberal judges as long as they are in the judicial mainstream isn apost that what an election is for schumer well both the new york times and washington post hired independent experts to rate where gorsuch would be the times said he would be to the right of every judge but thomas the most conservative judge we ve had in history and the post analysis said he d be to the right of that so this is not a mainstream judge crosstalk schumer he comes off as mainstream chris let me finish my comment chris he comes off crosstalk wallace you talk about the new york times and washington post neal katyal who is a former general for the democrats the american bar association said he was in the traditional mainstream sir schumer yes they said ruth bader ginsburg they judged by their legal acumen no one doubts gorsuch aposs legal acumen but his judicial rulings and all his comments in his earlier life show that he is far far to the right siding with special interest corporate interests the average middle class person the only recourse they have is the courts gorsuch repeatedly on issue after issue has been far to the right in one case he even went against what thomas and alito said on education of special kids so this is not a mainstream judge appearance is not what matters it aposs how he will rule that matters wallace all right you talk about taxes president trump unveiled his tax it aposs not a whole plan it s an outline of a tax reform plan principles this week here is how treasury secretary mnuchin explained it begin video clip steve mnuchin treasury secretary what this is about is creating jobs and creating economic growth and that aposs what massive tax cuts and massive tax reform and simplifying the system is what we re going to do end video clip wallace senator the government just announced that in the first quarter of this year the economy gdp grew by seven tenths of 1 percent that aposs the slowest rate in over three years doesn apost this economy need some more growth schumer yes it needs growth but it does not need to give the wealthiest people in america huge tax break mnuchin said himself a few months ago the mnuchin rule that the very wealthy would be tax neutral in other words the loopholes they close on them and the things they d take away would be the same they gave this tax plan is not like that at all in addition it adds anywhere from 3 trillion to 7 trillion to the deficit many of our republican friends who railed against the deficit when president obama wanted to help middle class people and the poor people are saying that this is ok i think it aposs going to cause huge problems for america if you aim tax breaks at the middle class we are fine with it if you aim them at the very wealthiest who are doing very well so far god bless them that aposs not going to work it aposs not going to it s not what america needs wallace but senator here is what you failed to mention in your critique of the tax plan the president aposs plan would also double the standard deduction as you can see we got it up on the screen from 12 000 to 25 000 for married couples 70 percent of americans mostly low to moderate income earners take the standard deduction and they would benefit from that doubling of the standard deduction this would be a tax break for them schumer well but he also takes away things like the mortgage interest deduction the local the state and local property crosstalk wallace no does not true he does not take away no he does not take away the mortgage interest deduction schumer you cannot do it if you use it without the standard deduction he takes away state and local as well and middle class people get far less of a benefit many of them were hurt one estimate said that millions would pay more and the rich do extremely well they seem to get 90 95 percent of this tax plan that is not how donald trump campaign it aposs another broken promise that is not what the american people want that is not what the american people need when you rush through a plan like he did and put it on one page it s not going to be very good and this shows it wallace senator schumer thank you thanks for joining us today schumer thank you wallace and i and i just want to say i do not believe that you are leading the democratic party to doom sir schumer thank you very much chris wallace that s all i ll say but i will give you that up next we ll bring in our sunday group to grade the president aposs first 100 days and look at his agenda going forward plus what would you like to ask the panel about mr trump aposs big new tax plan just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the trump administration says all options are on the table when it comes to north korea begin video clip rex tillerson secretary of state we put in place a very deliberate strategy which we are just in the early stages of executing end video clip wallace we ll ask our sunday group about the white house strategy for handling the growing conflict coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip trump we are keeping one promise after another and frankly the people are really happy about it they see what s happening end video clip wallace president trump last night in harrisburg pennsylvania trumpeting his record in his first 100 days in office and i aposm choked up about it time now for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham fox news political analyst and author of we the people now in paperback juan williams former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and rich lowry editor of the national review well rich as a traditional conservative i think it aposs fair to say you were pretty concerned ahead of time about donald trump for all the theatrics and tell me if you think i aposm wrong on this isn t the real story of these 100 days that on taxes and spending and the cabinet and foreign policy he aposs been a pretty conventional republican conservative rich lowry editor national review yes i think that aposs exactly right if you apos wee living on another planet and i know juan probably thinks he aposs been living on another planet for a lot of these 100 days and you weren t getting any of the news about the tweets or the other controversies you were just hearing about substantive things that have happened you would think this is a fairly conventional republican administration doing fairly conventional republican things wallace and does that make you happy lowry yes happier than i expected and look it s not the greatest 100 days ever as trump likes to portray it but gorsuch was a home run he s gotten significant early progress on the border where illegal crossings are down and he s begun the deregulatory rollback the big incomplete though chris is on capitol hill where he still could get health care reform and tax reform but he also could get shutout on both although i think it s likely that he gets taxes rather than health care wallace congresswoman edwards how do you assess these first 100 days donna edwards former democratic congresswoman well it feels like 100 000 but i think he aposs been beaten back on immigration in the courts he hasn apost had a significant legislative achievement health care has gone down twice and it aposs still a disaster and you know this tax plan is not really a tax plan it s a set of taxable ph it aposs so i i i think you know there s a d minus going on on this in this administration so far wallace well that s better than than chuck schumer who gave him a straight f so edwards well you you get you get a plus for signing your name wallace ok there you go the big news this week as the congresswoman mentioned was that the white house came out not with really a plan but an outline bullet points of the president s tax plan tax reform plan here aposs what candidate trump and treasury secretary mnuchin had to say about the plan before they took office begin video clip trump barack obama has has doubled during his fairly short period of years he aposs doubled our national debt doubled it it s going to be close to 20 trillion when he leaves 20 trillion so we have to get rid of at least a good portion of that steve mnuchin treasury secretary now on the upper the upper class we re going to simplify it we re not going to have a tax cut for the upper class end video clip wallace but michael even with just this bare bones outline isn apost it pretty clear that this plan will add trillions of dollars to the national debt contrary to what candidate trump said and that it would mean a substantial tax break for the upper income people michael needham ceo heritage action for america well we don apost have a ballooning national debt because we don apost tax enough our tax rates the percentage of the economy taken by taxes is well above the historic norm and the only way we re going to get out of the debt problems that our nation has is first we need to do entitlement reform and it s good to see the president wallace which the president s not doing it needham well but seemingly moving towards the direction of of maybe doing something and we need to grow the economy and that s why what s so exciting about what he aposs done in the first 100 days is one he s come out with this big bold tax reform plan and tow he s put out with a great plan and and real action to roll back the regulatory state using the congressional repeal ph back ph 13 times wallace but but wouldn t you agree that this plan would add trillions to the to the national debt needham there s trillions being added to the national debt because we are spending way too much we do not have a revenue problem wallace you re not asking my question needham sure this plan wallace i mean i m not saying you know there you could argue that he needs spending cuts as well but would you agree that this cut with all the cuts in revenue is going to add trillions to the debt needham what this plan would do is it would move revenues from where they are today approaching 20 percent of gdp back to the historic post world war ii norm which is 18 5 percent and i love the conversation you had with chuck schumer about taxes for the wealthy and what will this do here i thought you made a great point about the standard deduction but chuck schumer from new york state mentioned state and local tax deduction eighty eight percent of the benefit from the state and local tax deduction goes to people who make over 100 000 it is a subsidy from all of us around the country to states like new york that had terrible fiscal policies and it aposs a subsidy that overwhelmingly 88 percent goes to people making over 100 000 so i think chuck schumer if he wants to be you know a class warfare populist should join a president trump and say let s get rid of this ridiculous tax deduction for citizens in new york and new jersey wallace fair enough we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch on this issue of president trump aposs tax cuts and there was a lot of concern about adding to the national debt murat turkson tweeted this what will it do to the deficit and here is chuck aposs tweet where are the budget cuts to michael s point to match the reduced revenue juan how do you answer them and what do you make of the white house contention that between economic growth and the reduction of some of the loopholes of closing the loopholes and deductions at this tax cut will pay for itself juan williams fox news political analyst well it s all speculative at this point i mean this is all conjecture you know when you ask people even on the conservative side like the tax foundation people they say this will add 4 trillion to 6 trillion over the course of its life you know ten years let s say to the budget debt so i mean to me you know i listen and i i because i i want to be sensitive to the idea because i think most americans would like to pay less tax and think that we should simplify a very complex tax code but what s striking here in washington is that the people who were these loud deficit screeching hawks are now crickets silence chris nothing to say i mean what has what is going on here you look at the idea of doing away with the estate tax the alternative minimum tax this is written by goldman sachs for goldman sachs in the white house by mr trump who said i aposm going to drain the swamp i aposm going to really look out for blue collar workers in states that elected me in wisconsin michigan pennsylvania those folks are getting hosed by this deal and somehow republicans who previously would have especially under obama oh spending out of control silent wallace well we don apost like silence michael i have to ask you about one other subject before we end this segment i want to ask about the heritage foundation that you re associated with there are a lot of stories out that jim demint the head of the heritage foundation is going to be out and that steve bannon may become the new head that this is going to be his safety net as he is forced out of the white house what can you tell us needham that there s a lot of speculation and rumor in the media that never misses a chance to divide and attack conservatives jim demint is a patriot he has had a courageous career in washington and the country and the conservative movement are far better because of that and the heritage foundation is an institution that is committed to formulating and promoting conservative policies and and that is not going to change wallace but is he is is demint out i mean the story that the board wants him out needham i i don apost know there s a lot of speculation and rumor and i aposm not going to add to the speculation and rumor wallace and steve bannon needham there aposs a lot of speculation and rumor and i aposm not going to add to the speculation and rumor williams will you stop leave it there lowry chris inaudible wallace we live at speculation all right panel we have to take a break here that was a definite maybe when we come back another failed missile test by north korea as the trump administration seeks to strategy for dealing with that regime commercial break begin video clip admiral harry harris commander u s pacific command all options are on the table we want to bring kim jong un to his senses not to his knees end video clip wallace admiral harry harris the top u s commander in the pacific emphasizing the trump administration is not looking for a military confrontation with north korea and we aposre back now with the panel rich clearly the policy of these three presidents clinton bush 43 and obama hasn apost worked in stopping north korea s nuclear weapons program do you understand what do you think that the trump strategy is in the ways that it s different from theirs and do you have any confidence it s going to work lowry i think i do which is to engage in saber rattling to try to get the attention primarily of the chinese and shake them loose and get them to pressure the north korea regime more i think critics who have approached it have a dose of modesty as you alluded to the bush era negotiations didn apost work the obama policy of more or less ignoring the north didn apost work so it makes sense to try to catalyze something different i just think the options here are so limited especially the military options it wouldn apost shock me if this policy ends up running in fairy familiar ruts and we ll just try to cut off as much cash as we can for the regime maybe some internal subversion through covert action if we can and then as much missile defense in the region as possible wallace congresswoman edwards if kim jong un is as determined as he seems to be and some thought that this isn t blackmail before he that he thinks the best survival for this administration the chance of survival is to develop a nuclear weapon that that will prevent an invasion or an attack are we headed for a military confrontation because you heard at the top of the show h r mcmaster the national security advisor say we cannot allow that to happen an icbm with a nuclear warhead on the tip edwards no i i think that aposs right although i think that we ve never really used the leverage that we can with china and frankly the leverage that each of these presidents has had is on trade and there s been a patent unwillingness to use our leverage with china on on trade as a way to get the chinese more engaged and in you know trying to hold down north north korea wallace look isn t this president though i mean he really has made an offensive he had the meeting at mar a lago with president xi he keeps talking about that i mean isn apost he working the chinese about as hard as he can edwards no i don apost think so and and and frankly i think that him you know having the conversations which are very confused around whether or not we re going to foot the bill for the thermal defense system has complicated wallace the thaad missile defense edwards the thaad missile defense has actually complicated things because it makes it appear that we re not you know standing with with the south with south korea as we should and so i think it was good for general mcmaster to kind of get that off the table if you will maybe until next time but our leverage with china is on trade our leverage is not in just trying to ask the chinese to do to do what they need to do on that on that border with korea wallace i want to switch subjects it was more trouble this week still more trouble for former retired general michael flynn briefly the president aposs national security advisor as a former military intelligence officer he took over half a million dollars to do work for the government of turkey he took more than 33 000 to make a speech in moscow for russian television and here this week was a top democratic on the house oversight committee begin video clip rep elijah cummings d md oversight committee ranking member this letter explicitly warned general flynn as he entered retirement that the constitution prohibited him from accepting any foreign government payments without advance permission end video clip wallace michael there is reportedly no evidence that general flynn got that permission before he made that speech in moscow or took this big consulting job for turkey needham yes no evidence that he got the commission no evidence that he s disclose it he actually did disclose it it appears and so i think every day that goes by is further justification of donald trump aposs decision to get him out of there and get him out of there early michael flynn s going to be a distraction going forward there aposs no doubt he s going to keep popping up i think the real story though is that there is now a national security team in place with general mcmaster who did such a credible job at the top of the show secretary mattis secretary tillerson nikki haley up in new york there aposs an incredible national security team that is navigating some of these crises and michael flynn is going to be in the news but fortunately not part of the national security apparatus wallace juan let let me pick up on that because in an interview on friday president trump blamed flynn and the lack of vetting and screening of him on his predecessor take a look begin video clip trump he was approved by the obama administration at the highest level and when they say we didn apost vet well obama i guess didn apost vet because he was approved at the highest level of security by the obama administration end video clip wallace so is michael flynn are his problems barack obama s fault williams wow talk about spin i my head is spinning i mean it s unbelievable look the fact is flynn had been in the intelligence agency going back to the bush administration he sought renewal in 16 chris and when he did so he did not disclose that aposs what we aposre talking about this week he did not disclose any contacts that you know or seek permission for taking payments from russia or or turkey or anybody else so what you have here is a situation where michael flynn even subsequent to the renewal then engaged in contacts and we know sally yates then the acting attorney general went to the obama administration and said or went to the trump administration and said this guy s lying about his contacts with the russians and we know that he also hid information from vice president pence and that donald trump the president sat on that information for three weeks before firing him wallace but but the president says he was vetted by barack obama williams he didn t take he he was vetted again in apos16 when he saw that renewal but at that point he had not committed these acts that we are discussing now edwards but let s be clear president obama fired him and then he went into the into the trump camp and so this can apost be placed at the foot of president obama at all this is a trump lowry trump trump fired him too he s been fired by everyone edwards so lowry i think trump clearly showed bad judgment being so close to him making him national security adviser but this scandal at the end of the day has much more to do with flynn than with the trump administration or the or so called russian scandal williams why edwards well i don apost think we know that yet and this is the reason that we need a strong independent investigation because i don apost think we know that at all we know what we know about flynn but we don apost know all of the details and i think it aposs time for an independent investigation to follow that money wallace i want to give michael 30 seconds to say why an independent investigation is not a good idea needham well i think an independent investigation is i think there s plenty of investigations going on right now there s generally been good cooperation between the republicans and democrats on those there was a little bit of a brouhaha this past week about whether information wallace particularly in the senate there seems to be an investigation needham and so i think that you know the best thing that we can do is there aposs a lot of of kind of things going back and forth let s let these investigations play out and let aposs talk about it when it aposs all over wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week a crime fighting tool making guns and bullets to solve crimes this is pretty cool but first president trump as you know didn apost attend last night aposs white house correspondents dinner but that didn apost stop the headliner hasan minhaj from roasting the president and his administration begin video clip hasan minhaj i get why donald trump didn t want to be roasted tonight by the looks of him he aposs been roasting non stop for the past 70 years end video clip commercial break wallace donald trump became the first president this week since ronald reagan to address the national rifle association but while he reaffirmed his support for gun rights one of his agencies is using remarkable technology to solve crimes committed with guns here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape jim ferguson atf chief of firearms operations we could take the exact same make model of a firearm off of an assembly line and one will leave one impression and the next one will be a very unique different impression wallace in effect fingerprints ferguson correct wallace voice over jim ferguson is head of the atf s firearms operations division and he aposs talking about nibin a national ballistics database that helps connect guns to crime scenes some of the best evidence after a shooting are the spent bullet cases which have been ejected from guns police take 2 d and 3 d images of the cartridges unidentified female this would be what we would consider an ibin ph leave ph wallace at the atf s national laboratory outside washington they checked the new casings against the 3 million they already have from other crime scenes looking for matches left by the firing pin stress marks and the gun aposs cartridge ejector ferguson so what she ll do is she ll then match the two of them up and then turn them so that you can it aposs almost like looking at it inside out wallace on camera right ferguson so that you can see the depth and and the similarities in those depths wallace how precisely can you tell this same gun fired this cartridge in chicago and this cartridge in denver ferguson the system itself is more than 95 percent accurate and for us to be able to link people whether it be a suspect in one shooting and no information in the other shooting we now have a potential suspect because those two incidents are related by the same gun unidentified male i have the 40 s w glock i m going to load into the magazine well ok we re ready to fire two rounds wallace voice over when guns are found at crime scenes they can be fired into a tank of water you can see the bullet case that s ejected from the gun the markings from the cartridge can then be checked in the database to see if that gun has been used in other crimes and if a criminal has filed off a gun s serial number well that aposs no problem for atf to recover all of this raises a sensitive question wallace on camera you enter the evidence from crime scenes do you take this kind of fingerprint of a gun at the point of manufacture ferguson no absolutely not we do not have any sort of a manufacturer point on the front end because we are prohibited from having any sort of a gun registry and this allows us to keep it so that only crime guns are entered into the system wallace voice over atf has even set up this mobile forensic lab to take its ballistic database into the field how effective is nibin as a crime fighting tool ferguson we are trying to identify that very small population of shooters who are actually pulling the trigger and causing our communities you know considerable harm end
