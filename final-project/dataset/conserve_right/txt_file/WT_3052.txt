apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion a few weeks ago authorities in nigeria uncovered hundreds of cases of horrendous abuse of boys at so called islamic reform schools almajiris abuse so wicked it was described by one local law enforcement official as tantamount to modern slavery but don t expect cair national the council on american islamic relations headquartered in washington d c to do much about it the organization with a mission to enhance the understanding of islam encourage dialogue protect civil liberties empower american muslims and build coalitions that promote justice and mutual understanding is much too busy drumming up hate crime charges against a tj maxx shopper a shopper the group goes out of its way to classify as a white woman and deceitfully a trump supporter to worry about islam tied abuse of little boys top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender first the big story the one where muslim school officials were busted

nigerian tribune that he had been abducted and chained up for three months so that he would learn about the koran and islam an outrage a human rights tragedy and that bit alone the part about being chained as part of the education process of islam would seem should seem perfect for cair response right cair after all touts a mission that s dedicated to dispelling common myths about muslims particularly those supposed myths that paint islam as a religion of extremism bent on a convert or die type of proselyting but here s what cair national s focused on instead spreading unproven allegations about a white woman s assault of a muslim shopper at t j maxx in the bay ridge neighborhood of brooklyn new york spreading hysteria about supposed islamophobia facts be danged spreading more allegations unfounded about the inherent anti muslim hate of president donald trump supporters what s known is this a woman shopping at t j maxx in brooklyn over the weekend was captured on video coming out of the store holding up her middle finger slapping at the camera and warning get out of my face or i m going to f you up and then being escorted by her friend from the scene as she vowed i m gonna hit him i m gonna hit him the video doesn t explain why the woman was angry the video doesn t give any context of what transpired in the store between this woman and the guy shooting the video later identified as a muslim man named mido mourad who was shopping for winter clothes with his family mourad it was also identified later not by cair but rather by the new york daily news is a journalist from cairo living in the city enter cair national with a sob story of a hate crime against an innocent muslim family while a muslim family was shopping inside the tj maxx in bay ridge a white woman began to harass the family and yelled at them to go back to your country the family asked for assistance from tj maxx to deal with the harassment but were allegedly refused any help cair wrote on its website the family called the police and while waiting the white female assailant allegedly attacked and struck the muslim man the family filed harassment complaint with nypd the family captured the assault on video except the video doesn t exactly show that the video shows an angry new yorker doing what angry new yorkers do flipping the bird the slap at the camera was over the top but hardly to the level of what cair and this muslim man slash journalist painted from cair national s twitter feed cair ny pols demand hate crime investigation after woman attacks muslim family in brooklyn store yells go back to your country another cair tweet a day or so earlier my wife and i were attacked by this white lady at t j maxx in bay ridge we were at the tj maxx trying to buy winter clothes for our twins mourad said that tweet linked to a story from the new york daily news referring to the attacker as a trump supporter another cair tweet a couple of hours before that one it is unacceptable that tj maxx would value the business of a bigot over protecting their muslim customers from repugnant harassment said cair ny litigation director ahmed mohamed another before that breakingnews video cair ny calls for hate crime probe of anti muslim anti immigrant assault at tj maxx in bay ridge islamophobia racism immigration whitesupremacy and yet another before that video cairnewyork calls for hatecrime probe of anti muslim anti immigrant assault at tjmaxx in bay ridge good lord it s as if the woman had been wielding a knife stabbing away while shouting all glory to god or something the media absent the facts ran with the cair version patch reported muslim family attacked at brooklyn tj maxx video the new york daily news reported pols demand hate crime investigation after woman attacks muslim family in brooklyn store yells go back to your country and newsweek wrote this muslim family says trump supporter harassed then in tj maxx store yelled go back

crazy trump supporter attack muslims in nyc mourad wrote in english above a post he penned in a foreign language and now the pressure s on for police the community government whomever to do something do something to stop the islamophobia of trump supporters it s all such deception it s all so preliminary and absent facts but that s cair for you that s the anti trumping media for you in plain sight is a story of egregious islam tied abuse and violence against little boys no less but rather than report that inconvenient truth rather than focus on any uncomfortable truths of islam and sharia that might cast negative light on the muslim community islam s apologists distract with a tale of woe about an islamaphobic white woman er make that an islamaphobic angry white woman oh wait make that an islamophobic angry white trump supporting white woman yeah that ll work good one cair it s just too bad about those poor nigerian boys isn t it too bad so sad but there are trump supporters to fry
