afraid that when all votes are counted they won t have the votes to win said florida democratic party chair terrie rizzo the florida recount with republican candidates leading close senatorial and gubernatorial races has spawned an electoral free for all of political activists partisan lawyers and party honchos angling for an advantage president trump has injected himself into the recount rumble for senate between republican gov rick scott and democratic sen bill nelson when will bill nelson concede in florida the characters running broward and palm beach voting will not be able to find enough votes too much spotlight on them now mr trump tweeted mr scott clings to a lead that withered from roughly 60 000 on election night to just more than 12 500 by saturday afternoon as vote counting continued in broward and palm beach counties sen marco rubio florida republican repeatedly joined the partisan scrum he slammed incompetent lawbreaking election officials and accused democrats attorneys of trying to game the system you cannot change the rules of the game after the game in order to win because that would be stealing an election and that would be unacceptable mr

to 2 500 ballots based on having 15 tags that could mean that approximately 37 500 ballots could have been tampered with lawyer derek a schwartz wrote on capitol hill mr scott showed up for new member orientation on the assumption that his lead will stick mr scott s team has started to refer to him as senator elect scott in mailings although he insisted it wasn t necessary mr scott bowed to demands from mr nelson and some leftist groups that filed lawsuits seeking his recusal from certifying the election i recused myself from certifying results on the elections canvassing commission in 2014 and i will do so again this year he tweeted this is nothing new bill nelson is confused and doesn t even know how florida works i have no role in supervising overseeing the ongoing recount process mr nelson who has been largely off the stage since election day save for an appearance tuesday in washington with senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat released a taped statement wednesday some of his attorneys then entered federal court in tallahassee on one of the myriad lawsuits that the postelection confusion has birthed this one challenging the ability of what mr nelson calls untrained election officials from tossing ballots on which the signatures of voters didn t appear to match those on file given the closeness of this election and the fact that the courts have declared signature matching laws unconstitutional in several states we expect this issue to be of considerable importance here in florida mr nelson said it remains the most important goal of my campaign to make sure that every lawful vote be counted correctly in this senate race and that floridians right to participate in this process is protected to hear the scott team tell it the flurry of lawsuits and the inability or unwillingness of democratic elections supervisors in palm beach and broward counties to abide by state laws governing recounts are part of an effort to protect mr nelson s flagging chance of overcoming mr scott s lead at least nine lawsuits have been filed in the senate recount five from mr scott s legal team and four from mr nelson s mr nelson s effort is spearheaded by veteran democratic lawyer marc elias who flew in from washington a partner at the democrat connected firm of perkins coie mr elias is a heavy hitter who represented hillary clinton in her 2016 presidential run and fought previous election battles including the 2008 minnesota recount that overturned al franken s election day loss to put him in the senate complainants in legal action targeting mr scott include the liberal groups votevets common cause and the league of women voters on the conservative side larry klayman founder of the activist group judicial watch is suing broward county elections supervisor brenda snipes on charges of fraud misconduct and corruption and for denying the group access to inspect ballots the cases have landed in the courtroom of u s district judge mark e walker who compared the experience to a well known star trek episode i feel a little bit like captain kirk in the episode with the tribbles where they start to multiply he said from the bench wednesday as the recount closed in on a thursday deadline mr scott led the senate race by more than 12 500 votes in the governor s race republican rep ron desantis topped democratic tallahassee mayor andrew gillum by about 33 000 votes the democrats best bet to close the gap and claim victory was finding votes that eluded the nov 6 tally such as undercounted ballots democratic attorneys have pointed to what they consider an implausible undercount in broward county where roughly 25 000 more votes were cast in the governor s race than in the senate contest that could indicate votes missed by counting machines or from voters improperly marking their ballots they said mr elias has previously argued that leads as large as mr scott s are insurmountable and the scott campaign said wednesday that he and other democratic attorneys are arguing against the inclusion of votes in arizona recounts that they say should count in florida meanwhile florida officials have reached out to the department of justice about some odd communications in four counties okaloosa santa rosa broward and citrus there it appears florida democrats gave bad information to voters by mail the mailings said
