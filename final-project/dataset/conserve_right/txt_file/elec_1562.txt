assured a year from now we will be hosting this show from the national mall as the next president of the united states takes the oath of office will that president be donald trump well as of now republicans in washington feel confident that it will be the official economic numbers are strong the democratic primaries are a freak show elderly socialists accusing each other of thought crimes trump addresses world economic forum in davos touts trade deals us economy republicans are starting to think that victory is assured and that apos s a mistake america remains as divided as it was three years ago so no matter what happens nobody is going to win this election in a national landslide those don apos t happen anymore trump could lose will he lose well that depends entirely on what he runs on in 2016 donald trump defeated more than a dozen republicans and then hillary clinton by running as an insurgent a man from outside the system flipping the bird to the elites within virtually everything trump said reinforced that message click here to get the opinion newsletter the people who run this country are clueless they have no idea what they apos re doing they don apos t care about you they apos ve hollowed out our economy crushed the middle class they apos ve screwed up our foreign policy they left the door open on our southern border they are children playing leadership and they apos ve gotten rich doing it the result is a national catastrophe now trump apos s campaign summed up that message in a single phrase make america great again in other words let apos s not lie to ourselves this is a disaster the good news is we can fix it now the people in charge hated to hear that of course because it implicated them but voters responded they knew it was true by the way it apos s still true today things are a lot better in a lot of ways but they apos re not fixed consider the state of the economy the big numbers unemployment and inflation to name two tell one story and it apos s a good story the candidate who makes it easier for 30 year olds to get married and have kids will win the election and will deserve to win remember that it s truer than any economic theory conceived on any college campus in the last hundred years but dig a little deeper a pew poll from this fall provides a glimpse of what is actually happening in a lot of parts of the country in that survey 56 percent of americans said the economy was excellent or good and that apos s good news but then there was this only 31 percent of the economy was helping them and their families just 32 percent thought the current economy was helping the middle class 58 percent thought the opposite among lower income republicans 47 percent said economic conditions were hurting them just 30 percent said they were helping now keep in mind these aren apos t sociology professors from the oberlin faculty lounge this is the president apos s core it apos s his base why do they feel that way it apos s not personal it apos s just really simple for a lot of middle class people wages are not keeping pace with expenses child care housing education health care they apos re all getting more expensive by the year the student loan bubble is still inflating it apos s burdening young people with debts so large they can apos t start families now these are economic problems but they require a political solution the candidate who makes it easier for 30 year olds to get married and have kids will win the election and will deserve to win remember that it apos s truer than any economic theory conceived on any college campus in the last hundred years improve people apos s lives and they will vote for you period republicans ought to write that on our hands otherwise the temptation will be to focus entirely on the lunacy on display on the left right now democrats have gone crazy and it apos s definitely worth pointing that out repeatedly we do it five nights a week but it apos s not enough to win winning candidates come with their own program they convince voters they will make things better bernie sanders may get the democratic nomination and if he does every republican in washington will spend the next 10 months reminding you that socialism does not work and never has worked and they apos ll be right obviously but if sanders pledges to forgive student loans he will still win many thousands of voters who went for donald trump last time why because debt is crushing an entire generation of americans republicans need to make a plan to make it better or they will be left behind and one more piece of advice don apos t ignore the social issues the republican establishment despises this conversation if it apos s not about tax rates they don apos t want to talk about it but normal people know the social fabric is coming apart a winning candidate will say that out loud defend traditional values don apos t be embarrassed about it there apos s nothing embarrassing about it democrats are waging the most aggressive possible campaign against everything normal people think is virtuous they are promising to undo our justice system emptying our prisons even as they undermine the police and strip you of your right to defend yourself they apos re openly inviting chaos they want to give the vote to convicted felons even murderers they apos ve said that they think so little of this country that they apos re pledging to open our borders to the world every impoverished nation on earth welcomed here for free health care paid for by you they apos re opposed to free speech they apos re stridently for subsidized abortion up to the moment of birth they want americans sorted into creepy little categories by their dna judged rewarded punished on the basis of their sex and skin color they don apos t simply deny the existence of biological sex they apos re trying to force you to deny it too you apos ll be fired if you disagree or have your kids taken from you democrats aren apos t promising change they are promising revolution centuries of american history and custom abolished a nation starting over from scratch year zero that apos s effectively what they apos re calling for and most people are not for that they may be frustrated with the state of the country many are they may be anxious about the future but they don apos t hate america they don apos t want to topple george washington and implement maoism they are conservative in the most basic sense they love their families above all they distrust radical theories of anything because they know and they apos re right that when the world turns upside down ordinary people get hurt click here to get the fox news app they don apos t want to burn it down they just want things to get better the candidate who promises to make them better incrementally but tangibly will be inaugurated president a year from now adapted from tucker carlson apos s monologue from tucker
