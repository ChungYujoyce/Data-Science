 tonight s third and final 2012 presidential debate will feature 90 minutes on foreign policy an extremely important set of issues of course but not a subject area that sits atop voters list of concerns this year as president obama and governor romney enter tonight s third round bout a cross section of polls are converging to cement a clear pre debate trend the republican challenger has established a modest lead over the incumbent nationally while building momentum in critical battleground states let s take a peek at some of the data 1 rasmussen and gallup the two primary daily tracking polls both show romney in the lead among likely voters rasmussen pegs romney s edge at two points 49 47 while gallup again shows a larger cushion 51 45 the gop candidate has held a lead of greater than five points in this poll for more than a week for the third straight day rasmussen s slightly more volatile swing state tracker shows romney out front by a handful of points today it s 49 46 2 nbc wsj this national survey has consistently been among least kind to republicans in recent months yet it can t avoid picking up on the emerging trend dan covered this poll yesterday it shows a 47 47 tie as nbc s chuck todd says sitting at 47 percent two weeks out isn t a position of strength for an incumbent president 3 politico gwu romney has vaulted out to a slight lead in this poll for the first time at 49 47 the partisan sample is d 4 which is generally reasonable but might overstate democrats turnout edge by a hair in the poll s swing state sub sample romney leads by the exact same margin but hits the 50 percent mark ed morrissey says the survey s internals paint a slightly rosier picture for the gop ticket two keys suggest romney s doing better than his toplines first he s winning the gender gap romney gets a 10 among men while obama gets a 8 among women for a 2 advantage for romney in 2008 obama had a 14 gender gap advantage over john mccain obama wins single women but is getting clobbered among married women 42 55 romney s also leading among women without children overall 50 46 suggesting that women who already know how to access birth control aren t terribly concerned about it as an election issue the second key is age demographics obama has a 30 point lead among voters 34 years and younger but that s his only win he and romney tie among 35 44yos at 48 each but romney has double digit leads among 45 64yos 54 44 and seniors 58 38 those last two demographics are the most likely to vote in the election younger voters tend to be the most pro obama cohort but they re also the most disillusioned group and are less likely to vote than any other demographic team romney would happily accept a double digit loss among millenials if they can lock up large margins among older voters 4 monmouth university romney 48 obama 45 the three point romney edge in the top line is nice but again the sitting president at 45 percent is the bigger result how does the republican build his advantage carrying independents handily on every major question here are a few examples indies only head to head romney 52 obama 33 favorability romney 22 obama 15 economy and jobs romney 57 obama 34 medicare and social security romney 53 obama 33 budget and deficits romney 57 obama 29 foreign policy romney 49 obama 39 monmouth s overall sample was d 4 which explains the relatively close top line outcome let s close with a quick look at fresh state polls colorado romney 50 obama 46 iowa romney 47 obama 47 ohio romney 48 obama 48 the first two surveys are from rasmussen the ohio datais from the firm angus reid whose buckeye state results closely mirror two additional polls that came out yesterday national review s numbers muncher josh jordan explains why the ohio data may be stronger for romney than meets the eye hint partisan samples and independents the poll from gravis marketing shows obama and romney tied at 47 percent but that s as good as it gets for obama among the most interesting tidbits from the poll romney leads obama by 19 percent among independents 52 33 and holds 92 percent of his base compared to obama s 87 percent obama is underwater in job approval 44 50 and independents disapprove of him overwhelmingly 31 58 the gravis poll is a d 9 and ppp s is d 8 this assumes that the 2012 electorate will be more democratic than 2008 an assumption that seems inoperative given the early voting tightening quinnipiac also released an ohio poll today showing obama ahead by 5 points despite its ludicrous d 9 breakdown the survey shows romney gaining don t forget it was the q poll that all butdeclared the race over in florida ohio and virginia late last month oops in short with nearly two weeks left until election day republicans have ample reason to be optimistic maybe not quite this optimistic though the race is nip and tuck and one never knows when the trajectory might shift again tonight is the last head to head event leading up to november 6 and therefore may present the president with his best shot at re shuffling the deck update more red flags for team o from that nbc wsj poll a large majority of voters say that if obama is re elected they want to see him dramatically alter his policies he s basically been running a stay the course campaign we ve come too far etc so voters have plenty of reason to doubt the president s ability to well change update ii hey look another ohio poll showing the race exactly tied alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter
