state of the union let aposs bring in kevin corke reporting from the president aposs retreat in mar a lago with the latest kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris just three more days until the

sent overnight by the president certainly after midnight in which he accused democrats of using the impeachment process as a brazenly political process that damage the gop and boost their chances chris in 2020 chris wallace kevin corke reporting from mar a lago kevin thank you earlier i spoke about the senate trial with a member of the president aposs defense team alan dershowitz professor emeritus at harvard law school and offer of the new book guilt by accusation begin videotape wallace mr dershowitz let aposs start with the senate aposs decision by vote of 51 49 not to call witnesses the republicans had the votes so they won but is there a legal justification a legal reason for not calling evidence when there aposs substantial new evidence dershowitz yes as i argued to the senate if someone were accused of the crime of abuse of power or dishonesty something that aposs not a crime what you do is you make a motion to dismiss and the other side says no we want to introduce evidence no no no you can apost introduce evidence if there aposs no legitimate indictment here the articles of impeachment did not charge an impeachable offense so the right answer is to dismiss it and cut it off right there no amount of witnesses could have changed that conclusion wallace ok but the top democrats in congress nancy pelosi in the house chuck schumer in the senate say that the failure to call witnesses is going to put a taint on any acquittal listen to em dershowitz sure begin video clip schumer this country is headed towards the greatest cover up since watergate rep nancy pelosi d ca well he will not be acquitted you cannot be acquitted if you don apost have a trial end video clip dershowitz of course you can be acquitted if they don apost have a trial if they don apost charge you with a legitimate crime it aposs the fault of nancy pelosi and the others for failing to charge an impeachable offense wallace but they aposre going to say they say he aposs never going to be truly acquitted because you didn apost have witnesses you didn apost have no evidence you dismissed it before you even really got to hear what the facts were dershowitz well in the criminal context that would be called a victory a great victory here if they haven apost charged an offense then maybe he hasn apost been acquitted but he also hasn apost been charged he aposs in exactly the same situation he should have been in had they done the right thing and not impeached him at all wallace you created quite a controversy dershowitz i did wallace with something you said in the senate trial here is what you said and here aposs some of the blowback begin video clip dershowitz if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in an impeachment sen dick durbin d il if you can identify something that aposs in your political interest and say that aposs the national interest then all bets are off end video clip wallace here aposs what i don apost understand dershowitz right wallace you have made it clear and you and i went at it last week on the question of you say that to be an impeachable offense it aposs got to be a crime dershowitz criminal like behavior akin to treason and bribery that aposs what the constitution means what it says treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors wallace so then why get into this question of whether or not the president thinks his reelection is in the public interest because you seem to be implying that somehow that gives him an extra level of immunity dershowitz no no it doesn apost i was asked a question by a senator the question was does quid pro quo matter and my answer is it matters if what the president did is illegal or wrong but if the president did something completely lawful the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo that aposs what i said i never said i don apost mean and i don apost believe that a president should do anything if he thinks in his national interest look i supported the impeachment of richard nixon he thought that the five crimes he committed were all in national interest these folks have totally distorted quite deliberately because they saw that i was having an impact on some of the senators so they deliberately distorted what i said and said oh even if it aposs criminal if the president thinks it aposs in the best interest it can apost be an impeachable offense nonsense i never said it crosstalk dershowitz wall street journal says i never said it the new york times says i never said it and the fact that schumer and schiff and cnn say i said it doesn apost make it true wallace but again i don apost even know why intent is an issue and why you got into it dershowitz because i was asked wallace but my point is the activity is what you say is the key if it aposs criminal or criminal like activity then it can be impeachable if it aposs not criminal activity it doesn apost matter what the motive is ph dershowitz well the example i gave i said there were three levels of motive the example i gave is as the president says i aposm not giving you your money ukraine unless you give me a million dollar kickback of course that aposs criminal wallace right dershowitz and of course he goes to jail abraham lincoln sent the troops home to indiana to vote for republicans in the election was that impeachable no wallace but it wouldn apost matter what his motive was dershowitz well it doesn apost matter to me but it matters to schiff and it matters to to the people on the other side they were focusing on motive i was responding to them i didn apost put that in my original speech because you aposre right it aposs not relevant to my argument but i was on the floor to respond to constitutional arguments i was asked that question and then it was deliberately wrenched out of context wallace you seem pretty upset about it dershowitz i was very upset about that because it it has hurt me if people think i actually believe a president like nixon can do anything he wants it aposs exactly the opposite of what i aposve been teaching arguing and as a civil libertarian believing in for 50 years how dare they deliberately and willfully distort my position and then not give me an opportunity to respond wallace all right forget impeachment for a moment i aposm asking you this and may you aposll agree to do it or not but a thought experiment dershowitz sure wallace alan dershowitz citizen do you find it troubling problematic that a president would link in any way forget his motive and i aposm not saying it aposs criminal his support for an ally and even military aid for an ally to investigating his political opponent dershowitz an on election day as a citizen i will allow that to enter into my decision who to vote for but it aposs not an impeachable offense and i was there to argue a constitutional issue not to tell people who to vote for for president i aposm a liberal democrat wallace so are you going to tell me whether or not you find it troubling dershowitz of course any citizen would find that troubling if it were proved yes that would be troubling troubling is the criteria for impeachment wallace i am i aposm not asking about impeachment dershowitz according to schiff unless you do the right thing you aposre impeachable and doing something troubling is impeachable that aposs not what the framers set ph out wallace so you do think that linking aid to an ally dershowitz if a president wallace for your to investigating your political opponents dershowitz if a president linked aid to an ally to personal benefit that was not in the public interest that would be wrong that would be a reason for me not to vote for him wallace and when you say in a public interest just the fact that it might help his reelection does that make it dershowitz no that wouldn apost qualify as the public interest the fact that it would help eliminate corruption in the ukraine a country which i have been to i represented the former president of ukraine i know a lot about corruption in the ukraine the fact that wallace but you seem to be saying right here professor that what donald trump did was wrong and troubling but it wasn apost impeachable crosstalk dershowitz no no what you said is of a president did it solely for his own interest would it be would it be wallace i never used the word solely dershowitz ok but i aposm using it if a president had wallace what difference does it make if he did it partially dershowitz oh every president has an eye on electability wallace we aposre not talking about electability we aposre talking but investigating your political rivals dershowitz but if a president does it for mixed motives he says 90 percent of my motive is i want to get rid of corruption let aposs assume a guy named joe biden goes and says to somebody in the ukraine unless you stop unless you fire the investigator i aposm going to cut off the money let aposs assume 90 percent of what he had in his mind was the public interest but in the back of his mind he says you know maybe it will help my kid he works for the company that would not be impeachable that would not be corruption when you have mixed motives you can apost turn innocent conduct into criminal conduct that was my point wallace ok finally i want to ask you about you aside from this case dershowitz sure wallace your role and your sense of yourself as a defense lawyer over the years you have represented some pretty controversial figures i think dershowitz to say the least wallace to say the least o j simpson mike tyson jeffrey epstein i understand the principle of everyone has a right dershowitz right wallace to a counsel to defense dershowitz right wallace but why would you spend your time why would you spend your talents defending such unsavory characters dershowitz because the constitution requires that the most despised people the most controversial people must get a defense i litigated cases in the soviet union and in other places where people who are despised by the public and by the government couldn apost get a lawyer and i decided after being in the soviet union i would never allow public opinion to impact my decision i would have been crosstalk wallace what about your personal opinion inaudible about some people that you aposd say you know they have a right to a defense i just don apost want to be part of it dershowitz no i because i was a professor for 50 years and i have no excuse for not taking cases i want to be part of cases were nobody else can get is willing to come in and do the case i want to be part of controversial cases this case i didn apost do it for that reason this case wallace no i aposm not i aposm not talking about this case dershowitz this case i do it because the constitution was being absolutely compromised in its crosstalk wallace in these other cases if you end up because of your talents you end up getting them off your crosstalk dershowitz i hope so i mean i never want to take a case where i don apost win i aposve won a lot of cases because the law or the facts were on my side often the facts are against me but the law is on my side look to me my hero was john adams standing up for the people the murderers in the boston massacre and accepting all the opprobrium that was heaped upon them because he said i want to show the king of england that we in america believe that everybody is entitled to a defense he defended them and it almost destroyed his career and his personal life he did the right thing and i aposm going to continue to do that for as long as god gives me the strength to defend people who are guilty innocent popular or unpopular wallace professor dershowitz you show no sign of slowing down thank you dershowitz thank you wallace always good to talk with you sir dershowitz my pleasure thank you end videotape wallace up next countdown to iowa democratic candidate senator amy klobuchar joins us live from the campaign trail as she makes a big move late in this race as fox news sunday continues its coverage of super bowl liv live from hard rock stadium in miami gardens florida commercial break wallace welcome back to miami gardens florida and hard rock stadium home of super bowl liv on fox well tonight aposs game is just the first big contest this week tomorrow night thousands of folks in iowa will go to schools and churches and firehouses across that state to caucus and give us the first results of the democratic presidential race joining us now from des moines candidate and senator amy klobuchar who aposs hoping to build on her recent momentum there senator something interesting is happening in iowa and i want to put up the numbers back in august you were sitting at 3 percent and you stayed there for quite a while but in recent weeks you aposve surged to almost 10 percent closing in on the top tier what is going on and where are you going to finish on monday night klobuchar you know it is an open game here to your super bowl analogy and by the way congratulations on having the super bowl on fox it could only be better if the vikings were in it but i aposm excited to watch the game and what aposs been happening here is there aposs just a lot of people who are still making their decisions we were out yesterday everywhere from the quad cities to sioux city to cedar falls to beaverdale and every place we went huge crowds a lot of interest people literally signing up yesterday committing to caucus so we aposre excited we had two polls last week that i was at 13 percent or one was at 13 percent i was third in two polls and we just see a lot of enthusiasm i have more endorsements than anyone else in the race when it comes to state legislators wallace all right but klobuchar so we are really building something wallace but senator isn apost iowa kind of a special case for you you come as you just pointed out from right across the border over in minnesota you have held 189 events there over 69 days don apost you have to finish in the top three here in iowa or you aposre done and if you do finish in the top three how can you replicate that in other states like new hampshire where you haven apost spent nearly as much time klobuchar well first of all i aposve been to new hampshire 22 times chris i just do a lot of stuff and i i literally don apost put those kinds of litmus tests i think we have to do well here there aposs been a lot going on having been gone the last few weeks that i didn apost expect to have happened but i aposm going to new hampshire no matter what there aposs a debate i aposm on the debate stage i aposve got the endorsements of every major paper in new hampshire including the union leader that have endorsed in new hampshire and so of course i aposm going there we have a strong operation there and then going beyond wallace all right klobuchar i think that my but remember i bring something to the stage that really no one else has i aposm one of only two candidates from the middle of the country where we need to win as democrats i aposm someone that aposs won with moderate republicans and independents in the reddest of red congressional districts over and over again because i bring people with me i aposm the only one that has those receipts that i can bring into this election i aposm one of two women that are left on the debate stage i aposm someone that has passed over 100 bills as a lead democrat wallace ok klobuchar there aposs a lot of stuff about why i should stay in this race and i aposm excited to be one of the leading candidates wallace you aposve made it very clear you aposre staying in the race laughter let me ask you because iowa and the caucuses have special rules and one of them is if you don apost have 15 percent of the people who show up at an individual precinct caucus then you don apost qualify you don apost get any delicates and you know at the caucus level at the precinct level and there has been talk and i want to find out if it aposs true that the biden campaign has come to your campaign and said let aposs make a deal like the tv show if one of us doesn apost have meet the 15 percent threshold we aposll put our candidates in the other one aposs camp so that they can get the benefit of that one is it true did they try to make a deal with you to switch votes if somebody falls short and if so are you going to accept that klobuchar no deals in fact they just approached someone who was affiliated with our campaign but not on our staff and some evening in des moines asked them about it he said no we said no there is no deal and i am just focused on our own race here we have precinct captains all over the state we have worked on this and we are really excited and also remember the rural issues i serve on the agriculture committee i have a long track record of working on rural issues so i have something that aposs pretty special here going into the iowa caucuses and we aposre excited about how we aposre doing wallace senator a new issue has come up in the last few days i want to ask you about back in 2003 you were the top prosecutor for hennepin county in minnesota and your office put a 16 year old boy in prison for life for the shooting of a young girl you aposve campaigned on how this shows that you are tough on crime but just in the last few days i want to put this up on the screen a year long associated press investigation has raised new questions about whether that young man was wrongfully convicted they found police offered cash to potential witnesses and relied on testimony from jailhouse informants who got reduced sentences senator did you know when you were the prosecutor did you know about any of that and should this man aposs case be reopened klobuchar well justice must be done chris and just to put it in some context this was an 11 year old girl named tyesha edwards she was doing her homework at her kitchen table and a bullet went through the wall and she died and it was a tragic case it was a big deal within the african american community and our focus was on bringing the people to justice and doing justice for her family so what happened was wallace but klobuchar three people were convicted if i could just finish wallace but senator klobuchar and now one wallace we know let me just say we know it was a bad case the question is whether this young man did it and this ap investigation klobuchar exactly wallace indicates that other people who were there said he didn apost do it and that some of the witnesses that were relied on were very questionable you were the head prosecutor did you know and if you didn apost shouldn apost you have known klobuchar there actually were two trials in this case chris one was after i was had left the office wallace but he was convicted in the case when you were the prosecutor klobuchar i know could i just if i could just answer my view as someone that has worked with the innocence project for years is that if there is new evidence it must come forward it must come forward and it must be considered immediately by the court the job of a prosecutor is to do justice and that means to me convict the guilty protect the innocent do your job without fear or favor crosstalk klobuchar and that aposs what i have asked to happen wallace senator you aposre not answering my question klobuchar ok ok wallace did you know about the fact that there was this questionable evidence that the police were coming up with klobuchar i didn apost know about this new evidence no i didn apost know about this new evidence until i saw this report i i couldn apost have i haven apost been in the office for 12 years wallace i i but i was wondering when you were in the office did you know about this questionable evidence i the reason i aposm asking you is as i aposm sure you well know now there are a number of african american groups in minnesota who are calling for you to suspend your campaign until this is cleared up and according to national polls you aposre below 1 percent in african american support you aposre not going to win the democratic nomination if you have such little support from the minority community klobuchar well i think what you aposve seen all across the country is that when people get to know me i do well and it aposs on me i aposve got to go out there and and get to know people and in my case let aposs look at iowa two prominent african american legislators have endorsed me are out campaigning for me right this weekend at home i aposve always enjoyed and have gotten strong support within the african american community i aposve been a leader on issues with the somali community in my home state and it aposs on me to go across the country and make the case for my agenda which is very strong when it comes to the african american community wallace right klobuchar it aposs about economic opportunity it aposs about voting rights i aposve been the lead on things like getting rid of gerrymandering and getting rid of voting purges those are my bills that i aposve led on and so that aposs on me and i will keep criss crossing the country make my case to the african american community as i aposve done right here in iowa wallace senator klobuchar thank you thanks for your time and good luck tomorrow night klobuchar thank you thank you very much wallace when we come back we will bring in our sunday political panel in iowa what should we expect from tomorrow aposs caucuses and could there be some big surprises we aposre live for miami gardens as fox sports at the beach to cover tonight aposs super bowl we will be right back commercial break wallace coming up last minute campaigning in iowa as the 2020 democrats make their final cases ahead of tomorrow aposs vote begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate i aposm asking you to consider caucusing for me i need your help pete buttigieg d presidential candidate i aposm here eye to eye to ask you to caucus for me on february 3rd end video clip wallace we aposll have a special sunday group live from iowa that aposs next on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i call it the impeachment hoax and that aposs what it is it aposs a hoax it should have never taken place should have never been allowed to happen but i have great confidence in republican senators and probably some democrats from what i understand end video clip chris wallace fox host president trump talking with peter doocy this week in iowa about the senate impeachment trial and it aposs time now for our iowa panel fox news senior political analyst brit hume marie harf executive director of the serve america pac and gop strategist karl rove well brit i think it aposs clear from the start that president trump was never going to be removed from office in this process but as we wrap up impeachment and the senate trial who do you think has the political advantage in the particularly as we look to november both in the race for the white house and the race in congress republicans or democrats brit hume fox news senior political analyst well i think it aposs a little hard to say at this point chris because it aposs not clear how much attention the public was paying to this indications are the public really wasn apost following it nearly as closely as as we in washington and in the media generally were were following it so we don apost know whether it will have very much impact at all my suspicion is it will have less impact that than any of the impeachment or impeachment investigations of presidents that we aposve recently seen and i don apost think that any of these republican senators by the way they aposve behaved are afraid at all that their political forces are going to be harmed by voting not only not to have witnesses but inevitably to acquit so my sense of it is that this could end up being kind of a political wash wallace marie do you think that house democrats have any second thoughts about one going for impeachment and two deciding not to fight in court even if it was going to take a while to try to get john bolton to testify in the house marie harf fox news contributor well chris it was a big of a catch 22 because the white house made clear they had no intention of participating in this process and house democrats felt like they had a strong enough case as is i happen to agree there will be a lot of hand wringing probably in democratic circles about this over the coming days and weeks but i think what it aposs shown democrats in this election cycle is that first it is so important to nominate someone who can beat donald trump in november because the president will probably feel emboldened and even more unfettered after this acquittal and also that they need to focus down ballot on senate races because no matter what had happened with john bolton or witnesses because we don apost have the majority in the senate we were always going to lose this impeachment fight and so here in iowa joni ernst is on the ballot in november senders like cory gardner and martha mcsally already facing tough races holding onto their republican seats that aposs where democrats are focused and feel like impeachment actually may help pick up some senate seats in november wallace karl as we pointed out donald trump is going to be delivering the state of the union address to a joint session of congress on tuesday night and like bill clinton back in 1999 he aposll be delivering that even though it aposs only one day away from acquittal while the senate impeachment trial is still going on if you were advising him if you were in the role you were in with bush 43 would you how would you tell him to handle impeachment in the senate trial how aggressively should he go at democrats for what they have put him and the country through karl rove fox news contributor well the less said about it i think in the state of the union address the better off for president trump more important to herald what he aposs achieved and we aposve heard that he aposs going to be talking about the blue collar economic prosperity and also to sort of lift the curtain on the second act what does he intend to do both in the balance of the year and in his in and leave the impression it would things that he would tackle in a second term tomorrow night is a valuable moment for him it is a moment where he can sort of be dismissive of the impeachment by giving it as little attention in his remarks as possible and putting the focus on what he aposs done and what he intends to do wallace all right let aposs turn to why you guys are all in des moines and i should point out off camera karl pointed out the temperature disparity between des moines and miami karl i aposm sorry you drew the short straw although des moines is a lovely place but there it is 43 degrees in des moines 66 rove yes wallace i will tell you it is unseasonably cold here in miami so we aposre we aposre actually not that happy here rove oh you aposre suffering we feel we feel so sorry for you to be suffering a miami gardens really seriously wallace all right in any case let aposs turn to iowa rove can we send you a care package wallace let aposs talk about the two frontrunners in this race who are going at each other here aposs an example begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate bernie is a he calls himself a democratic socialist we have a different view on a whole lot of things he aposs a decent guy i don apost think he should be running sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate well joe biden has been on the floor of the senate talking about the need to cut social security or medicare or medicaid end video clip wallace karl as you sit there today sunday do you have any sense who is going to win the iowa caucuses tomorrow night rove no no real idea and look i think i think we aposre going to have multiple winners tomorrow night this is not going to be 2000 where al gore blows out bradley 60 some odd to 35 percent and the contest is over the closest thing we have is some of the contests like 2008 where there it was relatively close or 2016 where it was 49 8 to 49 8 literally a couple hundred votes separating clinton and sanders and it forecast a contest that went to the end of june and i think we aposre going to have that kind of a contest tomorrow night wallace so let me rove i would not be surprised to see three or four candidates splitting up the delegate pool i wouldn apost even be surprised if five candidates shared in the 41 delegates to be awarded in iowa wallace so so let aposs pick up on that marie assuming that it aposs kind of muddled and maybe one person wins the popular vote and somebody else wins the delegate vote how much does iowa matter as we all get on the train or the bus and head to new hampshire the next day harf i think as long as there are no huge surprises nobody really underperforming or over performing it will probably end up muddled and we aposll going into new hampshire expecting bernie sanders to win there expecting joe biden to win in nevada and south carolina and then looking to see how mike bloomberg will do on super tuesday joe biden does need to perform strongly here in iowa because of the expectations he needs to demonstrate that he is the moderate choice that is in the primary against the bernie warren wing of it and so i think that where amy klobuchar aposs voters go potentially on a second ballot if she doesn apost make the threshold if they go to joe biden wallace let me harf if mayor pete doesn apost where his voters go that aposs what we aposre really going to be watching here wallace marie let me bring in we aposre wanting out of time let me bring in brit i aposve got about a minute and a half left i you know i can make a scenario that this is shaping up pretty well for mike bloomberg you could have a pretty muddled field coming out of iowa maybe new hampshire the dnc has just changed its rules so that bloomberg is going to be able to get on the stage likely for the next debate how seriously should we take mayor mike hume i think we should take mayor mike quite seriously i think he aposs a genuine wildcard in the race and remember chris we are seeing money spent by him in this race that is orders of magnitude greater than anything we have ever seen and if you get a muddled picture particularly one with bernie sanders getting an edge out of iowa and perhaps new hampshire as well i think that strengthens the case for bloomberg because frightened centrist democrats and moderate democrats to the extent that there are any will be terrified of sanders terrified of a major defeat at his hands and i think that at that point bloomberg with all his money becomes a potential factor we don apost know that nothing aposs ever like this has never been tried before when people wait to get into late races that has never worked before but this is altogether different because we aposre seeing money on a scale we aposve never seen before wallace and let me just point out panel i was talking to a big republican who is here for the super bowl and he said the one advice he aposs giving to president trump is don apost tweet about mike bloomberg all you do is elevate him and last night and you can check it out donald trump was tweeting about mike bloomberg thank you panel see you next sunday in new hampshire where it will be a lot colder than it is here up next the highlights every time we report from the super bowl we sit on with the hosts of fox nfl sunday and yes once again it gets out of hand commercial break wallace that aposs a look at the massive fox sports and media compound on south beach ahead of tonight aposs big game earlier we got the chance to sit down again with a fox nfl sunday crew terry howie michael and jimmy and once again it got rowdy begin videotape wallace so it has taken me three years to recover from our last encounter are you as excited to see me as i am to see all of you terry bradshaw fox nfl sunday host no no howie long fox nfl sunday host always excited michael strahan fox nfl sunday host more excited long oh bradshaw no i aposm not and i know he isn apost jimmy johnson fox nfl sunday host oh no no i aposm really excited yes wallace ok bradshaw oh you aposre excited ok i aposm wallace let aposs get long you aposre the only guy that aposs on tv more than michael right now with all these hearings wallace no nobody aposs on tv more than michael strahan well jimmy dressed up for you by the way wallace i know that i was going to say you guys didn apost dress up all right let aposs start with the game the it seems to me one of the storylines here is generational change no tom brady no bill belichick new faces new teams howie is that good for the game long yes i do and i think we always we always wonder who aposs going to replace whether it aposs terry bradshaw joe montana john elway and his this kid in kansas city is a guy that if he pulls this thing off might be the face of the nfl and we aposre going to see a lot of kids out there trying to emulate him in pop warner football and the sidearm throws the wallace the no look throws long yes exactly wallace the left handed throws strahan right wallace let me pick up that with you tb because bradshaw tb tb do you hear it wallace no we aposre come on we aposre we aposre besties bradshaw hey there bubba strahan oh boy that was awkward wallace hey stop laughing strahan that was awkward wallace so anyway i think that mahomes is the most dynamic most exciting player in the game as somebody who knows even more about quarterbacking than i do what you think bradshaw well he is there is a kid lamar jackson in baltimore wallace yes bradshaw who aposs as equally as exciting only in a different way wallace right bradshaw not only can he throw the football but he he aposs electrifying as a runner also wallace right bradshaw so he is he is i would put them one a and one b you aposd go whichever one you way you want to go but i but mahomes hey listen i have such great respect and admiration for him that we had a horse born the other day and we my wife named him homes wallace homes bradshaw because she aposs from kansas city homes wallace oh ok all right bradshaw so there you go that says it all strahan you you sure know how to bring a horse or a cow story into every game bradshaw always promoting mike always the wife strahan it aposs amazing it aposs really amazing wallace so michael you aposve got this turbocharged kansas city offense against this stiff stubborn san francisco defense how do you handicap that strahan oh man i you think when you aposre a defensive player and how you always feel like defense wins in a lot of ways because they always say the best the best counter to a great passing game is a pass rush you know that helps out the coverage i think the unique thing the 49ers have four guys who can get after the quarterbacks and you can drop seven they take away so much worry on the back end of this defense but kansas city you aposre going against some of the fastest receivers in the games and the most electric receivers in the game and also a running back in williams who had to that coming out of the back for another ph receiver this is going to be as tb i don apost even know it aposs going to be a hard day wallace hey see he gets away with it you don apost laugh at him tb strahan it aposs such a hard game to it aposs such pick and you know the other day i had a puppy and i wallace what was the puppy aposs name michael raheem strahan homes inaudible the puppy aposs name is jimmy g wallace well let me ask jimmy johnson because one of the other storylines in this is andy reid who is the winningest coach in the nfl history who has not won a super bowl and the story is that everybody outside of san francisco is rooting for andy reid to win the super bowl is that true and if so why johnson chris i really think so because he is such a nice guy any you know strahan yes johnson anybody that knows him personally anybody that aposs ever met him you know they all say you know andy reid is one of the nicest people you aposll ever want to meet and so even though people are people supposed to be unbiased you know really they aposre pulling for andy reid to win the super bowl and you talk to those players you know i i talked with him the other day i said you know looking at it you know your players like you they don apost just play for you they like you i don apost know that they ever liked me now they respected me but i don apost know about if they really liked me strahan you want me to answer that johnson i say your wallace yes answer that michael johnson supposed to jump in and you jump in and say they liked him strahan they didn apost like him wallace they didn apost like him johnson no strahan no they respected him but they didn apost like him he was a mean man johnson hey bradshaw and jimmy johnson would scare me if i was playing for jimmy johnson strahan oh i used to love playing i aposd play in fear for jimmy wallace ok so now let me look at it from the other side howie in the nfc championship game you aposre looking at me like you aposre a little surprised i know this much about it jimmy garoppolo bradshaw it aposs written down for god aposs sake wallace i wrote it bradshaw you aposre reading it wallace jimmy garoppolo ran threw the ball eight times can he get through this super bowl and win it throwing the ball eight times long you know i think he benefited a great deal from being in new england just through osmosis i think you know you he aposs bound to have picked something up from tom brady and bill belichick and i think it aposs something that he aposs used earlier in the year you talk about the new orleans games four touchdown passes in that game and i think jimmy aposs willing to win whatever way he has to and i think that aposs key and i think that aposs part of his new england background that aposs in his dna strahan i don apost think you aposre going to win going in bradshaw here aposs what aposs got everybody confused they aposre looking at the last two games the playoff games where he ran the ball in one game 47 times wallace right bradshaw but let me explain something he he averaged 285 yards a game this year and mahomes 301 and he had 28 touchdowns the other guy had 30 ph he aposs playing with wallace have you got this written down somewhere bradshaw i no bub it aposs right here wallace ok bradshaw this is what i do for a living wallace bub bradshaw bub wallace i have you know nobody aposs called me that in a couple of weeks bradshaw if i call you bub you aposre in my circle ok wallace ok all right bradshaw but this wallace i aposm your man i am your mahomey bradshaw you are my mahomey long once it aposs in there nothing gets out there strahan this is awkward the longer this goes wallace all right so michael let me ask you a series football question rahim i aposm not looking raheem mostert ran for 220 yards in the nfc championship game i checked i did check this out since 2015 he has been on eight nfl teams so and he looks like jim brown suddenly strahan yes wallace so how does he emerge like this strahan because i think he aposs in an offense that fits him well and they aposve have a three headed running back by running back by committee and when his number aposs being called he aposs taking advantage of it but any guy who aposs been on that many teams and you get an opportunity you aposre not letting it pass he aposs running as if his life depends on it because his football life does and the way he aposs representing himself now if if he aposs not on the 49ers there are so many other teams right there who will take this kid because it aposs good to see a story like this this is a great storyline for the nfl for all those kids out there who may not be the best now who may feel like they aposre on the verge of you know not making a team that once you are you get cut or once you you aposre not you get let go don apost give up he aposs a great great model for that bradshaw yes he was a special teams guy and by people getting hurt he got his chance to play and he aposs he aposs long it aposs an amazing story johnson yes incredible story bradshaw yes wallace it is an amazing story and i aposm glad that i knew in and asked you guys about it there you go you aposre my mahomey long mahomey wallace all right jimmy so bradshaw do you do this with the senators wallace exactly off camera listen would you stop laughing at me bradshaw inaudible wallace i aposm glad i aposm entertaining you howie i aposm glad he aposs turning red with laughter so jimmy long oh we laugh a lot wallace keys to the game it aposs for the folks sitting out there first quarter what aposs going to say to them well you know this is looking kansas city or no this is looking johnson well you look at kansas city the last couple of ball games they aposve come from behind you know they got behind against tennessee they got behind you know the they can come from behind and score lots of points and i had to go against you here michael and i said you know and coaching all those years i would aposve gone defense but patrick mahomes he is so talented i think he may offset that defense he can make things happen that no other quarterback can make happen long see he went to he went to their practice johnson yes long he spoke to the teams strahan yes so he aposs biased ph long he gave them a big pep talk wallace they like him they like him long he aposs a kansas city guy he aposs got to go now bradshaw oh coach johnson oh strahan but i aposll tell you right now you better not you said they he said they started slow they got behind if they get behind 21 points like they did against houston or they get behind 10 points like they did in the last game johnson did you think strahan i don apost know if you come back against this defense long yes strahan because they will run the ball to keep your offense off the field johnson i don apost know bradshaw most teams that are able to come from behind are playing against teams that go into zones zones allow you to move the ball all right man to man you can go fast and this team in san francisco you get behind they come they aposre going to pour it on you johnson no tb you know those players for kansas city will recall what i told them at practice bradshaw pep talk wallace did you cross talk wallace wait a minute you gave them a pep talk and you didn apost give the 49ers a pep talk long no he did not johnson we have a little wallace that would be like me giving the democrats a pep talk and not the republicans johnson well no no no no we have a contest here on fox nfl sunday bradshaw true that johnson we have a contest bradshaw true that johnson and i aposm the lead dog i aposm the lead dog been lead dog all year long strahan oh my god long and we can always take it back to you wallace ok wait wait i i wait i aposve got to we aposre running out of time and i know you aposd like to talk to me all afternoon but the big story to me and the thing i was most excited about sitting down with you is that you are now a member of the hall of fame bradshaw amen wallace i watched when you got the announcement here on this show frankly you blubbered like a baby strahan oh long oh bradshaw oh wallace no no what what i just want to ask why does it mean so much to you johnson when you coach for 40 years wallace right johnson it aposs nice to be recognized you know actually when i was coaching i didn apost care anything about individual awards it aposs a team game but now that i aposve been out for so long having coached that amount of time and plus with these guys the people i love right up here they aposre all hall of famers so i wanted to be a hall of famer too strahan nice long ad deservedly so bradshaw are you in the hall of fame by the way wallace i aposm not in anybody aposs hall of fame bradshaw i

pump inaudible wallace all right bradshaw there you go man mahomey wallace they aposre mahomey bradshaw mahomey wallace true that baby bradshaw true that wallace hey mike dropped end videotape wallace oh my up next our power player of the week he pulled off one of the most famous plays in football and we aposll ask hall of famer franco harris about the immaculate reception and what he thinks about another big contest as fox news sunday reports from hard rock stadium live in miami gardens ahead of super bowl liv commercial break wallace one of the best parts of going to the super bowl is before the game when you see football giants walking down the street well yesterday i sat down with pittsburgh steelers hall of fame running back franco harris and he aposs our power player of the week begin videotape wallace so franco i aposve got to tell you i was talking to dana perino yesterday and i said i aposm talking to franco harris and she said frank o aposharris ph and she franco harris nfl hall of famer i get that all the time and i tell people that aposs why the inaudible drafted me they thought my name was frank o aposharris wallace they thought you were irish harris they thought i was irish and whala ph wallace it worked out ok this is the nfl aposs 100 season and the league says that the greatest play in the 100 years is your catch the immaculate reception back in the playoff game in 1972 why do you think that play still resonates 48 years later harris because the steelers before that year the steelers always found a way to lose they were known as sos same old steelers found a way to lose and on that play we were winning and then were losing again but guess what we found a way to win wallace and that aposs it harris and and wallace you can find a way to win harris find a way to win and that aposs been carried over with the steelers ever since wallace you say that that play happened because you had been trained by coach paterno at penn state harris right wallace always go to the ball harris go to the ball and during that play when bradshaw was scrambling and he threw the ball i said go to the ball and it aposs amazing what can happen wallace so harris so thank you joe wallace over the years you have supported a lot of causes education scholarships for kids in public schools programs for poor people like energy assistance special olympics how important for you to have this platform of the nfl has given you so you can help people harris you know what the nfl has given me an unbelievable platform and if my voice can make a difference then i look at that platform as being something more than just football wallace this is a political talk show so i aposm going to ask you one quick political question i know you aposre a big democrat do you have a candidate for 2020 harris you know what as you know i will get behind one and i like it every four years we compete i love to compete and whoever wins wins that aposs my president right and but then ever four you know then when that fourth year comes around i aposm saying like i aposm ready and the other three three and a half years you know i aposm like you know you know i aposm not much involved wallace right harris but once it aposs time to compete and get into the game i aposm there and i love it wallace and let me say if that aposs this is the super bowl that aposs the real super bowl harris that aposs the real super bowl no doubt about it wallace franco thank you harris thanks chris wallace my pleasure harris really appreciate it nice
