thomas samson afp via getty images the results of a clinical trial in france and studies conducted in lab settings are building hope that a drug usually used to treat malaria and arthritis can treat and possibly cure coronavirus patients though scientists say more data is needed before drawing a firm conclusion it has a lot of potential though we re not going on a lot of data yet dr peter hotez the dean for the national school of tropical medicine at the baylor school of medicine said of early studies of hydroxycholoroquine a malaria drug developed in the 1940s president donald trump asked the white house s coronavirus task force about possibly using the drug task force coordinator dr deborah birx said wednesday birx said that the drug is being studied very carefully as are several other potential therapeutics on tuesday a team of french scientists released the first results of a clinical study of the use of hydroxychloroquine on 24 coronavirus patients from southeast france the research team led by didier raoult a renowned infectious disease expert from l institut hospitalo universitaire in marseille administered the drug for 10 days along with azithromycin a common antibiotic researchers said the drugs cleared the virus in the nose and throat of most observed patients in three to six days the study found that after six days of treatment 70 percent of patients administered hydroxychloroquine were clear of the virus compared to just 12 5 percent of patients who were not given drugs related fauci on coronavirus in us it s going to get worse azithromycin boosted the effect of hydroxychloroquine according to the study after six days of treatment all patients treated with the drug combination were virologically cured compared to 57 1 percent of patients treated with hydroxycholorquine by itself we therefore recommend that covid 19 patients be treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to cure their infection and to limit the transmission of the virus to other people in order to curb the spread of covid 19 in the world wrote researchers who acknowledged the small sample size of the study vice president mike pence and the white house coronavirus task force drew angerer getty images lab studies have shown that hydroxychloroquine which was developed in the 1940s inhibited coronavirus a study published in cell discovery on wednesday by three chinese scientists found that hydroxychloroquine inhibited coronavirus in vitro or in a lab culture hotez the infectious disease expert told the daily caller news foundation he was enthusiastic about early results of studies involving hydroxychloroquine though he said more data is needed to determine if the drug can effectively treat coronavirus we urgently need to accelerate new antimicrobial therapies if hydroxychloroquine could be approved in therapy it would be a game changer hotez said the important next step is to show that it has an impact on reducing severity of symptoms in clinical disease hotez said that an ideal study would be conducted in areas with high rates of transmission such as the lombardy region in italy more clinical trials are underway a researcher at asan medical center a top research hospital in south korea is conducting a clinical trial of 150 patients with mild cases of coronavirus the lead researcher sung han kim estimates that the trial will be completed in may according to nbc news french drug maker sanofi is working with health authorities to study whether hydroxychloroquine can help with coronavirus the company is encouraged by preliminary findings according to nbc news but still does not have enough data to determine its efficacy health officials in belgium and south korea have recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine patients displaying either severe or mild symptoms from covid 19 the disease caused by coronavirus the united kingdom appears to have some hope for the drug on sunday government officials there banned the export and hoarding of hydroxychloroquine and two other drugs that could be useful as therapeutics according to pharmaceutical technology content created by the daily caller news foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience for licensing opportunities of our original content please contact licensing dailycallernewsfoundation org follow chuck on twitter trending
