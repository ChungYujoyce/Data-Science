daily bread and antacids in fact our modern military both active duty and retired reflects our modern american society with its reliance on prescription drugs as a critical component of health care that s why recent reports of contaminated chinese made generic drug ingredients are causing more than heartburn in washington the trump administration correctly views it as a risk to our national security my decade plus of service as a member of congress on the house ways and means committee provided unique insights into our relationship with china since that panel has jurisdiction over international trade and health care chinese intentions were often the subject of vigorous debate both publicly and privately top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens pro china trade advocates maintain that the communist nation is moving toward free market policy a more accurate assessment is that china employs a martial market policy in other words the chinese view trade through the prism of military and geopolitical advantage that advantage can come either through technology transfers which can enhance chinese war fighting capabilities or through actions that can inflict harm on a potential enemy the vulnerability of americans through tainted prescription drugs is obvious and troubling firsthand evidence of chinese drug contamination includes an experienced and expert source dr larry m wortzel is an eight term commissioner of the u s china economic and security review commission a man who spent 32 years in our military retiring as an army colonel in 1999 he told bloomberg that four of his blood pressure medications were recalled in three months dr wortzel was taking a version of valsartan an anti hypertensive generic drug manufactured in india but with active ingredients from china they were contaminated with rocket fuel i imagine active military people have the same problem dr wortzel said this affects the readiness of our troops the rocket fuel referred to by dr wortzel is the probable carcinogen ndma its discovery in valsartan prompted the food drug administration fda to announce a recall in july 2018 specifically naming china s zhejiang huahai pharmaceutical co the fda believes the company s manufacturing process created ndma as a by product that went undetected for four years other companies in other countries using similar manufacturing processes have had to start their own recalls those recalls have done more than create business for law firms they have prompted our national security apparatus to conduct a thorough re examination of chinese active pharmaceutical ingredients api and drug manufacturing in china the national security council is trying to determine the most at risk medications and the defense health agency dha which manages prescription drugs and other facets of health care for the military understands the magnitude of the threat the national security risks of increased chinese dominance of the global api market cannot be overstated said christopher priest the acting deputy assistant director for health care operations at the dha so why have the risks of that chinese api dominance and manufacturing

costs but recent events are prompting a reassessment within the body politic rosemary gibson the author of china rx in testimony before the u s china economic and security review commission put it this way we wouldn t have our aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines built in china and for very important medications we should really look at what it takes to purchase based on value not just price we want cheap we can buy cheap but what s missing from the whole equation is quality most assuredly there are more variables to this equation and other pieces of this geopolitical puzzle as the u s china trade dispute continues there are fears that china could unilaterally cut off drug shipments to gain leverage in future negotiations but such an action by china would most likely trigger resentment and resolve on main street wall street and pennsylvania avenue despite some predictions of panic americans would realize that unsafe chinese medications not only threaten our military but also our general population the ancient chinese military strategist and philosopher sun tzu famously observed that opportunities multiply as they are seized whether on capitol hill at the white house
