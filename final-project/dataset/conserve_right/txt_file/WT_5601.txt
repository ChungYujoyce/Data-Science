apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic it s hard to imagine steve bannon being hired to host meet the press or kellyanne conway anchoring the impeachment saga of a president hillary clinton which explains why the journalism business still doesn t know quite what to make of george stephanopoulos the abc anchor is heading the network s coverage of the house impeachment hearings despite some rather obvious conflicts before president trump defeated mrs clinton in 2016 mr stephanopoulos served as a top clinton white house aide and key campaign operative in 1992 and 1996 rich noyes research director for the conservative media research center pointed out that mr stephanopoulos often briefed the press in the early days of the clinton presidency see also prince andrew staying at convicted sex offender epstein s mansion was wrong thing to do it s as if sean spicer were now anchoring the news for a network what would they say mr noyes said people were going nuts because he was on dancing with the stars the idea that he could be anchoring anything or in charge of news judgment or even influencing editorial news decisions would send people into fits there s more the hearings come a week after the clinton stephanopoulos ties drew renewed scrutiny with the release of a leaked video showing abc s amy robach unloading on the network for sitting on her exclusive story on billionaire sex offender jeffrey epstein critics on the right were quick to connect the dots between former president bill clinton s friendly relationship with epstein the ex president took 26 flights on epstein s private plane for six trips from 2002 03 and the influence wielded by mr stephanopoulos within abc s news division an abc source said mr stephanopoulos had nothing to do with the decision to hold the story but even so the optics are terrible mr noyes said the optics are terrible for abc even if they didn t have stephanopoulos or any other democratic connection because this is someone who turned out to be a horrible horrible criminal and they had the story mr noyes said but he s connected to all of these democrats in addition the network s effort to explain away ms robach s reporting by saying it failed to meet its standards doesn t look good said patricia gallagher newberry president of the society of professional journalists it just does not look good for abc to let all this stuff just swirl around and simply dismiss it as the story wasn t ready yet ms newberry said it was a gettable story and it sounds like that reporter had some pretty significant real named sources in the video clip posted by project veritas ms robach said in august that the network sat on the story for three years which means she would have had it in 2016 the same year mrs clinton ran for president against donald trump is the fact that george stephanopoulos is a big figure there at abc is that the reason they didn t run it ms newberry asked i don t think we ll ever get to that being a confirmed fact but sometimes just the taint of the maybe can be difficult for a network to deal with she added it s swirled around george stephanopoulos since the day he set foot in the abc building and it s not going to go away because the clintons won t go away part of the clinton crew certainly he isn t the first political figure to cross the aisle into television journalism others include former nbc meet the press host tim russert who had previously worked for sen daniel patrick moynihan and ex carter white house speechwriter chris matthews who went on to host hardball on msnbc one thing that separates mr stephanopoulos from other politicos turned journalists is that he reached the top of both professions moving from a senior white house job to become the host of this week and co host of good morning america as well as abc s go to anchor on political stories how he managed to do so without raising red flags within abc s news division especially with the clintons still major players on the political landscape remains something of a mystery it would be the most ethical thing not to report on the clintons not to comment on the clintons not to discuss impeachment and clintons and epstein with any of your guests but how can he host his morning show if he can t talk about all of those things this week of all weeks said ms newberry who teaches journalism at miami university of ohio his rise at abc after his arrival in 1997 was so gradual that many viewers probably no longer remember that he was once a high level partisan operative mr noyes said the stephanopoulos story is interesting in that he leaves the white house in 1996 he s immediately picked up to be a liberal commentator on abc and he s going to be the liberal commentator bill kristol is going to be the conservative commentator and he s not going to be a news person mr noyes said that s not what happened over time you see this gentle move where bill kristol kind of goes away stephanopoulos ends up taking over the show and then he starts filling in on world news tonight as anchor good morning america as anchor he said now he s their global anchor or whatever so he s anchoring the impeachment hearings this week his past has come back to haunt him before he was criticized for his skeptical grilling of clinton cash author peter schweizer in 2015 after the washington free beacon reported that mr stephanopoulos had failed to disclose 75 000 in donations from 2012 14 to the clinton foundation he later apologized saying he should have gone the extra mile to prevent even the appearance of a conflict under pressure from republicans he dropped out as moderator of a february 2016 gop primary debate what is certain is that stephanopoulos ethical malpractice and hidden hand journalism have done further injury to an essential if beleaguered institution one already battling to preserve legitimacy mr schweizer said in a may 2015op ed in usa today after the robach video went viral mr trump took a shot at abc tweeting abc is as bad as the rest of them journalistic standards are nonexistent today in its stephanopoulos bio the national press foundationpoints out that the anchor has won multiple honors during his abc tenure including two emmys a dupont a murrow and two cronkite awards also mentioned is his clinton service from now until he dies he s part of the clinton crew ms newberry said when he dies his obituary in the lede will be george stephanopoulos a one time clinton staffer it s going to follow him to the grave and yet abc has employed him for an awful long time and apparently accepts that as the trade off for somebody who s
