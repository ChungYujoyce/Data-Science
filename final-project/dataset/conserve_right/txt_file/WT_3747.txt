across his chest lt col alexander vindman told impeachment investigators he felt no hesitation in reporting the president s request of ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy vindman a 20 year

message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed it was inappropriate it was improper for the president to request to demand an investigation into a political opponent vindman told the house intelligence committee his testimony launched a pivotal week as the house s historic impeachment investigation reaches further into trump s white house democrats say trump s pressure on ukraine to investigate former vice president joe biden while withholding u s military aid to kyiv may be grounds for removing the 45th president republicans have argued both that there was no linkage between the two matters and that there would be nothing inappropriate even if there was in a remarkable day of back to back hearings vindman testified alongside jennifer williams an adviser in vice president mike pence s office both said they had concerns as they listened to trump speak with the newly elected ukrainian president about political investigations into biden trump insists zelenskiy did not feel pressured and has cast the impeachment probe as a partisan affair aimed at pushing him from office the white house lashed out at the army officer it wasn t the first time vindman was alarmed over the administration s push to have ukraine investigate democrats he testified he highlighted a july 10 meeting at the white house when ambassador gordon sondland told visiting ukraine officials they would need to deliver before next steps a meeting zelenskiy wanted with trump ambassador sondland referred to investigations into the bidens and burisma in 2016 he testified referring to the gas company in ukraine where joe biden s son hunter served on the board on both occasions vindman said he took his concerns about the shifting ukraine policy to the lead counsel at the nsc john eisenberg an immigrant who came to the u s as a toddler from ukraine vindman opened his testimony by assuring his father that in america he would be fine for telling the truth yet vindman spent long stretches fielding republican attacks on his loyalty and his career in public service the republicans lead counsel asked at one point about an offer he got from a ukrainian official to become the country s defense minister vindman called it comical and said he swiftly reported it up his chain of command i m an american vindman said and i immediately dismissed these offers later tuesday the house committee heard from former nsc official timothy morrison and kurt volker the former ukraine special envoy who said he hadn t understood the scope of the investigations sondland and rudy giuliani the president s personal attorney were pursuing for trump sondland the u s ambassador to the european union is to appear wednesday as the most anticipated witness yet at the white house trump said he watched part of the day s testimony and slammed the ongoing impeachment hearings as a disgrace over the weekend he had assailed williams as part of the never trumpers who oppose his presidency though there is no indication she has shown any partisanship vindman was ready to defend his loyalty to the united states when the top republican on the committee rep devin nunes addressed him as mr vindman the colonel reminded him to address him by his rank he also deflected republican efforts to get him to divulge everyone he told about the trump call thwarting trump allies attempts to identify the anonymous whistleblower who spurred the impeachment probe nunes bore down once vindman acknowledged one person he talked to was from the intelligence community the whistleblower is a cia official according to people with knowledge of the matter vindman said he does not know who the whistleblower is he has previously said it is not him trump ally jim jordan asked if he ever leaked information never did never would vindman answered republicans were eager to hear during the afternoon from morrison who had supervised vindman at the nsc he had concerns about vindman s judgment the white house tweeted but morrison who has since left the administration told lawmakers he was not there to question his former colleagues character or integrity and did not intend to out the whistleblower morrison who was also listening to trump s call worried its disclosure would not play well in polarized washington and reported it to the nsc s top lawyer he testified about his sinking feeling after sondland told him trump wanted zelenskiy to announce the investigations before releasing the military aid a colleague warned him of the gordon problem he said vindman is being provided security by the u s army and local law enforcement according to a u s official the official said the army is prepared to take additional steps if needed including moving vindman and his family to a more secure location on a base williams a career state department official who has worked for three presidential administrations and counts former secretary of state condoleezza rice a personal hero said the trump phone call was the first time she had heard anyone specifically seeking investigations from ukraine the reference to biden and his son hunter struck me as political in nature williams testified the call was unlike about a dozen others she had heard from presidents over her career when the white house produced a rough transcript later that day she put it in vice president pence s briefing materials i just don t know if he read it she testified earlier in her closed door house interview pence s role throughout the impeachment inquiry has been unclear the vice president s national security adviser lt gen keith kellogg issued a statement saying he heard nothing wrong or improper on the call vindman said trump s remarks on the call strayed from the talking points prepared for him and both witnesses said zelenskiy had mentioned burisma but it was missing from the rough transcript released by the white house at the time of the call the officials were just beginning to make the link with the stalled military aid 391 million approved by congress that ukraine was relying on as it confronts neighboring russia vindman said the uneven power dynamic between the presidents of the east european ally and the u s made the demand obvious the culture i come from the military culture when a senior asks you to do something it s not be taken as a request it s to be taken as an order he said associated press writers alan fram zeke j miller laurie kellman colleen long eric tucker lolita b
