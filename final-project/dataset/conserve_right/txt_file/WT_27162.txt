the 21st century judiciary chairman jerrold nadler d n y will make the final decision about issuing the subpoenas he said they can be avoided if the information is provided voluntarily the judiciary panel is investigating whether trump obstructed justice after mueller s report detailed several episodes in which trump tried to influence his investigation mueller said he could not exonerate trump on obstruction and indicated in a may news conference that it was up to congress to decide what to do with his findings mueller is scheduled to testify to congress next week democrats have had little success so far in their attempts to investigate beyond what mueller detailed in his 448 page report as the white house has blocked several witnesses from answering questions it s unclear if they would have better luck with the latest group of witnesses as most worked for the white house or the administration still democrats say they will call in the witnesses as they attempt to keep public attention on mueller s report and nadler has said the panel is preparing a lawsuit to challenge the efforts to block testimony among the other subpoena targets are corey lewandowski trump s former campaign manager jody hunt sessions former chief of staff and former white house aides rob porter and rick dearborn three other names on the list are related to the national enquirer s efforts to help kill potentially embarrassing stories about trump over the years by paying hush money in a practice known as catch and kill former trump lawyer michael cohen discussed the practice in testimony before the house oversight and reform committee earlier this year they include david pecker the chief executive of the national enquirer s parent company and a longtime trump ally dylan howard who cohen said was personally involved in coordinating payments to two women who said they had affairs with trump and keith davidson an attorney who initially represented the women and negotiated their payments republicans have fought the democratic efforts to investigate obstruction saying the issue should be laid to rest after the mueller report even if chairman nadler still believes subpoenas are conversation starters it s hard to imagine this handful of subpoenas will do anything but reinforce the principal conclusions we ve been able to read about for months said georgia rep doug collins the top republican on the judiciary panel on immigration democratic lawmakers have sought answers from the administration since more than 2 700 children were separated from their parents at the border last year as the result of the zero tolerance immigration policy pursued by sessions there was renewed outrage in recent weeks after squalid conditions were reported at border facilities where scores of children are detained well beyond the 72 hour limit by which they are to be transferred to more suitable facilities a justice department official says the agency has turned over more than 1 200 pages of documents in six separate productions to the house judiciary committee related to the zero tolerance policy the department is also working to produce additional batches of documents soon the official said the official wasn t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity the democratic questions on pardons involve kevin mcaleenan the acting department of homeland security secretary shortly after mcaleenan took over trump told him he d pardon him if he were to find himself in trouble for blocking people legally seeking asylum people familiar with the conversation told ap the people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a private conversation trump has been trying to stop a surge in migration at the southern border mcaleenan has said he was
