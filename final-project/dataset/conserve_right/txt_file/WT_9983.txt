and wednesday was tried and tested echoing the tone of the state visit to washington by hu a year ago xi however did hint at a personal touch with his eclectic use of proverbs they ranged from

contributes to america s burgeoning trade deficit biden also described an opening for foreign companies to sell auto insurance in china as an important step in overhauling the finance sector but biden repeated u s concern over subsidies for chinese state owned companies and the forced transfer of technology as a condition for u s companies doing business in china he also described the chinese currency as still substantially undervalued against the dollar which the u s contends hurts its exporters xi urged the u s to lift restrictions on high tech exports to china and create a level play
