tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion remember when democrats complained that 5 7 billion for a border wall was too expensive well that s chump change compared to what many of the congressional democrats and nearly all of those 15 declared democrats in the presidential race are now rallying behind the price tag isn t in the billions but in the tens of trillions president trump was attacked earlier this month by democrats for a budget blueprint that would run fiscal deficits of 5 percent of gdp that s too high for sure but count up the spending plans of democrats and deficits could easily hit 20 percent to 30 percent of gdp and tilt the nation toward greece and puerto rican style bankruptcy let s start to add it all up top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey start with medicare for all the new health care anthem of the left it is touted as a way to make medical services free for everyone the cost to taxpayers by some estimates 32 trillion over the next decade according to a study by the mercatus center medicare just for the seniors it was designed to cover is already projected to run deficits in the tens of trillions of dollars over the next four decades according to the program s own trustees then there is rep alexandria ocasio cortez s green new deal which is supposed to turn america into an eco friendly paradise and avert the apocalypse that aoc claims will occur in just over a decade four presidential candidates have endorsed some or all of that agenda of course the politicians pushing these plans remain suspiciously quiet whenever they re asked to explain exactly how much their pet projects will cost u s taxpayers and whether they re worth the investment but thanks to public policy watchdog groups we have some preliminary estimates according to one recent study by the american action forum the low carbon electricity grid proposed in the green new deal will cost taxpayers 5 4 trillion over 10 years or 39 000 per household similarly a net zero emissions transportation system another part of the environmental proposal will require up to 2 7 trillion or 20 000 per household while guaranteed green housing would cost an additional 4 2 trillion the democrat backed welfare programs in the green new deal are even more daunting according to the study guaranteed jobs and universal health care would together cost each american family 582 000 or 80 6 trillion in total then there is the loss of as many as 10 million jobs in the oil gas and coal industries which would add to welfare and unemployment benefit costs let alone the severe financial hardship this would impose on millions of middle class families whom democrats once said they care about added together these preliminary democratic proposals are projected to cost about 92 trillion over 10 years but wait there s more another hot proposal on the left gaining momentum is called universal basic income everybody gets a free check from the government a key sponsor of this is u s sen kamala harris of california a leading candidate for the democratic nomination this would give families making less than 100 000 a check of up to 6 000 from the government every year americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages mean they can t keep up with cost of living increases ms harris says then there is the cost of free college tuition another federal freebie supported by democrats that would add trillions more to the taxpayer tab over the next decade while further inflating the outrageous tuitions that universities already charge the 15 an hour minimum wage would also impose new costs on government at every level now the latest craze on the left is for reparations payments for slavery beto o rourke and other presidential wannabes have endorsed this radical income redistribution scheme a 2015 study by a professor at the university of connecticut estimates that the cost of reparations would be between 5 9 trillion and 14 2 trillion these results were published in the journal social sciences quarterly add it all up and the estimated 10 year cost of creating the democratic socialist utopia envisioned by the likes of aoc sen bernie sanders and other leaders of the democratic party reaches well north of 100 trillion who will be left to pay for the democrats america when everything is free to the extent that any of the democrats currently running for president has offered an answer to this question they ve invariably claimed that they would finance their schemes by levying punitive taxes on the wealthy but even if you took every penny of income from every millionaire and billionaire in america it wouldn t even pay half the cost some say we will just put on the federal credit card president obama took our national debt from 10 trillion to 20 trillion but that might be loose change compared to the new spending spree ultimately the burden of paying for this radical transformation of america would fall predominantly on the middle class as usual just one example many europeans pay gas taxes that are double what we pay in the united states that s part of the tab for their green energy policies that democrats are eager to bring here anyone want to pay 5 a gallon to fill up the democrats balked at spending 5 7 billion to protect american communities by securing the border but they re perfectly happy to mortgage our future by spending nearly 20 000 times that amount on their own utopian fantasies we will all have everything we want and our country will be bankrupt stephen moore a columnist for the washington times is a senior fellow at the heritage foundation he served as senior economic adviser to the trump campaig
