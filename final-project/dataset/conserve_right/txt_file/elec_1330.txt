 sign in many voters at odds over president s geniality and capability manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong betsy livingston is an unabashed supporter of mitt romney she has met the republican presidential nominee on a dozen occasions over the years at campaign events in orange county calif where she and her husband dan are active in gop politics but you won t hear mrs livingston bashing president obama and there s a reason for that she knows him too she met him after enrolling in the sixth grade at the punahou school in honolulu where he also was a student barry obama was the chubby kid who grew into a lanky jock wrote funny entries in her yearbook and regularly greeted her in the hallway between classes they moved in very different circles she recalled he wasn t that involved with anything except basketball and sports and i was in student government he partied a lot whereas i as a practicing mormon did not so we were on opposite sides of the spectrum top stories postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces you are not going to die from covid 19 even so she considered him a friend he was always really nice to me he knew my name he said hi to me mrs livingston said he was pretty cool he had a little bit of a swagger to him mrs livingston knew then what the rest of america has since learned about the president he is a hard guy to know but also a hard guy to dislike he enters the democratic national convention this week with some of the worst economic indicators of any president since the great depression yet polls consistently show him in at least a dead heat with mr romney americans may not be impressed with his job performance an average of polls compiled by the political website realclearpolitics shows his job disapproval rating at 48 7 percent compared with 47 7 percent who approve but most voters do not outwardly detest him his average favorability ranking during the same period aug 13 to aug 26 comes in at 49 percent compared with 45 4 percent who view him unfavorably compare that with the left s seething hatred of george w bush or the right s outraged disgust with bill clinton a few years into their presidencies the president s likability may not be more important to most voters than his achievements or competence but it s close the cool dad mr obama instantly entered the history books in 2009 as the nation s first black president but it was only after mr obama took office that many voters were able to fill in some of the blanks on his personality tastes and foibles he sings a mean al green but endured national ridicule for his taste in mom jeans his rare and glancing references to racial controversy think harvard professor henry louis gates and florida teenager trayvon martin can ignite ferocious cultural debates he can be a trash talker whether on the pickup basketball court skewering donald trump at a black tie washington dinner or taunting a roomful of boston red sox supporters about a trade favorable to his chicago white sox he is by all accounts a devoted father and an equally devoted weekend golfer because he is not a natural schmoozer his golf foursomes and his social outings tend to revolve around a small group of old friends and aides he is not afraid to call out rapper kanye west twice as a jackass and prefers cutting edge cable fare such as hbo s the wire and showtime s homeland but in his 2009 appearance on the view the first time a sitting president has appeared on the morning talk show mr obama confessed that he didn t know who snooki of mtv s jersey shore was hilary busis writing on entertainment weekly s ew com site said the cool vibe mr obama exuded when he took office has been dulled over the past four years the american people are now better acquainted with the real barack obama and it turns out that he s not actually the political equivalent of arthur fonzarelli or whoever the kids are into these days instead obama is a textbook example of an archetype on the rise the cool dad she wrote as the name implies cool dads aren t like the painfully unhip parents who often pop up on tv they listen to jazz blues and unobjectionable hip hop obama s a fan of miles davis and jay z claim allegiance to classic films that have a bit of an edge the president cites one flew over the cuckoo s nest and the godfather parts i and ii as favorites and keep in shape by playing real sports rather than huffing and puffing on an elliptical but she added with their frumpy pants moralizing streak and occasional cultural cluelessness cool dads are still dads at heart whatever the image mr obama projects it has kept his personal ratings with voters consistently higher than the ratings they give him on how he is doing his job pulling punches that may be why speakers at last week s republican national convention in tampa fla were careful to mute their criticism of the president instead of blasting him most speakers expressed more sorrow than fury about mr obama and those who did stuck to criticism of his job performance barack obama s failed us but look it s understandable a lot of people fail at their first job former minnesota gov tim pawlenty said in one of the convention s harder hitting speeches former rep tom tancredo who ran for the republican presidential nomination in 2008 said the challenge for democrats at their convention will be to build on the president s likability with success stories from his first term in office such as the assassination of terrorist mastermind osama bin laden democrats need to find a way to market their candidate other than by attacking romney the former congressman from colorado said i would imagine you ll hear a lot of bin laden otherwise all they ve got is romney s rich romney s terrible romney s a mormon and i don t know if that s enough to win the day a gallup poll released aug 24 a few days before the republican national convention showed mr obama continuing to lead mr romney on a host of positive personal traits starting with being likable of those polled 54 percent agreed that mr obama was likable compared with 31 percent for mr romney at the same time the gallup survey noted that the president s likability edge has narrowed as mr romney has become better known to the electorate some 63 percent of those polled called mr obama likable in may while mr romney s likability had increased slightly the gallup survey found barack obama retains a significant edge over mitt romney on personal dimensions particularly in terms of his likability while americans still believe romney is better able to handle the economy the poll analysis said mr romney improved his own likability in the aftermath of the convention a reuters ipsos rolling poll conducted from aug 27 through friday found that the republican nominee s likability climbed from 26 percent to 31 percent mr obama s remained at 48 percent during the same period the republicans had the task at the convention of making their candidate more palatable likable to the american electorate ipsos pollster julia clark told reuters our data suggests they have absolutely succeeded history shows the likable candidate emerges as the victor more often than not the most recent example was the election of 2004 when mr bush defeated sen john kerry a democrat who consistently received lower scores on the likability index republican ronald reagan clobbered democratic opponent walter f mondale both on election day and in terms of likability in 1984 but mr reagan also had the advantage of a robust economy ditto democrat mr clinton who was seen as far more likable than republican bob dole in the 1996 election but also could point to a booming private sector this year s election will test whether a likable president can emerge victorious in a down economy republicans are betting that he can t in part because his likability may have been oversold by the polls i would say the polls generally oversample democrats and therefore they re a little bit skewed said mr tancredo but if it s true if obama really is liked as much as people say then that can go a long way toward overcoming the economic doldrums people feel copyright 2020 the washington
