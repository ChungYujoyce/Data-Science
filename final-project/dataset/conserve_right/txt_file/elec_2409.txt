the nov 6 election the report set for release at 8 30 a m was expected to show that growth picked up only slightly in the third quarter tepid growth has given romney an opening to challenge obama s assessment that the economy is moving in the right direction obama arrived back in washington late thursday following a 40 hour battleground state blitz that took him to eight states he was taking a brief break from the campaign trail friday and planned to spend much of the day at the white house but the democratic campaign wasn t ceding the spotlight to romney obama had a series of interviews

expand his path to victory republicans and democrats who track campaign spending confirmed that romney will begin running television ads in minnesota over the weekend the investment is described as a small buy that democrats suggest is simply intended to generate media coverage and force obama s campaign to invest there as well former president richard nixon was the last republican to carry the
