kellyanne conway only on fox news sunday then democrats wrestled with what to do next rep rashida tlaib d mich we need to look and investigate possibly into these impeachable offenses rep hakeem jeffries d n y protecting people with pre existing conditions increased pay at a real infrastructure plan that aposs what house democrats are focused on wallace we aposll break down where house democrats stand in the post mueller report world and get reaction to the attorney general aposs plan to release the report from congressman jim himes a top member of the house intelligence committee plus trump 401 k s and all these stocks ph and all the things that you and you want to see them deflate put a good socialist in this position wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the president aposs strategy to take apart the 2020 democratic field all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we now know attorney general william barr aposs timeline to release the mueller report on the russia investigation the a g says he will send a redacted copy to congress by mid april and won apost share it with the white house beforehand but house democrats say their deadline still stands to get the report by this tuesday and barr aposs plan does not satisfy their demand to see the full report joining us now for an exclusive interview white house counselor kellyanne conway kellyanne welcome back to fox news sunday kellyanne conway counselor to the president thank you chris wallace we aposre going to get to the mueller report in a moment but we aposre going to start with a fast moving political story it involves a woman named lucy flores she was a state legislator in nevada who was running for lieutenant general in 2014 she says that during a rally the real you are seeing here but off camera that then vice president joe biden touched her inappropriately biden aposs staff says he doesn apost remember it that way this morning here aposs what lucy flores said to abc news begin audio clip lucy flores former nevada assemblyman at that point it wasn apost even joe biden it was the second most powerful man in the country the vice president of the united states of america is touching me and kissing me and smelling my hair end audio clip wallace and to give you a sense of how quickly this is moving we aposre going to put up on a screen this is a statement that has just come out from former vice president biden he says in my many years on the campaign trail and in public life i have offered countless handshakes hugs expressions of affection support and comfort and not once never that i believe i acted inappropriately if it is suggested i did so i will listen respectfully but it was never my intention kellyanne you have shared the fact that you were a victim of sexual assault much earlier in your life i know this doesn apost rise to that level but your reaction to what we are hearing now about this incident conway first of all this woman lucy is very bold to come forward and i would remind the audience that she shares joe biden aposs political party he was there to help the democratic party of nevada and her candidacy so it aposs quite bold for her to go up against the highest levels of her own political party but all of these post metoo allegations and insinuations really don apost comport with probably joe biden aposs conduct over the years if anybody just types in creepy uncle joe videos apos you come up with a treasure trove far more evidentiary information and videos and we saw one brett kavanaugh aposs nomination was trying to be derailed and him as an individual and his family being destroyed by folks who had no evidence of what had allegedly happened 34 years earlier and i think joe biden has a big problem here because he calls it affection and handshakes his party because it completely inappropriate and the other thing that biden really has is a problem is stacey abrams who i look upon as a big future part of the democratic party she is very compelling crosstalk wallace let me if i may conway she rebuffed his advances to be on his ticket pretty much she said if i aposm going to run i aposm going to run for the whole thing so he aposs had a bad couple of weeks he doesn apost have president obama the men he served for eight years as vice president wallace ok conway he apparently doesn apost have his endorsement wallace let aposs conway so i think he aposs had the worst non rollout for any would be 2020 candidate on the democratic side this doesn apost help wallace let me ask you about one more question and we move on we aposve got a lot to cover here this morning kellyanne i aposm sure a lot of folks are saying there are women who have said much worse about your boss president trump in terms of touching them inappropriately conway we aposve certainly covered that ad infinitum during the campaign the transition practically every day but look what aposs happened to the people who alleged all that and who think you have to speak about that repetitively and ubiquitously now they have to they have to really grapple with what aposs going on in their own party with a man who was vice president of the united states until two years ago and so let aposs have that conversation and i do think as somebody who is very affectionate i am i tend to hug people i tend to put on my head because i guess we aposre not supposed to do that i do think that we should examine appropriate conduct in the public sphere but joe biden aposs intent is only partly or maybe not at all relevant here it aposs really how that woman felt she feels that it was unwelcome wallace again ph right conway and she aposs coming forward with it because she doesn apost want i supposed she doesn apost want this man to continue to advance in public life joe biden this week was apologizing to anita hill for his role crosstalk wallace ok all right you aposre going to have plenty of time to go after him on other issues conway why didn apost he apologize to lucy why didn apost he apologize to this woman why didn apost he do that they never apologize to the individual and i think the way the media covered everything from collusion to kavanaugh to the covington kids means they ought to be able to cover issues like this with the same time of vigor wallace well that aposs why i aposm asking you about it at the beginning of our interview let aposs turn to what the president is telling americans about the mueller report here he is begin video clip donald trump president the special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction total exoneration complete vindication end video clip wallace now the special counsel cleared the president on collusion absolutely no question about it but he expressly did not clear him on the question of obstruction so why is the president telling americans something that is not true conway well the barr memo talks about no obstructive conduct it also says something i don apost think it aposs enough coverage which answers your question in part chris which is that also nobody in the department of justice felt like the investigation was interfered with that mr mueller couldn apost do the job he wanted to do so for all the times i was asked the president was asked we were all asked will he protect mueller will he fire bob mueller will he impede the investigation will he fire this ph the department of justice feels wallace right but conway that mr mueller was able to do that now he also didn apost say the president obstructed wallace kellyanne i aposm asking you specifically about obstruction and i don apost mean to interrupt but conway well it aposs not in there wallace i do want to keep you on point here is the summary that attorney general barr sent to congress about the issue of obstruction i want to put it up on the screen this is barr summarizing the special counsel for each of the relevant actions investigated the reports they found evidence on both sides of the question the special counsel states that quote while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime of obstruction it also does not exonerate him so when the president says that its total exoneration on obstruction kellyanne that aposs just not true conway well the president is probably comparing that report and the ultimate conclusions of no conspiracy no collusion no contact with any russian at a campaign that i managed into its final successful phases and have always been offended than anybody would think that we would cheat lie steal or talk to any russians that aposs ridiculous and always was we wasted a lot of money and a lot of time in people aposs anxiety over it but the president is also saying look people were out there as recently as a week or days before the barr memo characterizing the mueller report was released by saying that the evidence of collusion was in plain sight that the president had committed a crime that elizabeth warren said we don apost even know if you will be a free man wallace look take yes for an answer i aposm agreeing with you on collusion i aposm asking you conway i aposm always going to take yes for an answer on the barr report wallace i aposm asking about obstruction though conway we will see with the full report says but there aposs nowhere in the barr report that says the president obstructed justice there aposs nowhere in the barr memo that says you or i ph obstructed justice and remember we crosstalk wallace well there was no barr report barr is simply summarizing conway the barr memo summarizing but i think crosstalk wallace mueller and mueller says it did not exonerate him conway well it said many things and most importantly it said that this president and his campaign did not commit a crime that there was no conspiracy no collusion and people vomited collusion for two straight years wallace ok conway and wasted taxpayer dollars and people aposs anxiety and got into and by the way adam schiff is completely compromised you want to find one person who is compromised he aposs the head of the house intelligence committee spent more time on tv than at committee over the last how many years and all nine republican members have asked for his resignation i certainly did it a week ago the president has done wallace all right conway he cannot be fair that is one of the most important positions in the united states house of representatives he sees all the nation aposs secrets and he ought to step down crosstalk wallace we aposre going to talk about adam schiff with jim himes his number two in a moment in a couple of minutes i do want to ask about mexico because the president is now threatening to close the border between the u s and mexico this week if it doesn apost stop the migrant caravans coming from mexico take a look begin video clip trump if they don apost stop them we are closing the border we aposll close it and we aposll keep it closed for a long time i aposm not playing games end video clip wallace mexico kellyanne is our third largest trading partner there aposs a half a trillion dollars of goods that comes back and forth across the border thousands of americans every day go back and forth across the border is the president really serious about closing the border this week with all the disruption to our economy or is this just a bluff conway it certainly isn apost a bluff you can take the president seriously and here aposs why you aposre giving those metrics what he aposs looking at is that 4 000 migrants apprehended in one day recently we aposre on track this month for close to 100 000 we have never seen a surge like this coming from the northern triangle company ph some of these kids are already separated by their parents from their parents before they even arrive here congress can fix this chris in an hour they can give us a fix for the flores agreement that a court said there aposs only so much we can do we have 20 days and then we have to release unaccompanied minors into the interior congress can fix the problem of immigration they failed to fix and this president is looking at the metrics secretary nielsen saying we are in a meltdown we are at the breaking point wallace ok conway and the customs and border patrol head saying we aposve never seen a surge like this and even give credit to dhs secretary jeh johnson under president obama said we have a crisis at the border wallace i understand that and i want to ask about that surge because the president is also now going to cut off all foreign aid to three countries in central america guatemala honduras and el salvador including aid for things like gang prevention the argument that a lot of people is making is if you cut off all those aid all that aid for all things that might improve conditions in what aposs called the triangle those northern central american countries you aposre only going to make things worse and you aposre only going to spur more migration so isn apost it counterproductive conway well chris this is the classic case of let aposs talk about what may happen and what we are looking for versus what aposs right in front of us how can people deny what they see which is these caravans day by day that people coming from the northern triangle countries and trying to come to this country and they are at very deplorable conditions that many of them are facing the dhs says wallace you aposre going to make the conditions worse kellyanne if you cut off foreign aid conway the conditions are really awful the conditions are already awful we have back to back homeland security secretary president obama and president trump saying that we have a crisis we are over the melting point we have to congress must act the executive branch has done so much to try to mitigate these awful circumstances and we need to send a message back to these countries too be honest with people they are being promising in giving their life savings to coyotes and they are being promised something that cannot be once they get here wallace ok conway and we have to just got off the drugs you know that we aposve interdicted drugs through the ports of entry outside of the points of entry enough fentanyl to kill every american in this country and people are just denying what they should see in front of them wallace all right we are blowing crosstalk conway and by the way on trade this president has the usmca get congress to get a vote and put it into law he struck a great crosstalk wallace a lot of people think this is going to hurt them ph i want to move onto obamacare because the president also announced this week that he wants to kill obamacare through the courts including what it does to protect people with pre existing conditions here he is begin video clip trump if the supreme court rules that obamacare is out we will have a plan that aposs far better than obamacare end video clip wallace simple question kellyanne what aposs the republican plan conway the republican plan is manifold and let me just begin by saying even the president aposs current budget pre existing conditions are accounted for he has said time and again for years including this week that he crosstalk wallace you had two years you had two years with republicans control of the house conway yes wallace and the senate and the white house and you could never the gop could never come up with a plan that they could all agree on and passed so conway well they need to come and here aposs why by the way the democrats are opposed to obamacare also president obama last fall said he likes medicare for all if the democrats actually liked obamacare they would all be running on obamacare instead they are running on medicare for all which is a health version of the green new deal which got exactly zero votes in the senate this week why because people make noise about it on the campaign trail and then when i have to vote on nonsense like medicare for all and green new deal they vote present they didn apost get a single positive vote in medicare for all what ph medicare for all would mean choices for none and apart from the monetary costs the moral costs are abhorrent we aposd be pushing more people out of the system you aposre going to do away with private insurance 180 million americans would lose their insurance more than half of the country wallace ok conway obamacare has been a failure because one third of the country had one insurance option which is no option at all wallace ok conway the cost 50 billion a year in subsidies crosstalk walalce kellyanne i hate interrupting but if i didn apost i think you might going conway we aposre going to offer higher quality lower lower cost more choices and less hassle wallace but there is no plan right now conway there is a plan we aposve been working on a plan for a long time and we hope that congress would come along wallace right nine years but you aposve never actually come up with a whole plan conway well donald trump has been president for two years so give us a chance and we aposll have wallace ok conway we are working on a plan at the white house wallace finally i aposm going to get into something i don apost like talking about i know you don apost talk about but i have to tell you that when we announced that you are going to be on the show more people asked me to ask you about this than any other question you know where i aposm headed here and that is conway i don apost wallace yes you do this is the state of your marriage with george conway i aposm going to put up some of the things that your husband has said about president trump just this month march 5th wherever he goes and whatever he does trump will always be summa cum liar let me try that again always be summa cum liar march 19th once someone understands narcissistic personality disorder they understand you march 26th if the charge were on fitness for office the verdict would already be in guilty beyond a reasonable doubt here aposs how the president responded begin video clip trump i don apost know him he aposs a whack job there aposs no question about it and i call him mr kellyanne the fact is that he aposs doing a tremendous disservice to a wife and family she aposs a wonderful woman end video clip wallace why is your husband attacking your boss conway well you could ask my husband but it doesn apost affect my job because my job is to be counsel to the president and do the best job i can do to provide information wallace do you think do you think that he is come on you aposve obviously thought about this do you think he aposs cyberbullying here to try to get you to quit do you think he aposs jealous of your high profile conway some people think that and they certainly do my first line of protection in this world is and will always be my four children so i don apost really like to discuss this publicly what i will tell you is that george was very supportive of president trump cried on election night in his maga hat blocks away from her at the hilton in new york wanted to take a job in the trump administration and changed his mind and was a guest of the president and first lady months after he withdrew himself from consideration wallace i understand that conway at the white house and when he withdrew his name he said he would still support the president and his agenda and quote his wonderful wife aposs work so if that aposs changed i haven apost changed wallace can i just ask conway i will tell you that it aposs unusual for washington too because i think that many women get tend to get their power and their position through the men in their lives and this is a little bit different and i aposm sure the feminists are going to throw me a parade at some point wallace finally and you have said that you believe that this has hurt your four children and understandably nobody would want to see their mom and dad fighting out in public conway but that aposs not true some people would like us to fight wallace i don apost conway some people take a little bit too much glee over the situation crosstalk wallace i don apost your children want you to fight i guess the question i have to ask bottom line final question has this hurt your marriage conway oh chris what are you oprah now i mean what am i on a couch and you are a psychiatrist i think it aposs a really inappropriate question and here aposs why that aposs the line over which nobody should have crossed so if you want to talk about policy issues policy disagreements the fact that george conway my husband would prefer that i not work in the white house i guess you can ask those questions the president has weighed in i aposve weighed in as modestly as i can but now you aposre asking a very personal question and i would say to you you should go ask it of many people wallace ok conway because i see messy lives living in glass houses all over both cities in which i live wallace i would only point out and look this is not something i aposm comfortable talking about your boss conway i aposm surprised you would ask that wallace the president did call him the husband from hell so it aposs out there conway i aposm surprised that people would ask that question i have seen home wreckers on tv as marital experts all of a sudden it aposs very amusing to me but i think people knew they crossed the line when they aposre talking about people aposs marriages all the stuff about leave us alone in my private life my family has a right to their private life also wallace ok conway i have children who are 14 14 11 and 9 and the reasons get so much coverage particularly by the mainstream media is because george conway now agrees with them he shares the views about president trump and their goals wallace kellyanne conway but you know what if you read george aposs op ed in the washington post the headlines didn apost match the op ed he was talking about the mueller report the barr memo and i think that they just they take glee in this and people should have thought thrice before they crossed a certain line over the last couple of days ph wallace kellyanne i you know as i said i aposm not comfortable people asking it it is what people are talking about if i offended you i aposm sorry conway i aposm sure thank you wallace thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you please come back conway you got it wallace up next we aposll get reaction from a top democrat on the house intelligence committee congressman jim himes joins us next commercial break wallace democrats are threatening to issue a subpoena unless attorney general barr sends them the full mueller report by this tuesday so what did they make of barr aposs plan now to send it to congress by mid april if not sooner joining us from connecticut congressman jim himes the number two democrat on the house intelligence committee congressman let aposs start with what you told your local newspaper in connecticut this week about whether the mueller report clears the president on the issue of collusion with the russians here aposs what you told them i aposm not sure i would break out a lot of champagne they try to make the case that the mueller report says there aposs no evidence of collusion there aposs plenty of evidence but congressman now i aposm taking the counterargument to what i was discussing with kellyanne it doesn apost say there aposs plenty of evidence of collusion rep jim himes d ct no what the mueller well first of all nobody knows what the mueller report says because we haven apost seen it we aposve got the four page barr summary and even though my republican friends are attacking adam schiff and others by saying that the mueller report says no evidence that aposs not at all what it says if you read the barr letter the barr letter says that the investigation was not able to establish so chris two things crosstalk wallace no excuse me with all due respect sir that aposs absolutely incorrect i aposm going to put up on the screen because we know that this probably was going to come up the specific quote from attorney general barr here aposs what he says the special counsel did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the russian government in these efforts despite multiple offers from russian affiliated individuals to assist the trump campaign so specifically the special counsel is not saying there is insufficient evidence to prosecute he saying it didn apost happen himes right so again two things are possible at the same time number one whatever happened and there aposs 400 pages of report that we are going to see so something happened or it wouldn apost be 400 pages long but whatever happened the conclusion is that it aposs not a chargeable offense crosstalk wallace no again sir respectable he didn apost say it aposs not a chargeable offense he said the report did not find that the trump campaign conspired or coordinated himes right wallace on the issue of obstruction he said i aposve got some issues as to whether it aposs a prosecutable offense he didn apost say that when it came to collusion himes right chris but my own quote which you read back to me was saying that there was not a finding of no evidence and that is also true so the conclusion is that there was not explicit collusion conspiracy but that does not mean that there is no evidence ok now that aposs sort of a fine point but here aposs the big picture we are accepting that and adam schiff and his famous speech of last week said we are accepting the conclusion of bob mueller something of course that the republicans did not do on benghazi on uranium one on clinton emails we are accepting that and we want to see the report and this is why i say i wouldn apost break out the champagne just yet for two reasons one the conclusion despite what kellyanne conway just told you is not clear on obstruction and number two again at 400 pages we are all speculating about what aposs in there but we know about don jr aposs meeting in trump tower wallace ok himes we know about many people going to jail for lying about russia my guess is that when you see the whole report you will see good reasons good reasons for why a number of people a lot of people were concerned by the possibility since disproved that the trump campaign was colluding with the russians wallace ok let aposs move onto another subject and that is that house democrats are demanding that attorney general barr turnover the entire mueller report by this tuesday two days from now here is basically barr aposs response to that barr says that you aposre going to get it by mid april which is two weeks from now if not sooner he says he aposs going to redact grand jury testimony and intelligence material but he says the white house won apost get to review it for executive privilege no white house review for executive of which which i know it aposs a big concern of yours isn apost that a reasonable plan congressman himes well i aposll say a couple things number one it is absolutely reasonable that they remove all classified information from a report my guess is it contains a lot of classified information because it pertains to russia absolutely reasonable grand jury information a little more ambiguous congress theoretically has the right to that and then there aposs that third category which you didn apost mention of information that may be potentially embarrassing to third parties and then but remember we aposre talking about a difference of ten days here or so and so my guess is that this is going to be something that can be negotiated away so that we wind up as everybody agrees we should with the mueller report wallace so in other words if it aposs just a matter of ten days or so this tuesday as opposed to two weeks from then you aposre saying that there won apost be a subpoena and you aposll take yes for an answer himes well we aposll see i think my guess is that jerry nadler and others are probably actually in communication with barr and with the department of justice on the nature of what is slowing them down now remember congress can and does see classified information so it aposs also possible that the department of justice can convey the report just to congress in a closed environment but by the way just to come back to the executive privilege thing remember what barr said was that the president has publicly indicated that he wants the report released and therefore we don apost anticipate executive privilege claims but look this could get reversed tomorrow morning if the president decides that he wants to change his mind on that this is a president who has changed his mind in the past so we are sensitive to that possibility wallace all right let aposs move on to adam schiff who you talked about and also kellyanne conway talked about the president and house republicans particularly republican members of the house intelligence committee are going after adam schiff he of course is chairman of the house intelligence committee you aposre the number two democrat on that committee take a look at their what they aposre saying begin video clip donald trump president little pencil neck adam schiff there could still have been some russia collusion sick sick these are sick people rep kevin mccarthy r calif house minority leader all americans should be concerned with a chairman of the house intelligence committee taking the position of judge and jury end video clip wallace so house republicans are saying that schiff should step down as chairman of house intelligence the president has tweeted that he thinks that schiff should be forced to resign from congress your reaction himes well look the american people will need to decide what they think about a president who poisons our political dialogue by going after people aposs physical characteristics calling him pencil neck et cetera on the substance here you just need to watch what adam schiff said last week in the committee first of all he is we accept mueller aposs findings something the republicans could never find it in their hearts or minds to do with respect to benghazi the clinton e mails uranium one i could go on and on he said we accept the findings we aposre not going to do ten investigations the way they did on benghazi second he said i do not believe it is appropriate for people to lie about contacts with russians when the report comes out what the american people will learn was that there was plenty of reason to be concerned about the nature of those contacts and the possibility of what those contacts might have meant wallace but himes so i don apost see adam schiff as having done anything at all wrong and in fact wallace well it himes purporting ph himself far more responsibly than the republicans ever did on benghazi and the many ginned up ph scandals that they had wallace well let me let me let me point out what i think sticks in a lot of republicans craws and that aposs what they say adam schiff in the run up to the mueller report said repeatedly that he thought there was a good chance that president trump had committed a crime here aposs some clips of adam schiff in just the last couple of months begin video clip schiff my takeaways is there aposs a very real prospect that on the day donald trump leaves office the justice department may indict him so there aposs clear evidence on the issue of collusion and this adds to that body of evidence the bigger pardon question may come down the road as the next president has to determine whether to pardon donald trump end video clip wallace is that appropriate for the chairman of the house intelligence committee which is basically and traditionally been seen as non partisan above politics not always and i agree in recent years not at all but above politics a fact finding committee to be talking openly about the president being indicted the next president having to pardon him before he even knew the results of the report himes well we don apost need to have the conversation we had previously about whether there was reason to be concerned evidence or reason whatever you want to call it that the president aposs campaign might be compromised you know we it aposs all out there for people to see from the don junior meeting to so many people lying about contacts with russia there was reason for this investigation now when when adam schiff says that there is a possibility that the president might be indicted after his presidency remember chris as we sit here today any number of u s attorneys in the southern district of new york and elsewhere continue their investigations of the president wallace so so basically you aposre not i understand that so basically you aposre not troubled by that himes well again i don apost think adam said anything that wasn apost factual adam never said the president is guilty of this he himself is a former prosecutor he is more careful than that he said there was evidence again the american people can judge the facts that they know today before the report has been released as to whether they would have criticized barack obama if barack obama aposs daughter had met with russians looking for dirt on barack obama aposs political foes wallace ok himes they can make that judgment but until the full report is out people should reserve judgment on what adam schiff knows or doesn apost know because adam schiff as chairman of that committee had access to lots of information that the public does not yet have wallace congress himes again i don apost say that because i think there aposs a surprise we accept the conclusion of the report but i don apost think adam schiff said anything that wasn apost true in his in the statements you played there wallace congressman himes thank you thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us always good to talk with you sir and we aposll stay on top of what your committee does next himes thank you chris wallace coming up we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the president aposs decision to revive the fight over the affordable care act plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs promise about a new health plan that is better than obamacare just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the end of the mueller investigation hasn apost ended the partisan bickering around it begin video clip trump there has to be accountability because it aposs all lies pelosi i think they aposre just scaredy cats they just don apost know what to do end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if what the attorney general plans to send congress is good enough commercial break begin video clip trump the democrats have to now decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bull expletive deleted end video clip wallace well president trump in his own way telling a rally in michigan this week democrats owe the country an apology for pushing the russia investigation for more than two years and it aposs time now for our sunday group the co host of benson and harf on fox news radio guy benson charles lane from the washington post author of the new book freedom aposs detective julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press and josh holmes senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff so julie some folks especially democrats say that the president is jumping the gun going on this victory tour declaring complete victory on the mueller report and that when it finally comes out there will be a bunch of stuff in there that he aposs not going to like and that they aposre going to have to explain what aposs the feeling in the white house let aposs just take the good news and if there aposs bad news later we aposll deal with it later julie pace the associated press pretty much i mean i think there have always been legal questions and political questions when it comes to the to the mueller investigation and from the legal perspective this is indisputably good news for the president you know we always believed that mueller was never going to be able to charge him because of justice department guidelines about a sitting president but there were real questions that surrounded other people in the president aposs orbit including his son donald trump junior and the mueller investigation ended with no additional criminal charges that is good news for the white house there is no other way to spin that on the political question i think we don apost completely know yet how this will cut i think that if you look at the totality of the investigation it certainly hasn apost been good for the president his national security advisor had to plead guilty his campaign chairman is going to be in jail for several years but i do think that the president sees this as a way to rally his base heading into his reelection to cast this investigation as politically motivated and to get some of his voters really energized heading into 2020 wallace guy whatever we end up reading and they aposre probably i mean you can tell from the summary of the mueller report from barr there aposs evidence on both sides on obstruction not on collusion whatever we end up reading in the report isn apost this a big victory for donald trump both politically and legally in the sense he was being he was investigated for more than two years by federal authorities and they end up finding no evidence apparently of collusion and apparently no criminal evidence nothing prosecutable when it comes to obstruction guy benson co host benson and harf of course it aposs a huge victory for him i aposd also say it aposs a victory for the american people that the president and his team did not collude with a hostile foreign government to steal an election that is something we should all be celebrating there aposs some glum faces around washington which i think is telling but yes the president has been not only accused of being a criminal for the last two years but in a lot of precincts of being some sort of a traitor and now we see from bob mueller who was determined to be the gold standard and i actually have always agreed with that no conspiracy and no coordination i think a lot of democrats are focusing on the word conspiracy look we heard from your last guest well this isn apost a crime necessarily the word coordination was also ruled out by the special counsel to me that is very significant i think we should wait for the entire report to come forward i think the full football spiking might be premature there aposs going to be some embarrassing stuff in there no question but the bottom line on the central thrust of what mueller was investigated for two years it aposs a vindication broadly for the president wallace then there was the president aposs decision surprising decision this week to jump into a court case that would strike down all of obamacare if it is this was a judgment by a district judge in texas if it goes through the appeals process here was the back and forth on that begin video clip trump they are going to work together to come up with something that aposs really spectacular maybe we aposll even get support in the house from democrats but it aposs going to be far better than obamacare chuck schumer d n y senate minority leader the president wants to go back to repeal and replace again make our day end video clip wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this question of the president aposs promise to produce a new gop health plan we got this on facebook from jacob staven why after nine years do the republicans not have any replacement plan why after two years does trump not have a replacement plan all they have is repeal that aposs not a plan josh you expressed big concerns this week about president trump and the white house deciding to go back and re litigate obamacare how do you answer jacob josh holmes founder cavalry well look i think there aposs a practical problem here and there aposs a political problem here the practical problem is unless you believe that speaker pelosi is going to work hand in glove with the trump administration and senator majority leader mitch mcconnell to repeal obamacare and come up with a replacement we aposre talking about an exercise in futility the second piece of this which i think is more broadly concerning is the fact that the issue selection is not exactly where it needs to be here they aposre fighting a battle that has been waged for eight years and largely decided in august of 2017 where we aposre at now is democrats full throated embrace of a medicare for all policy and i aposve got to tell you the one biggest political liability that you can accrue in politics is separating families from coverage that they have despite the efforts of their federal government be able to navigate and provide for their families that aposs where democrats are right now and that aposs really where the trump administration and all republicans out to focus wallace so how big a gift was the president aposs decision to get back into the obamacare fight to democrats charles lane the washington post it could be a big gift if they persist in it if it is a one off thing that just sort of popped out of the white house in the wake of the mueller thing because as wallace and when you say if they persist you mean the the president lane the white house wallace yes lane you know mick mulvaney thought what aposs now aposs our chance to get at at obamacare it aposs very important to understand that the republicans actually they may not have a whole repeal and replace plan for obamacare but they have plans for health care which include things like work requirements for medicaid which are not super popular around the country that it aposs there aposs a good case to be made that the 2018 election went overwhelmingly in the house for the democrats because they harped on pre existing conditions it republicans are threatening your pre existing conditions and that aposs what nancy pelosi and chuck schumer see coming coming back it aposs just fallen right back into their laps here comes the republican administration threatening that again and you know they aposre going to i think if they aposre smart the white house will backpedal quickly and this will be a passing thing pace and this is partially why republicans were so frustrated because they thought that the debate had changed they thought at least they had gotten the president and a lot of their vulnerable lawmakers to the place where they could accept pre existing conditions where they could accept the provisions of obamacare that let people stay on their parent aposs health insurance until they aposre 26 those are broadly popular there aposs very little appetite anywhere in in either party to do away with those right now and suddenly the administration is out there saying we want to get rid of the whole thing again wallace so we aposll see what because the the democratic presidential candidates are talking about medicare for all which is a much more controversial issue but protecting obamacare has become increasingly popular all right panel take a break here when we come back beto o aposrourke has his official launch and joe biden faces new scrutiny as he makes a decision whether to run we aposll check in on where the 2020 democratic race stands now commercial break begin video clip joe biden former vice president when anita hill came to testify she faced a committee that didn apost fully understand what the hell it was all about to this day i regret i couldn apost come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved end video clip wallace well former vice president joe biden apologizing this week for the way he handled anita hill aposs testimony in the clarence thomas confirmation hearing for the supreme court in 1991 and we aposre back now with the panel we aposre going to get to the other part of the biden story in a moment but josh biden had a tough week this week even without this latest allegation from lucy flores in nevada first his comments about anita hill and the hearing in which he seemed to apologize for being a white guy and that all the members of the committee at that time were white guys and then to say that he apologized for not giving her the hearing she deserved after all he was the chairman of the committee holmes right and he aposs not even in the race yet chris i mean this is going to get worse and i think what we aposre watching from joe biden at this point is twisting himself into a pretzel trying to appeal to a primary electorate on the democratic side that frankly has moved far beyond the joe bidens of the world what he aposs talking about now is basically a world apology tour and that aposs not going to work that aposs not going to sell in iowa new hampshire or anywhere else ultimately what the challenges that he faces is that he is no longer representative of that core primary electorate that will determine who the next democratic nominee for president is wallace now there is also as we aposve been discussing this morning with kellyanne conway potentially a much more serious problem that involves a woman named lucy flores she was a state legislator in nevada running for lieutenant governor in 2014 joe biden there with her on the stage at a rally supporting her but it turns out she alleges that before in private off camera he came up behind her he touched her shoulders then he came in and kissed the back of her head he says or his staff says that he doesn apost recall the incident he put out a statement this morning to say i aposm a huggy guy i certainly didn apost think i aposd ever bothered anybody but here is the reaction from another democratic candidate already senator elizabeth warren begin video clip sen elizabeth warren d mass 2020 presidential candidate i believe lucy flores and joe biden needs to give an answer question should he not run as a result warren that aposs for joe biden to decide end video clip wallace julie you have covered the vice president for years are you surprised that this would come up about the the the issue of inappropriate touching pace i aposm not surprised joe biden anybody who has covered him has seen these these moments he is quite an affectionate person there are moments where he aposs been on camera in front of big crowds and he aposs put his hands on women aposs shoulders he nuzzles them it aposs it aposs part of what people have have called kind of the uncle joe persona i think the challenge for joe biden is you know due those moments look different in 2019 when we are in a place where we aposve gone through the me too movement which has really i think cause people to take a fresh look at the at the behavior of men in powerful positions you know this is not necessarily sexual assault but if he was making women feel uncomfortable if he was using his position of authority to do that that is not going to be looked at favorably certainly by this democratic electorate wallace well it reminded a lot of people of this incident let aposs put it up on the screen this is 2015 and they you see ash carter being sworn in as defense secretary and joe biden is touching the wife of ash carter puts his hand on her shoulders nuzzles in and asks her says something whispers something into her into her ear guy could this be a problem a serious problem especially as julie points out in the me too movement period benson yes it could be for him and i think a lot of conservatives are saying hang hang on a second all of a sudden it aposs news that joe biden is handsy with women this has been a conservative meme for eight years at least and that video you just played is one of many examples i think it aposs very clear that joe biden is not going to win a wokeness primary and if he tries to he aposs going to fail and i think between not necessarily this story but a lot of the shots being fired already these are warning signals from the left that if he gets in they are going to make his life miserable and i think he needs to be fully aware of that if he decides to jump in wallace chuck lane i aposm going to just take the other side of this for a moment politically with two words for anyone who thinks joe biden is finished ralph northam we thought he was finished and he aposs still around these things have wallace well wait wait but there aposs a difference lane no no the difference wallace ralph ralph northam is the governor it aposs a question of kicking him out the other guys apos got to actually win a primary lane i aposm just saying people have a way of surviving things that you think they can apost survive and so we should all just be prepared for that possibility but i do think this what this let and the other point i would make is he aposs still well above the rest of the field in the polls so at least he came into this with a reservoir of good will but it was inevitable that democrats would have to go negative on one another in such a large field and being the front runner you aposre the one everyone aposs going to target so i guess the hope for biden would be that he aposs still not officially candidate but that this will somehow get processed before he is one and he aposll be in some way inoculated against it but i just wouldn apost rule out the possibility that he aposs not finished you know already wallace does anybody at this table think that joe biden won apost get into the race pace i think there aposs a chance wallace say it again pace i mean we have i think there aposs a chance he doesn apost get in i mean joe biden has this operation around him right now that is completely set up waiting for him to turn to them and say i aposm ready and he hasn apost said that yet and he aposs been pushing this deadline back and back and back we aposre now talking possibly late april is the is the new timeframe that some people around him are using and joe biden knows better than anybody what this would entail you know what is the thing that he is going to learn over the next couple of weeks that will push him over the finish line i think the longer that this goes on yes it leaves open the possibility that he doesn apost do this ultimately wallace josh holmes he might be at the point of no return i think the draft biden movement has gotten big enough where it aposs going to be very very difficult for him to walk that back but i you know to the point that guy made earlier i think that aposs honestly a mistake i don apost think that he can compete in this primary electorate lane well if he doesn apost get it it will be a real watershed in the history of the democratic party because it will be the end of that whole generation of leaders and they aposll be moving into sort of an unknown new new land with this whole bunch of newcomers ideologically very different diverse from one another and it would be a real free for all wallace you aposve still got bernie sanders who aposs what 77 years old so and and elizabeth warren aposs 69 so it aposs not completely a generational shift yet guy benson but a different kind of democrat i mean there aposs a world of difference between joe biden and bernie sanders who isn apost even really technically a democrat he aposs kind of a socialist and i don apost think charles that biden is done or finished i just think we aposve gotten a taste in the last few weeks of what aposs coming his way if he gets in and he might be sitting there thinking do i want to put myself through this wallace and and you aposve got to figure yes he aposd love to be president does he want to run for president a third time and lose for
