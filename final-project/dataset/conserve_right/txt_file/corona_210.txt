national review that s a rhetorical question actually the grownups it seems are in our local schools in our hospitals and running our local businesses definitely not in our newsrooms or in our political institutions no one has any clue how the coronavirus will end up affecting our lives though i believe there is some evidence that we re overreacting unlike the hundreds of pundits who have attained virology phds over the past couple of weeks i don t claim to possess any special insight into the matter i may be wrong i can only listen to experts and act accordingly in this regard though social media could have been immensely beneficial in helping navigate the virus allaying some of the public s irrational fears helping debunk rumors and offering beneficial information but instead it s mostly a cesspool of brainless partisanship and hysteria is wuhan virus a racist term as i write this that utterly idiotic question is being debated on twitter before a single case of the virus had even been reported in the united states some in the media were stoking fear the global health security index found late last year that the u s was the best prepared to deal with a pandemic but you might already believe it is trump s chernobyl then there are the pundits and journalists who can barely contain their glee at the potential market crash which might help them win an election but will cost jobs and deplete the retirement and college funds of millions americans it s simply deranged yet even if some are overreacting and even if the united states is as prepared as it can be and even if some democrats are happy to fuel panic the tone deafness with which president trump has handled the outbreak sending out pictures of himself fiddling like nero and downplaying concerns even as tens of millions of older and immunocompromised americans have serious worries about their welfare is also dangerous there is a vast space between panic mongering and flippant dismissal and it s not very difficult to find that ground anyway there are a lot more important things than politics it s heartening to see adults in the real world act accordingly get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
