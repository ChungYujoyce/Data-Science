trump s tightened immigration restrictions those include substantially lower caps on refugees and a travel ban that blocks citizens of five muslim majority countries including somalia and their immediate families from traveling or immigrating to the united states lee s decision doesn t dissolve those hurdles to make it to the u s as refugees but abdi who said she prayed over lee s refugee decision said she now knows he was listening to her community i m speechless and very happy with the outcome said abdi who said she voted for lee in 2018 we are happy that gov lee listened and heard the concerns and wishes of refugees we are glad to have lee as our governor lee s decision put him at odds with top republicans in the legislature who had sued the federal government over its refugee resettlement program and hoped lee would accept trump s offer acknowledging pressure from fellow republicans lee put a time limit on his initial approval saying it was only valid for a year he even said he supports the lawsuit effort i certainly know there s disagreement on this subject but there s disagreement around most subjects lee told reporters wednesday you agree to disagree and move forward but i think it s the right decision and we re moving forward on it so far no states have said they plan to reject refugees about half the states have given written consent to continue resettling refugees in september trump slashed the number of refugees allowed into the u s and authorized state and local governments to refuse to accept them an executive order says that if a state or a locality has not consented to receive refugees under the state department s reception and placement program then refugees should not be resettled within the state or locality unless the secretary of state decides otherwise some resettlement groups have sued to block trump s order if a state opts out under trump s order refugees could still move there but they d miss out on key aid for example

program with the help of a third party legal outfit since attorney general herbert slatery declined to take the case the 6th u s circuit court of appeals has rejected the lawsuit which claims the program improperly forces the state to spend money on additional services for refugees including health care and education lawmakers haven t said whether they ll ask the u s supreme court to weigh in

after a rough gop primary in which he and his opponents echoed trump s tough talk on immigration he also went to great lengths to bring up his christian faith while campaigning he invoked his beliefs again in his refugee decision the united states and tennessee have always been since the very founding of our nation a shining beacon of freedom and opportunity for the persecuted and oppressed and particularly those suffering religious persecution lee wrote to the legislative leaders my commitment to these ideals is based on my faith personally visiting refugee camps on multiple continents and my years of experience ministering to refugees here in tennessee advocates have said the program includes rigorous vetting and introduces refugees as reliable members of the workforce abdi spent three years in a refugee camp in kenya as a child then came to the u s with her mother and two step siblings she had been living here for years when she found out that her father was alive in 2014 she said she made the discovery when she saw a man who resembled her in a video then made calls until she confirmed it she s since talked with him on video chats abdi said she might be a stronger person for making her own way in the united states but at some point everyone needs family she said there are certain times when my father would say i wish i could just hold one of my grand kids abdi said
