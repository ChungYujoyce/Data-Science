apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic nanchang china ap in a lively muslim quarter of nanchang city a sprawling chinese factory turns out computer screens cameras and fingerprint scanners for a supplier to international tech giants such as apple and lenovo throughout the neighborhood women in headscarves stroll through the streets and arabic signs advertise halal supermarkets and noodle shops yet the mostly muslim ethnic uighurs who labor in the factory are isolated within a walled compound that is fortified with security cameras and guards at the entrance their forays out are limited to rare chaperoned trips they are not allowed to worship or cover their heads and they must attend special classes in the evenings according to former and current workers and shopkeepers in the area the connection between ofilm the supplier that owns the nanchang factory and the tech giants is the latest sign that companies outside china are benefiting from coercive labor practices imposed on the uighurs a turkic ethnic group and other minorities top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches over the past four years the chinese government has detained more than a million people from the far west xinjiang region most of them uighurs in internment camps and prisons where they go through forced ideological and behavioral re education china has long suspected the uighurs of harboring separatist tendencies because of their distinct culture language and religion when detainees graduate from the camps documents show many are sent to work in factories a dozen uighurs and kazakhs told the ap they knew people who were sent by the state to work in factories in china s east known as inner china some from the camps some plucked from their families some from vocational schools most were sent by force although in a few cases it wasn t clear if they consented workers are often enrolled in classes where state sponsored teachers give lessons in mandarin china s dominant language or politics and ethnic unity conditions in the jobs vary in terms of pay and restrictions at the ofilm factory uighurs are paid the same as other workers but otherwise treated differently according to residents of the neighborhood they are not allowed to leave or pray unlike the hui muslim migrants also working there who are considered less of a threat by the chinese government they don t let them worship inside said a hui muslim woman who worked in the factory for several weeks alongside the uighurs they don t let them come out if you re uighur you re only allowed outside twice a month a small business owner who spoke with the workers confirmed the ap is not disclosing the names of those interviewed near the factory out of concern for possible retribution the government chose them to come to ofilm they didn t choose it the chinese government says the labor program is a way to train uighurs and other minorities and give them jobs the chinese ministry of foreign affairs on monday called concern over possible coerced labor under the program groundless and slander however experts say that like the internment camps the program is part of a broader assault on the uighur culture breaking up social and family links by sending people far from their homes to be assimilated into the dominant han chinese culture they think these people are poorly educated isolated

scanners it touts customers including apple samsung lenovo dell hp lg and huawei although the ap had no way to track specific products to specific companies apple s most recent list of suppliers published january last year includes three ofilm factories in nanchang it s unclear whether the specific ofilm factory the ap visited twice in nanchang supplies apple but it has the same address as one listed another ofilm factory is located about half a mile away on a different street apple did not answer repeated requests for clarification on which factory it uses in an email apple said its code of conduct requires suppliers to provide channels that encourage employees to voice concerns it said it interviews the employees of suppliers during annual assessments in their local language without their managers present and had done 44 000 interviews in 2018 lenovo confirmed that it sources screens cameras and fingerprint scanners from ofilm but said it was not aware of the allegations and would investigate lenovo also pointed to a 2018 audit by the reliable business alliance in which ofilm scored very well all the companies that responded said they required suppliers to follow strict labor standards lg and dell said they had no evidence of forced labor in their supply chains but would investigate as did huawei hp did not respond ofilm also lists as customers dozens of
