 it s finally blessedlyover as expected hillary clinton santiclimactic acceptance speech capped off a democratic convention at which two of the weakest primetime speeches were delivered by the the two members of the nominated ticket there were powerful moments earlier in the evening including an impactful address by the father of a muslim us soldier who paid the ultimate sacrifice for his country in iraq andan address from a valorousmedal of honor recipient who wasshamefully heckled by some dnc delegates but when the lights shone brightest we got a perfectly nice little talk by chelsea clinton an over the top heroine hillary introductory video and a over long mediocre robotically delivered address by the woman of the hour pete wehner a senior speechwriter for president bush and an exceptionally harsh conservative critic of donald trump renderedthis assessment of her performance what a dismal speech poorly written even more poorly delivered in the biggest speech of her life she fell flat some bits were better than others but clinton only seemed to truly come into her own when she was attacking donald trump her longtime friend and donor whose wedding she attended hillary quoted trump s infamous statementthat he understands isisbetter than our generals she looked into the camera ice cold and unleashed one of several stinging lines no donald you don t a man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons there is no other donald trump this is it alas there is also no other hillary clinton this is it if only she and donald had taken some voice modulation lessons maybe stronger together a few weeks ago things might have been better they weren t in any case even if you re inclined to agree with her temperament critiques of trump as i am it s quiterich listening to a woman whoknowingly compromised high level secrets for her own selfish reasons andlied repeatedly about it lecture anyone about trust and national security the rest of her speech was almost entirely unmemorable although newscasts will love her break the ceiling sky s the limit formulation she talked a little bit about her upbringing and family she tossed a few blandrhetoricalscraps to independent and republican leaning voters and she rattled off a laundry list of liberal left agenda items she made sure to highlight her strong opposition to citizens united becausethis woman is so terribly offended bymoney in politics you see failing to mention that the ruling she abhors literally overruled thegovernment s censorship of a film that was critical of hillary clinton she also condemned mean and divisive rhetoric which seems apt in an age of trump but once again physician heal thyself as i predicted donald trump earned aclear polling bounce out of cleveland itmay or may not be receding i would be surprised if clinton doesn t garner one from the program in philadelphia too but because this is 2016 and because the commentariat was largely enamored with the democrats gathering this is a reasonable caveat most pundits doubted how disjointed rnc could produce a trump bounce if pundits blown away by dnc doesn t guarantee a clinton bounce by mid august the polls will likely have settled a bit and we ll have a better sense of the dynamics of the post conventions horserace and then come the debates i ll leave you with a sentiment i felt acutelywhile watching the final evening of the dnc proceedings and some sorely neededlevity i cannot support most of their agenda or their lying nominee but with exceptions the democrats are totally outclassing us it hurts the most amazing thing about tonight is that hillary is giving this speech for free alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
