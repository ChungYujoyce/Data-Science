us army capt humayun s m khan and his wife ghazala speak during the final day of the democratic national convention in philadelphia ap photo j scott applewhite editor apos s note the following column originally appeared on the website us defense watch it is reprinted with permission dear mr khan i like millions of americans saw your speech at the dnc on thursday night i wish to offer my sympathy for the death of your son captain humayun khan who was killed in action in iraq as a former us army officer and a veteran of the gulf war i can certainly understand the pain and anguish that you and your wife endure every day your son died saving the lives of his fellow soldiers as jesus told his disciples according to the gospel of john greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends captain khan is a hero i am sure the soldiers he served with regard him as one i know you and your wife do rest assured that millions of veterans regard your son as a hero as well to paraphrase from the book of ecclesiasticus your son s name liveth for evermore your son made the ultimate sacrifice for his country a country that was new to you and your family and one which you openly embraced and certainly love when you and your family arrived to america from pakistan you assimilated into our country you adopted american ways learned our history and apparently you even acquired a pocket constitution along the way good for you sir but there are many muslims in america who not only have no desire to assimilate but wish to live under sharia law that is unacceptable to americans there is only one law of the land that is the u s constitution as you well know mr khan we live in violent times dangerous times muslim madmen from isis and other radical jihadi groups are on a murder and terror spree across the globe your religion of peace islam is anything but that in 2016 that is a fact that is confirmed every time a muslim shoots bombs beheads and tortures innocent men women and children this does not mean that every muslim is a terrorist but most terrorists sir are indeed muslims a muslim terrorist attack has become the sign of the times regardless of what the feckless na ve leftist ideologue barack obama and his dimwitted colleagues john kerry francois hollande and angela merkel state the united states and the west are at war with radical islam it is the job of the president of the united states to protect his nation from all enemies foreign and domestic unfortunately mr obama romanticizes islam and refuses to accept reality which has resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent people across the world groups like isis and al qaeda have one goal the complete destruction of the judeo christian culture our religions and our way of life many americans have families that have been here for decades even centuries many families like mine have relatives who fought in the civil war wwi wwii korea vietnam and desert storm some families have relatives who fought in the american revolution we don t plan on letting our country be devoured by muslim maniacs we are americans sir and not unarmed socialist european zombies we will do what is necessary to protect the united states while many democrats and liberals see the world through rose colored glasses conservatives understand that there is good and evil in this world evil must be destroyed before it destroys us strong measures wartime measures must be taken to protect this country from those that wish to annihilate us and our way of life mr trump s plan to temporarily halt immigration from muslim countries that are known to either support terrorism or harbor terrorist groups is not only pragmatic but indeed it is constitutional it is the constitutional duty of the president of the united states to protect this nation there is simply no way to vet hundreds of thousands of muslim refugees from war zones like syria iraq and afghanistan europe is being destroyed because reckless leaders like angela merkel have opened the continent s doors to a flood of over one million undocumented muslims arriving with nothing more than a bad attitude and a haversack of jihad do you think americans are stupid while the left lives in a dream world the right does not mr trump understands the threat to his nation and the threat sir is not from swedish lutherans named anna and lars the threat sir is from radical islam how in god s name are u s immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of a 22 year old syrian man it is impossible you know it is impossible how in god s name are u s immigration authorities supposed to know the true intentions of hundreds of thousands of syrian refugees and thousands of other sundry muslims who wish to arrive on our shores it is impossible you know it is impossible whether you your wife the muslim world and millions of democrats are offended by mr trump s realistic view of the world is irrelevant whether you your wife and son would have been prohibited from emigrating from pakistan to america under mr trump s wartime plan is irrelevant the security of this great land supersedes your desires and the desires of others who wish to come here now the united states of america has no obligation to open its doors in order to placate foreigners and liberals in our government to adopt any other course but mr trump s would be a cause for further endangering the lives of americans every day that sir is unacceptable you attacked mr trump in front of a worldwide audience yet you can t understand the fact that he defends himself against attacks from you hillary clinton and the left what else is one to do sir we must live in a world of reality not a world of denial delusion and fantasy the democrats inhabit every waking day of their lives radical islam is the enemy of everyone on this planet who believes in freedom and justice until it is destroyed this nation must protect itself from enemies
