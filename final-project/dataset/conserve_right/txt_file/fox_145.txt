there is major news today on a trump kim summit and trade talks with china but we begin with another school shooting the 16th this year this time a high school in santa fe texas where 10 people were killed the attack coming just weeks after nationwide walkouts by students seeking tougher gun controls after the massacre in parkland florida walkouts students participated in before they begin the next targets this hour we aposll look at what can be done to protect our children we aposll talk exclusively with incoming nra president oliver north and get reaction from gun control advocate mark kelly but first to doug mckelway in santa fe texas with the latest on the investigation doug mckelway fox news correspondent hi chris for the first time we are hearing from the family of the accused gunman the pagourtzis family in a formal statement they ask for their privacy and they added quote we are as shocked and confused as anyone else by these events that occurred we are gratified by the public comments made by other santa fe high school students that showed dimitri as we know him a smart quiet sweet boy but like so many other americans they seem unaware of some of their son aposs disturbing social media postings the suspect made an initial court appearance on capital murder charges he told investigators that he spared the students he liked the death toll remains at 10 among the 13 wounded san fe isd police officer john barnes who ran to the sound of the gunshots and helped neutralize the shooter barnes nearly bled out but remains in critical but stable condition another of the wounded sophomore rome shubert was shot in the back of the head begin video clip rome shubert shooting victim it went in through the back of my head just right like kind of in the middle of the back of my head and it came out right here people were like let aposs go let aposs go and i just took off running i still had no idea that i had been shot yet i took off running out the door and there aposs something for a while out there inaudible hard and that i just propelled myself over the wall end video clip mckelway among the dead sabika sheikh who was in the u s on a state department exchange program from pakistan funeral prayers for sheikh will take place today in houston and the houston texans nfl football team confirms that there are star defensive end jj watt has indeed agreed to pay for the funeral services of all of the deceased chris wallace doug mckelway reporting from santa fe texas doug thanks for that joining me now the next president of the national rifle association oliver north ollie welcome back to fox news sunday oliver north incoming president national rifle association thank you chris wallace i want to start by playing two students from santa fe high said after the shooting here they are begin video clip dakota schrader santa fe shooting survivor i shouldn apost be going through this this is my school this is my daily life i shouldn apost have to feel like that and i feel scared to even go back paige curry santa fe shooting survivor it aposs been happening everywhere i aposve always felt eventually it was going to happen here too end video clip wallace what do you say to young people like that who have come to expect shootings in their schools north they shouldn apost have to they shouldn apost be afraid to go to school they shouldn apost worry about the fact that they might not go home that night because some crazed person comes in with a firearm which is one of the reasons why the nra for over two years has been advocating a program called school shield and there aposs legislation for it seventy five to a hundred million dollars appropriated by the federal government to assist in that but if school shield had been placed in santa fe high school far less likely that that would have happened the problem that we got is we are trying like the dickens to treat the symptom without treating the disease and the disease in this case isn apost the second amendment the disease is youngsters who are steeped in a culture of violence they have been drugged in many cases nearly all of these perpetrators are male and they are young teenagers in most cases and they have come through a culture where violence is commonplace all you need to do is turn on the tv go to a movie if you look at what has happened to the young people many of these young boys have been on ritalin since they were in kindergarten now i am certainly not a doctor i aposm a marine but i can see those kinds of things happening endangering those two gals wallace let aposs get specific because this was the 16th north yes wallace sixteenth school shooting so far this year that is the most at this point in a year since they started keeping records after columbine in 1999 two three key specific things that you think would keep our children safe north well one school shield because school shield wallace which is what north it aposs a program the nra introduced it two years ago it aposs a we aposll go do an assessment costs the school nothing costs the taxpayers nothing to get the assessment as to what the issues are in terms of ingress egress the ability to hide a firearm and get them into a school the number of officers you really need and very few schools actually have that wallace let aposs just talk about that specific if i may just talk about that specifically this school had to go policeman armed roaming the halls the school administrator said yesterday they considered santa fe a hardened school north but there aposs no way to detect a firearm being brought into the building look you and i came through the lobby here in this building for we are sitting right now there aposs a security desk there there aposs a barrier for us to pass through you can apost get on an airplane today without going through a metal detector wallace i was going to say there aposs no metal detector in our building are you suggesting that there be a metal detector i aposm not saying that aposs wrong a metal detector at the entrance to every school for millions and millions of schools north well if you want to stop the carnage look you are not going to fix it by taking away the rights of law abiding citizens you aposve got to take it away to harden the place sufficiently that those kids are safe inside the door if that means five metal detectors getting and out of the high school you get five metal detectors wallace ok cameron kasky one of the parkland students who has led the march for our lives movement tweeted this after the shooting donald trump does not care about you or your kids getting shot here aposs what you aposve said about the parkland school movement what they did very successfully with a frontal assault and now intimidation and harassment and lawbreaking is they confused the american people question what aposs wrong with students like this fighting they would say for their lives north look it i that is taken out of context as people are fond of saying in our business i was talking about the people who organized the harassment the vandalism the threats the hacking and showing the full force of the first amendment against the second amendment and they are leading the cause i aposm not these kids aren apost the problem they are being used by forces far bigger than they are to make sure that the second amendment goes away wallace who is using the parkland students north we know that we know what mayor bloomberg was up to we know what george soros has funded i mean in our business his creations have gone after you me and everybody else wallace cameron kasky would say he is speaking and working for himself and those other kids north ok but my point being i was not criticizing those kids your next guest is going to be a person who was an advocate for more gun control he aposs got a first amendment right just like i do i believe that what we are doing right now with the national rifle association is trying to make sure that kids are protected without taking away the rights of law abiding citizens and that aposs that aposs all it aposs about wallace i got less than a minute left you say that one of your jobs as the incoming president at the nra is you want to reassure politicians with all of this movement now for gun control that it aposs a good thing to be associated with the nra not a liability how is that going north well my goal is a million more members we have 6 million now we aposve been around since 1871 it took us that long i want to get a million more and then i aposm going to go out and ask every nra member to recruit one more that will put 14 million activists on the streets not the types that george soros is fielding not the types that showed up down there in dallas to protest our right to gather but those are going to be people who support the second amendment that aposs our cause wallace ollie thank you thanks for coming in today north a pleasure wallace now let aposs bring in mark kelly the retired astronaut who became a leader in preventing gun violence after his wife former congresswoman gabby giffords was severely injured by a deranged shooter in 2011 mark you just heard oliver north here aposs what president trump said after the shooting begin video clip donald trump president of the united states my administration is determined to do everything in our power to protect our students secure our schools and to keep weapons out of the hands of those who pose a threat to themselves and to others end video clip wallace mark your reaction mark kelly former nasa astronaut well you know on the surface those sound like reasonable words i mean keeping guns weapons out of the hands of people that pose a threat you did not hear ollie say that you know ollie talked about the school being the problem and not the fact that we have proliferated guns throughout society i aposm a gun owner like ollie i aposm a supporter of the second amendment but we make it so easy for irresponsible people and criminals to get access to firearms wallace but let me pick up on that because let aposs review the facts of this specific case the shooter in this case had a shotgun and a pistol there were no assault weapons the guns had been bought legally by his father he was on the school football team he was on the honor roll there were no red flags the fact is most of the things that you generally talk about would not have prevented this shooting kelly in general but you know one thing that could be done i mean the state of texas is an example could pass a piece of legislation that requires parents to safely store their firearms if they have a child in the house i mean this kid was 17 years old he shouldn apost have access to a semiautomatic shotgun and a 38 revolver i mean there is legislation i mean it works it works in the states that have less gun violence you know they have stronger laws wallace but you are talking about texas people go hunting the idea that a 17 year old is not going to have access to his dad aposs shotgun and that we aposre going to have a law preventing that kelly i mean it exists in some places i mean i go hunting as well but you know all my firearms are locked in a safe and if i had i don apost even have a kid in the house anymore i mean if i did you know i would even probably even double down on that i mean there are things that work when we allow irresponsible people to get their hands on firearms and criminals i mean your last guest is about to take over as the president of an organization that is against background checks for gun sales i mean the most common sense thing that we can do to protect society they are so strongly against and then they advocate for an alternative reality that the problem is the school and the access point wallace well wait wait i want to crosstalk kelly certainly we can take steps wallace mark i want to pick up on that though because as i discussed with oliver north this is the 16th school shooting so far this year there clearly is a copycat aspect of this one disturbed student seeing what another disturbed student did and following in that deranged path and the question does become at a certain point particularly as i point out where a lot of the things assault weapons red flags don apost wouldn apost have worked in this case do we need to harden our schools the way we do our airports with metal detectors and limited access to get in and out of the school kelly absolutely i mean i think we should make it more difficult i mean figure out a way to prevent people coming in the door with a firearm at the same time make sure that that irresponsible person can apost get the gun in the first place i mean there are a lot of reasons why we have the level of gun violence that we currently have in this country it aposs not one reason we have 38 000 people dying every year from gun violence another 110 000 people are shot and injured i can tell you this and this is from somebody who owns eight firearms it aposs not because we don apost have enough guns in our society i mean we have more guns than almost every other country if the issue was more firearms in more places which is what ollie north and the nra advocates for we would live in the safest country on the planet and that aposs not the case wallace i have about a minute left and i want to ask you one final question gun control has generally not been a big pro gun control a big voting issue in elections you just heard oliver north say that he is on a campaign to try to reassure politicians that being part or associated with the nra is a plus not a minus he wants to add a million more members voters do you think you can make pro gun control issues a key voting issue in this campaign kelly well i mean gun safety already is i mean we saw that in november in virginia we aposre going to see this year in november these kids from parkland who by the way ollie referred to as terrorists i believe it aposs what he said about them several weeks ago i mean these kids are motivated they are smart they are articulate and they are angry and they have a right to be angry the kids in santa fe i live 10 miles from that school for 15 years those kids have a right to be angry about this and the alternative reality i mean rex tillerson just gave just gave a speech at vmi a commencement speech and he talked about how alternative realities are a threat to democracy and i think what wallace all right kelly the nra is proposing as an alternative reality wallace mark we are going to have to leave it there thank you thank you for joining us today and unfortunately we will stay on top of this continuing story up next treasury secretary steven mnuchin on talks to settle big differences between the u s and china can the world aposs two against economies avoid a trade war commercial break wallace china is showing some signs of compromise in talks with the u s but heading off a trade war that has kept the global markets on edge is still far from a done deal joining us now president trump aposs point man in the negotiations treasury secretary steven mnuchin mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday steven mnuchin treasury secretary thank you it aposs great to be here with you wallace after two long days of talks thursday and friday where are we on the one hand on china agreeing to buy 200 billion more of u s goods in return for the u s dropping tariffs on 150 billion of chinese goods mnuchin well chris i aposm pleased to report that we have made very meaningful progress and we agreed on a framework which is important to understand and the framework includes their agreement to substantially reduce the trade deficit by increasing their purchases of goods we also discussed very important structural issues that they are going to make in their economy to make sure that we have a fair ability to compete there and also protections about technology which have been very important to the president wallace but china and one of the big things the president has said is he wants them to reduce the deficit by 200 billion by 200 billion worth of u s goods they reportedly refused to agree to that specific target there aposs nothing about a specific target in the statement one have they refused to agree to a target and is there still the possibility of a trade war mnuchin well chris we aposre putting the trade war on hold so right now we are we have agreed to put the tariffs on hold while we try to execute the framework the president has been very clear since the first meeting with president xi in mar a lago that it is we are going to reduce the trade deficit we have an agreement with china that they will substantially agree to it i would just comment that ultimately these are not government to government transactions it aposs not a giant purchase order with us we are immediately going to follow this up with secretary ross going there with very hard commitments in agriculture where we expect to see a very big increase 35 to 45 percent increases in agriculture this year alone in energy doubling the energy purchases i think that you could see 50 billion 60 billion a year of energy purchases over the next three to five years and strategically that aposs very important for us and very important for them wallace but just to lock down two points sir one no specific target of 200 billion mnuchin chris we have specific targets i aposm not going to publicly disclose what they are they go industry by industry and as i said not only do we have targets but ultimately this is about industry being able to have hard contracts and deliver these goods wallace and as far as the president aposs threat first of 50 billion in tariffs on chinese goods and 150 billion those are all on hold mnuchin they are and the president had a very productive meeting with the vice premier in the oval office with all of us and the vice president he heard these commitments himself and he can always decide to put the tariffs back on if china doesn apost go through with their commitments wallace now president trump shocked a lot of people this week when he tweeted this let aposs put it up on the screen president xi of china and i are working together to give massive chinese phone company zte a way to get back into business fast too many jobs in china lost the trump administration has banned u s companies from selling components to zte and the president indicated that perhaps he would be willing to and that ban which resulted in this exchange take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states president xi asked me to look at it i said i would look at it but anything we do with zte is always it aposs just a small component of the overall deal sen chuck schumer d new york president trump bemoans too many jobs in china lost what about american jobs end video clip wallace now the issue with zte is that they violated our sanctions for selling goods to iran and north korea is zte part of these trade talks and is president trump willing to relax the ban on u s companies selling components to zte mnuchin so chris i don apost know why anybody is surprised about this so let me give you the facts president xi asked president trump to look into this that aposs not a surprise president trump often asks other leaders to look into things that are important to our companies the president asked secretary ross to look into it ok and that aposs what secretary ross this is an enforcement issue it aposs not a trade issue we didn apost agree to any quid pro quo and secretary ross will make sure that the enforcement issue is in but in in a way that aposs good for american companies and i aposm not going to go through the discussions on the enforcement issue that was completely independent of our trade negotiations wallace but we just have the sound bite of president trump saying it aposs a small component of the overall deal he seems to be linking zte with the trade talks mnuchin again the president asked us to look into it as part of the delegation and that aposs what we did i can assure you and you know i aposm very involved in all the sanctions issues myself i can assure you that whatever changes we make to the enforcement issue on zte we will be protecting american technology american jobs and make sure that the secretary is comfortable with enforcement this is but this is an enforcement issue and i can assure you the president wants us to be very tough on zte and all he did was ask the secretary to look into this wallace ok president trump also suggested that president xi chinese president xi may be using his leverage with kim jong un on relative to a summit to get a better trade deal with the u s take a look begin video clip trump it could very well be that he is influencing kim jong un we aposll see what happens meaning the president of china president xi could be influencing kim jong un end video clip wallace now the president has suggested before that if president xi is helpful with regards to north korea then he president trump might go easier on china on a trade deal is the whole issue of a trump kim summit and president xi aposs conceivable role in that is that part of trade talks mnuchin well it is only part of trade talks in the sense of i have very direct conversations with the vice premier you know i aposm responsible for sanctions and i have a commitment from them that they are going to continue to enforce the sanctions that are in place and this is very important and china has the same objective as we do they want to get rid of the nuclear weapons wallace so we are not going easy on china and the trade talks to try and get xi aposs help for a summit mnuchin i don apost think we are going easy on the trade talks at all i think for the first time ok many presidents haven apost dealt with this issue president trump has dealt with this issue he threatened to put on 150 billion tariffs we have a really good framework agreement that aposs not just about buying goods it aposs about structural changes it aposs about lowering tariffs china has committed to lower tariffs on many things and made structural changes and protect our technology so these are very important issues for the u s economy and now we are going to make sure that this gets implemented wallace all right as if you didn apost have enough on your plate there aposs also nafta are negotiations of the effort to renegotiate a trade deal with canada and mexico and there are reports or speculation that prospects for a deal are diminishing after the administration missed a deadline this past week that had been set by house speaker paul ryan for getting the deal done what are the chances that nafta will be renegotiated and it will be passed by congress this year mnuchin the president is more determined to have a good deal then he is worried about any deadline so whether we pass it in this congress or whether we pass it in a new congress the president is determined that we negotiate nafta that aposs something we aposre doing i can tell you i aposve been in contact with the finance ministers in both canada and mexico president trump and trudeau had a very good conversation last week as ambassador lighthizer has said we are still far apart but we are working every day to renegotiate this agreement and that aposs what we aposre focused on wallace so you are suggesting the president is not setting any kind of deadline and might be willing to let this spillover into 2019 mnuchin i aposm not saying he aposs willing to let it spill over ok he has all these alternatives i aposm just saying right now we are focused on negotiating a good deal and we are not focused on specific deadlines i can tell you that ambassador lighthizer and others are still working around the clock on his negotiations with canada and mexico we are far apart but our objective is still to get a deal wallace secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for your time you aposve got a lot on your plate mnuchin very busy don apost forget iran sanctions which we are also very focused on chris wallace i wanted to ask about that please come back and we will discuss that as well coming up kim jong un threatens to cancel the singapore summit and president trump says kim can stay in power if he makes a deal we aposll discuss where things stand with senator lindsey graham next commercial break wallace coming up president trump offers assurances to north korea aposs kim jong un in exchange for a nuclear deal begin video clip trump we are going to say that he will have very adequate protection and let aposs see how it all turns out end video clip wallace we aposll ask senator lindsey graham what to expect from the planned summit in singapore next commercial break chris wallace fox news host north korea is making good on its reputation for being unpredictable now threatening to back out of next month aposs planned summit between kim jong un and president trump so what should we make of the diplomatic gamesmanship joining me now from south carolina senator lindsey graham a key member of the senate armed services apos committee senator north korea suggested this week as we say that they may not show up in singapore for the summit are they playing us sen lindsey graham r sc senate armed services committee right i don apost know but they are making a mistake if they don apost show up that means diplomacy has failed and president trump is intent on calling the question on north korea in his first term so that puts us back on the path to conflict it would be time to take american families and dependents out of south korea i talked with the president two or three days ago he aposs not going to be played they are trying to run out the clock they have a record of promising to give up their nuclear weapons in reality they build up their weapons they aposve done this for 30 years it aposs going to end one way or the other by 2020 wallace and you aposve also said that if they do show up have the summit and then don apost make a deal that that aposs dangerous as well graham well that ends diplomacy the last thing you want is want is diplomacy to be ended or to have a meeting with president trump and you continue to play him because they aposve done that for 30 years trump is not obama he aposs not going to tolerate that he wants a win win we aposre not out to replace kim jong un we aposre not trying to reunify the peninsula we aposre not trying to spread democracy to north korea we are trying to get them to give up their nuclear weapons program and the korean war and make it a win win if they don apost show up that aposs the end of diplomacy if they do show up and try to play trump and that means military conflict is the only thing left and if we have a conflict with north korea they will lose it not us wallace i want to be clear because you do talk to the president a lot you said you talked to him two or three days ago graham yes wallace has he said to you if they don apost get a deal a diplomatic deal to end north korea aposs nuclear program that he is going to use military efforts against north korea against the regime graham he says he aposs going to end this conflict within his first term that every other president has been played they aposve done every agreement known to man bilateral multilateral agreements they promised to give up their weapons they back out and they build up their weapons program there aposs no place to kick the can president trump told me three days ago that he wants to end this in a win win way he thinks that aposs possible but if they pull out they play him that we aposre going to end north korea aposs threat to the american homeland in his first term and i aposll let you surmise as to what that might look like wallace now you just heard treasury secretary mnuchin talk about trade negotiations with china here was the president this week begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i can only tell you this we are going to come out fine with china hopefully china is going to be happy i think we will be happy end video clip wallace any concern that president trump is too much of a hurry for a deal with china either to score a political win or to try to satisfy xi to help broker the kim trump summit graham well i think it aposs smart to engage china on trade abuses and it would also be smart to get them more involved in trying to help us with north korea so we finally got some leverage now with china anything before trump didn apost work being quiet not disturbing north korea we aposve engaged them like 20 times in the last 20 or 30 years nobody has ever really pushed back against china so north korea wants to wait trump out they aposre going to try to nickel and dime the president they aposre going to give a little bit take a lot they aposre going to play china against the united states none of that is going to work they are trying to run the clock out they understand our electoral system and the only thing i can tell you after talking to president trump three days ago china and north korea have a chance to end the conflict in a win win fashion and if it doesn apost end soon it aposs going to be a real mess and if there aposs a war it will be in china aposs backyard not ours wallace i want to continue though on this question of china and traded because let aposs talk about zte which i was discussing graham right wallace with treasury secretary mnuchin it aposs not just that they violated u s sanctions against companies doing business with iran and north korea as you well know there are also concerns that zte is a national security threat to this country so when you hear president trump talk about well you know maybe we need to reduce some of our sanctions against zte does that concern you graham yes i think president trump is going to is a good negotiator you know we are not going to withdraw our troops as part of the deal with north korea because that aposs been stabilizing as to zte continuing to do business with them as normal that would be a real backlash in congress if that were on the table because this is chinese run company that aposs up to no good but where are we we aposre at the table with china about leveling out trade imbalances we aposre talking about a summit with the north korean leader directly with the president of the united states the only reason we are where we are is because president trump has tried something new he aposs approaching this issue from strength not weakness he wants a good deal north korea could come out of this thing just fine but if they play trump if they try to nickel and dime trump and if they try to run out the clock on president trump then we aposre going to have a conflict and it aposs going to be in his first term i aposm highly confident of that because there is no other place to kick the can we aposve get it get too bad for too long and president trump is going to end this problem with north korea one way or the other and he should wallace all right finally the russia investigation and i will take you back to a tweet that president trump put out on thursday here it is wow word seems to be coming out that the obama fbi spied on the trump campaign with an embedded informant if so bigger than watergate now there have been senator several reports since then there was no mole inside the campaign but as the fbi became increasingly worried about possible links with russia it had a fellow apparently an american professor based in england talked to several members of the trump campaign particularly in the foreign policy area does that bother you graham yes it bothers me that there may be an informant and one of the campaigns unless there is a damn good reason all i can tell you is that the dossier compiled by mr steele that was given to the justice department where they obtained the warrant against carter page somebody inside the trump orbit was a bunch of political garbage it was not well vetted and that aposs a very crosstalk wallace if i may let me just ask you because what we aposre talking about here is not a mole inside the campaign but asking somebody outside the campaign to make efforts to reach out to carter page to george papadopoulos apparently to sam clovis to try to find out what they were doing with the russians do you think that aposs a problem graham i think this whole area is a problem let me tell you why the department of justice used a document prepared by a foreign agent paid for by political party to obtain a fisa warrant and never told the court if they were using as somebody to engage the trump campaign was their judicial oversight they had the thumb on the scale when it came to the clinton investigation somebody has got to watch those who watch us senator grassley sent a letter asking questions about this i aposm intend on letting mr mueller do his job but i want to make sure the fbi and the department of justice did not try to in their own way change the outcome of the election did they use techniques and tactics approved by the court or did they just make this up themselves i don apost know wallace ok i aposve got less than a minute left the president aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani was back at it again this week attacking the special counsel investigation here he is begin video clip rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney if you aposre going to write an unfair report write it and we will combat it we aposre ready to rip it apart and we aposre ready to rip them apart if that aposs what they want end video clip wallace do you think rudy giuliani is helping or hurting the president graham i think he aposs showing a determination to push back and aggressively defend his client with rudy it aposs a little bit of both but i aposd like to have rudy on my team if i were the president because he aposs pretty good at talking to the american people his reputation has been as a solid prosecutor let mr mueller do his job and then see what aposs there and let the trump people rip into it and we aposll figure out as a country whether or not there aposs anything there i haven apost seen the evidence of collusion by the president but time will tell wallace senator graham thank you thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us always good to talk with you and let aposs both hope graham thank you wallace we never need a good lawyer graham let aposs hope so wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to break down year one of the mueller investigation and what to expect as the president and his legal team launch a new strategy commercial break begin video clip rudy giuliani attorney donald trump we would have to know what is it do you want clarified if we knew that and they told us that if we gave the explanation that we aposre proposing he was they were going to end it fine we aposre trying to get him to end this end video clip chris wallace host fox news sunday president trump aposs lead lawyer rudy giuliani going on tv to negotiate the terms under which his client would sit for an interview with the special counsel and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume back after a long time on the beach welcome back columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and josh holmes mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff and now a gop strategist brit first anniversary of the special counsel investigation robert mueller what do you think of the effort by his present being ph increasingly aggressive effort by the president and his team to try to end it and what do you make of this controversy about an apparent fbi informant who was asking questions of trump campaign officials brit hume senior political analyst fox news well the aggressive approach is probably worth a try i aposm not sure it aposs going to work because the truth is chris for all the talk about there being some real accountability to higher authorities within the government by the special counsel there really isn apost i mean they aposre effectively have a roving commission ph no matter what you aposd call them no matter what legal authority they aposre operating under so he aposs it seems to me that as a practical matter the the special counsel is free to rove in any direction he wants wallace and the fbi informant hume and the fbi informant it seems to me is an interesting question and the question it seems to me is this did they actually have a basis in law to create this investigation in the first place was it sufficient was it sufficient to go to all the lengths they aposve gone to actually with the you know with with with the informants with the subpoenas with breaking down doors and all of that that they aposve that they have done you know it all hangs on a rather small thread which was this papadopoulos meeting that we aposve all heard so much about wallace former advisor george papadopoulos supposed being told that the russians had dirt on hillary clinton hume a man a man hardly at the center of the trump campaign wallace right hume so i think it comes down to that in the end and whether this was all much ado about not much and it has gone on too long remember you say it aposs the first anniversary it aposs really the second almost the second because it started as a counterintelligence investigation under comey then that was the thread that was picked up by mueller when he took over wallace juan i want you to too address particularly this issue because originally there was speculation and then even the president tweeting about a mole planted inside the campaign and now it turns out that it was an american professor based in britain who reached out to a few members of the of the campaign to try to ask them about relations with russia juan williams opinion contributor the hill right so what you have is an ongoing effort i think to undermine not only the mueller investigation but the intelligence organizations both cia and fbi that started this counterintelligence effort based on the idea that russia was interfering in an ongoing election but this changes nothing in terms of the substance the president this morning has backed off the embedded stuff he just and at one point he said this was bigger than watergate you know the obama wallace he was ph talking about infiltration williams yes but it aposs it aposs the cases all three of the people we are discussing here papadopoulos as brit mentioned but also sam clovis carter page all met with this professor and we know that all three are implicated in the russia probe so it doesn apost change anything i think what we have here is an effort in advance of the likelihood that mueller aposs going to ask the president to testify under oath to somehow diminish the quality of the investigation and the quality of the intelligence agencies that contribute to it wallace i want to turn to the other big story this week and that of course is the on again off again singapore summit between trump and kim the north koreans saying not so fast and the president quite remarkably is offering assurances to kim if you make a deal with us you can stay in power and your country will see untold riches from investment from the west congresswoman harman what do you make of this jane harman director woodrow wilson center well talking is better than bombing and i hope the talks are successful and i applaud president trump for making this his highest priority at the beginning of the administration something that president obama did not do and president trump tells us that all the time but it aposs true obama did not do this i aposm dubious that this gets to a good place fast this is going to take a long time for lots of reasons one of which is it aposs not a slam dunk that the kim regime survives just because we say so unless we aposre going to go to war to protect the kim regime which i doubt the reason is once the people of north korea understand that over 70 years tens of thousands have been in gulags and they aposve been deprived of food which is why they aposre three inches shorter than south koreans in order to build this nuclear industry which just got given up i don apost know how that aposs going to go down so that aposs kind of my point about that but in addition to that denuclearization doesn apost mean the same thing to kim that it does to us and i don apost think we will or should give up our nuclear umbrella in asia which protects our allies we still have some there wallace so what do you think if this doesn apost go the way the president wants what do you think of lindsey graham who really wanted to send a message today one way or another this is going to end by 2020 harman well 100 years ago world war i was fought based on a miscalculation and more people died than in any time in our history and i sure hope we don apost go to war because president trump wants to fit this in a box of his first term i think we ought to go to ware if we do and maybe we have to but i hope not for the right reasons not to meet a time clock wallace josh after all of this week aposs developments involving the president involving kim involving china how do you feel about a trump kim summit holmes well look i think the notion that we would go from a nuclear showdown to peace in our time in a course of three months without any bumps in the road is pretty ridiculous i mean obviously we are going to have some setbacks here and i think if history is our guide we are going to have a lucy and a football moment with north korea where they retract some of the things that they said they were going to go forward with and i think we will have a lot of setbacks wallace and how do you think president trump is going to deal with that because he sure makes it sound like i mean he says if this doesn apost work out in singapore i aposm going to walk out on the table i mean does diplomacy continue then holmes yeah i mean i think he aposs been remarkably circumspect about how he has approached this whole thing we have the showdown last summer where his rhetoric was pretty hot but since then he has talked about you know if there is something to be done here i will be there butthe moment there is not i will walk away and i think he has put for the first time in decades american foreign policy in a place where it aposs kind of a win win here if we get a diplomatic solution we are pursuing we are there if not the world is going to see kim for what he is hume and chris remember this for the longest time and for good reason threats of force against north korea have been considered unimaginable because not so much because they are an emerging nuclear power but because they have conventional weapons that could cause unspeakable destruction in the south particularly around the south korean capital so president trump by his rhetoric seems to me to have created in the mind of the north koreans the idea that he might just do it which is a useful thing that aposs what you want him to think going into a negotiation wallace all right well this will be continued from now to and perhaps after the singapore summit thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the man riding high in the sport of kings commercial break wallace around this time of year people get excited about the idea of another super horse ready to take on the challenge of racing aposs triple crown this spring there is a new contender trained by the most recognizable figure in horse racing here aposs our power player of the week begin

derby in 76 days the first derby winner not to run as a two year old since 1882 baffert the horse brings you to the derby you don apost you can apost make it happen and that aposs what this horse did wallace baffert grew up on a ranch in arizona as a kid he wrote in match races against another horse and jockey baffert i was like 13 14 and i was doing this i just loved it i wanted to be a jockey and the first thing my father would tell me now don apost tell your mother wallace he started training quarter horses as we found out on the track let me just start with a couple general questions we aposll get a little more specific what aposs it like training a great race horse baffert when i came from the quarter horse worlds every sentence we started out with i tell you what he aposs a good un he aposs a good un chris he can fly wallace now his thoroughbreds have won more than 2 600 races and more than 232 million and baffert is having the ride of his life baffert our stomachs are just churning the day of the race but when those horses when those beautiful horses win it aposs like it aposs like this is what this is what we aposre in it for and they just love to run they aposre born
