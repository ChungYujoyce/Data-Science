could boil over at the hotel du palais along the atlantic coast there s also mr trump s trade wars britain s attempt to pull off its brexit from the european union tensions in kashmir and hong kong and the potential reinstatement of vladimir putin s russia to the club of developed nations that includes canada france germany italy japan the u k and the u s and then there s climate change a perennial sticking point between mr trump and other world leaders yet an issue where mr macron wants to see progress tom bernes a distinguished fellow at the center for international governance
