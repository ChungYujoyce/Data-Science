voters across nine states largely in congressional districts held by freshman democrats on the front line of the fight the responses ranging from frustration and sadness to anxiety and relief point to the challenges democrats face if they are to turn what they describe as a principled stand against corruption to their political advantage republicans overwhelmingly opposed the step toward impeachment and say the development is a political ploy democrats and independents were not nearly as unified many expressed certainty that the president has committed impeachable offenses but they also were deeply skeptical about the wisdom of moving ahead now worrying it would only serve to fire up trump supporters the best way to unseat trump was at the ballot box they said others fretted about the distraction that impeachment would cause i don t think impeachment is meaningless but i don t think it s possible so why try it said agnes anderson a retired businesswoman and school teacher in suburban chicago with the republican controlled senate unlikely to convict trump and remove him from office if the democratic run house had voted to impeach i m not sure we re going to change any minds so why go there and run the chance of trump picking up more support agnes and her husband john anderson live in a district that swung to democratic rep sean casten last year the andersons talk regularly with a politically diverse group of neighbors and say they haven t sensed any shift on impeachment this week it s an issue they ve thought about for months the andersons attended an impeachment town hall held by casten who came out for impeachment this summer but came away unconvinced this squeamishness is one reason that impeachment has been off the table for party leaders until now the political future for many democrats may depend on whether they can bring along these voters there s about 15 of the american public who disapprove of the job trump is doing as president but disapprove of impeachment said whit ayres a gop pollster if people are going to change their minds about impeachment those are the ones most likely to move many democrats in these pockets celebrated

fire in the belly among those needing to step it up he said was his congresswoman rep angie craig a democrat who ousted a gop incumbent in a district trump narrowly won two years earlier this week craig was among a group of freshman democrats who announced they were moving toward backing an impeachment proceeding news that helped push pelosi ahead others included chrissy houlahan of pennsylvania elaine luria and abigail spanberger of virginia and elissa slotkin of michigan those lawmakers cited national security concerns not politics as driving their decision the democrats peril was illustrated in interviews in slotkin s district a mix of comfortable suburbs and rural areas that cut through trump territory in michigan the district has plenty of trump defenders such as republican joe chila 85 of rochester who called the news terrible he said he voted for democrat barack obama in 2008 but has voted republican since the democrats lost the election in 2016 and they still can t get over it he said adding that democrats should be working with trump on gun control rather than trying to impeach him some voters in the district who have favored democrats were ambivalent scott burns 38 said he didn t vote for trump or hillary clinton in 2016 but backed slotkin last year there s no such thing as bad publicity for him burns said of trump warning the tactic would backfire on democrats if that s your strategy to make it worse it s not going to work that illustrates a phenomenon that comes up in focus groups on the topic says kevin mack chief strategist of the liberal group need to impeach skeptics often oppose impeachment for tactical rather than substantive reasons if there s an actual vote that s taking place with actual facts we think they ll come around on it and stop acting like political prognosticators and start acting like american citizens mack said ron smith a 48 year old independent who works in it and lives in craig s district will be listening he doesn t trust either party s motives and said he didn t vote for trump or clinton in 2016 the outcome of the investigation may sway his vote in 2020 he said i just need to know more facts people who have their minds made up are basing that on emotion or just not appreciating the other side nearby yon thomand a 47 year old health coordinator at a nursing home was less ambivalent
