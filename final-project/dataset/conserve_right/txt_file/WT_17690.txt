apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic amsterdam ap president barack obama begins a week of international travel with russia s crimean incursion at the top of his agenda even as he simultaneously seeks to re emphasize u s influence abroad as he arrived in the netherlands monday on a sunny and brisk morning no issue commanded more of obama s and europe s attention than russia s annexation of the crimean peninsula and the fear that moscow could decide to expand further into ukraine we re united in imposing a cost on russia for its actions so far obama said after meeting with dutch prime minister mark rutte top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time but obama also is attempting to use his weeklong trip to personally reconnect not only with europe but asia and the middle east all strategically crucial regions with their own tensions and qualms about the u s officially nuclear terrorism is the main topic for world leaders at the summit the third since obama launched the series in 2009 it opened with japan announcing it would turn over to the u s more than 700 pounds of weapons great plutonium and a supply of highly enriched uranium a victory for obama s efforts to secure nuclear materials around the world but in another sign of how the ukraine crisis was overshadowing diplomacy on other fronts putin declined to attend sending his foreign minister instead rutte said russia s attempts to annex crimea are a flagrant breach of international law the presence of so many international leaders in the netherlands this week presents an important opportunity for the international community to discuss this subject as well as other pressing issues that affect our common interest rutte said as the two spoke before rembrandt s massive 17th century painting night watch at the recently renovated rijksmuseum obama remarked that it s the most impressive backdrop he s ever had for a statement to the press obama said he and the dutch leader also discussed trade

scheduled meeting of the group of seven industrialized economies the u s britain canada france germany italy and japan in an interview with the dutch newspaper de volkskrant published ahead of his arrival in monday obama says his message to european leaders is that russian president vladimir putin needs to understand the economic and political consequences of his actions in ukraine still he said he does not view europe as a battleground between the east and the west that s the kind of thinking that should have ended with the cold war he said on the contrary it s important that ukraine have good relations with the united states russia and europe discussion among obama and his g 7 counterparts will center on economic aid to ukraine while at the same time seeking to segregate putin from the exclusive group which russia usually joins in group of eight meetings more broadly the ukraine crisis will test obama s ability to forge a unified and forceful stance against russia from european leaders who are alarmed by putin s moves but whose economies are dependent on russian energy and trade in the interview obama conceded that the sanctions he has threatened against russian economic sectors could have worldwide impacts but he added if russia continues to escalate the situation we need to be prepared to impose a greater cost still european sanctions against russia have not matched those announced by obama michael geary who has written two books on the european union said expectations for concrete action are not high i suspect that what we will get is a lot of harsh rhetoric from the g7 and eu but little in the way of deeper coordinated sanctions said geary a global fellow with the wilson center obama s meeting with china s xi highlights another tricky front in u s international relations and comes just a day after the new york times and the german magazine der spiegel reported that the u s national security agency had hacked into the servers of chinese

secession referendum illegal with russia vetoing the measure and the 13 other council members voting in favor china s abstention served to isolate moscow internationally tuesday s meeting with japan s abe and south korea s park comes after what national security adviser susan rice conceded was a period of tension a reference to chinese and south korean anger at recent abe gestures that have rekindled memories of japan s aggression in world war ii it will be the first meeting between the two asian leaders since they took office more than a year ago tuesday s session with the abu dhabi crown prince will also serve as precursor to obama s end of trip visit to saudi arabia where he will meet with saudi king abdullah to address arab anxieties over the syrian civil war and u s nuclear talks with iran a saudi arabia rival in
