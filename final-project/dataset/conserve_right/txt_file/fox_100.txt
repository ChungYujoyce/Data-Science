an of the house oversight committee joins fox news sunday to discuss new revelations surrounding hillary clinton s presidential campaign this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday october 29 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news sunday host i aposm chris wallace a year after the 2016 election was it hillary clinton and the democrats who colluded with the russians begin videotape donald trump president of the united states she denied it her own people denied it everybody denied it and now they are sort of scooting around trying to figure out what to say wallace who in the clinton campaign approved paying for the russian dossier on donald trump and did they break the law and what does it mean for the investigation into russian collusion with the trump campaign we aposll ask house oversight committee chair trey gowdy only on fox news sunday then the gop revolt sen bob corker r tennessee it aposs obvious his political model and governing model is to divide sen jeff flake r arizona i have children and grandchildren to answer to and so mr president i will not be complicit or silent wallace what do republican attacks on the president mean for the future of the party we aposll talk with ohio governor john kasich a trump critic it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive plus president trump and the republicans still looking for the first big legislative win rep paul ryan r wis speaker of the house this budget that we just passed in the house today brings us one step closer to historic tax reform wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel if they can make good on the promise of big tax cuts by the end of the year and our power players of the week showing the struggles our nation aposs heroes face when they come home all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington we begin with the latest reports at least one person has been charged in connection with special counsel robert mueller aposs investigation into russian meddling in the 2016 election the reports say a federal grand jury approved the chargers friday those charges have been sealed by a judge and anyone facing charges could be taken into custody as soon as tomorrow meanwhile house republicans are launching new investigations into hillary clinton including the revelation that her campaign and the democratic national committee paid for opposition research that led to the russian dossier that accused the trump campaign of collusion with the russians joining us now to discuss all this congressman trey gowdy chairman of the house oversight committee chairman let aposs start with the report from several news outlets that the first mueller charges will be announced tomorrow as a former federal prosecutor yourself what will you be looking for rep trey gowdy r sc chair oversight committee well first of all chris we don apost know who aposs being charged let aposs assume arguably ph though the reporting is true we don apost know who is being charged we don apost what they aposre being charged for we don apost know the time period i will say this the only conversation i aposve had with robert mueller it was stressing to him the importance of cutting out the leaks with respect to serious investigations so it is kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and executing the law would violate the law and make no mistake disclosing grand jury material is a violation of the law so as a former prosecutor i aposm disappointed that you and i are having the conversation but that somebody violated their oath of secrecy wallace let aposs handicap this though if you will sort of expert analysis as a federal prosecutor you aposre quite right we do not know who is being charged and what they are being charged for what if anything when we find that out whether it aposs somebody close to the president somebody further down whether it aposs something related to russia or whether it aposs in effect an extraneous charge not to say it aposs not a legitimate charge but something like fraud or money laundering what will that tell us about the mueller investigation gowdy well a little phrase in the memo from rod rosenstein arose or may arise from investigation and the reason you have that phraseology is if special counsel finds evidence of a crime that aposs unrelated to his or her original jurisdiction you don apost ignore it but it aposs going to be really important whether or not this indictment involves 15 year old business transactions or 15 day old conversations with russia so it aposs really important what the charge is it aposs really important who the person being charged is one thing i don apost get that excited about although i do see a lot of reporting is somehow or another you aposre going to be able to flip a witness and that witness is going to turn state aposs evidence on everyone else if you didn apost believe a witness yesterday chances are great you aposre not going to believe that witness tomorrow particularly if they are under indictment and have a reason to curry favor with the government these investigations come down to documents and evidence much more so than they do witness testimony so i would caution your viewers don apost get too excited that all of a sudden the government now has a star witness that star witness you probably didn apost believe a week ago and you probably won apost believe a week from now wallace there have been growing calls from some republicans to end the mueller investigation some people say he aposs too close to comey and the fbi and that he ought to resign some people say that when the mueller budget for the special counsel investigation is presented to congress to review next month that they should cut off funding do you support any effort to either curtail or end the mueller investigation gowdy i don apost and i readily concede i aposm in an increasingly small group of republicans i think bob mueller has a really distinguished career of service to our country i don apost think any of your viewers can think of a single thing he did as the fbi director that calls them to have a lack of confidence in him i think most of our viewers have to be reminded that he actually was the fbi director or that he actually was a u s attorney because he aposs a pretty apolitical guy i see the reporting i see the same thing you aposre making reference to that he and comey are friends i aposm not really sure what the definition of that is i aposve got a lot of coworkers that it wouldn apost stop me from investigating them or prosecuting them so they aposre not family members they weren apost business partners i would encourage my republican friends give the guy a chance to do his job the result will be known by the facts by what he uncovers the personalities involved are much less important to me than the underlying facts so i would i would say give the guy a chance to do his job wallace let aposs turn to the revelation this week that it turns out that the clinton campaign and the democratic national committee paid for the opposition research that led to the writing the formulation of this russian dossier that has made all kinds of accusations against president trump and his campaign what do you think is the significance of that revelation gowdy well one of the areas of significance is just how hard the democrats in congress fault republicans for trying to gain access to this information if it were up to adam schiff and other democrats who of course want all the facts to come out they want all the facts of russia to come out except who finance the dossier so that aposs the most important thing to me is how unserious the democrats in the house have been about uncovering all of the facts i am interested in who paid for the dossier because that helps you understand motive and intent and whether or not you can rely on the document i am much more interested in whether or not the department of justice and the fbi relied upon that dossier and initiating a counterintelligence investigation or in court findings that is really important to me i don apost expect the dnc to be objective almost by definition opposition research is not objective i do expect an entity represented by a blindfolded woman to be objective and if they relied on that dossier and they didn apost corroborate it or vet it then we have a serious issue and that aposs the next thing that house intel is trying to find out is whether or not the u s government relied on it wallace yes let me ask you about that because your what the two points you are making and i agree these are two very important questions did the fbi based its original investigation at least in part of the dossier and when you talk about court representations that aposs the possibility that they use the dossier to convince a fisa court to allow the fbi to wiretap people in trump world trump associates do you have any evidence of that i understand the investigation is just beginning gowdy well actually the investigation is not just beginning we aposve been trying for a long time to get the department of justice to give us access to this information and frankly it took the speaker of the house this week to tell the department that we aposre not going away you know chris people don apost like it when i say this but it aposs actually true it aposs sometimes hard to tell the difference between the obama department of justice and the current department of justice in terms of transparency and their willingness to share information with congress this is a really simple request did you rely on the dossier and if so did you vet it before you relied upon it you can answer that in 30 seconds but it aposs taken three months for the department of justice and only recently have they agreed to give us the information so the battle is not just with house democrats unfortunately it aposs also with the department of justice the access ph of the information we need to wrap up this investigation wallace what about the fact that the clinton campaign and the dnc which paid 12 million for the law firm perkins coie that paid for the opposition research that led to the dossier that in the fec filings it simply says 12 million to perkins coie the law firm for legal work no mention of the fact that it was also paying for oppo research that went to christopher steele former british intelligence agency agent that went to the kremlin not the money to the kremlin but his investigation as i understand it that willful misrepresentation of campaign expenditures is a criminal offense gowdy well i aposm not an election law expert chris but the good news is you don apost have to be to understand the absurdity of believing that you can launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm i mean imagine if you and i were running for congress and we just hired a law firm and said hey you go to all the oppo you go buy all the television you go buy all the bumper stickers you go hire all the experts and we aposre going to launder all of this through a law firm i can apost think of anything that defeats the purpose of transparency laws more than that so i am interested in that and i am also interested in sharing some memory tricks with folks at the dnc because no one can remember who paid 10 million to a law firm to do oppo research i find that stunning ten million dollars and no one can remember who authorized it who approved it who said this is a really good idea so you aposve got two issues a memory issue and then the lack of transparency by laundering money through a law firm wallace we aposre running out of time but i want to ask you to more questions one is that you are also have begun an investigation into the 2010 uranium one deal this was the deal under which 20 percent of america aposs uranium reserves ended up going to a russian government agency hillary clinton responded this week to all of this talk about her i aposd like to play the clip of her begin video clip hillary clinton former democratic presidential candidate the closer the investigation about real russian ties between trump associates and real russians the more they want to just throw mud on the wall and i aposm their favorite target me and you know president obama we are the ones they always like to put into the crosshairs end video clip wallace so secretary clinton and other democrats are saying that you and the republicans are just trying to shift the conversation gowdy well chris all the way back in 2010 peter king and ros ileana ros lehtinen two of my colleagues on the house intel committee sent a letter to cfius trying to better understand this transaction in 2015 the house oversight committee also wrote the obama administration trying to understand what cfius did whether or not they had all the information but chris also keep in mind we aposve spent most of 2017 trying to better understand what russia did to this country in 2016 not to the democrats not to the republicans but to this country so what we know was that russia was not our friend in 2016 it aposs not that big of a leap to ask i wonder if they were all friends in 2010 that aposs not that big of a leap it wasn apost republicans who gave the reset button to russia it wasn apost republicans who said we aposll have more flexibility in the second term it was a republican named mitt romney who said russia was our greatest threat and the democrats laughed at him wallace so gowdy yes i do want to know if the same group that tried to sabotage our democracy in 2016 is buying uranium in 2010 i want to know that wallace ok two quick questions to wrap this up on the one hand given the revelations about the fact that the dnc and the clinton campaign paid for this the russian dossier in effect do we at this moment have harder evidence of collusion between clinton and the russians than we do about trump and the russians gowdy you know chris there are five words that start with c collusion coordination conspiracy contacts and coincidence where this falls out in those five cs i don apost know the word collusion has of criminal connotation to it i think the premise of your question is accurate for a long time we aposve heard about all the ties between the trump campaign and russia for which there is no evidence and lo and behold despite serious democrat opposition we have uncovered that the dnc was working with russian actors to try to disparage donald trump aposs reputation so it aposs certainly interesting whether it aposs collusion coincidence coordination i don apost know yet wallace right very briefly we do know as you point out that the key is the russians did interfere they did hack the dnc files they did hack and put out information about john podesta aposs files don apost we need to get to the bottom of that too gowdy i spent the better part of 2017 doing that including interviewing three witnesses last week and i aposve got a bunch more this week russia is not our friend wikileaks is not our friend julian assange is not our friend they tried to attack the fundamentals of our democracy and that aposs what i spent 2017 focusing on that to me is an american issue i wish the democrats would help a little bit more instead of reading the moscow phonebook during the witness interviews trying to see whether jared kushner knows a guy named igor i wish they aposd help but that aposs been my focus in 2017 is understanding that russia tried to subvert our democracy and it would be great if my democrat friends helped a little bit wallace chairman gowdy thank you thanks for your time and we will follow all the investigations in coming days sir gowdy yes sir thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the newest development in the russia story plus what would you like to ask the panel about the clinton and dnc connections to moscow just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump they made up the whole russia hoax now it aposs turning out that the hoax is turned around and you look at what aposs happened with russia and you look at the uranium deal and you look at the fake dossier so that aposs all turned around end video clip wallace president trump this week saying the real russian scandal involves hillary clinton and the democrats but now there are reports the federal grand jury has approved the first charges in robert mueller aposs investigation and it aposs time now for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and ari fleischer former white house press secretary under george w bush i must say you all have very distinguished and long titles laughter wallace all right michael let me begin with you what do you make of these reports that special counsel mueller has gotten much first charges filed by a grand jury in his investigation and that whoever is being charged may be taken into custody tomorrow michael needham yes i think that what i tried to say all year i think the responsible position all year long has been to allow these investigations to play out to see what the special prosecutor comes up with and not to speculate in advance and so we don apost know what will happen tomorrow if anything will happen tomorrow if these reports are correct that the investigation should allow itself to play out the country has the right to know what russia who aposs an enemy of the united states has done to try to undermine our democracy and as we get to at the second part of this panel we certainly have the right to know what other things have gone on with uranium or the russians or the democrats and so we should all allow the information to come out evaluated once we know what we aposre evaluating and maybe we aposll find our more tomorrow wallace congresswoman just to pick up on michael aposs point we don apost know who is being charged and we don apost know what they aposre being charged for but assuming that the reports are all correct that indictments are issued announced tomorrow won apost that give mueller more running them to continue his investigation jane harman director woodrow wilson center it probably will and i applaud what trey gowdy just said that he supports mueller and that there aposs no reason to believe that mueller is a partisan actor i think that aposs the place this investigation has to go sadly it aposs kind of running out of steam on capitol hill although i think they are entitled to get more information but mueller is a lawyer with impeccable credentials and the country trusts him and he aposs one of the few people the country seems to trust anymore now that congress is at 80 percent mistrust and the trump administration is 70 percent mistrust wallace let me turn to the other side of this there aposs only so much we can talk about something we have no idea what aposs going to happen that aposs never really stopped us laughter wallace i want to return to the revelation this week that it turns out it was the clinton campaign and it was the democratic national committee that paid for the opposition research that led to the russia dossier democrats say that the republicans focus on that and also on the uranium one 2010 deal is an effort to divert attention from the collusion investigation here aposs an example begin video clip rep adam schiff d cali ranking member house intelligence committee apparently there aposs more interest in what happened seven years ago with secretary clinton than there is in the russia investigation and that aposs quite by design end video clip wallace ari what do you think of that comment by adam schiff who aposs a top democrat on house intelligence the clip that i played for trey gowdy from secretary clinton that this is really an attempt by republicans the focus on clinton to change the subject ari fleischer former white house press secretary i think it shows that if there is something wrong with russia it aposs a one way street if it involved the republicans look at it if it involved democrats don apost and that aposs problematic because this is about the united states look i think too many people have gone too far and now they are reaping what they sowed we have created a modern day red scare about all things russia to the point now where a uranium transaction that may or may not have been legitimate is now subject to this immense scrutiny because it involves russia and i find this all problematic russia is a problem russia is an enemy of ours but we can also work with russia on certain things but when you listen to the rhetoric that aposs apos been created everything that touches russia is now a suspect and hillary and her people have now got caught in the web that they created wallace but isn apost there a legitimate concern about the uranium one investigation i we do not have hard evidence and fox news has been reporting on this for a couple of years now but the fact is the people involved in the uranium one deal gave millions of dollars to the clinton foundation bill clinton gets a half million dollars speaking fee right at the time this is all coming down in 2010 isn apost that worth looking at fleischer of course it aposs worth looking at i think it raises more questions about the clinton foundation than it does about the governmental process i don apost know if the uranium one deal was legit or not legit i do know that the issue about the dossier and the fact that it was paid for by the clinton campaign is a serious issue and as vanity fair reported in march of 2017 source a for that dossier was a senior russian foreign ministry figure and source b was a former top level intelligence officer still active in the kremlin so we do know that the clinton administration paid a foreign operative to get information from the kremlin on donald trump that is using the kremlin to get dirt on your opponent that aposs what we suppose objective wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and on this issue on the clintons and how involved they were with russia dave pearson sent this on facebook when is a second special counsel going to be appointed to completely investigate the corruption of the dnc and the clintons with their russian collusion mo how do you answer dave mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service ari and i tend to agree with each more recently when it comes to the state of politics this is one where i think we disagree but i fleischer i knew that was coming elleithee look i think the uranium one story is one that has been litigated over and over over the past few years it has been debunked we know facts that secretary clinton wasn apost directly involved and the fact there was nine different government agencies that had to approve this thing we know for a fact that the major donor they are referring to in here is someone who had disassociated himself from both from the company three years before the deal and before she ever became secretary of state wallace what about the fbi informant who the clinton rather the lynch justice department the obama justice department put a gag order on who now finally is going to be allowed to testify for congress and apparently according to his lawyer has information about bribery and also about clinton involvement in the uranium one deal elleithee the point i aposm making is that over and over this story has been looked at and more information may come out but over and over the story has been looked at crosstalk wallace about trump elleithee there isn apost really any new information that came out this week i do believe there is a coordinated effort to try to muddy the waters around what mueller is doing and try to overly confuse the situation that something democrats have done in the past and that something republicans are doing now crosstalk wallace clinton this is not uranium one but the dossier that the clinton campaign and the dnc paid for the effort that led to the dossier that aposs not new information elleithee it had been widely reported that democrats had paid for it after republicans had paid for it fleischer after the dossier hold on elleithee no no for the research that went into it crosstalk wallace marc elias who was the person at perkins coie had denied it i don apost know what you aposre talking about no he had denied that he had any involvement in the dossier this is the person at perkins and coie who gave all the money to christopher steele that led to the dossier how can you say that we knew that elleithee i know marc no i aposm saying that it had been widely reported that republicans tied to one of donald trump aposs primary campaigns initially funded the contract with fusion gps and that after the primaries that democrats did whether it was the dnc or the clinton campaign or some other democratic donor that information wasn apost there crosstalk wallace wait one at a time go needham in 2012 mitt romney was asked during one of the presidential debates what he thinks of the biggest threat to america is he says russia and barack obama says excuse me the 1980s called and they would like your foreign policy back i was on the show a couple months ago and zeke emanuel the brother of rahm emanuel barack obama aposs chief of staff and a very prominent policy adviser of the democrats says that this investigation is so important it goes to the bedrock of democracy now we find out that the dnc funded a dossier that relied as ari just said on two senior kremlin officials to go inaudible and that dossier may have been used by the fbi or by the federal government to get a fisa warrant crosstalk wallace but we don apost know that needham it may have been as i said cnn reported cnn has not been you know overly kind all the time cnn reports that that may have been used to get a fisa warrant to listen in on the phone calls of a senior member of the trump campaign that is outrageous that goes at the bedrock of our democracy crosstalk wallace mo you aposve got 20 seconds and then got have to break elleithee where i aposm going to agree with you is that i think too many people in my party underestimated politically the threat of russia back in the 2012 election we should have played that we should have bought into that more it was a mistake by democrats ok but today crosstalk wallace 2012 elleithee look what he did what the president and his campaign or not the president i don apost want to overstep but when donald trump jr and his associates met with someone who has clear ties to the kremlin wallace why is that any different than what the clinton campaign did harman it needs to come out crosstalk wallace all right go ahead harman thank you wallace i aposll give you the final word but it aposs got to be the final harman all right the free media the free beacon website was the first to invest in this kind of oppo research on republicans wallace yes but they didn apost go to the russians harman they wallace no they didn apost they were doing research christopher steele had not been hired at that point crosstalk harman but it is first to finance a file on trump crosstalk wallace with all due respect congresswoman they did not go to the russians they were simply involved in domestic research that aposs a different thing than having christopher steele go to the kremlin and talk to top kremlin government officials and get dirt harman well oppo research is dirty surprise surprise should it be relied on no it should be a major part of our campaigns no we should have vision wallace but the difference between oppo research in this country and oppo research for the kremlin needham congresswoman do you ever think it aposs appropriate for a political party to use senior kremlin officials for opposition research harman no i don apost i don apost crosstalk fleischer the dnc paid for it harman well let aposs find out more and but let aposs mueller find out what the truth is wallace and we may please end this crosstalk wallace please we aposve got to inaudible thank you panel we aposll see you a little later if we have any time left but when we come back the rise of republican insurgents open warfare with president trump and what it means for the gop ohio governor john kasich is next commercial break wallace coming up president trump and the republican resistance begin video clip jeff flake r arizona senator mr president i rise today to say enough bob corker r tennessee senator he has not risen to the occasion it aposs very evident to me end video clip wallace ohio governor john kasich joins us to discuss what it means for the state of the gop next commercial break wallace this week open warfare broke out between two republican senators and president trump jeff flake joined bob corker in questioning the president aposs fitness for office and announcing he too won apost seek reelection next year their criticism highlights the growing debate inside the gop about the future of the party joining me now ohio aposs republican governor and a frequent trump critic john kasich governor welcome back to fox news sunday gov john kasich r ohio thank you thanks for having me wallace i want to start with some of jeff flake aposs speech on the floor of the senate this week here it is begin video clip jeff flake r arizona senator we must stop pretending that the degradation of our politics and the conduct of some in our executive branch are normal when such behavior emanates from the top of our government it is something else it is dangerous to a democracy end video clip wallace governor do you agree with the senator that the conduct of the trump presidency is dangerous to our democracy kasich no i i i don apost that aposs i i wouldn apost go that far what i would say is what people are frustrated with in the country is the fact that it isn apost likely anybody can get along with anybody down there i focus on the policy things that i agree with the trump administration on and those that i disagree upon and i aposve never gotten into the you know sort of questioning people aposs motives or their competence i aposm very concerned about about policy and chris really what aposs happening inside the party is there aposs a debate about whether the country should look inward and kind of withdraw and take care of itself or whether the country ought to look outward and and these involve issues of trade and immigration and our relationship with our allies and and the most interesting things that aposs coming chris that you should focus on at some point now that i aposm the producer for your show is that we are seeing the rise of millennials and gen x ers in the 2018 election they are now going to equal the baby boomers and what does that mean they think profoundly differently than what the what this inward looking group of republicans care about because they care about the environment they don apost want to focus on all these social issues they understand america aposs place in the world they aposre comfortable with with global outreach it aposs immigration another one so what aposs going to happen over time is that the gen x ers and the millennials are going to begin to overtake the baby boomers and it will it will it will mean a profound shift in the way both the republican party and the democratic party function and the question is and to some sense they aposre up for grabs because right now they aposre leaning independent and the question is who appeals to them wallace i i kasich i happen to think the outward approach of our country is is the better one wallace well i aposm going to get to specific issues in a moment but i i do want to pursue this question of the philosophy of the republican party because steve bannon and his supporters say well look sure flake and corker made tough speeches but they basically the bottom line is that they announced that they are quitting and that there was silence for most other republicans so can apost one argue that what you call the inward looking the populist nationalist wing of the republican party is taking over kasich no i don apost think so i think the bulk of the republican party and i aposve been in the republican party since i was a college student is one that believes in the fact that america has a place in the world you know reagan talked about it advances in humanity i agree i think the bulk of the republican party does believe that immigration provides energy to our country i think that the bulk of the republican party believes that america is special and has a place in the world at which to advance freedom and free enterprise and all those things i think that this move towards nationalism or looking inward a lot of loud voices but i don apost happen to think it aposs it aposs the bulk and we we will have to see over time but for those that debate that debate to some degree is going to be settled by the demographics in the near future maybe not today not tomorrow but soon it aposs going to be decided by that new wave of new thinking by these young people who can bring a lot of energy to the republican party and the conservative movement wallace well let aposs talk about some specific issues because this is going to be played out at least until the next election in terms of broad philosophy republicans are going to unveil their tax plan this week and according to reports there are going to be big cuts in corporate taxes there aposs going to be a dramatic hit to the debt perhaps as much as 2 trillion increased national debt we aposre going to be taking on is that the right way for the party and the country to go on tax policy kasich well look chris here aposs the thing you need to have faster economic growth our economic growth over the last couple decades has been anemic and that means people can apost get work that means that we don apost have a have growth and opportunity in all the things that people want i favor a tax bill our corporate taxes are too high we can apost compete as effectively in the world and some companies just hightail it out of america because of that so i do think we need a tax bill when it comes to how do you pay for it you know i think in that case i happen to believe that entitlements have to be reviewed and it may be separate from the tax bill but it needs to happen because debt is going to swallow us up if we aposre not careful in our state i aposve been able to cut taxes but i aposve i aposve been able to stay because we have a balanced budget requirement to be able to pay for them in order instead of spending more in government we gave money back to people as a result in ohio now we aposre up 490 000 private sector jobs since i aposve come in that aposs up from a loss of 350 so lower taxes does matter but regulation matters i think that aposs why the market aposs doing better right now is because the trump administration has been has been moving away from stringent regulations and more common sense regulations and that aposs helped our economy to grow wallace on immigration the president says he aposs willing to make a deal to protect the so called dreamers people brought into this country as as children but in return he wants funding for his wall and he wants tougher more stringent limits on legal immigration your reaction kasich yes i i don apost agree on really ratcheting down the number of legal immigrants that can come into this country immigration has always been sort of high octane power for our country it brings people in with a lot of energy and a lot of new ideas of course we have to have a secure border everybody believes that but to begin ratcheting down the number of people who can legally come here i i don apost support that and in terms of daca these kids who came here one kid told me the other day he came when he was seven months old i think he aposs not 27 he aposs worried about what aposs going to happen to him that aposs nonsense just let the pressure off those young people they aposre contributing to our country and the daca thing should it should not be they should it should not be part of a negotiation let them stay in america you don apost have to give them citizenship but let them stay in this country if they aposve been law abiding they aposre conserving wallace we began with senator flake aposs speech on the senate and i aposd like to end with it here aposs another clip begin video clip jeff flake r arizona senator when the next generation asks us why didn apost you do something why didn apost you speak up what are we going to say end video clip wallace so governor when the next generation asks kasich i aposve spoken out i aposve spoken out more than anybody i mean but mine is not personal mine is policy and i look at what we aposve done in ohio chris and here aposs what we aposve done here we aposre not a party that cuts anybody out in ohio my administration has included everybody if the top does well the people at the bottom ought to have hope and as a result of that i still have high job approval my last reelection was overwhelming and i aposm a believer that everybody should be given an opportunity not just those at the top but also those who are struggling to get ahead wallace but but governor if you feel kasich and i believe that aposs the best approach for america wallace governor if you feel so strongly about the direction of the party and you don apost like the way some people on in the trump wing want to take the the country i have to ask you i aposve asked you before why not consider at least running for president in 2020 for the republican nomination against president trump kasich well because chris this is like 2017 i aposm trying to be the best governor i can be and i don apost i aposm not thinking about what aposs going to happen what aposs going to happen with me politically i have no idea there aposs such upheaval in the country right now no one knows what aposs going to happen next week so look all i want to do is contribute to bringing a calm voice that involves inclusion and everybody growing where that aposs going to take me i really don apost know but i can tell you at this point i aposm not plotting or planning anything like that chris that aposs just not where my head is right now i am going to be a voice for the new generation the next generation and for what has traditionally been strong in the party and i aposm going to do my best to promote that and you know what i think it aposs going pretty well wallace governor kasich thank you thanks for coming in today always good to talk with you sir kasich thank you sir god bless wallace up next we aposll bring back the panel to discuss the big reveal we find out this week what aposs in the republican tax plan plus president trump aposs new war on drugs we aposll look at his plans to fight the growing opioid epidemic commercial break begin video clip paul ryan r wis speaker of the house we aposre trying to achieve giving people a break on their taxes making it easier for people to plan and save for the future nancy pelosi d cali house minority leader you know rip off a shakedown a looting of the middle class end video clip wallace house speaker paul ryan and democratic leader nancy pelosi already fighting about who will benefit from the gop tax plan before we even find out what aposs in it and we aposre back now with the panel well michael republicans on the house ways and means committee will unveil their plan on wednesday they aposve been very secretive about it but we have heard some elements of it and we aposve also heard this extraordinary timetable they aposre laying out they want to pass it through the house and through the senate maybe different versions by thanksgiving what do you make of all that michael needham ceo heritage action for america well i think as quick as possible is good i mean look i don apost think this has been a secret process we had kind of an outline come out we aposve had much more detail go on we all know the basic broad strokes of it i think chairman brady the chairman of the ways and means committee has done an incredible job putting this together wallace you like what you hear about the plan needham i do i think it aposs a good plan that aposs put forward that unleashes the types of growth here aposs what aposs going to now happen every single corrupt force of the status quo in washington d c the national realtor association the home builders the representatives of high tax state are going to all come in and try to pick apart this plan and protect their little carve out and so i think momentum and speed is something that unfortunately you need at this stage to get this plan which has been talked about in the types of broad strokes that the vast majority of americans need to know and what to know before all of the the national realtors association is just making totally kind of the arguments about themselves and what aposs good for themselves this is a tax cut that will be good for people who don apost itemize for people who do itemize this is a great plan for the country and we need to get it done before the forces of the status quo and the special interests tear it apart wallace mo from what we know is it a great plan and the economy we just found out grew by 3 percent for the second quarter in a row won apost if they get the tax plan and its continued growth won apost republicans in 2018 be able to go to the to the country with a strong economy mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service they aposre banking on it they aposre banking on being able to go with this because so far they don apost have a very good track record of getting anything done and so they know that if they don apost get this done they aposre in very serious trouble with voters now whether or not it aposs a good plan we aposre going to have to see how it plays out so far the things i hear it doesn apost sound very good and you know mike i aposll just to toss back out the hypocrisy charge you through earlier the fact that republicans are now ok with a blueprint that is going to blow a 2 4 trillion hole in the deficit when people who were absolutely needham i did not say that aposs not i mean if you aposre going to accuse me of hypocrisy we have a spending problem in this country the tax code should bring in the amount of revenue necessary to fund the constitutionally appropriate parts of government wallace but but in fairness the republican republicans haven apost called for those 2 trillion in spending cuts needham oh sure but i republicans are completely gutless when it comes to spending cuts nobody would deny that but that aposs not hypocrisy on the part of anybody on this panel we should have a tax code that makes sense and that still makes sense ph elleithee i aposm just saying the republican party which has been fighting to to rein in the deficit seems to be ok now right i aposm not saying anyone on this panel needham the party should be fighting to rein in spending cross talk wallace i hate to interrupt but i do want to talk about one other subject because it aposs too important not to and that is another big development this week and that was that the president declared a public health emergency on in terms of the opioid crisis but he didn apost declare a national emergency which would have allowed access to more funds and that resulted in two very different responses begin video clip trump it is time to liberate our communities from the scourge of drug addiction never been this way we can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic pelosi what i would say to the president on that is show me the money end video clip wallace ari why didn apost you don apost know but i mean your speculation why didn apost the president as part of this announcement say and i aposm going to ask congress for x amount of money and in failing to do so did he step on his own announcement ari fleischer former white house press secretary yes i was surprised he didn apost take that step it seems to be a perfectly natural and appropriate step of the president when he says this is a national this is a health emergency so we need more money to fight it in addition to flexibility i was surprised because republicans on capitol hill and democrats as well will support more funding to fight opioids so it should have been included as a statement now it still is up to congress he couldn apost have delivered it unilaterally but i was surprised rhetorically communications wise he didn apost call for it wallace congresswoman harman your thoughts about what the president did and didn apost say in his announcement on the opioids jane harman former u s congresswoman d ca he did the right thing he should have funded it but there have been a lot of missed opportunities here and when we talk about tax reform penny kasich which i was part of in 1993 would have been a great way to cut the deficit which is crucial and then bowles simpson which was originated in the obama administration should have been seized by president obama and speaker ryan and would have put on the table the framework that would make the most sense which is reforming entitlements reforming taxes and cutting spending and if we can apost get there and we aposre just going to do this one sided tax bill i don apost think that that aposs going to stimulate the economic growth our country needs fleischer well since we aposre back to taxes the key thing on taxes is to make the economy boom again harman right fleischer if that can happen that aposs the best way to get wage pressure harman that aposs what i just said fleischer pressure go up for low income people so they become middle income people middle income people become upper middle income people that aposs why this tax bill is the heart and soul of republicanism if they cannot deliver it if they cannot find unity as a caucus because of the individual provisions pull them apart what aposs the purpose of having republicans in washington and this is what it comes down to wallace and conversely if they do pass it fleischer if they do the sky is the limit this is what republicans need because if the economy grows and wages go up for the middle class republicans are in great shape they delivered everything they promised and inaudible people that they need and that aposs what americans are looking for stop the arguments of the inaudible harman inaudible the country wallace all right you know you know what we will talk about this in the commercial thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power players of the week how a powerful new hollywood film shows the real struggles of soldiers returning home from iraq and afghanistan commercial break wallace it was a classic coming home movie after the second world war called the best years of our lives that won the oscar for best picture we haven apost had that kind of films that tells the story of soldiers coming home from iraq and afghanistan and the challenges they face at least we haven apost until now here are our power players of the week begin videotape miles teller actor you get scrutinized if you mess up a military film and those guys tear you up wallace voice over miles teller is the star of the new movie thank you for your service the riveting story of a group of soldiers who come home from iraq jason hall who wrote american sniper wrote and directed this film jason hall thank you for your service they step off the battlefield they step off the plane they come home and the memories and the trauma of war continue to reverberate through them and into their lives here wallace their stories start small hall one day you aposre on the battlefield and the next day like in the movie you aposre cooking pancakes for your daughter unidentified female how long you been up teller it aposs already 4 00 p m in baghdad got one chocolate chip smiley face pancake for you unidentified female she doesn apost like chocolate teller ok i guess i missed that hall they get flung right back into this life of being a father and then being provider unidentified male and what about you teller don apost worry about me hall and suddenly things are a little bit alien and a little bit off and sometimes it can throw them throw them sideways wallace estimates are one in five of the soldiers deployed to iraq and afghanistan suffers from some form of post traumatic stress the movie shows how many of them go to the va looking for help unidentified male and we aposre backed up it could be six to nine months teller aare you kidding you think these guys can wait that long hall i think there aposs a really good people operate in a very big kind of broken bureaucracy they aposre your podiatrists they aposre your trauma experts and your brain surgeon and so they aposre they aposre trying to do everything for all people and and that aposs challenging wallace the movie is based on the story of sergeant adam schumann who served in iraq unidentified male i rode shotgun in a lead humvee and i looked for bombs stop the truck you don apost see the bomb unless they want you to wallace on camera this country is good at fighting wars how are we at bringing the soldiers back home teller they aposve always noticed the price of war and the sacrifices these guys make and we know that biologically their brains everything is different they aposre a different person when they come back wallace the name of your movie is thank you for your service which we all say when we see a soldier and it makes us feel better hall sure wallace the sense i get is you think that aposs kind of empty hall i say thank you for your service and it makes me feel better but what i aposm not doing is i aposm not i aposm not offering to have that soldier you know tell me about his service and unload some of that on me wallace voice over and that aposs the message of this movie to connect the frontline to the home front and start a conversation unidentified female you never told me you were a hero don apost spare me the details i can take anything inaudible wallace on camera so how do these guys heal how does this happen hall what i hope this movie does is i hope people see it and they understand a little bit more about what the veterans have been through so they can offer them an open door teller there aposs nothing easy about it but these guys are soldiers and they keep fighting to you know to get better to you know be a good father be a good husband hall i hope that it brings that that closes a space between the civilians and the military and and what our understanding of what they aposve done and and that service that they aposve given end videotape wallace thank you for your service opened in theaters nationwide this weekend it is a tough powerful movie now this program
