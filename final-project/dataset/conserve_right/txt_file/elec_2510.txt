doing their best to out socialist each other rep tulsi gabbard has been trying to keep the country out of war when asked whether she would rejoin the 2015 iran nuclear deal first negotiated by the obama administration and withdrawn from by president donald trump gabbard gave an unequivocal yes while warning about the dire consequences of war war with iran would be worse than war with iraq said gabbard an iraq war veteran donald trump and his chickenhawk cabinet mike pompeo john bolton and others are creating a situation where a spark would light a war with iran trump needs to get back into the iran deal swallow his pride and put america first gabbard s position contrasts with the positions of other democratic candidates on stage sen cory booker d n j was the lone debate participant to say that he would not automatically re enter the iran deal worked out by president obama suggesting a better deal could be had sen amy klobuchar d minn said that while she favored reentering the deal she would like to push for stricter terms klobuchar also stressed that if a war with iran were to occur it would require congressional authorization gabbard has kept the focus on the u s s aggressive foreign policy the entire night when asked about what she would do about the gender pay gap the hawaii representative declined to answer the moderators lady question instead choosing to denounce our current interventionist foreign policy later in the debate when rep tim ryan d ohio referenced the recent deaths of two u s soldiers in afghanistan as a reason to continue our war in the country gabbard was having none of it will you tell the parents of those two soldiers that were killed in afghanistan that we have to be engaged that is unacceptable we have lost so many lives we have spent so much money said gabbard drawing critical attention to america s interminable overseas wars has been the explicit purpose of gabbard s longshot campaign from the beginning there is one main issue that is central to the rest and that is the issue of war and peace said gabbard when announcing her intention to run to cnn s van jones this single minded focus is unlikely to win her many votes given the predominance of domestic policy in tonight s debate and the democratic primary as a whole that gabbard was willing to duck a softball red meat question about raising wages for women to focus on america s war making abroad was nonetheless a refreshing moment amidst the otherwise dreary shockingly left wing rhetoric from the rest of the democratic field on stage tonight advertisement next democratic debate opens by declaring big tech and corporations as the enemy christian britschgi is an associate editor at reason show comments 173 editor s note we invite comments and request that

foundation we reserve the right to delete any comment for any reason at any time report abuses that gabbard was willing to duck a softball red meat question about raising wages for women to focus on america s war making abroad was nonetheless a refreshing moment that proves she doesn t have what it takes to be president move on to warren moderators and candidate obama also opposed foreign wars yeah i m not impressed by promises of non interventionism i doubt she means she wouldn t lift a finger to defend the u s or our allies including those we re obligated to defend by constitutionally ratified treaties but even so i m not convinced that telling iran or russia that we won t intervene when they re aggressive towards their neighbors is practical smart or will necessarily lead to less intervention by the u s in the long run in the case of iran forcing them to return to compliance with the npt is probably the best way to achieve peaceful coexistence and avoid war if they had nukes they d have a free hand to use their already existing proxy armies to move on whatever they wanted including mecca that s not a recipe for non intervention and peace likewise i m not sure estonia poland and the ukraine equate american non interventionism with peace anyway not when putin is itching for a reason to extend his rule chamberlain s non interventionism did not bring peace in his time quite the opposite i ve never heard of a bully who backed down once he realized his intended victims wouldn t fight back meanwhile trump doesn t have a bad record on non intervention he managed to defeat isis without invading syria he restrained himself on iran despite provocation and yesterday i read this u s president donald trump has recently spoken privately about withdrawing from the defense treaty with japan as he is of the view that the postwar pact treated the united states unfairly bloomberg reported late on monday https www cnbc com 2019 06 25 trump says he wants to end postwar japan defense treaty report html yeah why should the u s be on the hook to guarantee japan s safety against china when japan won t bother to take the steps necessary to defend themselves it s basically the same questions trump is asking about why we re on the hook to defend places like france germany and italy from russia when they aren t doing the minimum to defend themselves either isn t the democratic field grumbling about that last part too how do they complain about trump being an interventionist out of one side of their mouths and meanwhile complain about trump threatening to dial back our commitment to defend everyone from the europeans to the japanese out of the other side of their mouths i don t see a sharp contrast between trump and non interventionists i think you need tds to see it clearly how do they complain about trump being an interventionist out of one side of their mouths and meanwhile complain about trump threatening to dial back our commitment to defend everyone from the europeans to the japanese out of the other side of their mouths logical consistency is a social construct of the white supremacist cisheteropatriarchy used to oppress marginalized peoples japan can t take the necessary steps to defend itself their own constitution forced upon them by us after wwii renounces the right to wage war as written the jsdf is unconstitutional it still exists out of necessity but offensive war or amassing a large defensive force in anticipation of war is off the table right now in order for the us to leave japan needs the popular support to amend the constitution and modify or remove article 9 i think it s noble to as a nation sincerely believe and codify in law that you won t wage offensive wars but the jsdf needs to be let loose and start meeting the needs of the nation to deal with inevitable chinese incursions until japan moves in that direction it s in our best interest to maintain the status quo abe and trump like each other and are working on this issue because amending article 9 has never been remotely possible but now there s enough of a chance that they can openly discuss it it s in our best interest to maintain the status quo what do i get out of it yes the japanese constitution must be changed and the japanese should take the lead in defending themselves the chinese communist party will sure love this as us leaves the east pacific it should tell the ccp hey you guys got your wish we re leaving they ll beg us to come back and restore the old order pacifism is retarded when somebody is a little too kill y the answer isn t to go full on pussy it s just to tone it down a bit japan should have one of the most badass militaries on earth they need it and everybody else may need it someday too pacifism is for moral preeners who condemn those on whom they rely for safety and candidate obama also opposed foreign wars unfortunately neither congress critter of potus obo did unless tony or turd is posting in which case obo ended all wars never started one made the us immensely wealthy grew hair on bald men and cured cancer and when gone speak of him as if he s a regular cincinnatus despite not going away and making sure he sticks his two cents mostly to undermine orange man bad anti whiteism open borders for white populations only noone is illegal where white people live only diversity is a strength for non whites moving into white places only slavery colonialism etc were common to all peoples acting and receiving see turkey north africa mongolia japan among others and the enslavement of whites like the slavs and the irish by the islamic world in particular as always anti racist just means anti white and candidate trump as well and candidate trump as well and potus trump has not started any new ones but to those with tds that s not an issue right ce fuck off tiresome trump has been the least interventionist since ghwb it was the only thing in which i could agree with obama yet we started one in libya expanded the one in afghanistan and spent more on foreign wars in his 2 terms than we did during the bush years who am i chopped liver sincerely american backed yemeni genocide and serving as al queda s airforce in syria obama disappointed on foreign policy but was still undoubtedly miles better than mccain would have been given that mccain was literally writing op ed pieces calling for the u s to attack north korea regardless of whether south korea supported the action https www weeklystandard com john mccain rogue state rollback bomb bomb bomb bomb bomb iran yeah but obama never served on the front line and watched soldiers come in mutilated those sorts of images tend to weigh on a soul maybe that s the defining issue of her campaign for you where does she stand on the green new deal she is the sponsor of hr 3671 which would do the following by 2027 1 80 of electricity sold must be generated from clean energy resources 2 80 of new vehicle sales from manufacturers must be sales of zero emission vehicles and 3 80 of train rail lines and train engines must be electrified by 2035 1 100 of electricity must be generated from clean energy resources 2 100 of vehicle sales from manufacturers must be zero emission vehicles and 3 100 of train rail lines and train engines must be electrified it prohibits exports of domestically produced crude oil and natural gas including liquefied natural gas https www congress gov bill 115th congress house bill 3671 our next president needs to be someone who will veto the green new deal if and when the democrats get control of both the house and the senate so fuck tulsi gabbard and the horse she rode in on if she s the best the democrats have to offer then fuck all the other democrats too each and every one of them 80 so her green plan would only cost 4 trillion then it prohibits exports of domestically produced crude oil and natural gas including liquefied natural gas that s a reasonable position many countries and alaska recognize that all citizens have some right to the natural resources of the country and should be compensated when that right is given to a corporation to sell lockeanproviso exporting isn t the same as selling the mineral rights to a foreign power it s digging it up and selling it to them what s her opinion in the 2nd anendment amendment really need an edit feature or at least a return to the preview especially for those of us using tiny phones with big fingers yes we do need an edit feature ms gabbard is in favor of an assault weapons ban without going to her official campaign propaganda dissemination webpage i can not reliably inform you of any other positions she may have vis a vis firearm confiscation pistol carry permits weapons registration our unconstitutional restraining order paradigm dragon dildos or any other issue surrounding the right of every human to own and carry weapons i took a look for you basically in favor of any gun control measure you could think of that is mighty huwite of you sir it figures that she would be a gun grabber of course we shouldn t really expect much else when will you crazy kids learn that phones are for making phone calls they re not really phones any more they are handheld computers that can also make phone calls now they re primarily internet and texting devices they re handheld supercomputers with access to all the world s accumulated knowledge we use them for sending each other smiley faces and dirty pics 1 they re handheld supercomputers with access to all the world s accumulated knowledge something i remind people when they complain about the cost of their phone with access to all the world s accumulated knowledge not even close they have access to a carefully curated outline of the world s knowledge 80 of guns should be banned only by 2027 she would grab the rest by 2035 so we ve had two presidents now who think iraq and afghanistan were mistakes and yet we re still there good for you tulsi but you re out of your league against the mi complex entropic principle june 26 2019 at 10 59 pm so we ve had two presidents now who think iraq and afghanistan were mistakes and yet we re still there good for you tulsi but you re out of your league against the mi complex your tin foil hat is too small yep if gabbard is elected then soon after her inauguration there will be a meeting in the oval office at which the smoking man will explain to her about who controls the us military i joke that when a newly elected president sits in the oval office for the first time there is a note on the desk that says we killed kennedy we can kill you orders to follow her performance earned her the early lead in the drudge poll but some of that just might be 4chan if not it appears that ending the many wars in south west asia just might matter more to real americans than all of the remainder of the democratic platform trouble is she will take all those soldiers and assets to go to war with russia doubtful the two largest nuclear arsenals are simply not likely to ever actually be used against each other you peaceniks would know this if you actually studied the issue or read books authored by the people who are actually responsible for using these things anti war hippies talking about strategy always seems to me rather like monks talking about vagina or anti gunners blathering on endlessly and fruitlessly about assault weapons like monks talking about vagina actually one of the few things the catholic church gets right is that gay men make the best marriage counselors pakistan try to keep up not mexico she s no hillary she was the only sane one at the debate probably because she was given the fewest opportunities to speak seems she s just as batshit insane as the rest of them she just downplays that crazy by focusing only on her pacifist crazy but she s a gun grabbing open borders socialist greenie at home to go with her pacifism abroad here s tulsi on the issues it s one infantile horror show after the next her dad is also a cult leader so crazy is expected bill deblasio is 4th in that poll they re trolling i think the wars should be a top issue but they re going all in on free college reparations and medicare for all good luck with that plenty of commie dems liked bill b saying he would take over the corporations like a true fascist deblasio should have been out down for his communism a very long time ago headline 6th story link related stories 2020 kickoff developing elizabeth warren gets center my respect for gabbard went up several notches when she earnestly and forcefully stated her position that government has no business telling you who you can love or who you can marry all four of my eight year old girlfriends and my mom are going to be so happy or are we going to maintain those silly rules about pedophilia polygamy and incest is this one of those principles like the principle of my body my choice that only applies to abortion and not prostitution or drug use or working for less than minimum wage great another palin sock yeah worrying about who is in bed with who is a great concern to fucking ignoramuses consenting adults keep up please you get 2 out of 3 though shut up and take your vaccine you science hater when the democrats give eight year olds the vote they ll be able to make up their own minds about that headline 6th story link related stories 2020 kickoff developing elizabeth warren gets center no need to subsidize iran obama s deal was a sham we can remain civil without bilking americans tulsi is the best option the dems have but she s still wrong on too many issues i d be inclined to vote for her instead of trump but the greater dem agenda will drive me to supporting ballot access for the lp

straight up if pretty bernie broette my friend who shall remain unnamed states of ms gabbard that he would tax that like a thirteenth century nobleman it appears that my roomate is a burgeoning democrat hopefully he doesn t start smelling little girl s hair not unusual the dems have only a couple anti war candidates nearly every major war in the 20th century we were involved in had a democrat in the white house hot take stupid comment to be expected historically accurate sounds like lame ahistorical pathetic pro republican horseshit do you know how cheap pro republican horseshit is on the internet how about talking about what they re doing now or at least what they ve been doing for the past 40 years no tony it s right on the problem is you pukes don t ever take responsibility for your poor decisions and really at this point most of you should be executed en masse and i amsot hope that we get a democrat president then the people might get uncomfortable doug

federal spending is from mandatory entitlement programs started under democrats not sure what lies you ve been told like most people ce only looks at the discretionary spending because the mandatory spending is terrifying i m just saying there are usually only one or two anti war candidates for the dems every cycle hell the republicans usually have less than that unless rand paul or trump are running yes the last 70 years would have been a lot different if henry wallace continued to be vice president in 1944 and lbj didn t have jfk whacked but it is what it is policy big business becomes

tulsi gabbard s shining anti interventionist moment and since matt welch and nick gillespie weren t on the podcast we join tonight s for those who would like to hear more about ms gabbard she has done two podcasts in the last year with joe rogan each of which went well over an hour is she wrong when she advocates non intervention keep in mind she has worn the uniform has smelled the proverbial smoke and has probably buried a few friends if any of us had had the same experience would we not be inclined to feel the same way she clearly does personally i think her domestic platform is not good it is a recipe for a train wreck long term and will absolutely destroy our individual liberties socialized medicine restriction of gun rights relaxed borders with minimal restriction no thanks ms gabbard but her advocacy of non intervention is a breath of fresh air at least to me i m about as non interventionist as they come so that bit is cool but i d rather have a war monger within say the bounds of the level of stupid we ve done the last several decades and skip all the communist insanity if those are my two choices frankly trump so far really has been the most restrained president we ve had in a long time on this front and he s a hell of a lot better than any of these dicks on basically every other issue i like her however the iran deal is not a deal at all with the rhetoric they push no nuclear program of any sort is allowed tulsi gabbard representative tried to keep the country out of the war this is towards the interests of the community she put the interests of the
