talk with senator roy blunt member of the senate intelligence committee but we begin with fox team coverage catherine herridge on what the intelligence community is saying but first senior foreign affairs correspondent greg palkot live from our london bureau greg greg palkot fox news senior foreign affairs correspondent chris for the third time in three months terror hits the u k and once again it is ugly it was on a busy saturday night in london as the attackers spread across london bridge in a rented van driving up on the walkway smashing into pedestrians they then ditched that vehicle a few blocks away and armed with long knives stabbed their way through bars and restaurants nearby with some putting up a fight all told at least seven people were killed 48 injured many critically including an off duty police officer along with british citizens from france australia and elsewhere were targeted no word yet on whether any americans were involved now police caught up with the attackers just eight minutes later shooting that all three at least one had a beard camouflage pants and a fake suicide vest when one attack he reportedly screamed out praise to allah the arabic word for god here is what u k prime minister theresa may had to say today begin video clip theresa may british prime minister as a country our response must be what it has always been when we have been confronted by violence we must come together we must pull together and united we will take on and defeat our enemies end video clip palkot police now say they have arrested 12 people following raids in eastern london said to be the home of one of the attackers it is a sign that authorities might be on the trail of the terrorist police also doing a thorough forensic search of the entire terrorist site but what is next prime minister theresa may also said today terror breeds terror chris wallace greg palkot reporting from london greg thanks for that now let aposs bring in chief intelligence correspondent catherine herridge with the latest on who was behind the attack catherine catherine herridge fox news chief intelligence correspondent chris no group is claiming responsibility this morning but within minutes of the attack a senior isis affiliated social media account pushed out slick propaganda on using vehicles as weapons threatening more violence it aposs not clear whether the isis posts were opportunistic or the terror group played a role this morning u s and u k intelligence are focused on the suspects and whether they acted alone or had a terror network behind them british security sources reporting that very early indications suggest the attack may have been pulled together at short notice with the rising homegrown threat british police are trained to quickly neutralize suspects as they did last night begin video clip cressida dick london metropolitan police commissioner that vehicle continued to drive from london bridge to the borough market the suspects then left the vehicle and a number of people were stabbed the suspects were shot dead by armed officers end video clip herridge homeland security is saying that at this time they have no information to indicate if specific credible threat to the united states secretary kelly told fox last night he worries we are quote right around the corner from having a similar attack but for the efforts of dhs and law enforcement agencies president trump was briefed last night and spoke with the british prime minister expressing his condolences and praising the heroic response of london police and first responders the president also seeming to make a political point that the attack bolstered his travel ban we need to be smart vigilant and tough he tweeted we need the courts to give us back our rights we need the travel ban extra level of security safety questions are being raised this morning about a possible intelligence failure after the british government recently lower the threat level chris wallace catherine thank you herridge you re welcome wallace joining me now roy blunt a member of the senate intelligence committee senator welcome back sen roy blunt r missouri good to be with you wallace what can you add to what we just heard from catherine herridge blunt well you know i think what we are seeing is such a broad band of potential attacks we hear from our own intelligence community and have for years more threats for more directions than ever before you see the terrible manchester bombing those young people mostly young women young girls with a fairly sophisticated bomb based on published reports on that these guys have a van and kitchen knives we think other groups are looking at more advanced kinds of attacks so clearly this is from all directions is tends to take credit for the things that you can steal a truck get your van drive in a car terrorized people with very little planning or backup other groups we believe are looking at other things and we are constantly have to be vigilant i think secretary kelly is right when he says that only because we have been fortunate and worked hard to prevent this have we not had these kinds of attacks here wallace i want to play a clip from british prime minister may today here it is bgegin video clip may while the recent attacks are not connected by common networks they are connected in one important sense they are bound together by the single evil ideology of islamist extremism end video clip wallace any explanation as to why we have seen three fatal terror attacks in britain in less than three months blunt i don apost know if there aposs any real explanation for that but in paris and london and western europe generally it got people who came there to do jobs that were allowed to stay in enclaves never became part of the society you see the second generation of those families often turning to what the prime minister mentioned you know we need to say we need to talk about it our friends who are muslim need to admit that this extreme sense of islam that results in these attacks has to be called for what it is and we have to try to do what we can to intervene wallace do we have i ve heard the argument that because we are beginning to roll back isis in the so called caliphate in iraq and syria that there is an increased emphasis on these attacks these kind of low technology attacks in the west do you think our success in one place is creating more of a threat blunt i think you can you know somebody made the observation that long ago that sometimes countries implode syria seems to have exploded that as things change in syria people have access to europe in ways that you would otherwise want to try and do something about there aposs no way to do background checks on people that come in from communities that no longer exist jobs that were jobs months or years ago and so i think we do see that and you know like so many of the things that happened in northern africa what people initially thought would be the result would turn out to be just the opposite wallace as a member of the senate intelligence committee any indication of an increased terror threat here in the u s blunt i think the terror threat is real you know one of the things when we aposve seen things like san bernardino more often than not u s officials the fbi and others talk to these people after months of surveillance decided they no longer needed to be under the level of watch they were and then suddenly these kinds of things happen i do think again that you aposve got some groups that are looking at a big play like taking down an airliner you aposve got others who need very little support very little planning and can do incredible damage which is actually in many ways almost more of terrorism because you go anywhere do anything you wonder what could happen at any moment it could happen here crosstalk wallace in london bridge on a saturday night blunt london bridge the westminster bridge the concert wallace the concert yes blunt all of these things are true terror targets they re not it aposs not like going after the u s embassy wallace right blunt they are true terror targets wallace as catherine mentioned just after the news broke about this terror attack president trump tweeted another call for his travel ban that case is now before the u s supreme court do you think the justices should pay attention to the kind of thing that is happening in england and other parts of the world as they make that decision i mean the fact is in britain most of these terrorists have been homegrown they aposve been u k citizens blunt they have been and you know looking at where people like that who come to our country have been is important i m not nearly as concerned as a lot of people are about the visa waiver program because the visa waiver program just triggers that you can spend more time on people who you have reason to believe may have been in libya may have been in syria may have become radicalized i don t know what the court will decide i m not a lawyer i think my view is the president does have certainly the right to put in place extreme vetting and christ it s been four it aposs been four months since i said they needed four months to put that in place i think you can do that without a travel ban and hopefully we are wallace i want to talk to you about another hat as a member of the senate intelligence committee a lot of anticipation about the testimony this week from fbi former fbi director james comey what you expect to hear from him what questions do you have for him blunt well i think it aposs important that we talk to everybody who should be talk to about this i do believe that the senate intelligence committee is the most likely place to bring this investigation to conclusion with whatever the conclusion turns out to be you know we used to dealing with each other on issues like this so we are used to classify documents we re used to coming together to protect the country hopefully that aposs what we will be able to do crosstalk wallace what are you looking to ask ph from comey blunt we what comey says and how he says that i think will be important i haven apost frankly understood much of what comey has done since about a year ago and his decisions have been i think highly questionable we ll see what why he was prepared for that meeting the way he was said he had a round of murder board kind of questions before he went to see the president why he thought it was important to immediately download that and what other meetings he had that frankly he didn apost think were so important to download what happen wallace finally do you think that president trump has a legitimate claim to executive privilege to block comey from testifying and as a practical matter do you think he should invoke it blunt i think the president is better served by getting all this information out sooner rather than later let aposs find out what happened and bring this to a conclusion you don apost do that i think by invoking executive privilege on a conversation you had apparently with nobody else in the room you know most stories have two sides to them at some point we ll hear the president s side but i frankly think we need to hear mr comey aposs side and find out what other questions we need to ask after he answers the questions this week wallace senator blunt thank you thanks for your time this sunday and thank you for coming in on short notice blunt glad to be here wallace up next president trump aposs dramatic decision this week to pull out of the paris climate accord we ll talk with epa administrator scott pruitt a key player in the president aposs deliberations commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at pittsburgh the president said he aposs looking out for residents of the former steel town in pulling out of the paris climate deal international leaders business executives and people around the world are still reacting to president trump aposs decision this week in a few minutes we ll talk with former vice president al gore a leading advocate on climate change joining me now is scott pruitt mr trump aposs administrator for the environmental protection agency and a key player in the president aposs decision mr pruitt welcome back to fox news sunday scott pruitt epa administrator good morning chris wallace i want to start with a question that you were asked repeatedly on friday here it is begin video clip mary bruce abc news yes or no does the president believe that the climate change is real and a threat to the united states philip rucker washington post does the president believe today that climate change is a hoax pruitt what aposs interesting about all the discussions we had through the last several weeks have been focused on one singular issue is paris good or not for this country end video clip wallace let me get this straight you and the president spent weeks discussing whether he should pull out of the paris climate deal and you never discussed climate change pruitt it was about the merits and demerits of the deal chris crosstalk pruitt that s what the focus look when you look at what this country has achieved since the late 1990s 2000 time frame we aposve seen an 18 percent reduction in co2 footprint from 2000 to 2014 we re at pre 1994 levels you know what aposs interesting about all this criticism from the left environment left is if you go back to the time when the paris deal was cut those same groups in fact james hansen former national scientist called it a fake and a fraud the general counsel of the sierra club was critical of what was achieved in paris because it didn apost hold china it did not hold india accountable and the united states agreed to 26 percent to 28 percent reductions in chd ph crosstalk wallace we re going to get into all of that but what i m asking you is as the president s epa administrator as his point person on the environment isn t that a conversation that over the last few months that you have to have whether or not climate change is real or a hoax as the president suggested and whether or not human activity contributes to it are you saying you aposve never had that conversation with him pruitt the focus of the last several weeks was centered wallace i m asking you over the last few months pruitt was centered on the merits and demerits of the paris agreement the president said said actually back during the campaign that climate change occurs i ve said i ve said during my confirmation process that climate change is occurring that human activity contributes to it wallace he also said it was a hoax pruitt well chris the point here and to your question this is something over the last several weeks the president has received much information about the impact on jobs and also the impact on the environment you know we have nothing to be apologetic about as a country with respect to what we aposve done in reducing our co2 footprint it s also wallace i don t want to be a crosstalk wallace but you re not going to tell me whether or not the president believes climate change is a hoax and whether or not human activity it aposs a simple question pruitt the president has indicated that the climate changes it aposs always changing i ve indicated the same wallace well that s the same crosstalk pruitt what aposs important chris here what s important is what the president did on thursday is put america first and say to the united states and say to the world that we re going to remain engaged but we re also going to make sure that as we remain engage we put america s interest first wallace as you pointed out the president justified pulling out of the paris deal largely on economic terms here he is begin video clip trump the american family will suffer the consequences in the form of lost jobs and a very diminished quality of life end video clip wallace but the study that the president cited was funded by two groups that are dramatically opposed to environmental regulation and the study itself acknowledges it does this is a quote from the study it does not take into account the potential benefits from avoided emissions the study results are not a benefit cost analysis of climate change pruitt well there were several wallace administrator it is a worst case scenario pruitt there were several studies that were actually published in response to paris nera the heritage study the global policy publication wallace you specifically quoted nera pruitt there were several and that were sourced aspects as part of the speech and what we know from the paris agreement objectively is that it was a 2 5 trillion contraction to our economy over ten years what we do know is it impacted up to 400 000 jobs in this country what we do know is it impacted both the manufacturing base and energy sector jobs you know since last the fourth quarter of 2016 chris we aposve had almost 50 000 jobs created in the mining and coal sector alone in fact in the month of may almost 7 000 jobs so these individuals that are i think what s also being missed here is that when you look at how we generate electricity in this country the power grid we need to feel diversity we need coal natural gas hydro renewables nuclear as part of that mix because it provides stability and strength to our grid and lower cost our price per kilowatt compared to germany our price per kilowatt compared to europe is far better and it helps us grow jobs in this country wallace mr pruitt aren t you focusing on the wrong thing i want to put up some i m going to say surprising statistics take a look at this the u s now employs more than double the number of people in the solar industry than it does in coal aren t you and the president talking about protecting the horse and buggy business just as cars come online pruitt absolutely not because as i just indicated we need hydro we need hydrocarbon stored on site at utility companies across this country to address something attacks on our grid attacks on infrastructure if we have peaked demand needs you want a diversity of fuels that generate electricity it is bad business it is bad business for a country to limit the crosstalk wallace president trump talks about protecting the people of pittsburgh the mayor of pittsburgh said we re not a steel town anymore we re a green town and in fact he rejected what the president said and the mayor of pittsburgh the city he specifically cited said we re going to comply with the paris climate accord pruitt this president has said that we truly need an all of the above approach we should not penalize sectors of our economy chris government regulation shouldn apost be used to pick winners and losers the past administration declared a war on coal and there were several coal facilities across the country shut down because of their past efforts that is not what government regulation should be about government regulation should be about making things regular not picking winners and losers and making sure we have fuel diversity and generating electricity in this country and as i indicated the jobs numbers show already already that this president aposs deregulatory agenda his leadership in the energy space is making a difference for jobs across this country almost 50 000 in the coal sector wallace i want to go to another issue because the president also said that the paris climate accord and pulling out of it isn apost going to make all that much difference on the environment here he is begin video clip trump with total compliance from all nations it is estimated it would only produce a two tenths of one degree think of that this much end video clip wallace but the people behind the mit study that study that he just cited say that he took a number from 2014 before the targets for the paris accord were even reached and the cofounder of the program said this about the white house they found a number that made the point they want to make it s kind of a debate trick the people behind the study the president cited say look paris isn t going to solve everything it isn t going to solve global warming but it makes an important contribution pruitt what short memories these folks have what short memories they have james hansen former nasa scientist the father of climate change he aposs been called called paris a fake and a fraud because of the very things the president cited two tenths of one there are other studies the global policy publication came out criticizing wallace are you going to speak to what the mit authors crosstalk pruitt look it s very fishy to me that mit updated their study or their results after we started citing it no one is questioning their methodology nobody s questioning their findings wallace well in fact you didn t cite their study after paris you cited their study before paris in 2014 pruitt what aposs interesting chris is during the time before paris before paris this country reduce their co2 footprint by over 18 percent from 2000 to 2014 what does that demonstrate it demonstrates that american innovation american technology is leading the way with respect to reducing the co2 footprint not government mandate if china and india want to reduce their co2 footprint they should learn from us wallace well pruitt india by the way in the paris agreement talk about the merits of the deal chris conditioned any steps that they would take on receiving 2 5 trillion of aid china agreed to make no steps until the year 2030 they re the largest polluters in the world wallace let me let me pick up on that because you aposve taken me exactly where i want to go crosstalk wallace yes this is working together the president had one more big complaint about paris and he said that it treats the u s unfairly begin video clip trump china will be allowed to build hundreds of additional coal plants so we can apost build the plants but they can according to this agreement india will be allowed to double its coal production by 2020 end video clip wallace but here again sir the reality is different is very different from what the president said china has canceled plans for more than 100 coal plants and promises 20 percent of its energy consumption will be green by 2030 india has pledged 40 percent of its energy will be renewable by 2030 and it s set to pass japan this year as the world aposs third largest market for solar power so it may not mandate it in the paris agreement but in fact china and india are going green already pruitt you know what s interesting one of the keywords that was up on the screen was plans china was actually building over 360 new coal generation facilities and had 800 planned chris so maybe they aposve drawn back on the number that are planned but they re burning coal and they re going to continue to burn coal wallace well we are burning coal pruitt just for foreseeable future we ve got a contraction with respect to our grid quite substantially we used to be well above 40 percent we re now down around 30 percent if not less so this country has frontloaded its costs the rest of the world said hey we ll get to that later they applauded when when we joined paris the rest of the world applauded not because of climate reductions but because it put this country at an economic disadvantage we the clean power plan alone the clean power plan alone represented almost 300 million of compliance cost to our economy so why wouldn t paris excuse me why wouldn t france and these other countries want us to stay in that kind of deal it aposs a bad deal for this country the president didn apost say by the way that we weren t going to continue engagement the president he said paris represents a bad deal for this country wallace he also said we re going to renegotiate and all of the leaders around the world certainly in europe said forget it pruitt well then he also said either a new deal or as part of the paris agreement but we re already part look we are the united states chris we don apost lose our seat at the table we joined the treaty in 1992 called the unfccc with respect to climate change wallace all right pruitt and that is still there we re going to remain engaged internationally but we re going to make sure that as we make deals that we put the interest of america first this was applauded by small business you know it was interesting the new york times yesterday had an article that a small business that applauded wallace i don apost want you to filibuster so we can apost get to al gore we want to get to him pruitt ok wallace you brought up a lot of legitimate points i m going to ask him about mr pruitt thank you for your time always good to talk with you pruitt thank you wallace and thank you for answering our questions pruitt thanks chris wallace that aposs what it aposs all about up next former vice president al gore on mr trump aposs decision to pull out of the paris accord commercial break wallace coming up former fbi director james comey is set to testify before congress this week about his conversations with the president begin video clip sen lindsey graham r south carolina i hope this hearing doesn apost become a hitch on president trump there aposs a cloud over the presidency that needs to be removed end video clip wallace we ll ask our sunday panel what to expect commercial break wallace former vice president al gore aposs breakthrough documentary an inconvenient truth brought the topic of climate change to the forefront not surprisingly he is one of the sharpest critics of mr trump aposs decision this week we welcome him for what we believe is his first appearance on fox news since the 2000 campaign mr vice president good to have you back al gore former vice president of the united states great to be back chris thank you for inviting me wallace before we get to climate change i want to ask you about this terrible attack in london how do we stop these attacks on the west and is president trump aposs travel been part of the answer gore well most of the attacks both in england and here in the united states have been by homegrown terrorists and of course the courts will deal with the travel ban they aposve already been struck down we ll see what the supreme court does this surge of terrorism we we have to defeat it but we have to defeat it not only with the force of arms but with the force of our values and i truly believe that giving people around the world a sense that the world s got our act together and we re going to move forward to a bright future is one of the important tasks at hand wallace let aposs turn to the subject at hand you met with president elect trump during the transition to discuss climate change and afterwards you said this begin video clip gore i had a a lengthy and very productive session with the president elect it was a sincere search for areas of common ground end video clip wallace you also talked with mr trump we re told last month about staying in the paris climate deal did you misjudge the president gore well i aposve kept my communications with him confidential i think that aposs the right way to handle it but none of it would surprise you i did my best to persuade him it was in our country aposs best interest to stay in the paris agreement i i thought there was a chance that he would do that i aposm sorry that he made the other decision wallace how do you explain it gore well you d have to ask him for the explanation it makes no sense to me i think that it was a reckless decision and indefensible decision i think it undermines our nations standing in the world and isolates us and threatens to harm humanity aposs ability to solve this crisis in time but make no mistake about it the this country is going to continue to solve the climate crisis governors like jerry brown and andrew cuomo jay inslee many others mayors mike bloomberg s doing a great job rallying mayors around the country we are going to continue reducing emissions atlanta just decided to go 100 percent renewable and there are many many others wallace let s talk and i you heard me challenge scott pruitt i m going to challenge you let aposs talk about some of the concerns that people have about paris president trump talked about one begin video clip trump it includes yet another scheme to redistribute wealth out of the united states through the so called green climate fund nice name end video clip wallace under the paris accord 37 developed countries agreed to provide 100 billion to developing countries why is that fair gore well you know when the marshall plan was launched by the united states after world war ii it ended up benefiting us tremendously as well as making the world a better place we would have been we would be 11th on the list of nations per capita in in helping the country to meet this climate challenge and by the way one of the opportunities for us is to export our products and create more jobs here you showed some jobs in the solar industry earlier solar jobs are now growing 17 times faster than other jobs it aposs the brightest spot if we get out there in the economy if we get out there and help lead the sustainability revolution it benefits our economy wallace but here aposs the thing problem i think a lot of people have countries like the u s which have been developing an industrial economy since the 19th century the argument is that somehow we owe something to countries that didn apost gore well it s a global challenge in the world community as a whole has to has to face up to it this administration has said there aposs no such thing as a global community actually there is because we as a civilization are putting 110 million tons of heat trapping global warming pollution up into the sky every day as if it aposs an open sewer and you know the climate crisis is real chris i i m i aposm sure you know that president trump won apost say whether he believes it aposs real or not but but it is real and you don apost have to rely on the virtually unanimous opinion of the scientific community anymore mother nature is telling us every night on the tv news now is like a nature hike through the book of revelation people are noticing this these downpours and historic floods we ve had 11 once in a thousand year downpours in the u s just in the last ten years we ve got these wildfires that become mega fires now we ve got a 70 percent of florida s in drought today missouri declared an emergency just a couple of days ago because another of another one of these and they keep on coming wallace but let me pick up on that because let aposs say that we agree and you know a lot of people don apost some people don apost some people that watch fox news don apost gore right of course wallace even if you believe in greenhouse gas and climate change there s some questions about how effective the paris accord is gore yes wallace in dealing with it here aposs what epa administrator scott pruitt said on friday about the effectiveness of the u s target which is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by a quarter under 2005 levels here he is begin video clip pruitt paris it set targets at 26 to 28 percent with the entire agenda of the previous administration we still fell 40 percent short of those targets it was a failed deal to begin with end video clip wallace you would agree that even if all 195 nations now 194 met their targets it still wouldn apost solve the problem gore that is correct however it sends a very powerful signal to business and industry and civil society and countries around the world and since the paris agreement was reached look at what has happened you talked about china earlier china has now reduced its emissions four years in a row it aposs reduced its coal burning three years in a row india is now in the midst of a massive shift from coal to solar unbelievably india just announced two weeks ago that within 13 years 100 percent of their automobiles are going to have to be electric vehicles we re seeing this in this country as well i went to one of the most conservative republican cities in america georgetown texas in an oil state they have just completed a transition to 100 percent renewable energy wallace but but but that s part of the argument mr vice president and it aposs a philosophical argument do you need government regulations or will the economy will the market work and and we took the case of solar which has now doubled pretty astonishing gore yes wallace well actually we got some stats here so we ll do it greenhouse gas emissions already declined 12 percent below 2005 levels between 2004 2015 investment in green clean energy rose from 10 billion to 56 billion and as we point out now twice as many jobs in solar as in coal isn apost the country isn t the world going green on its own does it need this government this international regulation gore the the answer is yes and yes we re in the midst of a sustainability revolution that has the magnitude of the industrial revolution but the speed of the digital revolution but yes we still need good policies because we have to move faster we re in a race against time here we re seeing very encouraging changes but we have to change faster the late economist rudi dornbusch i m sure you knew him he once said things take longer to happen than you think they will and then they happen much faster than you thought they could and the paris agreement was a successful effort to send the signal this train is leaving the station everybody on board the u s should be on board states and cities and businesses and civil society leaders are on board if we had the president onboard an end good policy we could move even faster wallace i fact checked mr pruitt i m going to fact check you gore ok wallace after your movie an inconvenient truth came out in 2006 you made the following comments as part of our publicity for the the movie you said unless we took quote drastic measures the world would reach a point of no return within ten years and you called it a true planetary emergency we re 11 years later gore oh wallace weren t you wrong gore well we have seen a decline in emissions for the first on on a global basis for the first time they aposve stabilized and started to decline so some of the responses of the last ten years have helped but unfortunately and regrettably a lot of serious damage has been done greenland for example is losing 1 cubic kilometer of ice every single day i went down to miami and saw fish from the ocean swimming in the streets on a sunny day the same thing was true in honolulu just two days ago just from high tides because of the sea level rising now we are going to suffer some of these consequences but we can limit and avoid the most catastrophic consequences if we accelerate the pace of change that s now beginning wallace mr vice president we should point out you have a sequel coming up called an inconvenient sequel in july and i understand that you re going to have to rewrite the ending because of the decision the president was made just made gore the the the directors bonni cohen and jon shenk are putting a a new segment at the very end of the movie and i think that s appropriate wallace thank you thanks for joining us let aposs not wait another 17 years gore deal wallace ok up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss a moment of high drama this week when former fbi director james comey testifies before the senate intelligence committee plus what would you like to ask the panel about what we can expect to learn from comey just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip question is the white house going to invoke executive privilege to prevent james comey from testifying before the senate intelligence panel next week sean spicer white house press secretary the date for that hearing was just set i have not spoken to counsel yet i don apost know what what that what they re going to how they re going to respond end video clip wallace white house press secretary sean spicer not answering whether the white house will try to block the former fbi director from talking to congress on thursday and it s time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams julie pace who covers the white house for the associated press and jason riley from the wall street journal well julie as we say the white house refuses to say it the new york times is reporting over the weekend that the president is unlikely to invoke executive privilege to block comey from testifying one because it would be a p r disaster and two because his legal case is kind of weak question what are you hearing from your sources julie pace associated press well as recently as this morning what i ve heard is that the president is leaning toward not invoking executive privilege for comey s testimony but this is still an open decision this is something that is going to be discussed in the coming days and as we all know with this president it aposs not a final decision until it really comes wallace why are they fooling around with this pace i well i think there are a couple reasons i think one it actually is a discussion because they are worried about what comey could potentially say but they also recognize that if you do invoke executive privilege just the optics of that makes it look like you aposre hiding something makes it look like whatever comey might say is going to be problematic for the president they think they have a little bit of a wiggle room here i think if they don apost invoke executive privilege and comey does say something that is damaging to the president what you re going to hear administration officials point out is that in previous testimony that comey has has done on capitol hill the fbi has had to correct it there have been questions about things that he said i think that s the argument that they re going to be starting to make but again leaning toward no still an open discussion wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch on just this issue here s one we got on twitter from hatedirtypolitics why did he comey wait so long to come out and say he was threatened by potus why after he was fire and is this revenge for being fired jason i have to say a lot of our viewers are asking why didn apost comey either resign or blow the whistle as soon as he believed the president was somehow trying to impede his investigation jason riley the wall street journal it s an excellent question instead he simply took some notes and share them with a few people but if he really thought that trump had engaged in obstruction of justice i think he had a duty to come forward and report that to higher officials in the justice department and certainly go public with it he didn apost do that which suggest to me that he didn apost think what trump did really amounted to obstruction of justice right britt hume fox news senior political analyst remember this chris about obstruction of justice there has to be it has to be an impeding investigation in a corrupt way which is to say for political reasons or some other illegitimate reason to ask and fbi director is what we know of the meeting that if it s you know if he can t see if he could see his way clear to letting the investigation go since this is about mike flynn wallace on mike flynn hume flynn had just been fired my guess is if comey looked at that and took took the view that it was he was being asked if he could do it if he could in his view was he couldn apost see his way clear to do that he didn apost do it and then you later had testimony from him and also from his deputy that said there d been no real effort no effort to impede the investigation so i suspected as jason says comey did not think he was there was obstruction of justice involved here or he would have said so and this is a guy that s proved more than once that he s always ready to threaten to quit he does that all the time and by the way you re you re the viewers question said did he threaten comey he didn t threaten comey that we know of wallace juan juan williams fox news political analyst well i think if comey had come forward and done that at that moment it would have been grandstanding and it would have imped the ongoing investigation so i don t think even if he saw it as constituting obstruction of justice it wouldn t have been appropriate what was appropriate as to make it part of the investigation and see where it went from there i i think though you know at this point there s so much fear in the white house of what is coming they have now formed their own group to try to get ahead of this curve but this remains a dark cloud over the president wallace you know britt there s there s a the legal issue as to whether it s obstruction of justice there s also the political issue you and i have covered a lot of these big hearings for all of washington and a lot of the country stops to wait to see the the key witness raise his hand and take the oath how potentially politically damaging maybe not legally not a case a case for prosecution but how politically damaging could this potentially be hume it could be damaging if but i i don apost think juan aposs explanation holds up very well and i don apost think comey s in any position to come in and say yes he tried to obstructed justice and i kept quiet about it i don t that won t work in my view and the other factor we have to keep in mind wallace no but if he just says what he supposedly wrote in this memo it s damaging hume yes but it s wallace not not i don t mean it s a legal case but hume but that s but that aposs already but that s already out there whatever damage has been done on that is it might be reinforced for a couple of days but that doesn apost really change the change the atmosphere or move the ball very much and remember this chris he will be under the same strictures as he was when he was in office about discussions of an ongoing investigation he really can apost do that much which which is why i think this hearing like so many others before it will probably not quite live up to its inaudible although the coverage is going to be unbelievable pace well i think we re and one of the important things to keep in mind is that the amount of damage that this hearing creases is tied to how the president responds the president is going to be watching the hearing like everybody else and we aposve seen that he has an inability to prevent himself from reacting so if he is tweeting in real time if he is giving interviews afterward where he s weighing in wallace yes comey does that inaudible pace you know as a journalist we always like to hear we always like to hear from the president wallace you d like that wouldn t you pace but but some of the damage will be within his control wallace jason riley that aposs the damage sean spicer the white house press spokesman came out and said we want to talk about infrastructure this week how much are we going to be talking about infrastructure with his hearing going on this week that aposs the political damage it keeps this in the news and instead of being focused on advancing an agenda on whether it aposs infrastructure or health care reform or tax reform we re talking about the drip drip drip from this investigation williams you know it wouldn t this would bob mueller would not be a special counsel in this deal if we didn apost have word of just this kind of interaction between comey and the president and the pressure on jeff sessions hume i don apost think we have any way of knowing if that aposs true williams i think that s true hume remember juan williams no hume this is primarily and has always been and has always been described as a counterintelligence investigation williams correct hume to get to the bottom of what the russians tried to do to hack the election and of course as a part of that but just a part was the question of whether there had been collusion between the williams correct hume between the trump campaign and the russians so that s a piece of it but it s not the main thrust of it necessarily williams but it is and it has tremendous political damage hume it isn t it is not williams tremendous collateral damage for the president and the reason we re discussing obstruction of justice and whether or not it would have been inappropriate for jim comey to come forward at that moment is because this investigation continues in fact it s escalated britt hume i would agree with that entirely it would tell which is another reason why i ve said and will say again that this case has traveled farther on less evidence i aposm talking about the collusion piece of it than any scandal i think i aposve ever seen wallace all right williams so you know that in fact that what intelligence agencies have said russia definitely interfered in the election wallace ok hume what aposs the underlying crime what s the crime williams the underlying crime potentially and that s why i disagree with you would be obstruction of justice by the president of the united states hume there s been one crime identified and mike flynn was the victim of the of the leaking of his unmasked name williams that s the you think that aposs the crime hume that s the only crime that s been so far identified williams oh i see and mike flynn meeting with the russian ambassador hume that s williams to try to undercut the obama sanctions that doesn apost bother you come on hume that s not a that aposs not a crime williams oh ok wallace all right in any case you know this is kind of a a fox news sunday panel classic juan and brit back at it again as we mentioned earlier president trump made a new push last night for his travel ban in a tweet while the attack in london was still unfolding he aposs taking the case to the supreme court here aposs what vice president pence had to say this week begin video clip mike pence vice president of the united states the ability to come into the united states of america is a privilege not a right end video clip wallace jason does this latest attack add new impetus to the president aposs call for a travel ban riley i i don apost think it does he clearly does i mean he was linking it in in his tweets but the united kingdom is not part of the the list of countries that would be subjected to the ban a and and b again as as as previous guests earlier said senator borne ph i believe mostly these are homegrown folks that manchester bomber was someone who had been born and raised in manchester and so on and here domestically a lot of you talked to the homeland security officials that aposs what they aposre worried about people already here being radicalized and then you see the timeline that the administration laid out for this temporary ban they wanted several months they ve had several months so no i don t i don t think what what struck me about this though is is trump again tweeting and and and and talking about this publically and that has been a problem in these court cases that have come up so far the judges have been throwing his words back at him saying they speak to a state of mind here and i think that again he has to be more disciplined in how he talked about this issue wallace julie julie i want to pick up on that because the whole band which was which was put out the original ban on january 27th one week in talked about 90 day delay 120 day delay while they put together an extreme vetting plan we re now 130 days into this administration why didn apost they put together the extreme vetting plan so they don t have to worry about a ban pace it aposs a great question that extreme vetting plan is essentially nowhere and what we were told at the end of the first week is that the rushed rollout of the original ban was because the threat was so urgent and certainly i think that argument has been undermined by the fact that there hasn t been a major attack in the u s during that period and that the administration has not moved quickly on the extreme vetting and just to jason s point there and it ties back into what we were talking about with comey the white house has been focused on this idea tha
