patrick meehan pennsylvania republican was forced into retirement last year after a house ethics committee probe revealed he had used taxpayer funds to settle a sexual misconduct lawsuit brought by one of his aides mr vatz said there is no significant difference between the number of republicans and democrats caught up in the metoo campaign but he said democrats could be more angered when colleagues in their party face sexual misconduct accusations since they purport to be the party defending women s issues there is possibly some resentment of democrats by democrats that they are betraying women in that democrats portray themselves as more sympathetic and empathetic to females mr vatz said while all of these politicians were outed for their conduct taxpayers also learned that hundreds of thousands of dollars had been used to settle sexual harassment and other workplace misconduct claims against congress members over the past two decades the details about which lawmakers have reached into the fund were not made public only the amount of each claim concerned women for america s ms nance said the names should be made public she faulted house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat for not disclosing the identities of the members who have had to settle these accusations with taxpayer funds i m still very disappointed that neither the republicans nor the democrats have been willing to disclose the members of congress for whom the american taxpayer was forced to foot the bill for their illicit behavior she said neither party when the republicans were in charge they wouldn t do that and now with nancy pelosi in charge she refused correction rep ruben kihuen s state was listed incorrectly in a previous version of the story he is a nevada democrat
