help cure people of covid 19 critics of donald trump went to town and rightfully so while supporters scrambled to settle on a defense both he didn t really say that and he did but it was sarcasm have been in play by saturday morning social media was abuzz with articles about people calling poison control centers each crafted to illustrate how americans had apparently taken trump s ramblings to heart and consumed household disinfectants like lysol and bleach the problem articles shared as illustrations of this actually said no such thing one article making the rounds from the new york daily news is headlined a spike in new yorkers ingesting household cleaners following trump s controversial coronavirus comments but the article makes no mention of anyone deliberately consuming household cleaners it simply states that 30 people called the city s poison control hotline over fears that they had ingested bleach or other household cleaners fearing that you ingested something doesn t jibe with having intentionally consumed that substance the authors of the daily news piece anna sanders and chris sommerfeldt try to circumvent this inconvenient fact by noting that over the same time period in 2019 the poison control center only handled 13 similar cases and while this time nine calls were about possible lysol exposure and 10 about bleach last year s calls contained no cases reported about lysol exposure and only two were specifically in regards to bleach the paper doesn t present any other data about calls to poison control for comparison but one needn t do a detailed analysis to surmise why exposure to things like lysol and bleach and fears about this exposure might be up this month over april 2019 and one needn t reach for the ridiculous explanation that it s because people deliberately consumed it en masse after listening to trump we are in the midst of a pandemic right now and we were not in april 2019 of course more people are being exposed to household disinfectants at the moment than were during this time last year the daily news does note that none of the callers died or required hospitalization which also suggests their exposure was minimal and not of the lysol mouthwash variety but the daily news piece is far from the only poison control story being framed misleadingly a story out of kentucky that s being shared as evidence people have been consuming household cleaners following trump s thursday statements is actually about calls to kentucky poison control centers in march poison control centers around the country including here in kentucky are seeing a spike in calls related to covid 19 says the wdrb com story ashley webb director of the kentucky poison control center told the outlet that just in march we saw about a 30 increase in hand sanitizer exposures and about a 50 increase in household cleaners a similar spike in calls to poison control centers has been seen in many states but these boosts all started in march as people began using more household disinfectants to try and stave off the new coronavirus and not just last week michigan reported a nine percent increase in calls for accidental poisoning from home cleaning supplies in march says abc 57 in maryland over the past six weeks calls for toxic exposure to hand sanitizers have nearly doubled since the same time in 2018 according to fox 5 baltimore in addition the md control center has had 95 calls for bleach exposure more than double last year s 46 calls in the same time period in illinois two people had inappropriate exposure to disinfectants after president trump s covid 19 briefing thursday reported wcia com on friday but a spokesperson for illinois poison control told wcia that this wasn t unusual and calls had been up 36 percent since the covid 19 pandemic s start often related to people doing things like trying to wash produce with cleaners that are toxic for people to ingest according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc 28 158 people called u s poison control centers about possible exposure to household cleaners in march 2020 compared to 25 021 in march 2019 the number of calls about possible exposure to disinfectants went from 12 801 in march 2019 to 17 392 in march 2020 the cdc report containing these numbers was released this week so many have interpreted the data as being related to the trump disinfectant hoopla but the cdc data on poison control calls end on march 31 advertisement next covid 19 highlights the harms of bad food regulations and the benefits of lifting them elizabeth nolan

beating a dead horse or a vainglorious narcissistic reckless untrustworthy bigoted boorish horse with tiny tiny fingers and ridiculous hair at least he s not an asshole bigot asshole bigot go shove yourself back in the hole you came from sevo but he indeed is an asshole bigot as well as a serial adulterer a serial liar a foul mouthed bully and much more yes all that is true about trump but also the nyt is fundamentally dishonest and misleading and an insult to honest journalism explains why it s one of reason s go to sources then they re not honest journalists i feel a chipper tautology coming on i don t know if i can resist it help me secular nihilistic scientism you re my only hope yes both true like it is simultaneously true in this universe that trump said something really dumb and it s also true that he tried to cover up by using the lame transparent lie that he was being sarcastic and it is also true that liberals twisted his words to say that he said to inject bleach when he actually speculated injecting an unspecified disinfectant it was a bad move for liberals to embellish on his stupidest public statement ever as it just gives his defenders something to use it was a bad move for his defenders to not wait a day to see what self reversals he would commit before defending him yeah liberals got the model number of the poison dear leader said that people should injest they re all liars hang them high you are full of shit is sevo a bot no but american socialist is a sock chipper morning wood april 25 2020 at 2 59 pm is sevo a bot no asshole imbeciles are rarely worth a lot of thought or comment asshole imbecile you are full of shit like it is simultaneously true in this universe that trump said something really dumb and it s also true that he tried to cover up by using the lame transparent lie that he was being sarcastic you are full of shit no poison control centers aren t suddenly spiking after trump s disinfectant comments damn i was interested in seeing how effective clorox and lysol would be at cleaning gene pools or a vainglorious narcissistic reckless untrustworthy bigoted boorish horse with tiny tiny fingers and ridiculous hair but enough about you and the guy who fucks you while you wear your gimp suit reply beating a dead horse is an idiom that means a particular effort is a waste of time as there will be no outcome such as in the example of beating a dead horse which will not cause it to feel pain or anything else word thanks for the info chippy i never knew what it actually meant just thought the words sounded nice together sarc a particular effort is a waste of time as there will be no outcome huh like this article and virtually all of your comments he does like to post worthless bullshit the hilarious thing is that he changed his behavior from unfunny posts to trying to be substantive but still offers nothing of value and of course none of you dumbfuck got the joke it was a dumb joke but still come on they re all too worried that we re going to drown in 12 years wow that was supposed to be a joke you are really terrible at comedy not sure if you ll see this chipper or if it matters but i feel obligated to write it i understand you were joking before i m sorry i was a dick about it i misinterpreted what you meant he does like to post worthless bullshit he is worthless bullshit well it is in the sense that it won t change any opinions here in the comments section oh good we have two tautologists here now i was afraid we would miss the obvious well thank you for acknowledging my existence separate from whoever the other tautologist is how odd you replied directly to it now i m starting to worry do you smell almonds huh are you feeling numbness in one side of your face you should probably seek prompt medical attention you seemed like you were up for real conversation but you ve been getting more and more confrontational and hostile done responding done responding then his work is done please don t make yourself a liar now done responding good please fuck off and die https i imgur com uahn3ga jpg lol idgaf about trump so stupid i m even qualifying this didn t vote for him and don t have any strong opinions about him i do have strong opinions about the endless nauseating sea of tired non news stories the assumption of my political opinions re trump because of dissatisfaction with disingenuous hack journalism media coverage reveals more about where your head is at than mine fuck off jeff here s where we actually are journolist narrative timeline 1 trump said inject yourself with bleach 2 he didn t literally say bleach but it was implied 3 people are saying we re inventing shit again they re wrong if you ignore the bit in the transcript i omitted where he literally said it wouldn t be through injection we re talking about through cleaning sterilization of an area you ll see he figuratively implied injection 4 okay so maybe he was giving a sarcastic reply and then said it wouldn t be through injection but he was surreptitiously dog whistling to people to inject bleach using secret nazi code 5 trump said worship satan i m at who gives a shit which is where i think everyone not playing this trump gotcha game is bingo the look what trump said today complex that modern journalism has willingly turned itself in to is nauseating it s like the hot cheerleader chick just making shit up to get back at the nerd who won homecoming queen the mental stretches i m expected to make in order to go along with her ranting are absurd and the whining has made her a total turnoff duh since 2016 when the orange man humiliated the msm and their candidate they have been intent on bringing him down their bile has been so ott that trump has often relied upon in his media democrat rope a dope strategy which makes the usual suspects in the msm even angrier nevertheless the media knows that when political winds ie events change their attack attack attack strategy that up to now just kept their lefty base engaged will get under the skin of trump supporters and alienate apathetic voters from trump happens every 2 4 years with practically any major office holder although it never really goes away in off years doesn t have very much to do with government policy because we know that both the left and the right just believe in slogans obsess about the means rather than the ends and will embrace and extend what they vilify because politics the real question is this would a media darling like obama be any more effective than the current carnival barker in the covid 19 war before you answer that remember that trump inherited the obama administration s policy on pandemics and look at his record with smaller outbreaks during his terms would another boorish idiot like biden or a more amiable dunce like bush jr do better what the hell is turning the cdc into an imcompetent hot mess lane lily started working for them online and in a short time after i ve started averaging 15k a month the best thing was that cause i am not that computer savvy all i needed was some basic typing skills and internet access to start this is where to start more details in fact calls to poison centers are spiking tho the nydaily headline is misleading two cases of fake headlines do not make for the truth which is that after trump s ignorant and dangerous suggestions about ingesting disinfectants calls did spike shame on both the nydaily and reason for lying fact check no trump did not tell people to inject themselves with disinfectant or drink bleach quotes a few moments later in the same conference abc news reporter jon karl asked bryan the president mentioned the idea of a cleaner bleach and isopropyl alcohol emerging there s no scenario where that could be injected into a person is there trump then clarified his remarks it wouldn t be through injections you re talking about almost a cleaning and sterilization of an area maybe it works maybe it doesn t work but it certainly has a big affect if it s on a stationary object false flag phone call opportunity or perhaps it s lefties following the advice of mrs cuomo doctors warn against vitamin drips clorox baths after cristina cuomo touts them as coronavirus treatment alternatives https www yahoo com entertainment doctors warn against dangerous alternative coronavirus treatment ideas vitamin drips clorox baths 180851538 html cuomo also detailed how she took bleach baths adding cup only of clorox to her regular baths to help combat the radiation and metals in my system and oxygenate it we want to neutralize heavy metals because they slow up the electromagnetic frequency of our cells which is our energy field and we need a good flow of energy she wrote yeah his wife is a nut on the other hand ethnobotany is a serious field of study that has led to the development of all sorts of pharmaceuticals if you listened to a shaman explain why certain plants have certain medicinal properties you might dismiss his claims instead of developing effective pharmaceuticals fact is that old wives tales often have a legitimate basis tomatoes may not be poisonous as many thought they were for a long time but if you eat them off of lead plates they might as well be because you will get lead poisoning one of the recent discussions i ve been having with people a lot and i admit i may be wrong about this but i don t think i am the masks people are wearing to the store etc that isn t to protect you from other people that s to protect other people from you my understanding is that viruses are among the smallest of organisms much smaller than bacteria they can go through the material across your face as easy as anything the purpose of having you wear a mask is to stop the water droplets from your breath from escaping your immediate area it isn t to protect you from other people there are masks that will protect you from other people but they re all reserved for medical personnel at this point in time it wouldn t surprise me if half the people out there who are wearing masks think that it s protecting them from other people and why should the government or the media tell them otherwise the fact is that their false belief that the mask is protecting them is protecting other people it may helping them in a roundabout way by containing the virus but not in the way they imagine ken i understand the mask logic the same way i e serious medical masks used properly can protect the user and home made masks might protect others but the next level of thinking should focus on how much protection and how much risk with and without just saying more is meaningless unless we want to convolve the social signaling factor my quick consideration typical home materials might reduce virus concentrations exhaled by some factor call it half probably optimistic then mask design has to keep breath from avoiding escape except through the fabric again be generous and say the average home made mask allows only half to escape and finally the user has to follow protocol e g always wearing the mask and properly not ever touching the mask or face under the mask unless immediately washing hands before touching something else washing the mask frequently etc so how about another effective score of half the total effectiveness is then 0 5 x 0 5 x 0 5 0 125 or 12 5 to run the calculation backwards achieving a total mask efficiency of 50 required that all of the factors are about 80 effective not likely for the average person but what is the risk level anyway recent guesstimates about the population infection rate range from 2 to 20 i have no idea about the risk of transmission from one random passing by of an infected person being pessimistic perhaps 1 in 100 and then the risk of a healthy person actually getting infected from touching or inhaling the virus is also less than certain perhaps 1 in 10 if these factors are correct even order of magnitude then passing by a random person poses a risk of infection of 0 0001 and if they had a home made mask on your risk declines to 0 00009 not statistically different but the next level of thinking should focus on how much protection and how much risk with and without just saying more is meaningless unless we want to convolve the social signaling factor i think we can stop right here if it s not clear that most people aren t interested in anything but social signaling then nothing will ever be clear that s all virtually everyone is interested in i have n95 masks because i use them for work they do protect you if properly fitted i ve been through 3m training on how to properly fit them that makes you an exception average people in the grocery store still think they re protecting themselves by wearing a mask that doesn t work that way and isn t intended to work that way and neither the government nor the news media are disabusing them of their mistaken notion because more people wearing masks in a pandemic is a good thing even if they do so for the wrong reason it s about obeying it s another signal those who will follow along and those who won t if you support your local governor s diktats you wear a mask to show you re a team player even if it s completely pointless in stopping transmission if you don t support your local governor s diktats you don t wear a mask bingo most people treat things that should be based on logic and science as if they should be based on ritual and mysticism the electromagnetic frequency of our cells kilohertz but megahertz even more you know they say that cosmic rays cosmic rays ok that s like the universe which is the biggest most tremendous thing there is cosmic rays are the most powerful frequency there is cosmic rays can kill any virus just ask the experts so what if we beamed cosmic rays straight from the galaxy right into someone s lungs no virus can survive that do you enjoy making an ass of yourself you do it very well what if you beamed a bottle of drano into your stomach you should try that and get back to us the way i know she s an amateur she didn t use crystals people who have wells regularly add clorox to their wells about once a year i have never added it to mine cause i like the risk you have to give your immune system something to do the fish cleaner story didn t work out so well for the media why the hesitance here it worked out great i saw countless comments on social media today about the idiot trump supporters who drank fish tank cleaner it s like they didn t get the memo that the lady was a democrat and it s very unclear if the guy knew what he was drinking it s hard for democrats because they don t get to have the secret decoder rings republicans have that tell them what trump really said so you re saying they re illiterate you are full of shit i m sorry your fellow travelers like kirkland are fucking morons they don t read memos they just shrilly bleat whatever their media masters are lying about at the moment they have no redeeming qualities whatsoever people say all kinds of crazy shit after 12 hours of meetings for two or three days in a row i think it was about three years ago when i first heard someone say that trump s supporters take him seriously without taking him literally where trump s critics take him literally without taking him seriously and this seems to be an excellent example of that yeah he wasn t paying attention misheard or misunderstood something that was being said and he said some stupid shit so fuckin what last i checked the democrats are still advocating authoritarian socialism in the form of the green new deal and medicare for all anyone who thinks those of us who oppose these things should withdraw our support for the only thing standing between us and them over some of president trump s silly remarks would be smarter to drink bleach the democrats progressives activists and the news media really need to get it through their heads the reason we refuse to eat their shit sandwich isn t because we re in love with president trump the reason we refuse to eat their shit sandwich is because their sandwich is stuffed with disgusting shit yeah he wasn t paying attention misheard or misunderstood something that was being said and he said some stupid shit so fuckin what experience with competent educated professionals might have enabled you to avoid saying something that stupid do you really want us to start linking the insanity of those educated professionals from ivy leagues please provide examples you need examples like being rigorous in math and science is racist if you dont understand the issue you re hopeless might it help you in curing your assholish bigotry asshole bigot kirkland is one giant appeal to authority fallacy i still think he may be rush limbaugh s sock for parodying the progs he is absolutely parodying the progs not sure about the limbaugh part experience with competent educated professionals might have enabled you to avoid saying something that stupid you seem to be missing the point that my support for president trump is grounded in the issues and faux pas are beside that point https www merriam webster com dictionary faux 20pas anyone who thinks libertarian capitalists should support authoritarian socialism because the president made a faux pas is making an embarrassing mistake themselves and when we re talking about the green new deal medicare for all etc we re talking about authoritarian socialism did joe biden and the democrats in the house renounce the green new deal and medicare for all or do we have to wait for one of them to make a faux pas before it becomes okay to oppose them on the issues again you re a libertarian capitalist ken since when when you started supporting dear leader s fucking wall with mexico some libertarian you are i know i know the state spending a trillion dollars on defense spending is mandated in the constitution and thus any expenditure is allowed one of these days rather than post your piles of bullshit you should try posting without a single lie suggest no one try holding their breath until shitstain does so have you defaulted on your mortgage yet you re a libertarian capitalist ken since when when you started supporting dear leader s fucking wall with mexico i do not support president trump building a wall with mexico and i d don t believe i ve ever voiced support for doing so i may have scoffed at those who say that walls are ineffective see separation lines in belfast or the barriers in palestine for examples but just because i m not retarded on the issue doesn t mean i support building a wall in fact as all the anti immigration people here can tell you i support an open borders treaty with mexico because i believe it to be in the best interests of the united states in short i do support president trump despite him being wrong about international trade immigration and a number of other issues because he s right about a whole slew of important things like his pragmatic foreign policy his opposition to medicare for all his support for gun rights and especially his opposition to the green new deal which is the most authoritarian and socialist piece of legislation we ve ever seen in the united states because someone isn t perfectly libertarian and capitalist doesn t mean he isn t fundamentally superior to the authoritarian socialists who are driving the democratic party and although president trump isn t my idea of a libertarian capitalist that doesn t mean he isn t far far far far far far far far better than the authoritarian socialists in the house and their candidate for president joe biden for me to pretend that a third party candidate were appropriate the democrats would have to be far less malignant than they are now on authoritarianism and socialism suffice it to say as the democrats become increasingly authoritarian and socialist it is appropriate for libertarian capitalists to become increasingly republican everyone who would vote for a third party candidate over trump if trump was running against joseph stalin and the communist party would have no business calling themselves libertarian capitalists or they would have no business claiming to be relevant in the real world for me to pretend that a third party candidate were appropriate the democrats would have to be far less malignant than they are now on authoritarianism and socialism suffice it to say as the democrats become increasingly authoritarian and socialist it is appropriate for libertarian capitalists to become increasingly republican everyone who would vote for a third party candidate over trump if trump was running against joseph stalin and the communist party would have no business calling themselves libertarian capitalists or they would have no business claiming to be relevant in the real world it is tragic that they became authoritarian socialists while embracing racialism as well i do not support president trump building a wall with mexico ken hoist upon his own petard the only support for immigration control that ken has is from the position of the law of the country and the purpose of persuading the population to change the law i think that argument went something like neither is it libertarian to force people into things they don t want and the more we insist on it the more they will resist and become more entrenched in their anti immigration positions i don t agree with ken on it and i don t think open borders is a de facto libertarian position but i hope i did his argument fair service you re a communist traitor who by your own admission is a scofflaw who lost his house to foreclosure because you wouldn t lay your mortgage experience with bigger stronger boys pummeling you on a regular basis throughout your childhood might have enabled you to be an angry bitter bigot and by might i mean definitely the democrats progressives activists and the news media really need to get it through their heads the reason we refuse to eat their shit sandwich isn t because we re in love with president trump reason has openly advocated for socialized medicine and direct support of medicaid why do you think that position has changed i ve been yelling at suderman about his effective defense of medicaid since before obamacare i was denouncing him for opposing president trump s efforts to cut medicaid back when everyone else around here was cheering against the bill that would have done so https www cbo gov publication 52849 i have no illusions i know it was a rhetorical sympathetic question without a doubt reason exists as a gaslighting operation meant to smother any genuine libertarian impulse and gently guide people to the niskanen we need to learn to live with the welfare state libertarianism i don t know their motivations but those motivations certainly seem to have changed at some point over the years maybe it was a strategic decision to try to appeal to civil libertarians on the left since the right side of the equation seemed to be handled by other people maybe it s just a generational thing and the kids coming out of school just tend to see things differently these days maybe someone who gives them big bags of money wanted them to change direction maybe it s all of the above it certainly seems to be the case that they re hiring non libertarians to write about libertarian issues sometimes it s like reading a publication for fundamentalist mormons written by catholics it s hard for those of us who actually believe this stuff not to notice thank you except they aren t really siding with the civil libertarians they re perfectly fine with government surveillance as long as it s against the right people investigations are good because they can exonerate you and process crimes are just peachy too there s a word for principles of convenience i think it starts with an h some of it is something that affected cato strongly about 40 years ago but which reason resisted at that time a deliberate attempt at market positioning to try to appear equidistant between left and right unfortunately for reason it s clear that over the decades the right in this country has become a little more libertarian albeit maybe grudgingly resigned to the progress that s been made on lifestyle issues while the left has either become or revealed itself to be our worst nightmare so it s clear we should not be equidistant between them but that threatens their funding because why not get aboard the bandwagon that actually has horses pulling it so they have to pretend otherwise and keep distancing themselves from conservatives as the latter draw ever closer while the left has either become or revealed itself to be our worst nightmare so it s clear we should not be equidistant between them you do not compromise with fabians so fuckin what do you say stupid shit like that at your work how would you be treated if you did most same adults dont care about those terrifying swear words in fact multiple studies show successful people curse and not run away in fear also https www sciencealert com swearing is a sign of more intelligence not less say scientists so keep being the language and race police you have a good niche here the conversation here is about saying stupid things not about using swear words so fuckin what do you say stupid shit like that at your work your choices for stupid are so fuckin what to which of those 3 do you think he was referring apply the reason standard here since you re on their site yeah he wasn t paying attention misheard or misunderstood something that was being said and he said some stupid shit so fuckin what sorry sport i quoted the entire passage you don t get to start adding to it reason rules https reason com 2020 04 25 no poison control calls arent suddenly spiking after trumps disinfectant comments comment 8227786 no no sport i quoted exactly what chipper wrote why aren t you responding to the question oops one comment up from that one https reason com 2020 04 25 no poison control calls arent suddenly spiking after trumps disinfectant comments comment 8227775 https reason com 2020 04 25 no poison control calls arent suddenly spiking after trumps disinfectant comments comment 8227826 chipper was quoting the reverend we ll try this again i quoted exactly b what chipper wrote which is exactly what you attempted to do with trump s words so why is context relevant in one case and not the other oh and he was quoting ken not some reverend is there a reason you lied about that is there a reason you lied about that because jackoff was hoping you wouldn t notice and yes reason does rule best libertarian magazine around lol sarcasmic do you think chipper is going to settle for you when he has so many other tds infected security means we can squelch freedoms psuedo libertarians to choose from most same adults dont care about those terrifying swear words in fact multiple studies show successful people curse and not run away in fear facepalm why do i even bother breathing no idea why do i even bother good question good answer fuck off you say stupid shit all the time here somehow you re never happy with your treatment smart people sometimes say stupid shit i made a career out of catching my bosses mistakes before they realized they were mistakes that s why it s important not to surround yourself with yes men this is an election year the idea that i would withdraw my support for someone who opposes the green new deal opposes medicare for all opposes neocon rationalizations for foreign policy and withdraws our troops from harm s way in syria instead someone whose response to a horrific mass shooting in las vegas was a meager bumpstock ban someone who withdrew from the paris climate accord and refused to give iran a pass on nuclear non proliferation treaty etc etc the idea that i would withdraw my support from a president despite being on the right side of all those issues against a party and a candidate conversely who is on the opposite side of those issues just because president trump said something stupid that s a dumb idea if i did something stupid and withdrew my support like that from someone at work who should be kept in place despite saying something stupid i might fire certain people whose job it is to make sure i don t do stupid things like that i can respect if someone wants to judge a president on their actions rather than words but if one takes that stance one should still admit when the president did indeed say something stupid and what should one admit about his actions that s a whole other conversation i wasn t going to go into what is the status of his order temporarily restricting legal immigration i think that s the last actual action trump has taken although i haven t kept up whether it has been fully fleshed out yet and what about his deregulation at fda his deferral to states as a true libertarian does those mean anything to you or is it just open borders you know a proximal cause of this mess in the first place and abortion what all the hostility toward someone you don t even know why all the disingenuity where right in front of the hostility george washington never got a dinner april 25 2020 at 2 12 pm what all the hostility toward someone you don t even know why oh why would i be hostile to a fucking lefty ignoramus oh gee let me thing on it for a while lefty fucking ignoramus did i not link it to the definition for faux pas if your support for policy is a function of whether the president in question stuck his foot in his mouth you re missing the bigger picture personally i care about a president s actions words demeanor the whole package if you consciously choose to be misled by those who do terrible things but present them beautifully there isn t much anybody else can do for you in their own defense of course they should probably resort to ridicule i mean at some point ridiculing people who follow some sweet talking idiot off a cliff because of the sweet way he talks becomes like a moral imperative umm when did i do that you don t even know me what are you taking a political conversation and making it about me when you say you care about the presidents words and demeanor in response to the suggesting that we should ignore that and support the president because of his actual policies despite his faux pas am i not supposed to take that to mean that you think the president s words and demeanor somehow can make him unacceptable despite his positions on policy that guy s policies are authoritarian and socialist yeah but what he says to the media and his demeanor while he says it are flawless that s bullshit and if you re suggesting that the way people present themselves should be considered important compared to the policies they pursue don t be surprised if people notice and call it out i m saying it should all be taken into account there s no reason for a forced dichotomy here motte and bailey ftw i m saying it should all be taken into account there s no reason for a forced dichotomy here so you got nothing but you hope to find some sort of innuendo which might convince jackoffs like you fuck off and die he didn t say something stupid in the overall scheme of things he said something that was non expert when people are hoping for expertise what he said sounds like stuff i hear all the time from non biologists a frequent question on quora of late has been many variations of if soap kills coronavirus could injections of soap help the disease even if it was stupid it s not a deal breaker in the big scheme of things even if the worst reasonable interpretation were true they d still have bupkis on this and something to be noted about experts is they can rarely communicate with the lay person at a certain point in my short career between software and systems engineering i learned that you keep the software engineers away from your customers but you need someone who can talk to sws talking to the customer ken i agree that the left s policies are bad for us but it s a false choice between trump s words and the left s policies i also don t care what he said here the msm democrats and statists in the gop are out to get trump any way they can they ve bad mouthed trump s repeating what he s heard about hcq going so far as to hype a va study that s not undergone peer review or is even the standard of a double blind placebo human trial that had a higher rate of deaths with patients using hcq than not but statistically insignificant with many confounding factors and with hcq given to sicker patients with that kind of reporting at least trump is getting them to tell people not to drink bleach imagine if they treated biden like that for any of his gaffs and there s a lot of people in my liberal neighborhood with any functioning adult 2020 yard signs that support biden now that s some crazy talk chip you say stupid things every time you open your mouth or type on a computer so he s way ahead of professionalism stupidity isn t typically a quality one looks for in a national leader no creased sartorial sense is much more important there s a whole spectrum between those two extremes you re on your 3rd account name here in less than 2 days morty tommy karen sad and you know this because you have some kind of magical divining rod that you can tell when someone is someone else and you know this because you have some kind of magical divining rod that you can tell when someone is someone else it s often easy to spot when jackoff takes a jackoff1 sock jackoff fuck off and die it is sarcasmic again why don t these people ever engage in some real introspection and finally realize that suicide is the best option for them i m sure you understand a lot about the spectrum stupidity isn t typically a quality one looks for in a national leader commonly delivered here by lefty fucking ignoramuses with tds such as you stupidity isn t typically a quality one looks for in a national leader i m more interested in his actual policies saying stupid shit is nothing compared to doing stupid shit and have you see the stupid shit the democrats have promised to do if they take the white house but we are agreed that trump s statement about injecting disinfectant was stupid and that he is lying about it having been sarcastic why do you continue to lie about that even if what you re saying is true you ve failed to show why it s important or more important than his policies for me and a lot of other people policies are the most important but words matter too for you you ve said you don t care that s fine if words matter read the words before and after and then his words 10 minutes later words dont matter to you though sarcasmic if words matter you won t vote for biden because he has to read from a script to make sense at all right no but i think we all do agree that you should try harming yourself with suicide likely being the best possible outcome for you the democrats progressives activists and the news media really need to get it through their heads the reason we refuse to eat their shit sandwich isn t because we re in love with president trump the reason we refuse to eat their shit sandwich is because their sandwich is stuffed with disgusting shit bingo i don t believe the media because i support trump i don t believe the media because the media is little more than a lying bunch of cunts i m pretty sure some of those people poisoned themselves because trump told them to but not because the media jumped all over it and wouldn t stop talking about it and twisting the words no not that looking at you enb ernie s the new parody sock about as lame as obl sullum s headline yesterday did that but where did enb twist trump s words but where did enb twist trump s words in what she wrote jackoff it is coming to the point where people have even less faith in news media than congress can t get much lower than that i would not waste a moment worrying about anyone who takes medical advice from a president or from the wife of a new york governor or any other political person i e total non expert in medical matters and also a generally inept and power mad person there s a reason for having the darwin award some people are evolutionarily unfit if you re too stupid to be exercise even a tiny amount of common sense if you blindly and unquestionably worship talentless authority figures perhaps it s just as well that you will remove yourself from the gene pool on thursday the president suggested that perhaps an injection of disinfectant could help cure people of covid 19 hey enb less than 24 hours ago you ran a headline that emphatically said that trump advised injecting bleach to cure the virus you are a stupid cunt at least reason says suggested a way the local nbc news last night carefully edited out is there a way from trump s words to deliberately state we can inject i m no fan of trump s but the dishonesty and misrepresentation by most of the media is far more dangerous to american liberties than random droolings from this president reason also edited out the part about light and the fact that in the same briefing he said it wouldn t be an injection what do we call a lie of omission a lie the quote they re desperately spinning including the missing bolded line the president right and then i see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs so it would be interesting to check that so that you re going to have to use medical doctors with but it sounds it sounds interesting to me so we ll see but the whole concept of the light the way it kills it in one minute that s that s pretty powerful and 10 q s later in the same briefing q but i just can i ask about the president mentioned the idea of cleaners like bleach and isopropyl alcohol you mentioned there s no scenario that that could be injected into a person is there i mean acting under secretary bryan no i m here to talk about the findings that we had in the study we won t do that within that lab and our lab so the president it wouldn t be through injection we re talking about through almost a cleaning sterilization of an area maybe it works maybe it doesn t work but it certainly has a big effect if it s on a stationary object can you be more dishonest you cant fit a full transcript on a single tweet which is why enb missed it she reports exclusively on her twitter feed and what she finds on huffpo and vox cnn is her primary source why she still has a job is beyond me i guess orangemanbad really is a qualification in postmodern journalism the bald faced obviousness of the lying and lack of shame by journalists like sullum and enb in instances like this always astounds me outside of academia can you imagine any other job that would tolerate an employee lying and fudging in their reports like this government can you be more dishonest well the left tells us he called the disease a hoax and told people to drink aquarium cleaner so they re giving it the ol college try the president himself now claims he did say it but he was being sarcastic that undermines this defense of his words does it change the words themselves the transcript is right there for you to read he did say what jackoff here s the part of the transcript enb and sullum deliberately left out the president it wouldn t be through injection we re talking about through almost a cleaning sterilization of an area maybe it works maybe it doesn t work but it certainly has a big effect if it s on a stationary object if you watch the video he was clearly being sarcastic about injections he then and this is the part that the dnc media is omitting clearly says it wouldn t be through injection enb s whole article is based on a lie enb or sullum where s the link to cnn reporting this news of trump s idiotic brain droppings literally killing people all i can find is cnn s reporting that the leaders of the blacks are decrying governor brian kemp s deliberate attempt at genocide by opening only churches and nail salons and barbershops where the blacks congregate miller said there s not enough coronavirus testing available in georgia to justify even partially reopening businesses but he believes some black business owners need income so much that they will risk their lives to reopen when people get in desperate situations they make desperate decisions he said see that s the problem with them silly negroes they need leaders to tell them what s for their own good and without leaders telling them what s for their own good they start getting all uppity and thinking they re capable of thinking for themselves just as good as a white man i love how cnn still denies reade exists despite cnns own larry king transcripts being a smoking gun that something happened back then this is how a real political scandal comes to light a drip here a drip there that supports the underlying accusations not a sudden claim that isn t further substantiated the story doesn t die it only grows the dnc is soon going to go into crisis mode and the sanders supporters are already dissatisfied now they are latching onto this as much if not more then republicans calls for toxic exposure to hand sanitizers have nearly doubled since the same time in 2018 and of course trump has pushed the idea of using hand sanitizers great now people are going to start drinking hand sanitizer hey did something happen with the credible accusation of sexual harrassment against joe biden yes yes it did we now have video and audio evidence that reade told others about the assault contemporaneously as a strong feminist why aren t you covering this important credible story lol anti biden people really are getting desperate it s clear the cognitive decline attack didn t work now they re trying to make something else stick don t fall for it ibelievedrford butnottarareade https twitter com charliekirk11 status 1253819542993645569 breaking this newly unearthed footage reportedly shows tara reade s mom calling larry king to discuss her daughter s sexual assault by joe biden in 1993 this is the corroborating evidence the media never had in the kavanaugh case will they cover it rt so they can t ignore while supporters scrambled to settle on a defense republicans pounced both he didn t really say that and he did but it was sarcasm have been in play because he didn t really say that and it was sarcasm this magazine really needs to fire those here who deliberately lie in order to fit in with their peers and advance the political classes interests who would they be left with bailey the volokh adjunct um linnekin slade and her 3 pieces per year anyone not living in the ny or dc areas to start stossel too i don t think gillespie deliberately lies he s just trooping along with the crowd robby does sometimes but i think it s more self preservation because he s tackling dangerous topics than the narrative ber alles mostly to be sures is stossel even here anymore they were putting disclaimers on all of his videos and only his videos gillespie we need to be nice to socialists gillespie yeah no when they trot him out to do his bothsides you know team blue just fucked up bailey often lies but does he deliberately lie yes though i m sure he goes through some mental gymnastics to pretend to himself he s not lying on a separate note are we to presume that red tony and yellow tony have merged into a new form perhaps with a few others to form some sort of super tony i am the collective body and assembly of me s across space time and dimensions to better propagate and perpetuate the shared beliefs and ideas of me s throughout providences i was formed to be the singular vehicle of dissemination of the truth and thus to your question my answer kind of i meant to say uber tony should ve said uber tony although i guess omnitony would be more accurate see i was expecting a blue tony and a black tony and a green tony that combined with the others to form voltrony and i ll give the head i am the collective body and assembly of me s across space time and dimensions to better propagate and perpetuate the shared beliefs and ideas of me s throughout providences i was formed to be the singular vehicle of dissemination of the truth and thus to your question my answer kind of that s great tony should have ever been so self aware and ironic the infinite tony infinitony nooooooooooooooooooo although i actually enjoy alternate tonys infinitony is off to a promising start 2 chili because he didn t really say that and it was sarcasm lefties have a hard time dealing with complexities of this nature for instance commie kid is both stupid and dishonest this is tough for him to understand you can believe that the president s public stream of consciousness spitballing about the possibility of developing a kind of blood disinfectant was idiotic without taking the leap to say he was suggesting people inject bleach into their veins the single case of chloroquine phosphate poisoning isn t even what it presented to be why does everyone feel the need to take this kind of thing to a ludicrous level oh that s right it s trump to the election year power times pandemic he could have been talking about nebulizers you of all people don t find the humor in this first is a very serious man never tell the same joke a hundred times i wonder how the lady from arizona who ingested chloroquine phosphate along with her husband who ended up dying is making out with her lawsuits against trump i remember the dumb lady saying in an article that we shouldn t believe anything the dumb president saying you mean the democrat yes let them die can we help you mean the democrat these are the people who decided not to vote for the hag after watching a russki gif cnn msnbc and other legacy media spent three years telling us this is true she s a democrat i thought she was just a murderer is nobody looking into all the holes in her story about how she hates trump and yet followed his advice to take some drug that she was knowledgeable enough to know it s an ingredient in aquarium cleaner but not knowledgeable enough to know that the big warning label about not ingesting it meant it was not meant to be ingested and just luckily her husband that she had tried divorcing before drank enough to kill him and she only drank enough to make herself sick and how she s the sort of crazy ass lady who really would kill her husband just so she could blame it on trump yours is the most plausible theory was it ever proven she actually drank any none of the articles i read ever mention the tox report coming back only that there would be one conducted combine an idiotic president with a bunch of idiotic journalists and this is what you get seriously at worst he awkwardly and inelegantly made a point it s the job of a responsible journalist to parse through this instead reason choose to pile on the pile on instead we get this this mag is in rag territory in the age of orange man bad and it took me a while to get here and can we cut it out with opening a title with no as if reason is setting the record straight not when they write stuff like this they are it s like the pol who said the internet was not i forget what but a series of tubes i understood perfectly what he meant he meant the internet was a conduit of info not a generator of it but reason raked him over the coals for a supposedly stupid thing to say the internet is not a big truck https www youtube com watch v czc67wxuts combine an idiotic president with a bunch of idiotic journalists and this is what you get attract idiotic commenters and this is what you get on thursday the president suggested that perhaps an injection of disinfectant could help cure people of covid 19 critics of donald trump went to town and rightfully so while supporters scrambled to settle on a defense face palm he didn t suggest that at all you shouldn t be writing for reason go take this circus act to a left wing publication this is incredible that you would suggest this actually it s pretty fucking aggravating he literally said that on video the clip is on youtube he literally didn t the clip is on youtube and the transcript is at whitehouse gov https www youtube com watch v qtgvxgkrx1y president trump s remarks start at 1 42 in the video specific remarks about disinfectant start at about 2 05 if he is being sarcastic as he now claims it was extremely deadpan and the sarcasm was spoken directly to dr bryan not to the press he doesn t literally say it in that video all he said was disinfectants kill germs in one minute and wondered if uv radiation could do the same inside the body that s it what s so complicated to understand here if one takes it to believe he was being literal then they have voices in their heads fuck her brains out let me repeat jackoff he did not say what you claim on the vid you used as support for your lies is that clear do you understand that you are lying about what he said and then lying about what the vid shows how fucking stupid do you have to be to avoid reality to that degree are you pod the 15yo drooler did you continue to watch to the point where he says the president it wouldn t be through injection we re talking about through almost a cleaning sterilization of an area he was being sarcastic and then right there in the very same press conference referring to the exact same procedure he clearly stated it wouldn t be through injection journolist members don t mention this because they are liars you have remedial comprehension skills then pretty sure it s not limited to reading comprehension brain damage goes deep in that asshole literally then i literally had sex with your dad and dog they are spinning it now a sarcasm or a joke it may well have been intended that way however sarcasm is generally unfunny and hard to pull off which every internet poster knows hence s trump is not very good at humor few people are it is a difficult art the only president i recall who was any good at it was the gipper he was a professional actor and told jokes or one liners since a lot of us are just looking for something to watch found this compilation of his funnier moments https youtu be igpmftzyay0 everything the man has said has been spun into a democrat talking point by the left wing media the prog left and their democrat politicians and media editors and owners have decided he s public enemy number one no matter what else is going on they distracted the public from covid with a fake impeachment trial their democrat controlled states have caused a massive economic shutdown they have pushed for massive debt increases designed to wreak the economy not help it this is all designed to remove him from office and put in their puppet dementia patient joe biden at this point if you think trump is your worst problem you have your head so far up your ass you will never get it removed when asked by a reporter in the debates with mondale about his advanced age he was the oldest candidate at that time reagan said this i will not make age an issue of this campaign i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent s youth and inexperience watch the video it is there not just the words but he had the timing and delivery no trump is not my problem i am neither a democrat nor a republican my post was about political humor hey if you are a libertarian the most losing team in politics and you can t laugh it will not be a very rewarding experience it just goes with the territory no trump is not my problem and you spent 200 words telling us why right your tds is obvious there are many people who are legitimately affected by tds but the individual to whom you re replying isn t hysterically foolish so a moderate case it s been some time but his post alone didn t seem indicative of any outlandish justifications as to why trump is his point was that trump isn t good at humor something that is subjective but isn t retarded like claiming trump literally told people to drink bleach speaking of literally the bastardization of its definition has met its original one with this fiasco literally now means literally figuratively so when you say most people aren t good at humor yeah you re most people don t take it personally of course if i was any good at it would i be here hahahahaha hahahahaha good one no poison control centers aren t suddenly spiking after trump s disinfectant comments damn i was interested in seeing how effective clorox and lysol would be at cleaning gene pools you ll notice the focus of the news is now almost 100 on the claims lies regarding what trump said at one time or another we are now almost completely relieved of news of the disease outside of tin pot dictators camera whoring on local news and for good reason the panic is a hoax we still have the annual average us death toll from seasonal flu at 61k https time com 5610878 2018 2019 flu season and the current us death toll from the worst killer the world has ever seen we have to shut down the entire economy wereallgonnadie flu stands at 52k with a total of 150 deaths over the last 24h world wide all you fucking cowards and tds junkies stuff your lies up your asses so your heads have some company fearing that you ingested something doesn t jibe with having intentionally consumed that substance where has enb been for the past decade sufficiently woke or just politically greedy people know that feelings are exactly the same as physical reality and maybe even more import meanwhile in news kim jong un appears to be either dead or almost dead and in a vegetative state good let s hope he s indbur iii and the mule is approaching i really need to reread those books schrodinger s dictator ok i should not launch into nerd jokes schrodinger and heisenberg are driving a cop pulls them over and says did you know you were driving at 110 mph heisenberg says oh great now i m lost the cop walks around and opens the trunk he says did you know you had a dead cat in here schrodinger says well now he is bada boom meh 5 10 a cop pulls them over and says did you know you were driving at 110 mph heisenberg says oh great now i m lost pause wait i get it ha ha got any cites i ve got em ranging from he s dead to he s just hiding out cause the flu he s chilling with the rest of history s worn out dictators in south america actually he s been non stop on zoom meetings with other heads of state providing tips on autocracy story is he had a heart attack and needed emergency bypass surgeon was super nervous took 8 minutes to put in stent now he s in a coma vegetable saw it on zerohedge but only source anyone has i think is some chinese journalist with 15 million weibo followers is he there was a report today that various us spy planes their words saw him walking around near the city of wonsan could be a body double of course could ve been his body double that had the surgery and never woke up the story that he caught covid from the chinese doctors flown in to do his heart valve replacement is just too delicious to be true regime like his somebody needs to step up soon and show they have the reins lol at north koreans following a woman though i guess it could be like when park chung hee s daughter ended up winning the sk presidency and soon after went to prison for 20 some odd years for corruption hadn t heard the covid angle i read a nk surgeon did it before the chinese arrived but was very nervous i don t think kim passing is good for the us or anyone for all the ridicule we and western media likes to heap on him he was rational we ll see if his sister has built up any kind of cadre for herself he might have a 10 year old son whod i d assume gets the title and will be managed by a regent that would be best for the sister but still not secure if kim bites it or has bitten it there will be chaos i m giving dennis rodman 1000 1 odds on taking over can t locate the reference right now but one of my books dealing with nk make a point that the succession is not strictly determined by the current holder of office there is a sort of an advisory committee which has some amount of voice in the matter according to that source membership is hereditary in that also originally made up of suck ups to kim il sung now populated by their offspring supposedly they still exercised a degree of when kim jong un took power he was anointed by them whether that s still true nothing i ve found in the past couple of years either confirms or denies if they do there are other kims pretenders who might gain their approval think courtiers during the transfer of the king ship my suspicion is that the pres likes the brainstorming method by which he says whatever crap comes into his head on the assumption that if he s wrong he can correct it later i m sure other presidents have said dumb shit in the brainstorming stage but only in a safe environment with advisors who at least wait for their memoirs to repeat the pres s words in contrast i thought trump simply does his brainstorming in public via twitter or press conference even if i m right he may not admit that s what he does because that would mean admitting he sometimes says stupid stuff whereas in fact he has the best words etc in reality though i think he has a feedback system just like other presidents to tell him if he s being dumb it s just that he shows more real time transparency about when he says dumb stuff the statesmanlike approach would be to have your statements and speeches carefully vetted by advisors and speeechwriters so as to minimize the dumb stuff you say in public and keep it in private but the statesmanlike approach is less transparent and also less fun and no i don t think all other presidents were smarter maybe a few of them like jefferson and j q adams and some others were smarter than trump and jefferson s book smarts didn t always help him but i don t think say the democratic heroes like obama and jfk were smarter carter maybe on scientific subjects but it doesn t seem to have translated into smart policy likewise with hoover and engineering hoover s not a dem hero of course likewise with hoover and engineering i don t know he built a pretty bitchin dam and no i don t think all other presidents were smarter the democrats might have more credibility with the ugh trump is such a stupid chimp crap if they didn t do that with every republican president i m old enough to remember them doing it with bush and it has been pointed out by people older than me that they did it with reagan too the statesmanlike approach would be to have your statements and speeches carefully vetted by advisors and speechwriters so as to minimize the dumb stuff you say in public and keep it in private but the statesmanlike approach is less transparent and also less fun willie brown while obo was still a candidate wrote a column stating that his handlers kept him on a short leash and on script when he wandered off script we got such howlers from a constitutional scholar that re scheding weed was under congress control remember how the press was up in arms about that blatant lie yeah me neither funny you say this i basically said as much today to a friend he too sees it this way trump sees it as a virtue to take the people along whereas everyone know polished politicians like obama are full of shit carefully crafted and watching their every words they have no balls at least trump is being honest to the extent a politician can be he is who he is and people respect that sort of thing i know i like him waaaayyyyy more than this sorry disingenuous putz we have as a pm in canada now he even changed how he speaks he sounds even more retarded and lost i suppose i can imagine harry truman with a trump like twitter account he did denounce a reviewer who criticized his daughter s singing and there are a lot of blunt letters he never dropped in the mail https amzn to 2vbibee presumably because in the time it took to wait for the mail he reconsidered sending them but i can imagine if he was on twitter he might have gone ahead and sent them right away just finished a book on tr don t bother starting on that i heard a report that some dumbass in arizona thought i was playing puppets yeah dude you re right everyone who disagrees with you in a principled libertarian manner must be me because i m the only person in the world who thinks like that yep just lil ol me i m the only libertarian in the entire world seriously dude you re so unimportant in the world you are nothing why would i make up multiple personalities just to fuck with you really fuck you fucking flatter your worthless self go die in a fire don t be so hard on yourself sarc yeah the guy raising sarc s kids is probably hard enough on him already what s really sad that besides banging sarcasmic s kids mom he s also banging their grandma paternal grandma to be specific you replied to your own post sarcasmic that means you forgot to log out and use your sock account so fuck you for eternity you liberal ass bitch too funny lol go back to your socks they are less hostile and more fun lol he s important enough for you to take time out of a saturday to come here and cry about him twice sarcasmic april 25 2020 at 9 30 pm i heard a report that some dumbass in arizona thought i was playing puppets heard a report like on the local news and now you re going to spend hours telling us how you really don t care about it right fuck off you re a dimbulb lefty and that s about all anyone needs to know seriously wtf heard a report nigga you read it yourself you didn t hear a fucking report lololol sarc or stupidity poor girl s lost her damn mind we ve actually been using both therapies for decades and light for over a century link have you noticed it s primarily democrats who take trump s words to absurd extremes like that woman who murdered her husband by giving him aquarium quarantine powder with a giant bright orange label saying not for human consumption because i listened to trump don t trust trump orange man literally hitler killed my husband no so called republicans take his words to absurd extremes by listening to him look at the republicans on this thread going to the absurd extreme of trying to justify his

t suddenly spiking after trump s disinfectant comments future reason headline yes we have no fucking idea what s what it s possible that trump did say something kinda stupid but it s still being misreported and it didn t end up causing mass pandemonium it s just the typical trump statement cycle he says something off the cuff without thinking and it s dumb tds takes over and his actual words slowly change in the minds of partisans on both sides the media hypes it up like he just declared war on texas until even though i hate trump i end up having to defend him 90 of the time i agree sometimes trump can be his own worse enemy sometimes it is just him trolling the reactionary press sometimes it is just hard to tell the people protecting other people from injecting lysol or bleach into their lungs are likely the same people who think black people aren t smart enough to secure identification to present at a voting booth trump never told people to inject lysol into their bodies he mentioned how effective some chemicals are at killing covid 19 outside the body without destroying anything else and wouldn t it be worth looking into whether something like that could work inside the human body it takes a really leap of logic to think trump said covid 19 is killing people and i want to prevent that so why don t we have people drink bleach https msd norge as com thanks thanks

quick fluctuation it would not be a steady rise from march just as a business leader or politician may make an economic remark the stock market might momentarily fluctuate but the comment should not have a two week impact because it will become old information to the market the spike in calls is likely to verify that household chemicals are most likely poisonous the news would not need see if people were going to the hospital or dying more from house hold chemicals but the timing of the spike and the presidential information would be uncanny it s not like dc is not full of subject matter experts and trump could have called experts on the advice of injecting disinfectants before going before the public and saying that no politician in dc should sound like they dropped out of school in the sixth grade because dc has so many subject matter experts president trump did not advocate drinking bleach or any other disinfectant he tried and i will admit and failed to put into layman s terms
