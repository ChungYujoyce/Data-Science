including illegal aliens evers after the meeting appeared to retreat from his previous comments that he didn t think foxconn would employ 13 000 people last month evers said it was unrealistic and difficult to imagine that foxconn would hire that many given that it was downsizing the display screen factory it was building the number of jobs foxconn creates could be less it could be more than 13 000 evers told the editorial board of the racine journal times and kenosha news evers said he and gou had a great conversation and they were building a good relationship evers said they also discussed how foxconn operations would change as gou steps away from daily operations to run for president of taiwan after waffling earlier this year on its intentions gou recommitted to the project in february

qualify for tax credits in wisconsin and has downsized the type of factory it intends to build evers a democrat has said foxconn wants to make changes to its contract with the state which has promised to make more than 4 billion available in state and local tax credits if foxconn spends about 9 billion and hires 13 000 people wisconsin assembly speaker robin vos whose district includes the project site said he hoped gou s comments and meetings would convince skeptics perhaps today gov evers has accepted the fact that gov walker and republicans negotiated a really good deal for the state of wisconsin and perhaps hearing it directly from chairman gou s own mouth he can accept the reality that foxconn is going to be a huge benefit for our state and we should all celebrate it vos said evers was joined at the meeting with gou by the state s chief economic development official who brokered the original foxconn deal gou was also met separately with local leaders in southeast wisconsin
