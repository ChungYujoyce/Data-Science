updated chris wallace fox news anchor i aposm chris wallace reporting live from bedford new hampshire ahead of the first in the nation primary where the stakes are even higher after election chaos in iowa begin videotape sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate our campaign is off to a very very good start pete buttigieg d presidential candidate we are going on to new hampshire victorious wallace bernie sanders and pete buttigieg in a virtual tie but the iowa results is still in dispute and the future of former front runner joe biden now in question joe biden d presidential candidate i am not going to sugar coat we took a gut punch in iowa wallace this hour we are joined by the two new leaders in the democratic race who are now going after each other sanders unlike some of the folks up here i don apost have 40 billionaires pete contributing to my campaign buttigieg this is a time for addition not rejection for belonging not exclusion wallace mayor pete buttigieg and senator bernie sanders just two days before the new hampshire primary then donald trump president of the united states but this is what the end result is wallace president trump takes a victory lap after being acquitted on impeachment charges we aposll ask our sunday panel what aposs his plan for reelection and a possible second term and our power player of the week the new man in charge of america aposs treasure chest all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news today in bedford new hampshire just two days before the first in the nation primary we are live in the great hall of the bedford village inn ahead of the high stakes race here in the granite state a race that aposs even more important after the vote counting chaos in iowa embarrass the democratic party in a moment we aposll speak with the two candidates who are both claiming victory in iowa mayor pete buttigieg and senator bernie sanders both the new front runners taking fire from the other contenders in the democratic race but first let aposs bring in peter doocy with the latest from the campaign trail here in new hampshire peter peter doocy fox news correspondent chris during one of our trips here this summer the secretary of state told us that because new hampshire doesn apost have professional sports teams the primaries are like their pro sports and people are taking this one very seriously begin videotape buttigieg this is the decision we will remember for the rest of our lives doocy pete buttigieg and bernie sanders both say they won iowa sanders if you read these articles out there establishment is beginning to get nervous doocy elizabeth warren is taking her pitch to people aposs porches reporter did you get his vote sen elizabeth warren d ma presidential candidate here we go i am close but i got the woman who came out doocy warren and sanders may have a home field advantage which has joe biden worried about going 0 for 2 biden i aposve always viewed the first four encounters two primaries and two caucuses as a starting point doocy biden aposs latest warning argument is about labels warning sanders is a democratic socialist and buttigieg a small town mayor sanders doesn apost seem eager to mix it up with biden but buttigieg does buttigieg i do not believe we can take the risk of falling back on the familiar doocy and that line has biden blasting buttigieg with a serious diss for the democrat biden this guy is not a barack obama end videotape doocy but barack obama and pete buttigieg have something in common they aposve both beaten joe biden in iowa chris wallace peter doocy reporting from up the road in concord new hampshire peter thank you and joining us now one of the co winners of the iowa caucuses former mayor pete buttigieg welcome back to fox news sunday buttigieg good to be back wallace so how much did your win i aposll put it slightly in quotes in iowa transform the creditability of your campaign to show voters that you can actually beat this field buttigieg well i think it was critically important for the last year presidential candidates have been saying that claiming that we aposre the ones who can put the campaign together that aposs going to ultimately go on to defeat donald trump and the process of proving that began in iowa i was especially pleased that we had a coalition of suburban and rural and urban voters caucusgoers we had older and younger caucusgoers supporting us and did particularly well in some of those counties that had swung from president obama to vote for trump but that aposs one state and it aposs one day new hampshire is a state that thinks for itself with a very strong independent streak and we know that we aposve got to earn every vote here and so i will continue to be on the ground doing events taking questions spending time with voters making sure that they hear our vision and that i hear their concerns and we think that aposs how we aposre going to succeed here too wallace now the flipside of that is i don apost have to tell you you aposre more of a target among others joe biden has come out with a new ad specifically targeting you let aposs take a look begin video clip ad announcer joe biden helped lead the passage of the affordable care act which gave health care to 20 million people and when park goers called on pete buttigieg he installed decorative lights under bridges giving citizens of south bend color free illuminated rivers end video clip wallace now you say that biden is mocking people in small towns he says the point he aposs making is you just have too little experience on too small a scale you aposd like to say that the democrats who win are the ones who push for generational change john kennedy bill clinton barack obama he says and this is his quote he aposs no barack obama buttigieg well he aposs right i aposm not and neither is he neither is any of us and this isn apost 2008 this is 2020 this is about how we aposre going to turn the page and deliver a better future in the country but i aposll also say there aposs so many communities and cities like mine in the industrial midwest rural areas and even neighborhoods in our biggest cities that are tired of being treated as a punch line or not feeling that our voices are heard in washington and a big part of this campaign is about making sure that we carry those voices to the capitol instead of thinking that the answers are somehow going to come from washington as we know it in order to win but also in order to govern we need to be ready to look to the future and that aposs what my campaign is about wallace let aposs talk about some of the issues that have come out recently in the debate on friday night you were asked about the fact that african americans in south bend were four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites were here was part of that exchange begin video clip unidentified female how do you explain the increase in black arrests in south bend under your leadership for marijuana possessions buttigieg and again the overall rate was never lower unknown no there was an increase the year before you were in office it was lower end video clip wallace i aposm less interested in the statistic than the fact it seem to me that you weren apost straight that you at first you docked the question and when she pressed it again you seem to deny it and you know you have the reputation as a straight talker the fact is blacks were four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana arrests in your town when you were mayor buttigieg no that disparity is there and it aposs there in our city and it aposs there across the country so one of the things i wanted to make sure got across was that that was only part of the story that in my city black residents were less likely to be arrested on drug charges than in the state or in the country but still the disparity is real it aposs a problem and it aposs one of the reasons why i aposm proposing that we legalize marijuana outright and when we do we have a process of expungements and looking backwards at the harm that drug policy has caused look we have seen time and time again racial disparities in the enforcement not just in drug laws but across the criminal legal system and we need reform no one mayor is going to be able to resolve it this is a national process that i aposm pleased to see there is more and more bipartisan energy around doing something about it it aposs got to happen now wallace mayor you not only want to decriminalize marijuana you want to decriminalize all drug possession you say that the better answer isn apost ph incarceration i mean rather treatment not incarceration buttigieg that aposs right wallace but isn apost the fact that it aposs illegal to have to possess meth and heroin doesn apost that at least in some way the fact that aposs illegal act as a some deterrent to actually trying it in the first place buttigieg well i think the main thing we need to focus on is where you have distribution and the the kind of harm that aposs done there well yes of course it aposs important that it remain illegal but crosstalk wallace but you would decriminalize it so it wouldn apost be illegal buttigieg possession should not be that dealt through incarceration and crosstalk wallace but you would say that possession heroin is not illegal buttigieg it aposs not going to be dealt with through incarcerations wallace but your your website says decriminalize it would not be illegal buttigieg yes or it could be a misdemeanor the point is not the legal niceties the point is that we have learned through 40 years of a failed war on drugs that criminalizing addiction doesn apost work not only that the incarceration does more harm than the offense it aposs intended to deal with this is not saying that these substances are ok it aposs saying that when somebody develops that kind of addiction throwing them in jail or being in a situation where jail is the closet thing they aposll ever get to inpatient treatment shows a profound failure in our country aposs mental health and addiction treatment system and i don apost think that comes as a surprise the american people know that we aposve got to do a better job and frankly expecting the law enforcement system first responders and jails to be the frontlines of mental health is just no way to run the united states of america wallace in our town hall in des moines two weeks ago you had an interesting discussion with a democrats for life woman a woman who was pro life who said that all she wants is for the party the democratic party to make an explicit statement that people like her are welcomed into the party here aposs a bit of that exchange begin video clip unidentified female do you want the support of pro life democrats pro life democratic voters there are about 21 million of us buttigieg i respect where you aposre coming from and i hope to earn your vote but i aposm not going to try to earn your vote by tricking you end video clip wallace for someone who talks so much about inclusion that struck a lot of people as sounding like you were trying to kick people out buttigieg well i was trying to show her the respect of being honest with her look she is very welcome to join this effort i hope that voters like her do but i aposm not going to turn around and support the criminalization of women and doctors as a way to get a vote because i don apost believe it aposs right i know that this is a tough and a sensitive issue i aposm from south bend indiana a lot of people i know a lot of my own supporters don apost view this the way that i do but at the end of the day it is very important to me and i think to most americans to respect a woman aposs right to choose wallace i think that she wasn apost saying that you have to change your view she was saying is the tent big enough in the democratic party that people like her who are against abortion who are pro life are they welcomed into the party if they want to support them buttigieg here aposs what i would say to me being pro life means also making sure that children can grow up and be healthy and succeed it means making sure that there aposs maternal care it means making sure that there aposs nutrition and if we can agree on that much then perhaps she can support me and if not i respect that wallace you have made it clear you want some structural changes not just specific issue changes one of them is to end the electoral college but doesn apost that mean in a general election if it was just about the popular vote nobody would come to a state like new hampshire because they aposd be too busy gong to population centers like new york and los angeles buttigieg no i don apost think that would be the effect and the reason is we run every other election in this country in the traditional fashion in other words you know the person who gets the most votes gets to win the election and when you aposre running for governor of a state of any size you go to the big cities and you go to the small towns we don apost run governor races in some electoral college system where certain counties count more than certain other counties and if you want to earn that office you campaign everywhere i think the same is true for the country and at the end of the day it aposs not clear to me why a rancher in texas should not count because they are in a state that aposs overwhelmingly conservative or somebody living in brooklyn shouldn apost count because their community is overwhelmingly liberal or that my city a midsize city in the industrial midwest doesn apost have much of a voice because i aposm part of a state that aposs not considered a swing state it doesn apost even benefit small states it just benefits some states and at the end of the day i think it aposs fair for everybody aposs vote to count the exact same like we do in every other election that we run in this country wallace finally bernie sanders who is going to be our next guest after the commercial is going at you hard right now especially about the issue of some of your campaign donors take a look begin video clip sanders unlike some of the folks up here i don apost have 40 billionaires pete contributing to my campaign coming from the pharmaceutical industry coming from wall street and all the big money interest end video clip wallace you say look to beat donald trump we need all the help all the money all the support we can get no qualms about accepting contributions from what he calls big money interests buttigieg we aposve gotten 2 million contributions in this campaign i think the average is under 40 bucks and we are building the movement that is going to defeat donald trump i want everybody to help out i want everybody who shares that vision to be at our side i think donald trump raised and his allies raised 25 million bucks in one day i aposm building a campaign that aposs not defined by who we reject it aposs defined by belonging it aposs defined by inclusion it aposs defined by pulling together a coalition to get the job done and at the end of the day whether somebody goes to peteforamerica com and chips in the five bucks wallace ok buttigieg you know i got to say the website wallace yes buttigieg but also this is how we built the campaign or whether somebody comes to an event and may be a surgeon who can contribute 2 000 without it being much skin off their back i want all of them to be part of this effort wallace mayor buttigieg thank you thanks for your time sir buttigieg thank you wallace and we aposll be watching in your final push before tuesday buttigieg sounds good wallace when we come back the other big winner out of iowa senator bernie sanders joins us to discuss his 2020 strategy as fox news sunday continues alive from the great hall of the bedford village inn right here in new hampshire commercial break wallace and we aposre back now from bedford new hampshire just two days before the nation aposs first primary we aposre joined by the man who shared top honors in iowa senator bernie sanders he aposs on the campaign trail in manchester senator i just asked major buttigieg about your charges about him that he aposs accepting money from billionaires he says the point is you aposve got to build a coalition and accept money from all sources if you aposre going to beat donald trump so the question is are you more interested in purity than you are in winning sanders no i am more interested in transforming this country and lowering the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in making sure that every american has health care as a human right not a privilege and making sure that our kids can afford to go to college and not leave school deeply in debt and here is the problem everybody knows this whether you aposre a conservative or a progressive it is the brilliant ads and the big money that tries ph to control what goes on politically what goes on legislatively in this country and if you do as mayor buttigieg does take huge amounts of contributions from the ceos of the pharmaceutical industry from financers in the fossil fuel industry from the insurance companies from wall street does anyone seriously believe that you aposre going to stand up to those powerful entities and represent working people chris i am enormously proud of the fact that my campaign today as of today has received more campaign contributions from more people averaging all of 18 50 than any candidate in the history of the united states of america we are a campaign of the working class by the working class and for the working class and we are going to take on wall street and the insurance companies and the drug companies and the fossil fuel industry and finally create a government an economy that works for all of us not just the 1 percent wallace but pete buttigieg not to not to take his side in this argument just to just to state what his argument is he says look i aposve put out my platform i aposm going to work for working and middle class people if billionaires want to support me support what i stand for what aposs wrong with that sanders look chris do you or anybody else in america really believe that if the ceos of the pharmaceutical industry are making significant contributions to a campaign that they don apost know what they are doing look let me be very honest with you and mind you the drug companies are not only extraordinarily greedy in charging us in some cases 10 times more for the prescription drugs that we get as they do in canada or in any other country they are corrupt they engage in price fixing they engage in collusion in terms of the opioid epidemic they were actually selling a product that they knew was addictive in killing people they continue to do it do you think when the ceos of major pharmaceutical companies contribute to your campaign that you are really going to take them on i don apost think that you will we have massive levels of income and wealth inequality in america three people have more wealth than the bottom half of america do you really think you aposre going to take on the rich and say guess what guys you aposre going to finally start paying your fair share of taxes not as trump did give a trillion dollars in tax breaks for the 1 percent and large corporations i think common sense suggests that when you take money and you aposre dependent on billionaires you aposre not going to stand up to them you aposre not going to effectively represent working families wallace senator you are and this picks up right on this conversation you are getting hit as a democratic socialist which is how you have identified yourself for decades by everyone from joe biden to donald trump take a look begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate bernie aposs labeled ph himself inaudible a democratic socialist i think that aposs inaudible if he aposs the nominee donald trump president of the united states well i think he aposs a communist i mean you know look i think it aposs communism when i think of bernie now you could say socialist but didn apost he get married in moscow well that aposs wonderful moscow aposs wonderful end video clip wallace in inaudible watch it i know you laugh sanders inaudible yes i just wanted to say chris chris chris i just want to say something and it and it aposs really sad i gives me no pleasure to say this we aposve got a president who aposs a pathological liar who lies all inaudible no i did not get married in moscow i participated in creating a sister city program with the city of yaraslavo ph when i was mayor of the city we had republicans with us people city officials so that aposs a lie and obviously i am not a communist that i presume the president knows the difference maybe he doesn apost but i don apost know wallace ok ok but and here aposs the question in a general election where you aposre going to need the support not just of liberal progressive left wing democrats but you aposre also going to need the support of independents even conceivably some moderate republicans how do you overcome not ph the communist label but the socialist label which which joe biden said not donald trump sanders ok right right that aposs fair enough chris and i i want to make two points on that number one in many respects in many respects we are a socialist society today we have a huge budget it puts money into all areas now donald trump before he was president as a private business person he received 800 million in tax breaks and subsidies to build luxury housing in new york now what does that mean when the government gives you 800 million in tax breaks and subsidies the fossil fuel industry whose produce happens to be destroying our planet right now it aposs seen tens and tens of billions of dollars in tax breaks and subsidies so does the pharmaceutical industry the difference between my socialism and trump aposs socialism is i believe the government should help working families not billionaires so i believe that health care is a human right i believe we should raise the minimum wage to a living wage of 15 an hour i believe in fact that the rich must start paying their fair share of taxes when you have massive levels of income and wealth inequality wallace but but but senator let me let me ask you about some aspects specific aspects of your agenda and you aposve just laid out some let aposs put up on the on the screen some of the things that you are proposing according this is a report from cnn if you add up your proposal for medicare for all and the green new deal and cancelation of all student debt and a guaranteed federal jobs program all things that you propose that comes to 60 trillion of new spending over 10 years senator the congressional budget office non partisan estimates projected over the next 10 years right now the federal government will spend a total of 52 trillion in new spending you aposre more than double that sanders all right chris let me deal with the issues first of all we pay for everything that we propose in terms of health care the question that trump and joe biden anybody else has got to answer if we leave the status quo alone in the next 10 years we aposre going to be spending 50 trillion we are now spending twice as much per person 11 000 a year as do the people of any other country on earth we aposre spending a fortune for health care and yet we have 87 million americans uninsured or under insured 30 000 die each year because they don apost get to a doctor and unbelievably 500 000 people go bankrupt because of medically related illnesses they get cancer they go bankrupt that aposs insane the medicare wallace but but senator sanders they will cost the average let me finish medicare for all will cost the average american less than the 12 000 a year they are paying right now to the insurance companies you can call it whatever you want but when you pay a premium to the insurance companies i call that a tax i end those premiums we end the co pays ph inaudible wallace but but senator let me let let me get in here larry summers not a right wing conservative he was the treasury secretary for bill clinton sanders right wallace he was the top economic adviser one of the top economic advisers to barack obama sanders yes i know larry yes wallace ok he here aposs what he had to say about your plan this is far more radical than all previous presidencies on either the right inaudible or on the left building up programs sanders inaudible wallace how do you persuade voters in a general election that you aposre in the political mainstream sanders i the sound was interrupted so i didn apost hear everything that you said but let me just say this chris every other major country on earth guarantees health care to all people as a human right and they also spend substantially less per capita they all pay far less for prescription drugs wallace but he aposs not just talking about sanders i wallace but he aposs not just talking about health care he aposs talking about the whole program he says it aposs far more radical than inaudible sanders let me let me sorry chris chris i aposve got to wallace ok sanders in terms of climate change chris in terms of climate change i do propose a lot of money and you know why because the scientists are telling us the future of the planet is at stake we spend 60 billion dealing with hurricane sandy you see what aposs happening in puerto rico you see what aposs happening in australia right now what the scientists are telling us is we have an existential crisis how much do you think it aposs going to cost when we have more and more extreme weather disturbances wallace right sanders what do you think it aposs going to cost in crude production when we have increased drought we have got to act to save this planet and the green new deal by the way creates up to 20 million good paying jobs transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel inaudible but on this issue of climate change chris there are very few options if we want to save this planet for our kids and our grandchildren give them a planet that aposs healthy and inhabitable we need a forceful response that aposs not bernie sanders that aposs what the scientific community is telling us and by the way it is a disgrace that we have a president who ignores that reality wallace senator sanders thank you it aposs always good to speak with you sir always invigorating sanders inaudible wallace we aposll be watching how the world turns on tuesday night sanders thank you very much chris wallace up next thank you up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss how this week aposs primary could change the direction of the democratic race as fox news sunday continues from bedford new hampshire commercial break wallace coming up president trump touts his record in a week that saw his impeachment acquittal begin video clip trump we are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago and we are never ever going back end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel whether voters will rally around that message commercial break begin video clip joe biden d presidential candidate it aposs a long the long race i took a hit in iowa and i aposll probably take a hit here end video clip chris wallace fox news anchor well former front runner joe biden i say former already conceding defeat in new hampshire ahead of tuesday aposs primary and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove julie pace washington bureau chief for the associated press dana perino anchor of the daily briefing and fox news political analyst juan williams well dana as our messaging guru how good an idea to acknowledge that you aposre going to lose a couple of days before people even go to the polls dana perino anchor the daily briefing i would say this is joe biden in the debate the other night that was a first opening line and it was a little bit shocking and i i aposm sure disappointing to some of his supporters however that was clearly planned by his campaign they wanted to lower expectations the problem is they aposve been lowering expectations of so far down that you wonder how they think that they can bounce back you know we have we know a lot about what aposs happening here in new hampshire kind of know what happened in iowa we don apost know a lot about nevada or south carolina he had a lead there but i feel like the national lead is starting to slip away from him i thought from a communications standpoint bernie sanders feels to me like their best communicator he aposs the one that aposs punching you might not agree with him but he aposs at least the one that aposs really trying to take it to president trump but i would also say you aposre not talking a lot about elizabeth warren coming in third means that you don apost get a lot of attention but amy klobuchar was described by some political analysts here and reporters in this state saying she had such a good debate performance on friday night that she aposs the one that aposs on the move and she was said to be the most interesting one to watch wallace yes it aposs interesting there was a new poll today i think it was the boston globe poll and it indicated that buttigieg off his debate performance slipped a couple of points and amy klobuchar went up three points which brings me to you julie what aposs your read on this race now two days out are buttigieg and sanders still the frontrunners and what are among the other three warren biden klobuchar who do you think is most likely to spring a surprise julie pace the associated press i think you have to look at what aposs happening in new hampshire and then you have to look at what could happen in the states to come in new hampshire i think everywhere you go right now you feel a lot of energy for bernie sanders it aposs really undeniable right now buttigieg does seem to have gotten a bounce here coming out of iowa but i would say watch klobuchar she has had strong debates throughout this cycle but she aposs never had a debate that has been this close to a voting contest and this is when people start to tune in and when i was out yesterday talking with voters and at events not just her events but others a lot of interest in her the big question though is you know iowa and new hampshire we talk about this a lot these are two states that don apost look like the rest of the country and they don apost look like the rest of the democratic party the challenge for joe biden right now is to hang on until south carolina can he keep his supporters there energized enough and thinking that he actually is electable or will he go in there with a real sense that this is a campaign that aposs on the decline wallace karl you aposve had some expense in new hampshire karl rove fox news contributor oh oh wallace i always like to bring this up i aposve been planning this question for about 48 hours you and george w bush and i like to say you and george w bush not george w bush and you 2000 new hampshire primary lost in an upset to john rove eighteen points wallace to john mccain yes all right good i aposm glad to see you don apost remember how do you read the democratic race in new hampshire two days out rove well we aposll have a surprise we know one thing bernie sanders who won here by 22 points last time around if he wins is not going to be winning by 22 points this field is fragmented we for the first time ever we aposre going to have five candidates who are getting delegates out of iowa the previous record was three lowest percentage winner 26 point odd ph in iowa ever and we aposre going to have a similarly fragmented picture here what was interesting to me was your interview with sanders who talk about a great drive by two two one hundredths of one percent of the money that pete buttigieg has raised his come from 40 billionaires who gave him 2 800 each and yet suddenly those contributions made him responsible for the opioid crisis and fossil fuels and climate i thought that was really great on on bernie aposs part just drive it in there and and the same with his his interview with his question with you on on money we pay for everything he said well that aposs not what he told norah o aposdonnell he said i don apost even know what it costs nobody knows so what is it and but artfully done and and i think enough to keep him in the hunt for first place wallace but i want to pick up on something you said because back in 2016 now you know we need to point out he aposs from the neighboring state of vermont people in new hampshire have known him for decades he beat hillary clinton 60 percent to 38 22 points let aposs say he beats buttigieg by five points is that a victory or is that rove well it aposs a it is a victory you can apost take that away from him but it is a sign of the fragmentation of this field and it aposs going to go on at least through march 3rd that this field is going to be fragmented think about it we got we got five people competing here we we don apost know how many are going to be still alive by march 3rd but we aposre going to have another entrant into the cause on march 3rd mayor mike who aposs spending god awful amounts of money in states that vote on the 3rd of march i cannot turn on my television without seeing the mayor telling me what great accomplishments he aposs had in new york city which in texas is not exactly a great selling message wallace all right let me bring that brings me exactly to what i wanted to ask you juan because it looks like the two frontrunners coming out of here are still likely to be sanders and buttigieg big electability questions about both of them juan williams right wallace how and biden aposs really in in a bit of trouble as he heads into nevada and south carolina how well is this setting up for mayor bloomberg coming in march 3rd super tuesday 40 percent of the delegates from sea to shining sea being being voted on williams i don apost think there aposs any question even though he aposs on the sidelines chris mayor bloomberg had a very good week and i aposll tell you why the centrist lane is opening up for him obviously you aposve heard about the struggles that you know that you see vice president biden having at this moment those struggles mean that people like mayor bloomberg you know are are being sought because people want someone that they can believe can stop a second term for donald trump they aposre looking for a strong centrist and thinking maybe the centrist there right now is stumbling and i think that his ads his ads have been powerful and picking up on what karl said he is he pledged this past week to double down on the existing spending he aposs already spent 300 million since november and he aposs doubling down on that secondly the dnc rules now allow him into future debates so he will be on the debate stage i don apost know how charismatic he might be but he aposll be there so he aposll be a player and then finally you have donald trump donald trump this week saying hey little mike he needs a box at the debates trying to make fun of him i think that also elevates this idea that maybe president trump now sees him and his big dollars as a threat wallace well let me pick up on that with you julie for all of the president aposs bluster about biden and not little mike mini mike that aposs williams mini mini mike thank you wallace yes mini mike who do you get the sense the president and his campaign are most worried about of all the democrats facing in november pace there are two candidates that i hear a lot about from from trump advisors one is bloomberg and that is simply he is just in their face right now the president is a big tv watcher he sees michael bloomberg ads and what they worry about with bloomberg is not just a head to head face off in the fall but it aposs that bloomberg is committing to spending a tremendous amount of money for whoever the democratic nominee is and that aposs important because democrats are trailing trump in in in money right now the other one i hear about a lot is sanders you know the the the public line about sanders from republicans right now is that he aposs a socialist there aposs no way that a socialist can win in this country but donald trump more than anybody knows what it is like to run for president and have everyone say you aposre going to lose have everyone say there is no path forward for you and so that worries them they know that this is a country that is in an unpredictable mood right now that is in the mood for change and that doesn apost really rule anybody out wallace and do they think that perhaps the populace wave that brought trump in in 2016 could bring sanders in in 2020 pace there aposs there aposs definitely some overlap you can you can see in some some of the supporters some of those white working class supporters who are drawn to the same trade message that trump has bernie has that too that sort of anti anti you know free trade message pull out of the big multilateral deals they do think that there is the potential that some of those voters that swung from obama to trump could swing to a bernie sanders wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back what is president trump aposs plan to lead the country post impeachment we aposll get our panel aposs take when fox news sunday returns live from bedford new hampshire commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i want to apologize to my family for having them have to go through a phony rotten deal by some very evil and sick people end video clip wallace president trump striking back at his critics after acquittal this week in his senate impeachment trial and we aposre back now with the panel karl what did you think of president trump aposs post impeachment victory lap going after democrats and even mitt romney a republican who voted against him and in a scene i have to say that reminded me of the end of the godfather when michael corleone says today we take care of all family business firing not only colonel vindman who had been his national security advisor and vindman aposs twin brother and also ambassador gordon sondland what did you think of all that rove well first let aposs take the last item the president has a right to have ambassadors and white house staff who he is comfortable with and colonel vindman if if i were them the the reports are that he was going to leave at the end of february his tour of duty at the white house ended in july but it supposedly signaled he wanted to leave at the end of february i would have left him leave at the end of february but the president has a right to have staff in whom he has confidence i thought it was a very gordon sondland aposs statement was a very i thought generous statement thanking the present for the opportunity to serve the country and again the president has a right to do that i the president you know i understand what he aposs angry but the american people wanted to hear somebody who said you know what it aposs over and i intend to move on and i don apost think he served his cause well by by angrily striking out we spent more time thinking about mitt romney after the president had his made his statement than we would have spent anyway we spent more time looking at you know sort of the anger on both sides at each other then we would have the president had a moment to to to strike a great i aposm looking forward which i think would have been good for him politically and good for the country but i understand it this is this is something he cares deeply about because he feels personally aggrieved about it i just wish he would have been able to tone a little bit of that down and tone a lot up on let aposs get going and move forward wallace juan both aspects of that first of all the president lashing out at his critics after the impeachment acquittal and then also the decision to to fire a couple of the people who testified against him and against the edict of the white house and what about the karl aposs argument the president has a right to have people he can trust working for him williams this is not about trust chris this is about payback i mean if you thing about lieutenant colonel vindman this guy is a decorated soldier and as far as we know truth teller as confirmed by john bolton and others who testified before congress the president is acting also in defiance of all laws that protect whistleblowers or people who speak truth about when they see corruption or malfeasance in government that aposs the way the laws are constructed i think he aposs going after vindman after sondland he aposs denigrating mitt romney aposs faith in order to scare other people into silence in the future i think you know your example of the godfather rang true for me this is like taking care of business after you know going to the mattresses right and so when you look at the senate and you look at the gop votes with the exception of romney you can understand why people were reacting the way they did they aposre in fear of this guy he has control of the party and he has silenced them wallace karl you want to push back on that rove yes a little i love it a law a law was broken the whistleblower law i aposm not aware of it not even the attorney for vindman made that outrageous suggestion the president has a right to have staff whom he has confidence and trust in he had every right vindman had every right to step forward and say what he did but as to being justified and verified by others he said i had problems with that conversation well guess what that conversation on its face is not is not what the democrats alleged it was they alleged there was a quid pro quo in the president never says you aposve got to do this or i or i aposm not going to do that that aposs ridiculous so williams i think there aposs no question karl that that call was not perfect and that aposs way it was put in a secret server and that aposs why you had people go to the that director of national intelligence rove well ok so great we aposre going to impeach a president for being imperfect we aposre going to impeach the president of the united states for not meeting our perfect standards no that is exactly why this thing has been so ridiculous williams that aposs no perfect standard when you the senate had the when you are signed into the united states senate you take an oath to uphold and protect the constitution and when you see the most powerful man in the land breaking that trust wallace ok williams and then you close your eyes something aposs going on wallace all right let aposs turn rove yes well i aposm not going to question the credibility the the judgment of people who said i believe like lamar alexander it wasn apost appropriate but it didn apost rise to the level of wallace ok williams well there you go there you go rove inaudible shouldn apost question it you shouldn apost question the judgement wallace i aposm glad the i aposm glad the acquittal settled everything let aposs turn to the state of the union address where the president reached out and here aposs one particular issue that is going to be a big one in this campaign take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i have also made an iron clad pledge to american families we will always protect patients with pre existing conditions end video clip wallace dana after all of the president aposs efforts to kill obamacare he aposs now part of a lawsuit that would basically end the affordable care act how big a lift for him to make the case and this is going to be a big issue as you well know in this campaign health care to make the the idea the argument that he is the protector of people with pre existing conditions perino well he got a little bit of a reprieve because the supreme court is not going to decide that decision on obamacare until after the election so actually you go back to the status quo ante ph which would be the 2018 election and wanted did the democrats do they drove forward on pre existing conditions like michael bloomberg ads everywhere across the country and they said the president won apost protect you there i think that the white house and the administration has to figure out a way to communicate better what they aposre trying to say about pre existing conditions i understand the case but it aposs not resonating it aposs much easier for democrat to say he won apost protect them there is however some possibility of a health care compromise perhaps on lowering drug costs though the republicans and democrats are a bit far apart the president said he wants to do it that is a possibility but basically what happened this week was if you aposre like at the olympic qualifying round in the hurdles the democrats tripped on the first one and the president kept running and he took the state of the union and what he decided to do with that momentum going forward will be really interesting his budget is released tomorrow and no doubt the democrats will come out swinging wallace because among other things he calls for cuts in medicaid let let me ask you julie clearly the president was trying to reach out to some groups that he aposs had constituents he aposs had trouble with suburban women minorities he really made a big effort how confident are they that he can pull that off pace they aposre trying i mean they have the luxury of time and money right now they don apost have a democratic challenger at the moment so they can kind of pressure test these different constituencies and see where there is the possibility to make up some ground and in a really close election and there aposs every indication that this one will be a close election if he can pick off one percentage point two percentage points among african american voters in some of these key states that could be a difference maker the group that is most concerning though that he has to get back suburban women they have fled the republican party it was a disaster for republicans in 2018 in large part because of suburban women and they aposre the ones that look at trump and worry about tone they worry about his attacks they worry about how personal it gets and that aposs where you could have all of the ads you could have all of the all of the policy proposals you want but can president trump stay on message for ten more months wallace so so as you were watching his state of the union with the idea of suburban women those those suburban rings around philadelphia and other other major cities where they took a drubbing in 2018 what did you see pace i think that kind of speech is a really good speech for the president in terms of trying to get back those voters but that aposs one speech in january late or in early february the president is out on twitter multiple times a day he is speaking at the white house sometimes multiple times a day and that aposs not often the message that you get wallace i got 30 seconds for you karl i you aposve been pushing the idea that this president needs to talk more about an agenda for a second term he talked about what he aposs done he aposs very good at that and he said the best is yet to come is that enough rove no it aposs not and i and i got hints in their prescription jobs child care school choice job training infrastructure all those that he touched on and so i i my sense is from talking to them that they get it they aposve got to have a second act i aposd also point to that ad during the super bowl about 2nd chance that was a powerful ad aimed straight at two groups the african american community and suburbanite suburbanite woman and i aposve got to tell you i was around democrat operatives in iowa watching that ad that made them very nervous wallace which made you feel very happy thanks panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week we aposll talk to the man now in charge of the world aposs biggest museum complex about his plan to bring the vast collection into your home commercial break wallace the smithsonian has been called america aposs treasure chest well now its new leader says it aposs time to share that bounty with the world here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape lonnie bunch secretary of the smithsonian it aposs kind of like buying a new car i know how to drive i know most of the buttons suddenly there are new buttons so i am like a little kid discovering the smithsonian every day wallace voice over lonnie bunch is talking about his new role of secretary of the smithsonian bunch there is no place that is as full of wonder as the smithsonian wallace he aposs the first african american to lead the institution bunch most of my career i viewed myself as an outsider banging on the doors and then one day i wake up and i aposm the quintessential insider and it meant that suddenly my presence could make a difference wallace bunch now oversees the world aposs biggest museum complex 19 museums nine research centers and the national zoo one hundred and fifty five million artifacts iconic objects like the space shuttle discovery abraham lincoln aposs hat and henry the 11 ton elephant that welcomes visitors to the museum of natural history bunch i aposll find myself walking in the gem hall in natural history and learning the stories behind the hope diamond which i never knew wallace bunch has been a power player twice before we first met him in 2012 when he was working to put together the national museum of african american history and culture bunch at 8 00 in the morning i have the best job in america and at 2 00 in the morning it aposs the dumbest thing i aposve ever done wallace in 2016 he gave us an insider tour just days before the museum finally open to the public bunch i am humbled emotional in fact i aposm very emotional wallace the museum has been a huge success more than 6 million visitors since it opened bunch what i love more than anything else is watching grandparents share their stories with their grandchildren it really has become this source of intergenerational learning that i aposm very proud of wallace bunch says that kind of family storytelling sparked his own love of history bunch when i was a little kid my grandfather would read to me and i remember seeing pictures of sort of african american schoolchildren and i was fascinated by that and i looked at those faces and i said i want to know what where their lives like and i really felt that my job became a desire to sort of make visible those often invisible and to give voice to the voiceless wallace the museum aposs success led to his new job now that lonnie bunch is in charge of the whole smithsonian he wants to make sure the voiceless are heard around the world bunch we aposd like to reach a billion people and we aposd like to do that over the next decade wallace so a billion people online can go and see america aposs treasure chest bunch that aposs the goal you kno
