back let them keep it the president elect tweeted saturday evening earlier in the day he had blasted the seizure misspelling unprecedented he tweeted china steals united states navy research drone in international waters rips it out of water and takes it to china in unpresidented act he later reissued the tweet correcting the spelling the u s said china s unlawful seizure came in international waters yet china pointedly accused the u s of long sending ships in china s presence to conduct military surveying china is resolutely opposed to this and requests the u s stop such activities yang the defense ministry spokesman said in the statement china will continue to maintain vigilance against the relevant u s activities and will take necessary measures to deal with them earlier saturday china s foreign ministry said the nation s military was in contact with its american counterparts on appropriately handling the incident though it offered no details on what discussions were underway sen john mccain an arizona republican who is chairman of the senate armed services committee said sunday on cnn s state of the union that the seizure of the drone was a gross violation of international law the drone was seized while collecting unclassified scientific data about 92 kilometers 57 miles northwest of subic bay near the philippines in the south china sea which china claims virtually in its entirety navy capt jeff davis a pentagon spokesman said friday it is ours it s clearly marked as ours we would like it back and we would like this not to happen again davis told reporters he said the drone costs about 150 000 and is largely commercial off the shelf technology the usns bowditch which is not a combat ship was stopped in international waters thursday afternoon and recovering two of the gliders when the chinese ship approached davis said the two vessels were within some 450 meters 500 yards of each other he said the usns bowditch carries some small arms but that no shots were fired according to the pentagon as the chinese ship left with the drone which is about 3 meters 10 feet long its only radio response to the u s vessel was we are returning to normal operations bonnie glaser senior adviser for asia at the center for strategic and international studies said the seizure of the glider occurred inside the exclusive economic zone of the philippines not china and appeared to be a violation of international law china delineates its south china sea claims with a roughly drawn sea border known as the nine dash line that runs along the west coast of the philippines however it hasn t explicitly said whether it considers those waters as sovereign territory and says it doesn t disrupt the passage of other nations shipping through the area the u s doesn t take a position on sovereignty claims but insists on freedom of navigation including the right of its naval vessels to conduct training and other operations in the sea davis said that the incident could be the first time in recent history that china has taken a u s naval vessel some observers have called it the most significant dispute between the sides militaries since the april 2001 midair collision between a u s navy surveillance aircraft and a chinese fighter jet about 110 kilometers 70 miles from china s hainan island that led to the death of a chinese pilot the drone seizure seemed likely to fray the already tense relations between u s and china beijing was angered by trump s decision to talk by phone with taiwanese president tsai ing wen on dec 2 and by his later comments that he did not feel bound by a one china policy regarding the status of taiwan unless the u s could gain trade or other benefits from china china considers the self governing island its own territory to be recovered by force if it deems necessary there also have been increased tensions over beijing s ongoing military buildup in the south china sea mainly the development and militarization of man made shoals and islands aimed at extending china s reach in the strategically vital area
