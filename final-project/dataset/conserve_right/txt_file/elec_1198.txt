tampa fla paul ryan rallied the republican convention audience wednesday night as he formally accepted his party apos s nomination for vice president and made an urgent plea for the country to get to work turning around its economy and finances we don apos t have much time ryan said but claimed we can do this teeing up the stage for mitt romney apos s nomination speech thursday night ryan repeatedly accused democrats of falling down on the job the acerbic speech accused the president of leaving his legions of voters with little more than a record of squandered opportunities and broken promises as they stare at fading obama posters and look for work it all started off with stirring speeches greek columns the thrill of something new ryan said now all that s left is a presidency adrift surviving on slogans that already seem tired grasping at a moment that has already passed like a ship trying to sail on yesterday s wind from start to finish the speech was an unceasing assault on obama s record by the end he drew thunderous cheers and applause from the convention crowd and as he has in the past ryan tried to draw a sharp contrast throughout obama s term he said has been a dull adventureless journey from one entitlement to the next a government planned life a country where everything is free but us ryan pledged a new direction we will not duck the tough issues we will lead he vowed to rein in the size of government and called on the party to take the journey with them before the math and the momentum overwhelm us all we are going to solve this nation s economic problems ryan said and i m going to level with you we don t have that much time but if we are serious and smart and we lead we can do this of the democrats he said their moment came and went ryan catalogued a litany of grievances against the president from the stimulus and accompanying funding for companies like solyndra with their gold plated connections and make believe markets to the health care overhaul his inner numbers guy emerged as he tried to explain the disconnect between the economic crisis when obama took office and obama s actions in those first couple years here we were faced with a massive job crisis so deep that if everyone out of work stood in single file that unemployment line would stretch the length of the entire american continent ryan said you would think that any president whatever his party would make job creation and nothing else his first order of economic business he went on instead we got a long divisive all or nothing attempt to put the federal government in charge of health care ryan also renewed the ticket s pledge to repeal obamacare and continued to claim that he and romney invite a debate about medicare which democrats have tried to use against ryan because of his own controversial plan but ryan repeated the argument that the federal health care overhaul is the real danger for medicare seniors because of the cuts it makes the greatest threat to medicare is obamacare and we re going to stop it he said so our opponents can consider themselves on notice in this election on this issue the usual posturing on the left isn t going to work ryan brought the crowd to its feet when he took the stage and again when he left it after four years of getting the run around america needs a turnaround ryan said at the top and the man for the job is gov mitt romney ryan s speech sets the stage for mitt romney s nomination acceptance speech thursday which will close out the party s convention and be the gop s last word before democrats convene in charlotte n c for their nomination gala new jersey gov chris christie fired up the crowd on the opening night which was delayed by a day over tropical storm isaac but christie left it to ryan to get into the particulars of what a romney ryan ticket would pledge to achieve for america those particulars have proved controversial ryan the house budget committee chairman is the author of a medicare plan that has been a punching bag for democrats for years now but even more so since he was tapped as romney s running mate democrats continued to hammer ryan on the morning of the speech releasing a web video that cast him as a regressive choice from a bygone era ryan though known for his strict fitness regimen and hobbies ranging from bow hunting to heavy metal has brought a vitality to the ticket and has challenged efforts to caricature him as a one dimensional soak the poor conservative his selection as gop running mate was hailed by many conservatives as a serious choice for serious times which is how ryan sought to cast the romney ryan ticket wednesday night going into the november election jazzed up delegates pouring into the halls after the speech told foxnews com they liked what they heard i think he hit a home run said gerry geer a 74 year old navy veteran and alternate delegate from pennsylvania he brought up things that nobody has so far this
