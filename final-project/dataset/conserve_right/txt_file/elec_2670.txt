 sign in republican state of union response was weak unfocused manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion after this week s gop state of the union response it has become undeniable that someone everyone in the republican machine has no idea what they re doing and that is the generous assessment the other option is that republican leadership is deliberately sabotaging the midterm elections for those of us who understand the imperative of conservative victory in november it s obvious the gop must respond very differently to president obama s yearly circus act of the state of the union we ve now learned he pretty much repeats what he said the year before so responding to it isn t exactly rocket science take for example rep cathy mcmorris rodgers response mrs mcmorris rodgers is well liked and smart i had the pleasure of meeting her last year at an independent women s forum event honoring her i found her dynamic compelling and clearly a gop star photos top 10 handguns in the u s then for the state of the union response some self obsessed cave dweller from the land of the clueless consultants and speech coaches got their paws on her and instead of the focused interesting and compelling woman i met in washington d c we got a woman so overprepared and controlled that the powerful and smart mrs mcmorris rodgers had disappeared criticism of the content of the gop response has also been well deserved within the first two minutes the republicans assured americans that mr obama like the gop wants what s best for everyone really there are many people who legitimately have every reason to not believe that after all this is a man who deliberately lied to the american people about one of the most important aspect of their personal lives their health insurance and health care to say nothing of the internal revenue service national security agency benghazi syria iran and fast and furious crises and the gop did say nothing it s easy to understand why a man to whom the lie of the year award was presented isn t trusted to make the right decisions for america in fact the latest poll has found a supermajority of americans have little or no confidence that mr obama will make the right decisions for the country while half simply don t find him trustworthy photos eye popping excuses in american political scandals so no gop spending even one precious word when the nation is watching to support mr obama or reassure people about his intentions is not your job as a matter of fact what people want to see is honesty about our situation a commitment to principles and the articulation of a vision that doesn t mirror the agenda that is sending this nation off a cliff bottom line americans are pretty much hating everyone in washington specifically because of the astounding disconnect between the political class and regular people highlighted by a president who lies to them democrats who cover for him and republicans who are allowing the disaster to proceed without serious confrontation the republicans state of the union response delivered by mrs mcmorris rodgers is a perfect illustration of why voters don t trust the gop machine their overwrought affected message insults the instinct as shallow and pandering if the gop were serious about winning in november and illustrating to americans what and whom the republican party represents the perfect person to counter mr obama s vapid repeat of a state of the union would have been mia love of utah her current run for utah s 4th congressional district got a boost when democratic incumbent rep jim matheson announced his retirement delivering the gop response would have presented her to a national audience helping her campaign and she would have delivered a message very much like her 2012 gop convention speech inspiring the nation and lighting a fire under freedom loving people all over the country in that speech mrs love schooled the gop machine on the fact that a woman can be tough but not hard unique but not remote aggressive but not offensive she also brought it to mr obama showing the american people even if they disagreed with her that she stood for something larger than herself that she knew what the american dream meant and was not shy in being its champion there is one other reason why republicans may be acting strangely as we head into what should be another astounding gop midterm victory they may not want to take the senate consider the situation they would find themselves in in control of congress they would have to act on promoting the conservative agenda and that would mean actually having to stop mr obama why else when the truth of the liberal agenda and its failures are handing a november victory to the gop would their pet project for the year suddenly be immigration reform perhaps the current gop leadership prefers things as they are not enough power to do anything conservative of consequence while watching and applauding as house majority leader eric cantor did during the state of the union the liberal agenda including de facto amnesty become the law of the land there are those who recoil at the idea of criticizing republican leadership the only way to push the reforms the gop must implement if we are to take our great nation back is to make sure everyone knows that what is happening is not normal and certainly not conservative we re in this mess for a reason and it s because gop leaders either don t understand the conservative ideal which is why they can t articulate it or they do understand it and simply don t like it either way it s clear they re not convincing anyone and have failed at being obama lite frankly i wouldn t care if the only thing at stake was a political party but it s not it s the nation s future and your family s future that hang in the balance the only way we re going to bring the conservative ideal back to power is by being honest about what s happening to the entire political class challenging them to change and if they refuse then retiring them against their will tammy bruce is a radio talk show host new york times best selling author and fox news political contributor manage newsletters copyright 2020 the washington times llc click
