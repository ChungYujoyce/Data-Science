apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion new delhi indian prime minister narendra modi chinese president xi jinping russian president vladimir putin and president trump operate quite distinctly both ideologically and stylistically for instance mr modi is an ardent hindu nationalist who projects the image of an ascetic unconcerned or even disdainful of worldly possessions mr trump on the other hand is secular and acquisitive mr xi meanwhile has expanded china s role overseas investing in infrastructure projects across the world while mr trump has tried to wind down america s presence around much the globe particularly where little direct u s national interest is at stake top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey and then there s mr putin who struts on camera on horseback or shirtless or both while one suspects if a photo of mr trump bare chested were to leak he would probably sue to suppress its circulation one is a judo master the other golfs because of their varying priorities all four leaders have locked horns with one another on multiple occasions yet for their myriad differences the indian chinese russian and american leaders are in harmony on one thing each believes strongly in national sovereignty the idea is that what goes on in within a country s borders is solely the concern of that country and its leaders not international organizations or foreign governments national sovereignty codified in the treaty of westphalia dating to 1646 has ebbed and flowed over the centuries for obvious reasons after world war ii there was a turn against it adolf hitler s reign which began with his repression of people only within germany s borders gave the lie to the notion that totalitarianism and genocide are containable regimes that are aggressive inwardly toward their own people tend to eventually become aggressive outwardly toward others but lately because of overstepping by anti democratic international institutions the european union for example those championing a return to the principles of national sovereignty are on the ascent it s not just the leaders of the big countries listed above the heads of countries as varied as brazil hungary israel and the philippines now preach the doctrine of don t bother us we won t bother you china has long operated by this principle which it calls noninterference this week indian external affairs minister subrahmanyam jaishankar was in beijing the visit by india s equivalent to secretary of state came at a tricky time india earlier this month stripped the disputed region of kashmir which is also claimed by archrival pakistan of its special constitutional status parts of kashmir are already controlled by pakistan indian administered kashmir will no longer enjoy special autonomy the decision was blasted predictably by pakistan but beijing a longtime pakistani ally and indian rival opposed it too india s action is unacceptable and would not have any legal effect a spokesman from the chinese foreign ministry said to this criticism mr jaishankar could have a ready riposte don t mess with our national sovereignty some in india have made this argument just as india doesn t comment on china s internal matters be it xinjiang or hong kong beijing too should respect new delhi s internal matters argued an editorial in the times of india the newspaper of record here but the recent eruptions in india and the protests in hong kong have turned into major crises for a simple reason the assertion that our internal matters will ward off outsiders far less when as here sovereignty over the areas in question is in fact disputed or limited india has a hard time claiming sovereignty over kashmir when another country says all that land is theirs and is de facto sovereign over part of it anyway and hong kong according to the treaty with britain that gave beijing sovereignty over it is supposed to enjoy a special status in china at least until 2047 one man s national sovereignty is another man s invasion ethan epstein is deputy opinion editor of the washington times contact him at emailprotected or on twitter ethane
