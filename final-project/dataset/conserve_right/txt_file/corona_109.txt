thanks for contacting us we ve received your submission opinion by post editorial board submit may 2 2020 9 51pm covid 19 may be killing people and ravaging the economy but for mayor bill de blasio it s the perfect excuse to swing open city jail doors and free inmates that s a fair conclusion anyway given his recent boasts of reaching a milestone with less than 4 000 people now behind bars after the city set more than 2 000 loose over virus fears it s one part of the overall effort to create a system that is smaller safer and fairer for all he gloats by fairer for all he means softer on those behind bars which is why former police commissioner bill bratton who helped engineer gotham s stunning drop in crime in the early 90s then came back under de blasio to ensure crime kept coming down despite the mayor s instincts labels that cukoo land they are literally celebrating that they have less than 4 000 incarcerated bratton fumed sunday he says in reality the state s botched bail reform and the failed attempt to fix it this year created another virus a criminal justice virus and now under the guise of containing covid city hall is now emptying jails even faster worsening the problem as the post reported 50 of the first 1 500 who were released were already rearrested and some of them released yet again a week ago cops nabbed robert pondexter for attempted rape he d been sprung april 15 as part of the effort to curb the virus at rikers where he was detained first on another rape charge and then when that charge was dropped on an unrelated parole violation earlier a convicted murderer was freed and quickly rearrested for bank robbery we support the compassionate release of inmates who pose little risk to public safety but de blasio s plainly unwilling to stop there as bratton notes there are 9 000 corrections officers out there 4 000 prisoners and a jail that once housed 22 000 you d think they d be able to space them out enough to protect them from the virus and keep them away from the public the only logical explanation for why that s not happening de blasio is letting folks out for ideological reasons and public safety be damned read next the smarter strategy for the middle east in a post coronav read next the smarter strategy for the middle east in a post coronav share selection stay informed with our coronavirus daily update newsletter read latest updates this story has been shared 358 426 times 358 426 this story has been shared 262 314 times 262 314 this story has been shared 176 443 times 176 443 this story has been shared 161 994 times 161 994 2020 nyp holdings inc all rights reserved terms of use privacy notice your ad choices sitemap california privacy rights do not sell my personal information would you like to receive desktop browser notifications about breaking news and other major stories not now yes please
