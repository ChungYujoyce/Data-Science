claim it is legal for michigan to send unsolicited applications to vote by mail to every registered voter in the state verdict unclear thenew york times claims it is legal but dances around the central legal obstacle to doing so president donald trump criticized michigan on wednesday for announcing that it would send absentee ballot applications to all of the state s 7 7 million voters he originally stated incorrectly that it was already sending the ballots michigan sends absentee ballot applications to 7 7 million people ahead of primaries and the general election this was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue secretary of state i will ask to hold up funding to michigan if they want to go down this voter fraud path donald j trump realdonaldtrump may 20 2020 it is probably unlikely that the president can withhold federal funding to assist with michigan s elections this year which as thenew york times noted in its own fact check has probably already been distributedto the states however the trump campaign actually has a fairly good legal case against the state sendingunsolicited vote by mail applications to voters the key word is unsolicited thetimes notes that a trump campaign official cited a 2008 michigan case in which a judge said local clerks could not send absentee ballot applications to a limited universe of voters however it adds that was before a 2018 ballot initiative that amended the state s constitution to allow absentee voting for any reason thetimes adds that a voter can physically print a ballot application at home and send it in the 2018 amendment known as proposition 3 does not actually answer the objection raised by the 2008 case it says that voters can apply to vote by mail for any reason and it also says that state election authorities shall have the authority to make absent voter ballots available for voting in person at additional times and places beyond what is required herein but it does not say that state authorities should be able to make voting by mail more available than required nor does it authorize state authorities to send unsolicited applications in the 2008 case fleming v macomb the michigan court of appeals held unanimously that while private entities including political parties may send unsolicited absentee ballot applications to their members the state itself cannot the court referred to michigan s election statute which still even after the 2018 amendment does not provide the express authority for state or local officials to mail ballot applications to voters who have not requested them first thetimes fact check claims that the 2008 case is no longer applicable because it involved sending applications to a limited universe of voters while that was one of the issues in the lawsuit it was not the basis for the court s decision the fact that voters can already print ballot applications at home also suggests that the state did not contemplate a need to authorize officials to mail unsolicited applications therefore president trump is on solid legal ground when he claims that michigan s effort was done illegally and without authorization it is possible a court could disagree but he has a good argument well rooted in precedent and the text of the michigan election statute as for funding that is another issue it is possible that trump could withhold other future funding to the state though that could prove more politically damaging than the risk of voter fraud itself joel b pollak is senior editor at large at breitbart news and the host of breitbart news sunday on sirius xm patriot on sunday evenings from 7 p m to 10 p m et 4 p m to 7 p m pt his new book red november is available for pre order he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship follow him on twitter at joelpollak 2020 electionmediapoliticsabsentee votingfact checkmichigannew york timesvote by mailvoter fraud please let us know if you re having issues with commenting copyright 2020 breitbart
