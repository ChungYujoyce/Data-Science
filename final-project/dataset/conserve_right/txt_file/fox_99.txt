washington president trump is in paris on this veterans day marking 100 years since the end of world war i the celebration of peace comes as the president faces new turmoil at home divided government on capitol hill open hostilities with the press and controversy over his appointment of acting attorney general matthew whitaker in a moment we aposll talk with white house counselor kellyanne conway but first john roberts traveling with the president in paris begin videotape john roberts fox news chief white house correspondent president trump began his day at the arc de triomphe in paris meeting with leaders who have gathered to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the armistice between the allies and germany as he welcomed world leaders french president emmanuel macron ripped the nationalism that president trump has so proudly embraced in recent days emmanuel macron french president patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism by saying our interests first who cares about the others we erase what a nation holds dearest what gives it life what gives it grace and what is essential it aposs moral values roberts it was the second time he spoke out about president trump aposs policies in the past week earlier calling for a quote true european army in a tweet president trump called that comment insulting and it seemed to have cast a chill on the warm relationship the two have shared russian president vladimir putin was also on hand for the ceremonies briefly shaking hands with president trump the u s nixed initial plans for a summit with putin during the paris visit though the two will sit down for talks later this month at the g20 in buenos aires end videotape roberts following his speech here at the suresnes american cemetery overlooking paris president trump will head directly back to the united states that means that he is going to skip the opening day of the peace forum a three day global cooperation summit here in paris that stands in sharp contrast to the president aposs america first policies chris wallace john roberts had a beautiful situation reporting from just outside paris thank you now let aposs bring in kellyanne conway counselor to the president kellyanne welcome back to fox news sunday kellyanne conway counselor to the president thank you for having me chris wallace so let aposs start with the president aposs appointment of matthew whitaker as acting attorney general here aposs what he said about whitaker on friday and what he said about him last month begin video clip trump i don apost know matt whitaker matt whitaker worked for jeff sessions i can tell you matt whitaker aposs a great guy i mean i know matt whitaker end video clip wallace so does the president know matt whitaker or not and specifically did he know before appointing him that whitaker was a critic of the special counsel aposs investigation conway the president does know matt whitaker has gotten to know him over the course of the last year since he has been the chief of staff to the attorney general the president aposs point is it aposs not like he aposs putting a friend in there who he aposs known for his entire life he aposs putting somebody who has been working at the department of justice for 13 months now in a very senior position as chief of staff to attorney general sessions and the president has dealt with matt whitaker in many different situations in the white house i aposve been in some of those meetings myself so i aposve watched them interact i aposve watched mr whitaker brief the president wallace if i may specifically kellyanne did he know that he was such a sharp critic of the mueller investigation conway i aposm not aware of that because it aposs not even clear to me that mr whitaker has been briefed on the mueller investigation he has been the chief of staff to a recused attorney general it aposs deputy attorney general his chief and his team that has been overseeing the mueller investigation so it aposs not even clear to any of us that mr whitaker has been read in to most of the mueller investigation if you aposre talking about matt whitaker aposs statements as a private citizen a year and a half ago when the mueller investigation first started what he has said on cable tv i don apost think that disqualifies somebody from being the chief law enforcement officer at the department of justice which is an executive function wallace but let aposs since you referenced it let aposs talk about it because mueller or rather whitaker has had a lot to say about mueller here he is about a possible way to shut down the special counsel begin video clip matthew whitaker acting attorney general i could see a scenario where jeff sessions is replaced with a recess appointment and that attorney general doesn apost fire bob mueller but he just reduces the budget so low that his investigation grinds to almost a halt end video clip wallace and here aposs whitaker on mueller looking into president trump aposs finances begin video clip whitaker i think that is a red line it aposs beyond the scope of the letter that the deputy attorney general issued and appointed director mueller as special counsel end video clip wallace and here is whitaker on the centerpiece of the entire investigation begin video clip whitaker the truth is there was no collusion with the russians and the trump campaign end video clip wallace given what seems to be you say he hasn apost been briefed since he came in but at least his predisposition on the investigation how can he fairly oversee it now and specifically if whitaker were to decide to block a mueller subpoena of the president or were to decide that he would not send a full special counsel report to congress would the president back him on that conway we are so far past the period in which those comments were made by matt whitaker as a private citizen chris and here aposs why since then and through the course of this mueller investigation which has gone on for over a year and a about a year and a half and has cost taxpayers millions of dollars over 1 1 million or 1 4 million pieces of paper have been produced in compliance with the mueller investigation request thirty three trump associated witnesses and counting and even people he doesn apost go he has said i aposve never met have been called before mr mueller as i understand it so we aposve been nothing but compliant it is the president himself who said it would be a redline to go into his finances because the president listened to everybody at the beginning which is this is about russia collusion this is about collusion in the campaign crosstalk wallace but forgive me it aposs different from what the president says than what whitaker says when he is now overseeing the investigation so the question is given his predisposition against it can he fairly oversee it and if he decides to somewhat limit or block the mueller investigation now because he can as the acting attorney general will the president back him conway the president is not looking the president said he has not discussed the mueller investigation with whitaker he has made that very clear the other day i believe somebody asked him that question i aposve never been witness to them discussing it and i aposll go a little bit farther it would be a mistake to try to shut down the mueller investigation in the way that you describe it because we aposve been so compliant and everything that was promised russia collusion there were people out there sit tight sit tight everyone because he aposs not going to be in office very long we aposll find the electors we aposll recount in michigan and wisconsin then we aposll impeach him or he won apost like it in d c guys get used to it and if there if there aposs proof of collusion we aposre waiting to look at the final report and i would just note to you that the gentleman who aposs been overseeing the mueller investigation the deputy attorney general rod rosenstein has called matt whitaker a quote superb choice to be acting attorney general i think that aposs important because people who are working with him feel confident that he can be the chief law enforcement officer at the department of justice chris also just quickly the department of justice does many important things to this country that don apost involve bob mueller or this investigation they crosstalk wallace i understand that conway but i think people need to realize that wallace no i understand that but i do want to but there this is the specific area where people are interested and there is a controversy about whitaker there aposs also a controversy about whether his appointment as acting attorney general is even legitimate and as you well know your husband george conway joined with a former obama official to write this in the new york times it aposs unconstitutional it aposs illegal and that means anything whitaker does or tries to do in that position is invalid i know kellyanne this is not your favorite subject but here is what the president had to say about it on friday begin video clip trump you mean mr kellyanne conway reporter he wrote that you were unconstitutionally appointing him is he wrong trump he aposs just trying to get publicity for himself why don apost you do this why don apost you why don apost you ask kellyanne that question end video clip wallace so following the president aposs direction is your husband wrong about the constitutionality of it is he just trying to get publicity and how do you feel about your husband so frequently publicly criticizing your boss conway well it doesn apost affect me or my job at all i aposve never been doing better personally or professionally people argue about the constitution every day that aposs why we have the united states supreme court that aposs why we have an entire u s circuit court system they are there to talk about conflicts within the constitution and its interpretation so he and his co author have one opinion the president and his attorneys have another respectfully i offer my advice to the president in private i don apost need to put it on the opinion pages because i aposm counselor to the president and the president and his attorneys are convinced that there are at least three or four ways that this appointment is does pass muster it aposs constitutional under the constitution first of all through the vacancies act also there aposs a statute passed in 1998 and there aposs a 2003 department of justice opinion about this but but i think i think the mr kellyanne conway comment is instructive too because people describe my husband as kellyanne conway aposs husband more often than they describe him by his first name so i aposm sure the feminists are really cheering me on today an independent strong strong willed strong woman in a very powerful position that disagrees with her husband i think that aposs the essence of what they call crosstalk wallace well he disagrees with you let aposs move on to something else and that aposs the midterm elections and the agenda for the next two years president trump talked about trying to find ways to work with nancy pelosi the likely speaker of the house and with the new democratic majority unless they start investigating him here is the president begin video clip reporter can you compartmentalize that and still continue to work with them for the benefit of the rest of the country or are you are all bets off trump no if they do that then it aposs just all it is is just a warlike posture end video clip wallace but some presidents have been able to compartmentalize kellyanne to do business at the same time that they aposre being investigated conway well chris you should play the other clip of the president in that stem winder of a press conference from wednesday where he said that there are a few areas he thinks that the democrats are ready to work on he mentioned trade he mentioned immigration i spoke with the president this morning he called me from paris and he said infrastructure immigration obviously the economy we don apost want to go backwards on these economic gains and president trump on wednesday answered 68 questions from 35 reporters it aposs unheard of president obama answered 22 questions from 10 reporters in a press conference after his midterm self described shellacking where he lost 63 seats in the house and this president he just stands there and holds for us taking question after question and said that he would work on infrastructure immigration lame duck will be focused on judicial nominations and immigration wallace ok we conway but that aposs a question for the democrats too are they going to be investigating or legislating are they going to be trying to impeach him or talk about infrastructure crosstalk wallace they say that they say they aposre going to do both i and you brought up the press conference this brings me to my final subject which is the now infamous confrontation with jim acosta at that news conference as you know i have been very critical of acosta aposs behavior myself and i want to ask you about two responses by the white house first to tweet a video that was clearly altered to make it look like it was more of a physical confrontation than it really was although i do think it was inappropriate and second to pull acosta aposs pass to get into the white house and to threaten to do that to other reporters conway well chris first of all what do you mean by edited or as others are saying quote doctored video he either put his hands on her and grabbed the mic back or he did not and he clearly did wallace no he he really did but the video was altered and there are experts who have looked at it to make it conway by that do you mean sped up ph wallace speed it up to make it look pardon conway oh well that aposs not altered that aposs sped up they do it all the time in sports to see if there aposs actually a first down or a touchdown so i don apost have to disagree with the i think overwrought description of this this video being doctored as if we put somebody else aposs arm in there he should have apologized to that young aide and as far as i know he has not i aposm much more interested in the work of alex acosta than jim acosta he aposs the secretary of labor doing a tremendous job with this country but as the president said on friday it aposs instructive you have to show respect to the white house to the presidency and certainly to the president and i think what acosta did was very unfair to the rest of the press corps there are many people who wanted to ask questions that crosstalk conway beginning of the press conference wallace just one quick question because we really are over time already if the president either you say show respect if a reporter writes a story that the president doesn apost like if a reporter asks a question the president doesn apost like are you now saying that it aposs fair to pull their pass and prevent them from getting access to the white house because that strikes at the heart of freedom of the press conway chris if what you just described were the standard you would have cleaned out the entire building years ago he aposs got gets a lot of unfair treatment by the press and but no the disrespect at that moment in that incident and i aposm going to disagree with you as a woman who aposs had people her hands on me thinking they had a right to get into my personal space i aposm currently deciding whether or not to press charges on an incident that happened in the last month in fact i don apost like him pulling that mic back and doing on her arm it looked like a karate chop almost she aposs a young age just doing her job and if you play the full clip for your audience you will see the president had already answered his questions and he was moving on to the next questioner from nbc who was already standing ready to pose that question and he wanted to move on to give other outlets an opportunity to ask their questions wallace i agree with that as a reporter who has sometimes been in that press room waiting ph you always wanted to get your question kellyanne thank you thanks for your time conway thank you chris wallace this weekend answering our questions always good to talk with you conway my pleasure wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the fallout from the appointment of an acting attorney general and what the split decision in the midterms means for the president aposs agenda commercial break begin video clip schumer i just heard the news but i aposd just heard the news but i aposd say this protecting mueller and his investigation is paramount end video clip wallace senate democratic leader chuck schumer reacting to the president aposs appointment of matt whitaker his acting attorney general and it aposs time now for our sunday group rich lowry of national review co host of benson and harf on fox news radio marie harf former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and josh holmes senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff so rich your thoughts on matt whitaker i don apost know if you want to weigh in on the constitutionality of his appointment is it even legal and do you think the president put him in that spot given the statements he aposs made to either limit or block the mueller investigation rich lowry national review i think the appointment is legal under statutes the question is whether the statute is unconstitutional that aposs a close and interesting question that we will probably get some litigation on if he aposs in there for any period of time i think a lot of stuff being thrown at him is nonsense and not a problem it aposs not a problem that he has a relationship with the president it aposs not a problem that he said discouraging things about the mueller probe i think the big problem is that he served on the board of the scam patent company which is just extraordinary for a high level justice official to have done and i think the president on those grounds needs some more stature and credibility as soon as he can get someone wallace congresswoman some of your former democratic colleagues in congress are already calling this a constitutional crisis before whitaker does anything and this morning on one of the other shows chuck schumer the democratic leader in the senate is saying he must recuse himself do you think they were overreacting jane harman d calif former u s congresswoman well first let aposs say a fine farewell to jeff sessions i served with jeff sessions wallace you aposre the only one to say that but go ahead harman well i aposm the only one to say it so i aposm saying it on armistice day i mean he was a is a patriotic american who is a devout conservative and served his constituency well and his service in the justice department was applauded by at least three former attorneys general so i aposd like to say that but on this subject the only reason he could possibly have been appointed is to shrink and starve the mueller investigation because rod rosenstein has not been criticized for any of the other things he aposs doing and wallace well there was the question about whether or not he wanted to use a wire and go into the oval office and tape the president harman oh that aposs fair ok that aposs fair fair and balanced wallace ok harman back to this i think it i think he aposs going to be a short term appointment i think he wasn apost vetted i think the white house did this impulsively as it does many things and that somebody is in the wings whether it aposs chris christie or somebody else but i think the logic here would have been to make rosenstein acting attorney general and the president would have avoided big speed bump wallace josh your former boss senator mitch mcconnell says that he will not even let the senate consider legislation legislation incidentally some republicans are offering to protect the special counsel against any interference by whitaker or anybody else but if whitaker if were to move against the special counsel we talk about ways he could do it he could block a subpoena by mueller he could decide if he still in the job to take the final report from mueller and not give it all to congress what you think the reaction would be in the senate josh holmes founder cavalry well the reaction to anything would be horrible but i think everybody is articulating that pretty well over the last year and a half and i think one of the reasons why mcconnell thinks it aposs not necessary is because it is i mean what we aposve seen over the last year and a half is the senate and the congress basically allowing this investigation to go through you know have a democratic house of representatives i mean we have to remember this has been operating since may 17th 2017 the idea that you can have matt whitaker or anybody else just show up now and shut this down belies the fact that we aposve already accumulated a year and a half worth of information here he aposs not going to shut this down nobody aposs going to shut this down and i think bob mueller is going to come to a conclusion one way or another wallace let aposs turn to what under normal circumstances would be the lead story on the friday after midterm election and that is the fact that the democrats have taken back the house and it looks like nancy pelosi will be the speaker of the house here aposs how pelosi reacted to president trump this week and talk about the fact that the democrats are going to proceed on two tracks begin video clip pelosi said that let aposs talk i aposm sure we can come to agreement on some things and we have an obligation to try to find common ground it is our constitutional responsibility to be a check on the executive branch and we have the responsibility to have oversight on the agencies of the executive branch and we fully intend to implement that end video clip wallace marie how much business serious governing business do you think house democrats will be able to do with the president over the next two years and what about the president aposs threat i want to deal with you but you start investigating we aposre dead marie harf co host benson harf right well it looks like the house majority for the democrats continues to grow as more races get called we could be somewhere close to 40 seats the blue wave is looking much bluer than i think the conventional wisdom held on tuesday night probably nancy pelosi is right here chris you can do both you can walk and chew gum at the same time i think on issues like criminal justice reform immigration other issues democrats in the house will put forward a proactive policy agenda they will vote on bills they will send them to the senate and they will put the onus on the senate and the president but she aposs also right that one of the main things voters said during this midterm was they want more accountability for the trump administration and look we aposve seen that under every administration the house and the senate have that constitutional role and quite frankly they didn apost use it during the last two years so i think the investigations will be very strategic they will be specific it won apost just be willy nilly impeach impeach impeach unless mueller comes up with something really earth shattering but i really think democrats can do both the ball is going to be in president trump and the senate aposs court to see if they actually want to govern or just abstract house democrats wallace you have a bit of a smile on your face harf i can feel it actually wallace yes harf i can feel it holmes this is not the same democratic conference that nancy pelosi led in 2006 to 2010 what we aposre dealing with is all of the energy within this democratic party is the impeach trump movement and the abolish ice movement in the sort of radical left wing economy view of the world which is like medicare for all and a whole bunch of different socialist policies if we think that any of those are going to go across to the senate and die anything but a lonely death wallace what about issues on which there does seem to be some agreement like infrastructure lowering prescription drug prices is there a basis for a deal there and specifically can congress and the president walk and chew gum at the same time investigate areas and you know they aposre going to regardless but also do some business holmes well i look i would be the happiest man in show business if there was something other than messaging a legislation coming out of the house i aposm really dubious about that at this point i think there aposs going to be a lot of investigation they aposre clearly going to have to work together and things like appropriations bills authorization bills the big kind of pass items but in terms of immigration reform i mean look i aposve been watching this movie for ten years and there aposs nothing about this democratic conference that seems to me like it would be compatible with a deal here wallace thirty seconds harman strongly disagree all those surprise all those newcomers who fought so hard are not just far left democrats i aposm not demeaning them but i think that nancy pelosi aposs best move will be to empower the newbies and set up a policy conference with them and let them chart a new direction crosstalk wallace all right guys harman and i think if she did that there would be opportunities for making deals with kevin mccarthy aposs republican caucus and i think we could see the house finally revived wallace all right guess what we are going to have two years to talk about this and we aposre certainly going to have until january to talk about it before it does look like she aposs going to take the speaker aposs gavel all of the opposition seems to have disappeared all right panel we have to take a break here we will see you a little later and in case you aposre wondering why we don apost have any members of the new house democratic majority on today well so are we we invited democratic leaders and the likely new chairs of key committees to join us they all declined when we come back yet another election vote counting controversy in florida we aposll talk with governor rick scott who senate races headed for a recount commercial break wallace coming up the razor thin margins in florida aposs races for governor and senator spark a partisan showdown begin video clip scott their goal is to keep mysteriously finding more votes until the election turns out the way they want end video clip wallace governor rick scott now running for the senate joins us next on fox news sunday commercial break wallace well florida is once again the center of an election storm the florida secretary of state has now ordered a recount in the governor aposs race between andrew gillum democratic mayor of tallahassee and former republican congressman ron desantis and there will be another recount in the senate race between incumbent democrat bill nelson and republican governor rick scott governor scott will join us in a moment but first let aposs get the latest from phil keating in lauderhill florida site of the broward county board of elections phil phil keating fox news correspondent chris in all 67 florida counties elections workers are now scanning 8 million ballots through the tabulator aposs one more time with a thursday 3 00 p m deadline for this second recount or second count rather that is the daunting task according to the supervisor of elections in palm beach county who says it aposs impossible to meet begin videotape keating election protests are back as the nation watches another florida recount with national implications and this morning the recount is underway almost immediately from europe saturday president trump lashed out at democrats tweeting trying to steal two big elections in florida we are watching closely eight million florida voters cast ballots with both republicans in the senate and gubernatorial races ending up with leads but not wins any race under half a percent requires an automatic machine recount on election night both scott and desantis declared victory but the election wasn apost done provisionals and mailings still had to be counted that shrunk the republican aposs margins leading the president and scott to allege fraud with no evidence andrew gillum d fla gubernatorial candidate we didn apost win it tonight keating gillam who conceded tuesday night but has since made up enough ground to join nelson for a recount says it aposs called democracy gillum i am replacing my words of concession with an uncompromised and unapologetic call that we count every single vote end video clip keating as it stands right now in the senate race the margin of difference between incumbent bill nelson and rick scott is a 0 15 percent if it stays that way under a quarter of a percentage point we will then be headed to a hand recount chris wallace phil thank you joining us now from naples florida governor scott who thought he won election to the senate tuesday night we also invited his opponent senator nelson but he declined governor at 11 00 p m on election night your lead was 56 000 votes but as of the latest tally by the state your lead is now down to 12 500 or as phil pointed out 0 15 percent over bill nelson how do you feel about the recount and how do you feel about your chances of winning scott well we had 8 million people vote chuck schumer spent over 50 million trying to beat me but we won every supervisor election has reported their results i aposm up about i think 12 500 votes there aposs never been a recount that aposs changed in florida or any other state any sort of win like that so while we aposre going to the recount we won this is the state won i aposm going to be going to d c and i aposm going to do exactly what i did in florida try to change the direction of the country like we tried to change the direction of florida wallace you suggested earlier this week that there was rampant fraud your phrase going on here let aposs take a look at what you had to say begin video clip scott no ragtag group of liberal activists or lawyers from d c will be allowed to steal this election end video clip wallace governor do you have any hard evidence that there was actual fraud or is actual fraud going on and if so by whom scott sure so so chris we have very specific election laws in this state to try to prevent fraud we had to go to court to force the supervisor of elections in palm beach county to broward county to comply with the law which is the law is there to prevent fraud they were not letting party officials review you know when they were reviewing ballots they didn apost report on time how we we still don apost understand how they went in these two counties and had dramatic increase another 93 000 votes were cast or somehow they came up with 93 000 votes after election night we still don apost know how they came up with that so we aposre trying to figure out exactly what we what happened i aposve asked the florida department of law enforcement to go in and do an investigation to find out what happened here but we clearly know the judges have already said they clearly violated the law wallace i agree with you there were two decisions one in broward county and one in palm beach county which both said that the election supervisors there did not comply with transparency and making information available on the other hand as you point out you asked the florida department of law enforcement to investigate any accusations of wrongdoing but the department says so far they aposve done nothing because they have no specific allegations of fraud and the secretary of state aposs office says the same thing so certainly they were not as transparent as they should be and that had to be remedied by the courts but there were there are no allegations of fraud at this point scott well first off the laws chris the laws are set up to stop fraud that aposs with the laws are set up to do and let aposs look at what happened yesterday we know senator nelson aposs lawyer said that a non citizen should have the right to vote senator nelson has gone to gone to court to say that fraudulent ballots fraudulent ballots that were not properly delivered sign whatever should have should be counted ok senator nelson is clearly trying to find to try and commit fraud to try to win this election that aposs all this is wallace i wait a second i want to pick up on that you aposre accusing bill nelson of trying to commit fraud scott his lawyer said that a non citizen should vote that aposs one number two he aposs gone to trial and said that fraudulent ballots should be counted ballots have already been thrown out because they were not done properly he said those should be counted wallace and you think that is the senator himself is committing fraud scott well it aposs his team wallace i want to play a clip from senator nelson he issued a video yesterday let aposs take a look at that begin video clip sen bill nelson d fla votes are not being found they aposre being counted end video clip wallace he says this is just a matter of allowing the democratic process in florida to continue your reaction to that governor scott chris 93 000 ballots were found after election night it aposs the law you have to say how many ballots have been how many votes have been cast that night all right within 30 minutes after election ok somehow after the election finished somehow they came up with 93 000 votes afterwards how did they chris did they do it we don apost know bill nelson is a sore loser he aposs been in politics way too long 42 years he just won apost give up and he aposs saying if you aposre if you aposre not a citizen you ought to your vote ought to count he aposs saying that fraudulent ballots ought to count that aposs wrong wallace i want to turn the subject slightly with you about this because the election supervisor in broward county a woman named brenda snipes ph has has a history of irregularities and in fact two years ago a judge ruled that she illegally destroyed ballots from a democratic primary the question i have for you is as governor you could have suspended her at some point and and named a replacement why didn apost you scott well what i focus on now is we aposve gone through an election let aposs get this election finished that aposs what i aposm focused on now let aposs get this election finished let aposs make sure she complies with the law let aposs make sure that florida department of law enforcement does an investigation i aposve asked all the sheriffs who have the authority to do this to be very vigilant with this we have 7 500 volunteers willing to willing to go in but bill nelson aposs a sore loser we aposve won i aposve had to win this election twice now i will be going to washington as the next u s senator from florida and i aposm going to work hard to change the direction of this country like we did in florida wallace you aposve got to know that people across the country are saying florida again recounting controversies bad ballot design you were governor for eight years could you have done more to reform the election system than you did scott well you know chris we have laws right that try to prevent fraud to try to make sure people feel like you know there aposs an honest election here it aposs so frustrating when you see supervisor elections that violate the law that aposs what not just what i aposm saying what judges are saying you know we have a reason that we have party officials be able to review ballots we have we have a reason that we report information so to prevent fraud i mean the supervisor in broward has admitted ballots that shouldn apost have been cast in this election got got you know put together with other ballots so we know they aposre doing we know they aposre doing the wrong thing we aposre trying to do everything we can to prevent fraud but these individuals you know we aposve had to go to court to try to get them to comply with the law we can pass every law you want but if people don apost comply with it what else can you do wallace i i got one final question for you governor you aposve said a couple of times you aposre the new senator you aposre headed to washington you aposre going to change things specifically the senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has scheduled a photo op for two days from now for tuesday i think it aposs at 10 00 a m a photo op where he aposll take pictures with all of the new coming republican senators are you going to be there scott i haven apost i haven apost decided where i aposm going to be this week you know we aposre doing you know we aposre going to watch this manual machine recount process so i aposll figure that out in the next few in the next few days but i look forward to going to d c i look forward to being the florida senator and working to make sure this is the better a better place for all of our families like we aposve done in florida wallace governor scott thank you thanks for taking the time to speak with us and you can be sure we aposll stay on top of the recount this week thank you sir scott bye bye wallace coming up we aposll bring back our sunday group to discuss vote count and controversies in several states and president trump says he could revoke press credentials for more reporters our panel weighs in on that commercial break begin video clip trump all of a sudden they aposre finding votes out of nowhere what aposs going on in florida is a disgrace take a look at the total dishonesty of what happened with respect to broward county end video clip wallace president trump blasting election officials counting votes in some parts of florida and we aposre back now with the panel well josh the president aposs raising questions about vote fraud stealing elections and not just in florida he tweeted this just out in arizona signatures don apost match electoral corruption call for a new election we must protect our democracy do you see fraud or just close races holmes well we know they aposre close races i think the question is what more is there i mean you have mark elias ph who aposs the democratic lawyer and went down to florida and said his intent was to go down and have bill nelson win this race he didn apost go down to find an accurate democratic vote count he went down to find the votes enough to win which of course is exactly what mark elias did in minnesota in 2009 for al franken so i can understand skepticism here you have that coupled with the fact that broward county has been is the center of fraud and mismanagement in terms of elections for the last 25 years and they did find 93 000 ballots after election day and i noted with interest in your interview with the governor that he said these laws are in place they just weren apost complied with and i think that and of course what we aposre having in arizona which is a very different set of rules than most of us across the country are accustomed to warrants some skepticism wallace congresswoman harman what do you make of the controversies about now about vote counting in florida and arizona and we haven apost even mentioned it so far but also in georgia in the governor aposs race there and what do you make of the president questioning the legitimacy of these elections harman well i aposve actually seen this movie in 1994 when i was up for my first re election on election night i was down 250 votes with 10 000 uncounted absentee ballots and that count of the absentee ballots took two weeks a supervised account and then i won by 811 wallace so what are you saying that it aposs this is harman so i aposm saying this you know unfortunately is the old and new normal but these counts have to happen every vote has to be counted illegal votes are illegal votes period and i don apost know what lawyer said what you know accordance to this rick scott interview you just did but if a lawyer said that non citizens can vote that aposs inaccurate but my point is every single vote has to happen and we aposll see where it comes out and there aposs still some close races in california this it ain apost over till it aposs over lowry it aposs not normal what happened in broward county i mean you had a judge there saying that the election supervisor was violating the law by not providing timely and transparent updates about the count and she actually missed mixed as a matter of fact mixed improper votes with proper votes in one of these counts so she is horribly incompetent at best and ron desantis who will be the next governor of florida should fire her at the first opportunity harf but that aposs not evidence of fraud and i think you pressed rick scott on that he could not give you one piece of hard evidence of fraud lowry but it under it undermines the credibility of the process and the reason why the rule is there is to create credibility and she went out of her way to ignore and defy the rule wallace well i all right i aposm going to cut this off because we have a couple of minutes left and i want to turn to another story this week and that was the infamous confrontation between jim acosta and president trump here was the president talking about this on friday begin video clip trump i think jim acosta is a very unprofessional man i think he does this with everybody he gets paid to do that and he question inaudible trump wait wait david do you mind if i answer the question and as far as i aposm concerned i haven apost made that decision but it could be others also end video clip wallace marie the question in case you couldn apost hear it is might you remove from other people and how long are you going to keep jim acosta in the penalty box marie you dealt with the press you had a similar kind of job you weren apost the president but you were a spokesperson for the state department during your years in those briefings did you ever see any reporter behave the way that acosta did and what do you think of the way that the white house handled it harf i think that reporters are trying to figure out they aposve been trying to figure out how to cover president trump for a long time and if they aposre changing some of their tactics i think that aposs in response to a president who behaves like no politician we aposve ever seen if we had behaved like that we probably would have gotten a similar response from the press i hate the president aposs war with the media i always have but this week it really took a different turn i think this is much more serious when you revoke the hard pass the press credential for the white house of a major reporter of a major news outlet accuse him of assaulting a woman which is such an incentive claim when he clearly did not do that chris wallace you didn apost see him i mean if you look at the tape he clearly is batting her arm away because she aposs trying to grab the microphone after he aposs asked about four questions and you don apost have a problem with the way acosta was behaving there harf honestly chris i don apost i know a lot of people don apost i aposm going to get a lot of criticism for this donald trump is combative he calls the press terrible names he called them losers he calls them liars and yes he was being combative wallace and you and you don apost and you don apost think that the press is misbehaving in some cases harf in some cases but the way the president has responded is so beneath the office he holds and the way he is cracking down on reporters the names he calls them the accusations he levels against them lowry you know you know who loved every minute of that press conference every single reporter in the room they were begging him to keep going they were begging him to do more of these kind of events it was utterly transfixing and it aposs one reason republicans have a problem in the suburbs he acts that way but it aposs also it shows just what a dominant figure he is and there aposs still a good chance he can overall beat any democratic opponent in 2020 wallace and just in like 20 seconds what about pulling the hard pass is that lowry he shouldn apost do it on principle the president shouldn apost be deciding who covers him and then it backfires because it just makes martyrs of these reporters harman and it emboldens other countries leaders to pull credentials from their press and there is no free press in most of the most parts of the world wallace thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the last surviving marine from world war ii to receive the medal of honor on his latest mission you won apost want to miss this commercial break wallace as we said at the top of the hour this is veterans day when we honor the millions of men and women who have defended our freedom while they all deserve our respect and thanks i think you will join us in paying tribute to one very special veteran here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape hershel woody williams medal of honor recipient i know we aposre classified as a hero very often but i keep saying i aposm not the hero the heroes didn apost get home wallace voice over meet hershel woody williams the only marine from world war ii to receive the medal of honor who is still living i had the good fortune to meet woody at a town hall at the naval academy this fall where he told the brigade of midshipmen about fighting in the battle of iwo jima wallace on camera do you feel any sense of fear in that moment williams i aposve always said if you aposre being shot at and you have no fear there something wrong with you unidentified male the iwo jima invasion brought on one of the bitterest of battles wallace voice over over four hours under heavy enemy fire he took out a network of japanese pill boxes with a flamethrower to clear the way for the infantry wallace on camera aren apost they spraying bullets at you williams oh yes yes absolutely they aposre trying their best to get me why they didn apost get me i have no answer except i was he wasn apost ready for me i guess wallace voice over president truman gave woody the nation aposs highest military honor for valor but that aposs where this story begins not ends woody spent 33 years working at the va securing benefits for veterans and their families and in 2010 he started a foundation to honor gold star families who have lost a loved one in battle williams we aposve gotten inaudible for veterans all over this country and most community but do we have anything that pays tribute to those families who sacrificed one of their own no we don apost wllace the williams foundation has helped communities put up 44 monuments to those families across the country with plans to build them in all 50 states williams these monuments gathered these gold star families together and they become friends for the very first time many of them will say to me i thought i was alone now they aposre together unidentified male it aposs about the gold star families and those survivors that they have somewhere they can go and remember the name of their loved one williams i get tired but then the cause is so great i can apost refuse to do it wallace woody is now 95 years old but he aposs on the road 200 days a year and folks are giving him new honors this year he flipped the coin at the super bowl in the navy launched a ship named for him williams it was like a dream that you never have but then all of a sudden it really is a reality that you never thought could possibly happen in your lifetime wallace but woody williams has one final mission in world war i mothers with a son in the service would put a flag with a blue star in the window and if the sun should be killed in action they would paste a gold star over the blue williams i aposd like to see it today i aposd like to see these one of these on every home that has somebody serving in our armed forces i think it would do something for their c
