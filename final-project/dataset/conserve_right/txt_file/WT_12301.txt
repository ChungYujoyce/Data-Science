intelligence operations in the inner regions of china including arming and directing guerrilla bands to fight the japanese as far fetched as that might sound such is exactly what happened in world war ii in what was one of the best kept secrets of the war although several books have been published about the rice paddy navy linda kush s book is the most thorough exploration of the work of an extraordinary joint venture the sino american cooperative organization saco top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey two conflicts were being waged in china in the 1940s the struggle against japanese invaders and the civil war between communist insurgents and the government of chiang kai shek the driving force behind saco was comdr milton mary miles who had served for eight years in china in the 1920s and 1930s on river parole boats his feminine nickname was bestowed on him by annapolis classmates a takeoff on the name of the popular silent screen actress mary miles minter as war threatened he and other veterans talked regularly about the need for naval intelligence activity in china the navy s primary concern was obtaining weather reports the united states had no weather monitoring west of hawaii the japanese conversely had weather stations from mongolia to indonesia prevailing winds out of asia blew from west to east a storm in china meant heavy waves in the pacific the next day or so ordered to china during the first weeks of the war miles realized that he must enlist the support of chiang s spymaster gen dai li who was perhaps the second most powerful figure in the government however miles was taken aback when he read reports on dai from the u s embassy he was billed the himmler of china through an estimated 300 000 agents in southeast asia he ruthlessly protected chiang kai shek s political military and governing interest executing and imprisoning chiang s enemies through a gestapo like organization known as the blue shirts according to the state department dispatches he even ordered the execution of his own mother twice a false claim as it turned out miles read these reports with a cocked eyebrow he knew that many embassy officers were reflexively anti chiang and he decided to make his own judgment when he met dai in person miles made another important decision at the outset he would not recruit any old china hands the western businessmen and government bureaucrats who had embarrassed him with their patronizing behavior during his china service the chinese painted these persons with a broad bush as exploitative racists at their first meeting dai greeted miles with a penetrating smile and a broad gold toothed grin as they chatted miles searched for signs of the sinister character described in the state department files he found none dai readily agreed to miles plan to set up weather stations send radio transmissions and help train guerrillas moreover dai said he would provide operating bases an embassy officer watched in awe as he cabled washington commander miles has gotten off to a flying start and has been taken entirely into the confidence of the chinese secret service he has seen and done things i never thought any foreigner would be able to do in due course the sino american cooperative organization had nearly 3 000 american servicemen mainly sailors with a few marines and soldiers in its work there was also 97 000 organized chinese guerrillas and another 20 000 individualists pirates and lone wolf saboteurs the main training school dubbed happy valley graduated classes of several hundred chinese fighters every two months in addition to weather reporting saco intercepted and cracked japanese codes blew up japanese supply dumps destroyed bridges and sank scores of enemy vessels in a post war history saco claimed the felling of some 26 000 japanese while losing only five of its own men miles did have many problems foremost was the fact that his contingent was utterly dependent on the army and its air corps for supplies which had to be flown in via india a more serious challenge was posed by gen william donovan and his office of strategic services designated as the primary intelligence and special operations command during the war donovan badly wanted to get into china to the extent he decided to bypass chiang and dai li and send ad hoc teams into the country unlike miles donovan relied heavily on old china hands including r v starr who had wide commercial holdings in china in insurance and publishing the chinese of course were infuriated when questioned by miles donovan said his men were in china on personal business a mighty row ensued at a meeting in dai s home donovan repeated that oss was going to operate in china whether dai liked it or not the party deteriorated into a shouting match during which dai threatened to kill any unauthorized oss agents in china and donovan threatened to retaliate by killing nationalist chinese generals tit for tat when donovan appealed to chiang the next day the generalissimo replied that china could no more tolerate an unauthorized american intelligence operations in china than the americans would accept the same from the chinese in the united states in the end after a bureaucratic war too complex to summarize here oss and saco tacitly agreed to go their separate ways and donovan had to do his work without any cooperation from the chinese miles retired as a vice admiral on his 60th birthday chiang sent him a scroll reading two men in the same boat help each other
