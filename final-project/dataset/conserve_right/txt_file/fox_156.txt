a rush transcript from fox news sunday august 5 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace the president and his administration send mixed signals on the election threat from russia begin videotape chris wray fbi director russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day kirstjen nielsen homeland security secretary our democracy itself is in the crosshairs wallace but while top national security officials condemn russian modeling the president defends his meeting with vladimir putin president donald trump i had a great meeting with putin we discussed everything now we are being hindered by the russian hoax it aposs a hoax wallace we aposll discuss the apparent disconnect with the president aposs national security adviser john bolton and with marco rubio a top member of the senate and intelligence and foreign relations committees bolton and rubio only on fox news sunday then a federal judge blocks a texas activist from putting blueprints online to make plastic guns on 3d printers cody wilson joins us to explain why he thinks it aposs a good idea plus just hours after this ivanka trump first daughter i do not feel that the media is the enemy of the people wallace president trump bashes journalists again president trump whatever happened to fair press whatever happened to honest reporters they don apost report it they only make up stories wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the trump family divide all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington while top national security officials say the threat from russian meddling in the upcoming midterms is real president trump keeps calling it a hoax it aposs just one of several issues along with north korea and iran where the president aposs statements appear at odds with the rest of his administration in a moment i aposll talk about the seeming disconnect with the president aposs national security adviser john bolton but first let aposs bring in kristin fisher in columbus ohio where president trump held another of his highly charged rallies last night kristin kristin fisher fox news well chris this was president trump aposs second campaign rally since five of his top national security officials stood side by side sounding the alarm that russia is continuing to try to interfere in our elections and yet at both rallies president trump did not back them up begin videotape trump we got to stop meddling we got to stop everybody from attacking us but there are a lot russia is there china is there fisher president trump once again refusing to place the blame squarely on russia but he had no problem taking china to task for smacking u s farmers with retaliatory tariffs trump china is targeting the american farmer because china is smart and they know the american farmers love donald trump and they say what can we do to stop donald trump fisher the retaliatory tariffs are hitting one of the president aposs key constituencies prompting a 12 billion bailout for farmers the president aposs lengthy defense of his tariffs inside a sweltering high school gymnasium made clear he is feeling the heat trump so much for my brand new beautiful suit fisher the president and republicans are also feeling the heat heading into tuesday special election for ohio aposs 12th congressional district it aposs why president trump came to this reliably republican district to rally his supporters around troy balderson who aposs locked in a tight race with democrat danny o aposconnor trump a vote for danny boy and the democrats is about to let criminals and drugs pour into our country and to let ms 13 run wild in our communities end videotape fisher and that is exactly what we can expect more of heading into the midterms this is president trump aposs third campaign rally this week and that pace is only expected to accelerate chris wallace kristin fisher reporting from columbus ohio kristin thanks for that joining me now the president aposs national security adviser john bolton and ambassador welcome back to fox news sunday john bolton national security adviser glad to be with you wallace let aposs begin with breaking news what leftist venezuelan president is calling an assassination attempt against him yesterday let aposs put up this video pretty striking the president president maduro speaking at a military event when drones loaded with explosives exploded you can see security protecting him with ballistic blankets and military it was a national guard event at the event in caracas begin the stampede question did the u s play any role and what aposs our reaction to what he was calling an assassination attempt bolton well i can say unequivocally there is no u s government involvement in this at all just within the past couple of hours i have spoken with our charge in caracas the head diplomatic official down there he and his staff were up much of the night making sure that americans in venezuela were safe as of now we think everybody notice to the embassy is in a secure position they aposre going to will evaluate conditions today but they focused on that principle responsibility and as of now feel pretty confident that americans are accounted for now with respect to what happened last afternoon look it could be a lot of things from a pretext set up by the maduro regime itself or something else he aposs made accusations accusing the outgoing president of columbia responsibility what he calls the extreme right wing in venezuela that means the vast opposition to his authoritarian role and he aposs blamed unnamed fancers ph in the united states these are things he has said before and you have to take them for what they are worth if the government of venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of u s criminal law we aposll take a serious look at it but in the meantime i think what we really should focus on is the corruption and the oppression of the maduro regime in venezuela wallace let aposs turn to the apparent i suspect you aposll challenge this the apparent disconnect between what trump administration officials are saying about russian meddling in 2016 and in 2018 and what president trump is saying about it here aposs how dhs secretary nielsen described the threat this week and on the president just hours later begin video clips nielsen our democracy itself is in the cross hairs trump i had a great meeting with putin we discussed everything i had a great meeting now we are being hindered by the russian hoax it aposs a hoax ok end video clips wallace so ambassador which is it is russian meddling a threat to our democracy or is it a hoax bolton look i know that there aposs this narrative in the press that there aposs a distinction between the president and the rest of his administration you know i got to know eugene mccarthy the late democratic senator very well he was a client of mine in buckley against valeo he aposs an iconoclastic guy he used to describe the press as a group of birds sitting on a telephone wire one would fly off and then they aposd all fly off that aposs what this narrative i think it is all about the president knew exactly what was going to be said at that press briefing on thursday he aposs the one who directed it be held it came as the result of a national security council meeting we had held the friday before where the heads of the operating agencies and departments before who attended the press briefing on thursday and others told the president what it was doing he felt it was important that the american people hear directly from the people responsible for election security at the federal level hear what they were up to at least in a non classified environment so that aposs why we had the briefing crosstalk wallace because they are saying this is a clear and present danger that russia did it in 2016 they are continuing to do it now you have the secretary of homeland security with her hair on fire saying our democracy is in the crosshairs and then you have president trump saying we are being hindered by the russian hoax that aposs not the press making that up that aposs anybody who looks at it has got to see a difference there bolton i think what he aposs saying by the hoax is the idea that somehow the russians directed and controlled his campaign or direct and control his administration that there was some conspiracy or some violation of u s law in 2016 crosstalk wallace mueller is also investigating ph russian meddling he aposs handed down an indictment of 12 military intelligence officers of the gru bolton and there aposs no question that that aposs going on that aposs what everybody said on thursday wallace so that aposs the hoax bolton the hoax is the idea that the trump campaign was a beneficiary of a concerted effort together with the russians to affect the 2016 election as to that i don apost think there aposs any evidence publicly but everybody who participated in the press conference thursday agreed as has the president on several public occasions that the intelligence community assessment of russian meddling in 2016 is valid wallace but one of the most powerful ways that mr trump can try to prevent any meddling in the 2018 election is to stand up in public and call out vladimir putin and say knock it off i want to go back to helsinki and to the joint summit news conference there begin video clip trump i have great confidence in my intelligence people but i will tell you that president putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today end video clip wallace i know you say that it was the first issue election meddling that president trump brought up with putin in their one on one meeting but why not stand there right along side putin with the whole world watching and say we are not going to stand for anymore meddling bolton well as the president said he misspoke the subsequent point in the press conference and that he intended to say just that he had a statement issued the next day that i think made clear where he stood on the issue and as i say you can apost read any motive into what he did other than his deep concern about russian election meddling than to put the four operating heads and myself out for that press briefing the whole point of that was to show what his administration was doing to counter russian meddling and other broader influence operations wallace but in kristin fisher aposs piece about the rally last night he talks about meddling and he said there was a lot of people involved there was russia there was china there was north korea no there wasn apost it was russia that was interfering that aposs what everybody aposs been focusing on that aposs what you focused on in your briefing bolton right there aposs no question that russia was the principal violator in 2016 and that their activity this year puts them in the lead although as people said activity so far at least is down from 2016 but it does not exclude the potential for others to meddle and the broader issue that i think fbi director christopher wray talked about in particular of influence efforts that go beyond the specifics of a particular election i think that aposs very troubling too and something we need more focus on wallace i you talked about the media and the idea that they all jump off the telephone line at this electric bolton not every one of them but a lot of them wallace but a lot of them do it at the same time in a much more direct way the president critiqued the media and i want to put up his tweet he aposs been on something of a twitter tear today and this is one of them the fake news hates me saying that they are the enemy of the people only because they know it aposs true i am providing a great service by explaining this to the american people they purposely cause great division and distrust they can also cause war they are very dangerous and sick ambassador what wars have we started bolton look i think the issue of press bias has been around for a long long time as a boy i supported barry goldwater in 1964 i thought the press was biased against him i don apost think it aposs changed much since then wallace i absolutely agreed there is press bias people you know people get stories wrong and people are called out for it and we should be called out if we make a mistake cause war sick divisive this is taking it to a completely different level bolton well that aposs the president aposs view based on the attacks that the media made on him there aposve been other administrations that have been highly critical of the press as well you go back i remember john kennedy cutting off the white house subscription to the new york times wallace it was the herald tribune but close bolton sorry close enough i was much younger what can i say but i think this kind of adversarial relationship is difficult wallace ok north korea this week we learned that north korea continues to produce plutonium continues to build new missiles there are reports that north korea is violating the sanctions by ship to ship transfers they aposve done it it aposs increasing that china and russia are stepping up their efforts to ease around the sanctions at what point does the trump administration say that kim is playing us that he isn apost serious about denuclearization and basically call him on this bolton yes well that point may well come as i aposve said to you and others before there aposs nobody in his administration starry eyed about the prospects of north korea actually denuclearizing but i think what aposs going on now is that the president is giving kim jong un on a master class and how to hold a door open for somebody and if the north koreans can apost figure out how to walk through it even the president aposs fiercest critics will not be able to say it aposs because he didn apost open it wide enough we are going to have to see a performance from the north koreans there aposs no question about it wallace how soon though i mean there aposs talk in his exchange of letters they are discussing another summit bolton well they are talking about in the exchange of letters what is necessary to get performance on the commitment that north korea itself made in singapore to denuclearize that aposs the central issue for us there aposs a lot of interest in inter korean negotiations they are looking at further discussions there that aposs important to them that aposs not our priority though our priority is north korean denuclearization kim jong un promised south korean president moon jae in at panmunjom on april 27th that he would do it and that he would do it within a year so the focus here is getting kim jong un to follow through on what he committed to the president at singapore wallace so you aposre willing to leave the door open for a year and that it shuts bolton no the year period there aposs been a lot of discussion about where the idea of finishing this in a year comes from it comes from kim jong un that if they make a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons they can do it within a year we are waiting to see evidence that in fact that strategic decision has been made wallace have you seen evidence of that strategic bolton unfortunately i can apost talk about intelligence whether it aposs leaked into the news media or not i aposll just say the president is doing everything he can beginning with the film that he showed to kim jong un in singapore about what the future can be if north korea denuclearizes he aposs doing the best salesman job he can on that point wallace we aposre still a long way away from building condos on beaches in north korea i have one last question i aposve got a minute bolton i don apost want a condo on a beach in north korea under any circumstances laughter wallace that makes two of us i got one minute left remember your training here in tv we seem to be starting an escalating trade war with china i want to put these up on the screen we aposve imposed or scheduled tariffs on 50 billion of chinese goods they have retaliated now we are talking about 25 percent tariffs on 200 billion more in chinese exports and they are threatening tariffs on another 60 billion of u s products here aposs white house economic adviser larry kudlow begin video clip larry kudlow white house economic adviser the president is impatient you know so he has said to our team take a look take a look at raising the tariff on the last 200 from 10 to 25 take a look inaudible he aposs impatient end video clip wallace how far is president trump prepared to go here in his standoff with china and if chinese president xi doesn apost blink doesn apost back down how long is this could this go on bolton well i think as larry is saying don apost underestimate president trump aposs resolve here and the reason he aposs so resolved is that for decades china has been the principal malefactor trying to use free trade aspiration most of the rest of the world has to pursue mercantilist goals it steals american and european intellectual property it engages crosstalk wallace how far are you prepared to take this bolton far enough to get china to change its behavior and they need to understand that wallace and if they don apost change their behavior bolton i think the pressure will continue i think the president has made that very clear wallace ambassador bolton thank you thanks for your time always good to talk with you sir bolton glad to be with you wallace when we come back senator marco rubio joins us exclusively to talk about his push to hit russia if they meddle in our midterms as well as his plan for paid family leave and a little later should blueprints to make a plastic gun in your own home be available online the debate over these homemade firearms and free speech that aposs all coming up commercial break wallace president trump aposs off the cuff statements about russia north korea and iran stand in contrast to the rest of his administration and much of the republican party we want to discuss that with senator marco rubio a key member of the senate foreign relations and intelligence committees senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen marco rubio r fla thank you thanks for having me back wallace you are trying to get the senate to pass what you call the deter act which would invoke automatic sanctions against russia or any country that interferes with u s elections here aposs what some top intel officials of the trump administration said this week begin video clips christopher wray fbi director russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day dan coats director of national intelligence it aposs pervasive is ongoing with the intent to achieve their intent and that is drive a wedge and undermine our democratic values end video clips wallace senator if you can get congress to pass your legislation given what we just heard there should sanctions be imposed on russia right now rubio well there aposs always calls for sanctions against vladimir putin aposs government because of their consistent and ongoing violations of human rights and the likes and there have already been sanctions in place and to their credit this administration has imposed tough sanctions already for what happened in 2016 but what we aposre hoping to do is deter future activity in essence create a situation where vladimir putin has to weigh the cost and the benefits we aposre going to show him what the costs are by detailing them ahead and then when he weighs the cost and the benefits of taking similar action in 2018 hopefully he aposll determine the costs are too high compared to the benefits i can apost guarantee that but i can guarantee if we don apost do something he will interfere again in multiple ways because right now the costs are too unpredictable and too low wallace well one interesting aspect of your legislation as that it would under the bill it aposs the director of national intelligence not the president who would certify that interference had taken place given all the president aposs talk about the russia hoax don apost you trust him to call out kremlin meddling rubio i do especially if it happens in 2018 i think and that aposs part of the bill that we aposll probably have to rework in some way there aposs some concern about it because we want to pass a bill and so our the important thing we want to do is create an automatic way for sanctions to kick in now there probably is going to have to be an addition of a presidential waiver like all sanctions bill have and the like the dni will still play a key role that aposs the way we crafted it but i know my the partner i aposm working with on this senator van hollen a democrat and i are willing to make reasonable changes to the bill that allows us to pass it and that aposs probably one of those that we heard a little bit of pushback on we want to get something done and we are willing to do whatever it takes to pass a law that has real sanctions that will deter but at the same time can pass the house pass the senate and will be signed into law by the white house wallace president trump this week tweeted this about the russia investigation i want to put it up on the screen attorney general jeff sessions should stop this rigged witch hunt right now before it continues to stain our country any further afterwards you said that special counsel robert mueller should be allowed to finish his work and all the truth should come out in pursuit of that truth should president trump sit down with a special counsel to answer any questions about russian collusion about obstruction of justice and what if he refuses in a special counsel gets a subpoena rubio well the second question is really for the president aposs lawyers i aposm not in a position to give legal advice to the president about what the right thing to do or not do in those circumstances but let me talk about the first part of it and that is the president look this is no mystery ok he believed strongly he says he knows for a fact obviously that he did not collude with the russians and he thinks this investigation that mueller is conducting is solely about collusion and that aposs how he feels very strongly about that my position based on everything i know about this case is the following i believe it aposs in the best interest of the president and of the united states of america and the american people for that investigation to run the course for all the truth to come out and for i think it aposs the best thing that could happen for him and i think it aposs the best thing that could happen for the country obviously he is annoyed by that investigation continuing to go on because it aposs about him and he believes and has said repeatedly and emphatically that he did not collude with the russians i aposm limited to what i can say because the senate is still doing our investigation but i am comfortable in saying this if there was evidence strong evidence of collusion i guarantee it would have been leaked by now but let aposs wait for the process to play itself out and i think that aposs what should happen mueller should continue he should finish his work and the truth should come out and i think that aposs in the best interest of everyone including the president wallace but as part of that process and you say the best interest of the president and the country should he sit down and answer all questions rubio well it aposs easy to say that from a political realm but that aposs not an interview it aposs an interview with a law enforcement official with a special prosecutor and there are plenty of people who are innocent whose lawyers would tell them do not sit down and answer questions from a prosecutor because there aposs all sorts of other problems involved with that that aposs a decision for the president to make alongside with his attorney it aposs my understanding from what i aposve read in the press that he wants to do it it aposs attorneys who have questions about that but there are plenty of innocent people whose lawyers tell them do not sit down with a prosecutor and answer questions so i don apost want to prejudge this or somehow imply that by not sitting down he aposs guilty of something wallace let aposs turn to north korea do you think that the kim regime is playing president trump do you think they have any intention of giving up their nuclear and missile arsenal rubio well i aposm about to tell you i aposm wrong about but i do not believe that he is ever going to give up his nuclear arsenal what i do believe he will do is a series of unilateral concessions that do not undermine his capabilities in the long term for example i think he aposs more than willing to tear apart facilities that are no longer necessary for old muscles because he aposs got newer ones that work better i believe he has undisclosed sites that he thinks he can shield from the world i believe that he believes that even if he gets rid of some of the thing new enrichment capabilities he already has existing weapons and existing enriched capabilities that he can hide from the rest from the world and every single time that he does one of these productions he is engendering goodwill internationally which is ultimately his goal to undermine international support for sanctions by arguing look at all these things i aposm doing the americans are not reciprocating and undermining sanctions at the u n and internationally that aposs his goal in my opinion wallace well senator rubio and i hope i aposm wrong wallace well senator let me ask you about that because it appears to be working we understand that north korea is violating the sanctions by doing ship to ship transfers we now hear that russia is doing business with north korea that they are bringing thousands of more guest workers into the country or in effect slaves who send money back to the regime i mean isn apost kim succeeding in lowering the temperature breaking apart the alliance of sanctions and president trump is being played rubio well neither one of those two things are new the laborers to russia has been going on the whole time the ship to ship transfer is the only way they aposve been able to evade i think what we need to be very careful about is undermining for example any split between us and south korea they aposre going to try to exploit it i think the chinese are trying to drag this out the chinese would love for this to be a step by step process that drags out i think their biggest concern initially was that we would cut a deal with them directly i don apost know if the president is being played i think he aposs hoping for the best but prepared for the worst the sanctions remained in place we haven apost changed a single sanction on north korea i think what they need to be more cautious about is we need to continue to engage our partners around the world so that they are fully aware of what aposs actually happening in north korea and what isn apost happening what aposs real and what isn apost real that aposs what i aposd be very cautious about i don apost have any concerns about anything they aposve done so far wallace i want to ask you about one of your other big issues and that is you have introduced legislation to create paid family leave you would take the money that would go to the parents of newborn children from social security payments they would get later on democrats say one the benefit is too small two it shouldn apost come out of retirement payments and third they say that most people take family leave for illnesses either their own or family members they don apost take it for childbirth and in fact ivanka trump who aposs a big supporter of paid family leave said there aposs no chance this is going to happen in this congress rubio well we got nothing is going to happen in this congress other than the bills that are already stacked up and ready to go this congress ends in six months five months and we have elections in between this is a big issue it aposs a revolutionary idea and it aposs going to take time to pass now here aposs what it does it aposs very simple to understand number one it aposs an option you don apost have to do this number two the benefit is comparable to what you aposre going to get in the private sector in terms of paid family leave for the birth of a child and number three the concept is this if you choose to take paid family leave at least six weeks up to 12 weeks you can take you can decide that some of your retirement benefits from your money and social security you can advance it and take it now instead of later a portion of it it aposs up to you it aposs a choice you have it aposs an option you have for the 85 percent of americans that today have no options at all other than to skip paychecks how many people can afford to skip one paycheck not to mention four or five or six after the birth of a child wallace senator rubio thank you thanks for joining us rubio thank you wallace please come back sir rubio we will thank you so much wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs escalating attacks on the media the face off with reporters gets even more heated plus what would you like to ask the panel about the president aposs threat to shut down the government before the midterm elections over funding for his border wall just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the latest battle over gun control and this one aposs in 3 d begin video clip sen ed markey d mass a 3 d printer cartridge has become as deadly as a gun cartridge end video clip wallace we aposll talk with the man behind the push to publish gun blueprints online next commercial break begin video clip pres i aposm a little torn myself i would personally prefer before but it whether it aposs before or after we aposre either getting it or we aposre closing down government we need border security sen lindsey graham r s c it would be bad politics for the republican party to shut the government down we aposd get blamed end video clip wallace senator lindsey graham warning president trump not to shut down the government over immigration issues ahead of the november midterms and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove philippe reines former senior adviser to hillary clinton susan page of usa today and jason riley from the wall street journal well karl simple question would shutting down the government over the wall and immigration issues helped or hurt republicans in the midterms karl rove fox news contributor hurt the republicans they aposre seen as being in charge of the government and they aposve got the presidency the senate and the house and if they can apost get their act together regardless of how strong the president describes the culprits as being the democrats it will hurt the republicans remember one thing the president aposs approval is 46 51 in the latest fox poll his approval in that poll on immigration is 43 55 he aposs worse in immigration among the americans than his overall approval rating wallace so don apost push immigration rove well don apost shut down the government over immigration shut down if you want to shut down the government shut down the government over the economy where he aposs actually seen as doing the right thing but people don apost believe particularly when it comes to the wall that it aposs that it aposs the right thing the wall the wall is the the weakest border security is great you aposll notice he has stopped talking about the wall and he aposs talking about border security because even inside the white house they figured out the wall is not as popular as border security wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of a possible shutdown we got this on twitter from independent02 if potus the president shutdown the government how is he going to get his scotus supreme court picked confirmed and should the republicans be blamed if potus does this philippe how do you answer independent02 philippe reines former hillary clinton senior adviser well as my insider knowledge of the gop i mean i think this is another example of the president posing a bigger problem to his own party than the democrats who most of the time are just innocent bystanders to this i don apost know what he gets out of it but i don apost think he cares what he gets out of it you have i don apost think he really cares what happens in november of 2018 wallace well come on wait wait wait of course he does i mean he reines i don apost think he does frankly wallace he knows what happens to his agenda if he loses the house reines i think he knows that he gets to run against the house in 2020 i think he does not fear impeachment it won apost be a problem i don apost think he buys into it as much as maybe karl does or the his republican colleagues in congress do wallace all right i want to switch subjects i know you want to weigh in on this but i aposm going to switch subjects and turn to the presidents bashing in the media i know it aposs always all about us but it seemed to hit critical mass this week i i you just heard my conversation with ambassador bolton in which the president says the fake media can cause wars they aposre sick divisive we also had this fascinating contradiction this week between ivanka trump who spoke about the fake media and then president trump just hours later take a look begin video clip ivanka trump i have some sensitivity around why people have concerns and and gripe especially when they aposre sort of feel targeted but no i do not feel that the media is the enemy of the people trump they can make anything bad because they are the fake fake disgusting news end video clip wallace and susan there was also that moment in the white house briefing room this week where cnn reporter jim acosta some will say that he was grandstanding i kind of agree with that but he challenged sarah sanders the press spokeswoman to declare that the press the media are not the enemy of the people and she refused susan page usa today you know i care more about what the president says then i care about what the press secretary says and for the you know mr bolton in your interview said that an adversarial relationship with the white house is is common with the press and having covered six white houses that is true no white house really likes the press but the rhetoric that the president is using enemy of the people this is a phrase from stalin is chilling and unprecedented in modern times it does not recognize the role that the founders saw for a free and vigorous press to be to hold officials accountable and to be the friend of the american people and i think it aposs i think it aposs enormously serious wallace and jason i i let me just ask you a question you had u n officials who were in charge of freedom of expression around the world this week say that these kinds of comments and again i don apost think we aposre talking about criticism of the media we aposre talking about fake news starting wars enemy of the people that undermines the role of a free press around the world to hold governments accountable jason riley the wall street journal ivanka trump is right the press is not the enemy of the people and and and you aposre right that this some of this what what this rhetoric coming out of the white house is unprecedented but so is some of the behavior of the media these days media that is supposed to be covering this white house objectively and is behaving much more like political activists than they are like objective journalists this too i think has reached a new low in terms of the press behavior and when that happens i do believe that the press deserves to be called out here the press should not be the story the story should be what making sure that the voters are informed and and too often these days the press is making themselves the story wallace but the president wait wait but the president does make the president does well wait a minute the president makes them a story riley and that aposs this adversarial relationship that i think all administrations have the problem here is that the press too often takes the bait and and we get eventually ph cycles wallace well i agree with that riley and this is what we end up talking about and the press loves the press loves talking about the press page that is that is incorrect i as a reporter i do not love talking about the press i wish the press could be in a more traditional role here i think what is happening there are certainly things to criticize about the press there aposs no question about that we ought to be held accountable for our errors but i think what the president is doing is undermining faith in the institutions that stand to challenge him and that would include the press and the inaudible riley ph i think the media wallace let me wait let me let me bring in karl because as a white house official you were i aposm sure you felt the victim of unfair coverage where aposs the line between legitimately criticizing the media for things that as jason points out we do wrong whether it aposs biased reporting and accurate reporting and what the president is doing right now rove look any white house has the right if it disagrees with coverage to be specific and precise in criticizing that coverage if the wall if the new york times has a bad story about the trump administration i don apost i think the administration ought to say we think this is what aposs wrong but look the veracity of these generalized slurs if you will against the press and the frequency of them is disturbing to me i watched the speech and there was i lost track about 18 or 19 times that the president went after the press and every time he did that crowd roared its approval but that crowd represents the hard core trump base this does not help him with his bigger problem back to the the fox poll 46 51 approve twenty eight percent strongly approve those were the people who were screaming their cheers when he said enemy of the people but 41 percent strongly disapprove that aposs why the president aposs numbers are so he is enraging the opposition was simply reinforcing a much smaller base wallace i you were talking before about how maybe losing the midterms would be good would be smart politics or at least not caring is bashing the press smart politics for this president reines absolutely it aposs working for him but that doesn apost mean it aposs right and i think it aposs part of a larger problem that it aposs part of a war on the truth and to be honest with you you know i aposve been on the other side of this i think you know that and susan probably knows that we wallace again we should point out you worked for hillary clinton reines i did and you know the media is not always perfect but you know what you get on the phone you talk about it you don apost call them the enemy of the people my my beef now is the media has to just accept that this is not normal behavior and they have to realize that they are in combat and they have to start acting differently they have to stop broadcasting the daily press briefings live get rid of the soap opera aspect of it the grandstanding they have to use the word lie when he lies et cetera wallace well i disagree with that thank you panel see you next sunday when we come back the debate over 3 d printed guns cody wilson wants americans to have the information to make guns in the privacy of their own homes he joins us next commercial break wallace he aposs been called one of the most dangerous people in the world for his push to put blueprints online to make guns on 3 d printers and now cody wilson is at the center of a legal battle over making that information available to everyone on the internet mr wilson director of defense distributed joins us now from austin texas so simple question why on earth do you think putting these blueprints for plastic guns online is a good idea cody wilson director of defense distributed hey chris so i aposve put the blueprints for all types of guns all technical plans all data all blueprints past and present i put them all online and that aposs the right that i aposve secured it aposs not like i aposm somehow only fascinated by the idea of a printable gun that was just a mere technical demonstration of a much wider possibility of the digital production of firearms which is in no way precluded by current law wallace but as i understand it you say this is your first amendment right you aposre talking about information that you aposre putting online not what happens after people receive that information but i don apost have to tell you that the first amendment is not an absolute right you aposre not allowed to cry fire in a crowded theater courts have have exercised prior restraint to stop people from publishing troop movements in the time of war it aposs not an absolute right cody wilson so chris as the hardest newsman in the game i aposd expect you to not propagate that ignorance right fire in a crowded theater has not been good law for over 40 years that case was replaced the standard is even the most inflammatory speech is protected by the first amendment unless it produces immanently unlawful action right or direct incitement or is likely to produce imminent harm and i mean these these are not the standards like we need to correct the people aposs ignorance here fire in a crowded theater is a pseudo profundity ok the first amendment without questions protects this kind of data lawfully produced it aposs got a cognizant government authority it aposs directly related to another protected right of the people which is their second amendment so speech about another amendment is even more protected than the use of like wallace well well wait wait first of all we don apost know whether it aposs protected because in fact a judge issued a temporary restraining order there aposs going to be a court hearing about this this week and i know you aposre going to you aposre going to be pursuing this here you talk about speech that that incites or creates the opportunity for illegal action here aposs the problem with putting these blueprints about plastic guns on the internet it allows people to create to make guns that are untraceable there aposs no serial number it allows them to make guns that are undetectable they aposre all plastic they could get through a metal detector it also allows people who would be prohibited from having guns whether it aposs someone with a history of mental illness a felon domestic abuse or even a terrorist it allows them to make guns take a look at at at democratic senator ed markey here he is begin video clip markey these downloadable firearms are available even to those who could not pass a background check it aposs the ultimate gun loophole end video clip wallace the nra has supported the law that makes these guns undetectable firearms illegal for 30 years wilson so chris i don apost think ed markey knew you could legally make a gun in the country until last week and i think that aposs part of like what aposs inflammatory to at least the democratic establishment this is also their discovery that it aposs been legal in this country since its founding to make a gun for yourself well i aposm sorry that you just found that out ok but you should have you should have made a law right you aposre congress make a law make it illegal to make guns in this country i aposd like to see that wallace but but but they did made an undetectable firearms act which passed 30 years ago cody wilson right and and look it aposs legal to make a gun if you include all requisite amount of metal in it and chris like this is why i aposm not in jail today right my printable guns have the amount of metal in it you know there are security norms i respect the norms of course maybe even that type of law ultimately couldn apost survive second amendment scrutiny but i aposm not here to argue for for or against our security norms i aposm literally here to argue that what i won in court over five years in the western district of texas was the right and not just singularly but all americans have the right to share data for making firearms on the internet this is not controversial the progressive case the h bomb nuclear nuclear plans these are all protected by the first amendment i aposm sorry that some people are just waking up to the idea that the first amendment protects scientific inquiry that doesn apost advantage what the gun control movement wallace you first put blueprints online in 2013 and it was downloaded almost 100 000 times before you were stopped by the government since you put the blueprint again after a settlement with the federal government online it was downloaded more than 20 000 times to us is this is the genie already out of the bottle is this information already out there and we aposre arguing about something that aposs already happened wilson frankly chris that aposs that aposs the case when these attorneys general came into washington and they your honor he aposs going to release all this stuff august 1 well look in one sense i released it five years ago in another sense i released it july 27th i can apost make a judge read a brief ok but these are apa claims these aren apost gun control act claims these these attorneys general have no standing the judge can apost even review the decision that the state department made so i aposm just sitting here watching all these gun files already online and people arguing about what reality is when we both know that guns are now downloadable and they have been repeatedly demonstrated to be wallace to a certain degree i think you aposre protecting you aposre saying hey i aposm just making the information available i aposm not responsible for what people do once they get the information but the fact is cody there are real world consequences here what if somebody takes your information makes a gun and then goes out and kills someone potentially god forbid kills member of your family would there be do you bear any responsibility do you feel would you feel any remorse wilson so i credit the question as like an honest question i i credit your question is good faith right but i literally believe in the second amendment to the point of that it aposs all right and it should be expected that there will be social costs for protecting a right like this why is the people aposs right to keep and bear arms on the bill of rights why is it even protected because we know that there are downsides and that there are consequences to allowing free people to own the means of self defense i mean of course we should expect and have a mature attitude that bad things can happen wallace but the government has made decisions that for the right best of society certain people should be prevented from having guns and that there should be it should be easier to trace and easier to detect you aposre going around all of that cody wilson oh i disagree with respect i disagree the government has regulated commercial manufacture of arms and the arms and transfer and interstate commerce but the government has never regulated the production of firearms that you aposre allowed to own an american can to this day right now make a gun and there aposs no requirement to put a serial number on it again i aposm sorry that a bunch of politicians woke up to the reality of this just last week but this is the way it aposs always been wallace cody cody wilson thank you thanks for talking with us wilson a pleasure wallace up next our power player of the week the army aposs art collection puts powerful nazi propaganda from world war ii under lock and key commercial break wallace one of the highlights of this job is to get to see historical treasure trove aposs that aren apost open to the public as we told you in february the army opened its doors to show us one of its explosive collections here is our power player of the week begin videotape charles bowery u s army center for military history they used it to enhance in their view sort of the sanctity of the nazi way of life wallace charles bowery is the chief of army history and we met at a huge warehouse at fort belvoir outside washington it holds thousands of pieces of military art and artifacts the battle standard of an african american regiment in the civil war a taliban motorcycle norman rockwell illustrations from world war ii wallace on camera do you ever feel like you aposre in that huge warehouse at the end of indiana jones bowery we make that joke all the time wallace voice over but we were there to see the army aposs stash of nazi propaganda 586 pieces seized during hitler aposs fall and sent back to the u s unidentified male hitler aposs retreat at berchtesgaden the luxurious mountain residence wallace the man in charge of the operation gordon bilky ph who was appointed by president roosevelt wallace on camera why was it so important to remove this art from germany postwar bowery they believed that the presence of these pieces in german society could be essentially a powder keg that could kick off additional incidents of the rise of nazism wallace on camera pieces like this 1937 painting in the beginning was the word bowery the piece is very intentionally titled to mirror the first verse of the book of john in the bible and it very clearly equates adolf hitler with john the baptist wallace on camera it aposs an almost godlike figure and his disciples bowery that aposs correct wallace voice over the army seized another work called the standard bearer bowery it portrays adolf hitler as a medieval night he aposs carrying a nazi flag he aposs mounted on a horse and he is prepared to lead his people into battle wallace on camera now what is the hole there bowery an american soldier up his rifle bayonet and he punched through the eye of hitler as a direct message wallace voice over the army found this huge bust of hitler in the eagles nest unidentified male where the nazi furor held meetings of triumph in the mountains of bavaria wallace a grand hall he used for key meetings bowery the monumental scale of it conveys as personal power and the fact that this was a cult of personality that he led through individual magnetism wallace perhaps most fascinating are these watercolors painted by hitler an aspiring art student and then a soldier in world war i long before his rise to power bowery one of the comments on his early evaluations of his work was that while he was pretty good at depicting buildings and structures he was not so good at depicting human life wallace but chances are you will never get to see any of these works in person the army keeps them locked up in its mammoth storage facility wallace on camera is their concern that some of these pieces could be used as a rallying point for neo nazis here in this country bowery that aposs the heart of the tight control that we maintain ove
