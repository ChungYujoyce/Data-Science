apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic house democrats gained momentum tuesday for the impeachment inquiry when a key figure revised his testimony telling congress that he believed u s military aid to ukraine was linked to an agreement to investigate president trump s democratic political rivals gordon sondland ambassador to the european union made the revelation in a sworn update to testimony he gave last month in the house democrats closed door impeachment inquiry he previously testified that mr trump was clear that there was no quid pro quo for releasing u s military aid but in the update he sent to the committees monday mr sondland said his memory had been refreshed and that he did tell ukrainian officials that they likely needed to give mr trump what he wanted to get u s funds flowing top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century i now recall speaking individually with mr yermak where i said that resumption of u s aid would not likely occur until ukraine provided the public anti corruption statement that we had been discussing for many weeks mr sondland said andriy yermak is a top aide to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky the revised testimony went to the question that is the crux of the impeachment inquiry did mr trump condition u s military aid for ukraine on kyiv s investigation of former vice president joseph r biden a top 2020 democratic presidential hopeful house democrats also released a transcript of testimony by former envoy to ukraine kurt volker who contradicted mr sondland s latest account the dueling transcripts provided ammunition for both sides of the impeachment battle a statement from mr biden s campaign slammed the president for sinking to appalling depths to avoid running against the former vice president rep mark meadows north carolina republican and one of the president s top defenders on capitol hill said this public phase of the inquiry won t bode well for democrats the volker sondland transcripts lay it out donald trump wanted to clean up corruption in ukraine and ensure taxpayer funded aid wasn t going to corrupt causes mr meadows tweeted only d c democrats could spin protecting taxpayer money into an impeachable offense blatant partisanship one version of the ukraine anti corruption statement according to text messages released by the impeachment inquiry would have specifically committed kyiv to investigate mr biden s son hunter who received a lucrative job with a ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president despite having no apparent qualifications or experience in the energy field the statement was also supposed to commit to investigating suspected attempts to meddle in the 2016 u s election mr volker said two diplomats advised against making such specific references despite the wishes of the president s personal attorney rudolph w giuliani to avoid an appearance that ukraine was attempting to intervene in the 2020 election the statement was ultimately shelved and u s military aid flowed anyway mr sondland in his original testimony oct 17 said the opposite he said his conversations with mr trump made clear there was no explicit link he said i want nothing i don t want to give them anything and i don t want anything from them i want zelensky to do the right thing the ambassador said that s what he kept repeating no quid pro quo over and over again mr volker backed the recollection that there was no quid pro quo gordon was repeating here what we all understood he said furthermore mr volker told lawmakers that the idea of an anti corruption statement was abandoned before the ukrainians learned about the delayed aid in a politico article published in late august regarding the aid mr volker said the delay was not significant because there was never an official reason for it and he never doubted it would get to the ukrainians eventually mr sondland in his updated testimony said his memory was refreshed by seeing news accounts of others understandings including that of william taylor another top u s diplomat to ukraine he said he is not sure who suspended the ukraine money and he isn t sure how he learned that mr zelensky needed to commit personally to the investigation mr sondland said he was under the assumption in september that the aid was linked to ukraine s commitments to the investigations that assumption came after mr giuliani made it a condition sometime around may 23 ambassador volker energy secretary rick perry and i understood that satisfying mr giuliani was a condition for scheduling the white house visit mr sondland said the white house seized on that uncertainty saying mr sondland presumed there was a link but cannot say how or why by contrast volker s testimony confirms there could not have been a quid pro quo because the ukrainians did not know about the military aid hold at the time white house press secretary stephanie grisham said she said press reports were making too much of mr sondland s linking aid to the biden investigation no amount of salacious media biased headlines which are clearly designed to influence the narrative change the fact that the president has done nothing wrong she said democratic committee chairmen leading the impeachment inquiry disagreed they said the revised testimony confirms their case against mr trump it is clear from their testimony that in exchange for the statement president trump would award the ukrainian president with a highly coveted white house meeting and later with millions of dollars in critical military aid being withheld ambassador sondland called this changing u s policy toward ukraine a continuum that became ever more insidious over time the chairmen of the oversight and reform committee the foreign affairs committee and permanent select committee on intelligence said in a joint statement house republicans have long complained that the inquiry was an unfair partisan operation they accuse democrats of selectively releasing the transcripts to support their narrative and generate headlines indeed mr volker s testimony gave a different view of events in ukraine he told lawmakers that the idea to have ukrainian leaders issue a statement about corruption and investigations was abandoned even before politico revealed that the military aid had been delayed the article was published on aug 29 which also was after mr trump had his now infamous phone call with mr zelensky the impeachment inquiry stems from that july 25 phone call in which mr trump asked mr zelensky for the favor by looking into accusations of corruption involving mr biden and others a rough transcript of the call does not show a quid pro quo but democrats argue that the threat to withhold aid was understood and part of an ongoing pressure campaign of shadow foreign policy conducted by mr giuliani republicans argue that u s law dictates a president must ensure that aid going to a foreign country isn t diverted to corrupt officials which they say justifies the president s actions public hearings are not expected for another few weeks but the transcripts are returning public attention to claims of wrongdoing the transcripts were part of the democrats moves to open up what has been a secretive impeachment inquiry they simultaneously have scheduled more closed door depositions though administration officials have defied subpoenas this week white house deputy press secretary hogan gidley said past democrat and republican administrations would not be inclined to permit senior advisers to the president to participate in such a ridiculous partisan illegitimate proceeding and neither is this one democrats also sought to add acting chief of staff mick mulvaney to the crowded deposition schedule this week as a firsthand witness to mr trump s and mr giuliani s efforts at least three more officials are slated to testify this week office of management and budget official russell vought top state department lawyer t ulrich brechbuhl and former national security adviser john r bolton none of whom is expected to show up dave boyer and stephen dina
