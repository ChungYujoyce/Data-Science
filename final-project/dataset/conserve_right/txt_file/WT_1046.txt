ion of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic so much for sunlight democrats who spent the past four years challenging suing and eventually impeaching president trump over his refusal to release documents are about to march into the 2020 presidential campaign with a candidate who said friday that he is ok with shielding his own records former vice president joseph r biden said he will not heed calls to have the university of delaware release his senate papers which he donated years ago top stories hogan says maryland can begin testing residents for covid 19 without appointment symptoms n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender he said the speeches position papers and documents from conversations with world leaders amassed over a quarter century on capitol hill could dent his chances of winning the white house and he doesn t want them public they could be really taken out of context mr biden told msnbc on friday the immediate demands for access to the papers stem from allegations by tara reade a former senate staffer who this year publicly revealed an incident in 1993 when she says mr biden pushed her against a wall stuck his hand under her skirt and penetrated her with his fingers ms reade has called on mr biden to release his senate records she said they could shed light on her claim mr biden vehemently denied the allegation in a public statement and said in an interview with msnbc that this never happened still he balked at agreeing to ms reade s request that he release the records mr trump mr biden s opponent in november has faced allegations of sexual misdeeds and has now admitted to knowing about hush payments to silence two women who might have gone public with claims of affairs mr trump also has rebuffed demands to release his tax returns and he faced impeachment for shielding witnesses and official documents from congressional investigators who wanted to probe his interest in having ukraine investigate mr biden mr biden s stonewalling of transparency requests deprives him of the high ground in pointing out mr trump s furtiveness biden s deny and stonewall position guts his core message that he s serious battle tested and an open book said kevin sheridan a republican consultant whatever you think of the charges against him joe biden is violating his own standards of due process and presumption of innocence refusing to release his records only makes him look like a bigger hypocrite mr biden donated more than 1 850 boxes of records to the university of delaware in 2012 when he was vice president the university said it would make the material public two years after mr biden retired from public office he left the vice president s job on jan 20 2017 but the university changed its deadline last year and said it would wait until two years after mr biden left public life we are currently curating the collection a process that we estimate will carry at least into the spring of 2021 spokeswoman andrea boyle said in a statement friday as the curating process is not complete the papers are not yet available to the public and we are not able to identify what documents or files can be found within the collection the records cover mr biden s senate career from 1973 to 2009 for those looking to delve into mr biden s senate years the university tells them to contact the national archives look at the published proceedings of congress or go to c span fear of what could be lurking in old documents is not unwarranted mr biden has had to fend off complaints about his senate friendships with segregationist lawmakers hillary clinton the 2016 democratic presidential nominee spent much of that campaign dealing with revelations from her once secret emails from her time as secretary of state those emails were pried loose by freedom of information act requests just as the primary season was hitting its stride in 2015 the pro trump great america pac is looking to force the university s hand it announced last week that it would file a freedom of information request for the documents to be released because the university is public mr biden said the records at the university do not include any personnel files he said those are at the national archives if a complaint against him exists he said the archives should make it public moe vela who served as director of administration for mr biden called it is a stretch to compare mr trump s lack of transparency with that of his former boss stop with the double standard mr vela said you want him to release documents that have nothing to do with tara reade but you guys aren t demanding the same of donald trump with his tax returns i would be willing to bet that in those tax returns are all kinds of conflicts of interest and problems much greater than joe biden having talked to a president of a foreign country he said he called the biden documents a non story and predicted reporters would be horribly bored and disappointed with the documents even if all of them were released but steve guest a spokesman for the republican national committee said mr biden is covering up his university of delaware documents to save his political future the most transparent thing joe biden did this morning was admit that he is hiding documents so they can t be used against him mr guest said friday stephen dina
