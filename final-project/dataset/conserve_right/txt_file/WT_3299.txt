apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic an emerging voting bloc could swing key states in the november elections vapers anti regulatory advocates at americans for tax reform think the vaping voting bloc will be larger than donald trump s 2016 margin of victory in the battleground states that handed him the electoral college win four out of five electronic cigarette users or vapers said they are likely to decide their vote this year based on candidates positions on vaping according to polling conducted in october by mclaughlin associates for americans for tax reform nearly 4 700 vapers in 17 states were surveyed and the group s paul blair identified the battleground states of michigan florida pennsylvania and wisconsin as places where vapers could determine the final result

lago club in palm beach florida where he and his family are spending the holidays on several afternoons demonstrators hoisted placards reading stop the flavor ban and don t ban my vape while others wore we vape we vote t shirts still mr trump said the federal government would soon announce a strategy to crack down on underage vaping that would entail nixing certain flavors for a time we re going to protect our families we re going to protect our children and we re going to protect the industry mr trump said tuesday look vaping can be good from the standpoint you look at the e cigarettes you stop smoking if you can stop smoking that s a big advantage so we think we re going to get it back on the market very very quickly he added with a ban expected for e cigarettes on all flavors except menthol and tobacco albeit temporary the president could be playing with electoral fire you can discount the people that don t vote and you can discount the adult vapers that maybe vote on other issues or don t care about this mr blair said but based on polling that we did in 2016 and that john mclaughlin trump s campaign pollster did in october three out of four of these voters will be less likely to vote for the president if he does a flavor ban or a ban on these products mr blair pointed to the wisconsin senate race in 2016 as an indicator of a contest in which vapers flexed their political muscle and as evidence of a larger trend that could spread nationwide sen ron johnson a republican was an outspoken advocate for vapers on the campaign trail en route to defeating democratic incumbent russell d feingold mr blair said he thinks the lessons learned in wisconsin will apply elsewhere this year there are more than 200 000 adult vapers in wisconsin in 2016 and ron johnson outperformed donald trump by 70 000 votes and won by nearly 100 000 votes after not a single poll showed ron johnson winning the entire year mr blair said every single vape shop across wisconsin was motivated and engaged and politically active to get ron johnson elected mr trump risked alienating those voters last year when he considered an outright ban on e cigarettes and a ban on flavored e cigarettes after indicating he shared public health concerns associated with the product mr trump reversed course after campaign manager brad parscale reportedly privately warned him that the issue could backfire with many voters in his corner precisely what the trump administration s posture toward vapers will be in november remains to be determined but supporters of additional regulations on e cigarettes are hopeful they can sway mr trump vaping opponents do not share americans for tax reform s belief that addressing public health concerns about vaping would irreparably harm mr trump s reelection chances among the groups advocating for regulations are the american heart association the american lung association the american cancer society cancer action network the american academy

the campaign for tobacco free kids told the washington times this is a new issue mr myers said in the decades i ve worked on tobacco related issues i ve never seen such fervor and anxiety among parents of all political persuasions about what s happening anything short of tackling the problem of flavored e cigarettes that have fueled the epidemic will both fail from a public health standpoint and harm the politician who takes that position more than 25 of high school seniors said they had vaped nicotine or marijuana in the past month the annual monitoring the future survey from the national institute for drug abuse found in december mr blair however believes new regulation of e cigarettes could affect the persuasions of voters whose primary issue is the economy mr blair said one of the biggest obstacles on the horizon before the elections involves a may deadline for manufacturers of e cigarettes to apply with the u s food and drug administration to remain operable and avoid enforcement mr blair estimated that changes to the industry could place some 150 000 jobs at risk and affect 13
