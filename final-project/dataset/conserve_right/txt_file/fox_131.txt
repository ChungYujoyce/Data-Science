tuesday first let aposs bring in peter doocy with the latest from the palmetto state and the race for the democratic nomination peter peter doocy fox news correspondent chris this is the state where joe biden flew before that results from new hampshire were even in because things were so grim for him there and his gamble paid off begin videotape biden my buddy jim clyburn you brought me back cheers doocy and now biden wants to be the alternative to bernie sanders biden democrats want a nominee who aposs a democrat cheers doocy the democratic socialist sanders congratulated biden last night sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate there are a lot of states in this country nobody wins them all doocy iowa aposs winner pete buttigieg finished fourth in south carolina pete buttigieg d presidential candidate i am proud of the votes we aren apost and i am determined to earn every vote on the road ahead doocy tom steyer aposs road ended in columbia tom steyer d presidential candidate i can apost see a path where i can win the presidency doocy dynamic debates haven apost helped elizabeth warren anywhere but she is staying in and trying to chip away at rivals like biden sen elizabeth warren d ma presidential candidate this crisis demands more than a former vice president who is so eager to cut deals with the mitch mcconnell and the republicans that he aposll trade good ideas for bad ones doocy but for now biden aposs focus remains on bernie biden most americans don apost want the promise of revolution they want more than promises they want results end videotape doocy bernie sanders used his two wins in february to raise more than 46 million in a month joe biden has just two days to soak up his win here before more than a dozen more states host their contest on super tuesday chris wallace peter doocy reporting from south carolina peter thank you and joining us now from the campaign trail in alabama former vice president joe biden mr vice president congratulations on your victory in south carolina last night what do you think it does for your campaign biden well i think it aposs a big boost i think it starts the a real comeback and i think it we picked up a lot of delegates practically speaking and we now have amassed more popular vote than anyone running for the nomination but we have a long long way to go this is a marathon wallace well let me ask you about that because now you face super tuesday in just 48 hours where 44 percent of the delegates will be allocated and frankly you aposre at a big disadvantage going into there let me count the ways you haven apost held a rally in a super tuesday state in more than a month in california bernie sanders has 23 offices and more a hundred staffers you have one office and your campaign won apost say how many staffers and while sanders is spending 13 5 million on tv ads for tuesday you started running your first ad this week question if you get clobbered on super tuesday what does that do to your campaign biden well it certainly doesn apost help but there aposs a lot of big states coming up after that florida and georgia and pennsylvania and michigan i mean a whole range of states that still are in play but i look i aposm not pundit chris and i aposm not being a wise guy i aposm being i aposm being deadly earnest i feel good about where we are and i think ultimately people are now beginning to focus on the opposition in the way that they focused on the in the democratic party the way they aposve been focused on me for a long time and i think that i think it aposs about the message and i think that people know who i am although i aposve been outspent 41 to 1 i think it was or 40 to 1 in south carolina and other places i think we aposve now began to raise money nothing like they have raised we have raised about 18 million this month just 5 million overnight and so i think things are picking up but we aposll see wallace and talking about money mayor bloomberg has bought tv time on two networks tonight to deliver a primetime address three minute primetime address to the nation how do you compete with that biden i aposm on your show by doing as much of the free press and earned media as i can i aposm being serious and look i think that you know money can buy a lot but it can apost it can apost hide your record and it can apost make you something that you are or are not and so i just think one of the best things that i think happening is now mike is a solid serious guy he aposs in the debates now and we aposre able to discuss the differences we have but i think the democratic party is looking for a democrat not a socialist not a former republican a democrat to to be their nominee and to bring the country together in a way that i aposve been able to do my whole career wallace speaking of democratic socialist how damaging do you think bernie sanders would be on the top of the ticket both in terms of trying to beat donald trump and also for democrats down ballot biden well look if he aposs the nominee i will support him but i think it makes it very difficult down ballot and this is no great secret to anybody you can apost run as an independent socialist now a democratic socialist and do particularly expect to do very well in the states we have to win like north carolina like georgia like florida like texas like pennsylvania et cetera and so i look i believe that if i aposm on the top of the ticket we will win back the senate and we aposll keep the house i went in last time in 2018 to 24 purple states we won 41 house seats we won governor seats i was invited in i don apost know that they invited the bernie sanders to come in not because he aposs a bad guy but he comes from a different perspective look the people aren apost looking for revolution they aposre looking for results but he talks about a revolution let aposs get results and the idea that bernie aposs going to be able to come up with 60 trillion in 10 years to do the things he wants there aposs no there aposs really no path there and i can get that done on health care by building on obamacare with a biden medicare option in it i can do this in terms of ebola i mean excuse me in terms of dealing with the issues that relate to what we put together when we faced the pandemic of ebola i aposve had the experience of doing that i can do this in terms of bringing together the world with regard to climate change and so on so i this is these are things that have been in my wheelhouse things that i aposve done and i have a record of real success bernie doesn apost have much of a record at all as accomplishments in the united states senate and united states congress he aposs done a few things he aposs worked with john mccain on health care excuse me on veterans apos issues and post office is another thing but i aposve passed big legislation i aposm able to cross the aisle and i aposve been able to get things done wallace mr vice president if sanders is such a threat to the democratic party and the possibility of democratic majorities should all of the centrists get together i know you have a pretty clogged lane there aposs you there aposs bloomberg there aposs buttigieg there aposs klobuchar should you get together after super tuesday and however is in the lead amongst you whoever has the most delegates all the other say we aposre going to get out and we aposre going to support this moderate to go one on one against bernie sanders biden well you know it aposs kind of interesting on your show for me to be called a moderate chris i know it aposs 13 years since i aposve been on but i aposve never been called a moderate on your show before and i don apost consider myself including myself wallace a relative moderate laughter crosstalk biden you know what i mean and i aposm not criticizing you ph i aposm making the point that i have a very very progressive record and the issue is what we what can get done and look it aposs not for me to tell any other candidate that they should get out of the race they aposll know whether or not they remain viable whether they have a chance and i aposm confident that the primaries that are coming up and the ones that follow are going to winnow that field and and i think people will do the right thing but i aposm not going to presume to tell anybody to get out ph crosstalk wallace well let me ask you a question directly then if super tuesday ends and there aposs another so called moderate or a centrist who aposs leading you in delegates would you consider getting out to give them a clear path against sanders biden well look i aposm not going to i aposm not going to speculate on any of those kinds of things i think we aposre going to do well i know i am running i aposm not running against any of the democrats i aposm running against this what what our present president is doing and what he stands for and i aposm going to stay in my message and i aposve started off saying we have to restore the dignity and honor of the office and the soul of this country to gain respect in the country and around the world we have to deal with bringing reestablishing the middle class and bringing everybody along including the poor having an opportunity to get up and as well we have to unite the country and i used to be criticized for saying all these all those three things when i started now we know most democrats are saying the same thing who can get it done who can put his country together who can restore the dignity and honor of the country from my perspective anyway wallace mr biden biden and i think and i aposm best equipped to do that wallace mr vice president i don apost especially like asking you about this but it is an issue in the campaign and that has been your sometimes shaky performance on the campaign trail here aposs a story that you told at least three times about nelson mandela take a look begin video clip biden i had the great honor of meeting him i had a great honor of being arrested with our u n ambassador on the streets of soweto trying to get to see him on robbens island end video clip wallace you now say you weren apost arrested and that it didn apost happen in soweto you were at the airport in johannesburg and you were stopped from going through the door for blacks i guess the question is were you confused or were you just trying to embellish a story biden no no what i was trying to what i was doing was talking about the fact that i was strongly opposed to apartheid when we landed and we were going to soweto actually we landed in johannesburg and the afrikaners took me off the plane and took me into one direction wanted me to go through a white only door and in fact i wouldn apost move i said everybody else is going through to another door i aposm going with the with the black delegation that i came with they said no you can apost and i said i aposm staying here i aposm not going to move and they would not let me move anywhere so i guess i should have said i was i was detained i was not able to move forward so what they finally did was they went out and they cleared out a baggage claim area took us all up through the baggage claim area up through cleared out a restaurant look and if anybody wonders whether or not what i said about my desire my adamancy about apartheid you aposve covered it go back and look at joebiden com and take a look at the wallace no no crosstalk biden happened in the wallace your record is clear crosstalk wallace let me ask you though here aposs something else you said this week take a look begin video clip biden i aposm a democratic candidate for the united states senate look me over if you like what you see help out if not vote for the other guy ph give me a look though ok end audio clip wallace you haven apost run for the senate since 2008 what happened there biden well the context was i said to everybody i said look i aposm going to say the same things i aposve always said like i used to campaign in delaware i aposd say knocking the door i said my name is joe biden democratic candidate for the united states senate look me over if you like me help me out if not vote for the other guy that aposs the a sentence i aposve repeated throughout making the case and i sent and i aposm here now to ask you all to look me over it was in the context of how i said i ran because the context is also was that you can apost as was pointed out by my cedric and others on my campaign and how i ran when i ran for the senate was people will not they expect you to ask them you have to earn their vote that was the context for that wallace all right final question in this regard president trump went after you about this at cpac yesterday take a look at what he said begin video clip trump joe aposs not going to be running the government he aposs just going to be sitting in a home someplace and people are going to be running it for him end video clip wallace your response to the president aposs crosstalk biden is that the stable genius saying that laughter biden oh give me a break god love him i aposm going to resist saying what i feel like saying wallace no go ahead biden i aposm crosstalk wallace don apost resist it go ahead mr vice president biden no no no no no no no no no i aposm not going to do it i aposm not going to try to you know assign names and insults to the stable genius this is a guy who doesn apost know what he aposs doing he doesn apost know how to run the country he is making us more unsafe the way he aposs responding to the coronavirus he has done virtually nothing well that i can see and so i can hardly wait to debate him on stage i want people to see me standing next to him and him standing next to me we aposll see who aposs sleepy wallace mr vice president thank you thanks for your time please come back in less than 13 years sir biden all right chuck thank you very much wallace all right it aposs chris but anyway biden chris i just said chris no no i just said chuck i aposll tell what man these are back to back anyway crosstalk wallace no it aposs ok biden i don apost know how you do it early in the morning too wallace safe travels biden thank you chris wallace on the campaign trail biden appreciate it wallace thank you sir biden thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss where the democratic nomination stands two days from super tuesday commercial break begin video clip biden thanks to all of you the heart of the democratic party we just won and we have won big because of you sanders we are more than campaign we are a movement end video clip wallace joe biden celebrating a much needed victory in south carolina while current front runner bernie sanders looks ahead to super tuesday and it aposs time now for our sunday group townhall com editor katie pavlich mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service former dnc chair donna brazile and pollster kristen soltis anderson who aposs a fox news contributor well donna let me start with you how big a bounce does joe biden get from his victory in south carolina with super tuesday just 48 hours away donna brazile former dnc chair well i think the firewall stopped the spread of the fire but in terms of the bounce i mean he has not been holding rallies he hate doesn apost have a lot of ground operatives in those big states but here is what joe biden can now rely on rely upon i think as a result of super tuesday black voters gave him a second look a second opportunity and i think joe biden can now go into alabama where i believe he is today arkansas tennessee parts of texas virginia north carolina and try to grab as many delegates as possible bernie has a bigger assignment that is he not only has to win the state of vermont try to capture the voters in maine and massachusetts with elizabeth warren but bernie because of his success in 2016 can go to minnesota california colorado so i still believe it aposs bernie aposs race now you notice i didn apost mention michael bloomberg i aposm trying to give him a little love later this afternoon wallace boy that aposs late late coming brazile well i can apost give loved by man i don apost know but here aposs what i will say about michael bloomberg he has spent a lot of money and i don apost know if that aposs going to add up unless those mayors get out and give him some love wallace ok kristen as i discussed with the vice president the fact is he is way behind michael bloomberg and bernie sanders in terms of organization for super tuesday both in terms of ground game and also airtime ph we have this extraordinary thing tonight where mike bloomberg is buying 3 minutes of primetime network time on two networks how much can his win biden aposs win in south carolina make up for the deficits and all of those especially given the fact that millions of people have been voting already early voting in those super tuesday states kristen soltis anderson fox news contributor look everybody loves a winner having this momentum is very valuable for him it is helping keep his campaign afloat but with the short time frame the problem he aposs going to have is i still believe the biden campaign does not have a clear and concise message in the way that someone like bernie sanders does if you ask what bernie sanders is about it aposs easy it aposs revolution for the 99 percent wallace al right let me just push back biden would say it aposs results not revolution soltis anderson yes and i just wonder is that inspirational enough is that the sort of thing that gets people excited as motivated does it hit the right emotional buttons i think that bernie sanders because he aposs got this movement behind him this is my he aposs going to go into super tuesday and still be able to pull together so many delegates from states like california from places like texas the polls show that he is still doing quite well particularly among younger voters but as long as he can still divide up the older voters within the democratic party it aposs going to be hard for anyone to challenge him even once they get past super tuesday wallace mo how do you handicap the race now just after south carolina super tuesday about to come upon us and as forgive me as a more mainstream democrat how much do you worry about bernie sanders at the top of the ticket mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics public service i think right now bernie probably is still the front runner but he aposs a little bit less of a front runner today than he was yesterday morning and i do think this is a momentum business and when you get a nice bounce out of a state like south carolina a pretty big bounce i mean it was a good old fashioned shellacking in south carolina that can help in a lot of the states donna just mentioned the wild card there are two wild cards one is the early vote as kristen talked about the other is mike bloomberg mike bloomberg got into this race saying he was going to be the last line of defense against bernie sanders but we aposre not seeing him really sort of take the lead yet no one has voted for him yet but the polling in each of these super tuesday states showing he aposs not doing well enough to beat bernie but he is doing well enough to stop someone else from beating bernie so mike bloomberg could have gone from being the last line of defense against bernie to being bernie aposs last line of defense against biden wallace let me pick up on that with you katie because there is polling that shows that socialism is not the buzzword that it has traditionally been for some voters especially younger voters do you think it aposs possible first in the democratic primary then in a general election for bernie sanders to make socialism mainstream katie pavlich townhall com editor i think he already has if you look at the way that young people view the word socialism even though they can apost always define exactly what that means you look at the number of people in these fox news voter analysis polls that we have been doing what they actually believe in they line up with a lot of what bernie sanders is pushing with his platform which is socialism i would add that bernie sanders and his record especially over the past week defending the castro regime his record personally of honeymooning in the ussr that was communism not just democratic socialism as he likes to say so that is something certainly he aposs been able to take mainstream in the democratic party whether he can do that nationally i aposm not sure but what he is good at doing is building coalition the question for joe biden now going forward is he going to be able to find a james clyburn in every single super tuesday state to get him over the edge i know we aposre all celebrating that joe biden finally won a primary after three times running for president but if he had not one his campaign would be over and the question now is is he going to be able to make enough money over the next 48 hours to have some momentum going into the states and wallace even if you raised the money you can apost spend it pavlich right right the airwaves are already taken up by other by other candidates and also if you look at nevada and the way that bernie sanders came out of that with the coalition a diverse coalition and the fact that people are already voting for him in places like california and colorado and how he aposs right behind joe biden in texas this is still something that joe biden has to worry about and whether he can expand the coalition at this point is a real big question wallace we should also point out for all the talk about how iowa and new hampshire were untypical states because they were 90 percent white south carolina is also an untypical state because the electorate there in that primary last night was over 50 percent african american final question to you kristen we aposve got about a minute left what does polling say about how tough it will be to sell socialism not communism but socialism to majority of americans soltis anderson so fox news aposs owned polling from just this week shows it aposs only about 3 out of 10 voters say they would be comfortable with someone who is a socialist being president that only about a third of america is ok with socialism but socialism is defined very differently for younger voters versus older voters as katie was mentioning i think in terms of the word socialism lots of voters don apost like it but the idea of the government providing very extensive health care benefits et cetera a lot of voters are actually much more on board with that i would not count out the ideological places american voters may be willing to go wallace you know it aposs also interesting in our voter analysis fox news voter analysis bernie sanders won among people both black and white under 45 he clobbered among blacks and whites over 45 thank you panel see you in a little bit up next the latest on the spread of the coronavirus worldwide and in this country we aposll talk with health secretary alex azar about what aposs being done to keep americans safe commercial break wallace coming up the new yours announces a historic peace agreement with the taliban begin video clip mark esper defense secretary thanks to president trump aposs leadership we are finally making substantial progress toward ending our nation aposs longest war end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel what it means for bringing american troops home from afghanistan commercial break chris wallace fox host we turn now to the global health crisis caused by the outbreak of the coronavirus more than 86 000 people have contracted the illness most in mainland china but 59 nations now have confirmed cases including the first death here in the u s president trump says there aposs no need to panic joining us with the latest secretary of health and human services alex azar mr secretary welcome to fox news sunday alex azar health and human services secretary good to be with you chris thank you wallace what aposs the latest count of coronavirus cases in the u s of unknown origin where at this point the only explanation is community spread azar you bet so we aposve got about we aposve had 23 cases here in the united states that are not a result of us repatriating individuals from japan or china of those individuals we aposve got cases in chicago as well as washington and oregon where we do and two in california where we do not yet know why they contracted the novel coronavirus so we aposre deployed with state and local people and we aposre working to get to the bottom of it wallace so so we knew about the cases on the west coast there aposs now one in chicago as well azar there there is one overnight in chicago yes wallace and did the man who died from the illness in washington state did he get it best of your knowledge from community spread and what can you tell us about this nursing home in kirkland washington azar so at this point we do not know how this gentleman contracted the illness and we aposre obviously want to express our sympathies to him and to on behalf of him and his family for this fatality he is in a he was in a hospital this hospital is one where the nursing home sends patients there are cases in that nursing home also so right now there aposs a large investigation going on in the nursing home the hospital contact tracing to try to determine where that disease was introduced and how it might have spread wallace but you don apost know so at this point this is a community transmission which means it aposs somewhere out in that community in kirkland washington azar at this point it aposs a suspected community transmission yes wallace and that aposs concerning right azar any community transmission is concerning that aposs why we aposve been very clear from the outset we aposre going to have more cases here in the united states in spite of the president aposs aggressive efforts at containment we aposll see more cases we aposll see some forms of community spreading but the risk to any individual american remains low thanks to the efforts the president aposs taken they stay low we aposre working to keep it that way but things can change rapidly but they should know we have the best public health system in the world though looking out for them wallace let aposs talk about some of the new measures the president is considering he announced a travel advisory yesterday to south korea parts of south korea and italy what would it take to go to a travel ban and how seriously is he considering shutting down our southern border with mexico azar well right now mexico has very few cases so that would that would take a real change in the epidemiological profile and the risk to the united states from there i think what he was trying to say is all things are on the table we aposre not going to take anything off the table in our armamentarium of tools we have to protect the american people so what he announced yesterday is we already had level three travel warnings for all of italy and all of south korea that means essential travel only is recommended but for the impacted areas in northern italy and the one region of south korea we escalated that from the state department to a level four advisory which says do not go to these parts of italy and to south korea wallace and is there a point at which you could go to a travel ban azar we could look at using 212f which is the procedure we aposve used for china where we actually restrict entry from certain countries the the point is with italy and south korea we have highly developed public health and health care systems we have transparent leadership and very aggressive action that aposs been on it from day one so at this point we think advising people not to go is the right measure but everything will always be on the table wallace what about there aposs talk of invoking war powers to require u s companies to manufacture some goods in the national interest one possibly i know you have millions of them but one is that you might actually require companies to manufacture more protective masks azar that aposs right so that aposs called the defense production act i believe it came into existence during the korean war it aposs actually used fairly commonly for defense department procurements here in the united states effectively we can determine that our production should get to the front of the line and so we go before any other contract so that they might have wallace so so where are you on doing that azar so right now we are initiating the procurement processes for personal protective equipment so that would be masks as well as gowns gloves et cetera we are we aposve got that process initiated we aposre gathering information from potential vendors wallace but is that going to be under the war powers act that you aposre going to azar if we need to we aposll we aposll use it if we need to but we obviously if we can work cooperatively with any vendor we aposd rather do that but we aposre waiting for the emergency supplemental funding from congress because of course we need that money to fully fund those procurements wallace one concern that that some americans have is that president trump and some of his advisors are low balling the risk from the coronavirus for political purposes here aposs one example begin audio clip donald trump president of the united states looks like by april you know in theory when it gets a little warmer it miraculously goes away oh that aposs true dr robert redfield director cdc i think this virus is probably with us beyond this season or beyond beyond this yet and i think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community based transmission end audio clip wallace do you know that the coronavirus is going to disappear in april when the weather gets warmer azar no we don apost know that the normal coronavirus the annual cold and as well as flu and other respiratory illnesses often do dissipate and go away in warmer seasons the virus just doesn apost survive well in the warmer climate warmer atmosphere but we do not know as to this novel coronavirus how it will interact sars for instance which was a novel coronavirus did not dissipate in april what the president aposs been saying is we hope that it will be like the regular cold or regular flu and dissipate but we do not know wallace but here aposs another example of what some people are calling low balling by the president take a look begin audio clip trump because of all we aposve done the risk to the american people remains very low dr nancy messonnier cdc it aposs not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness end audio clip wallace well since dr messonnier spoke we have begun to see community transmission we have seen severe illnesses we have seen at least one death can you understand the concern about mixed messages coming from the administration azar i could understand the concern but i hope people will understand what we aposre trying to do we aposre trying to level with the american people at all times so dr messonnier was very clear with accurate information the risk is low it remains low but we have always expected we aposd see we would see more transmission and as she predicted we will see at least some limited community transmission the president though is also trying to keep balance in messaging so that the american people don apost engage in unwarranted panic for instance people running out and buying face masks that aposs not needed that aposs indicated we don apost recommend it it actually can be harmful to individuals in an infection situation so he aposs trying to keep good balance i aposm trying to keep good balance but we aposre also trying to be radically transparent with our information to make sure folks know what might be coming so they can mentally prepare as well as engage in normal prepared effectiveness wallace i want to pick up on that with you because clearly part of public health is psychology and in the last week we saw the dow jones go down 3 500 points we see people buying masks hoarding food and other supplies obviously part of this is a reasonable response to an unknown threat but do you see some elements of panic azar i see elements of uncertainty i was with secretary mnuchin yesterday at our task force meeting at the white house and he was talking about the stock market reaction and how so much of the market is just dealing with uncertainty and we aposre dealing with a novel virus and so there is uncertainty and i know that can make people feel uncomfortable and that aposs why we are trying to give the american people all the information we have when we have it so they don apost think there aposs secret information they aposre not getting that at least helps we say what uncertainties we aposve got and as we resolve them we try to clarify wallace you just think ph people are overreacting azar yes absolutely if people are going out and buying face masks that aposs not necessary in fact we need those masks for the people who should be using them which are health care workers taking care of patients wallace finally a whistleblower in your department raised a concern about a number i think a dozen hhs workers who apparently said sent to receive the first evacuees from china she says without proper gear without proper training and she raised this concern i know you say you aposre investigating but that woman was she reassigned as she claims after she raised this concern azar so first we it is vitally important that we protect our employees in any situation it is vitally important that we follow the appropriate isolation or quarantine protocols in dealing with individuals and it aposs important that no whistleblower ever be retaliated against and we will never permit retaliation against the whistleblower let me give you the facts that we know so far first every hhs employee who was involved in the allegations in the whistleblower aposs complaint has now been well over 14 days from any interaction with individuals and nobody is symptomatic or has the disease so there was no risk there aposs no risk to the people of hhs no risk to the community even if the allegations prove to be true so that aposs a very important fact we also have offered voluntary testing to our employees it aposs not medically indicated because they don apost have the virus wallace ok azar but if it comforts them we aposre going to get them tested so they know wallace and but what happened to the woman was she reassigned you the she said has said more than 10 days ago that she was reassigned you certainly know whether that happened azar well i aposm not going to discuss personnel matters that wouldn apost be proper for me to do but there will be no retaliation against this individual or any other individual we are grateful if our employees raise concerns about our processes if something proves not to be right we are grateful for that wallace so if she was reassigned i you can apost i know you can apost discuss it if she was reassigned because of raising this complaint you aposre saying she aposll be restored to the position azar nobody would ever be reassigned or discriminated against or prejudiced or retaliated against because of raising concerns about the functioning of the department wallace and you can apost tell me whether that happened azar i cannot i aposm not going to tell you whether that happened because that aposs still under investigation we are doing a comprehensive thorough investigation wallace secretary azar thank you thanks for coming in today and we aposll of course be tracking your efforts and the efforts of the entire task force to follow and fight this disease in the week ahead azar thank you chris wallace up next we ask our sunday panel about the administration aposs response so far and the political and economic fall out commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus think of it and this is their new hoax sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate hey mr trump why don apost you worry about the coronavirus rather than disrupting that democratic primary right here in south carolina end video clip wallace president trump using the accusing democrats of using the coronavirus as one more effort to bring him down and bernie sanders returning fire and we aposre back now with the panel katie how do you think the trump administration has responded to the coronavirus and if it continues to tank the markets and hurt the economy fairly or not could it hurt the president aposs chances for re election katie pavlich fox news contributor it certainly has an impact on the campaign trail but it aposs also had democrats on the campaign trail responds to it that really matters can they portray themselves as better leaders on this issue than president trump who has been in the brady briefing room twice in the last four days to talk about this issue he has president or vice president mike pence in charge of a team of people he has the cdc director the head of hhs talking about these things on a daily basis meeting they aposre meeting again today we may hear again from the president and democrats too ap is out with a fact check today saying that michael bloomberg and joe biden have been making false statements about the way that the president has handled this in terms of cdc funding and so democrats have to be careful here about not trying to stoke panic for political reasons and the president has a lot to handle in the sense that he has to be able to say don apost panic go about your lives but also be prepared for this to get worse before it gets better wallace donna plenty of democrats have been attacking the president aposs response to the virus so is it wrong for him to respond to then in kind as you saw them do at that rally and what impact do you think particularly if it continues to hit the economy which is obviously going to be a trump selling point even though he aposs obviously not responsible for the coronavirus what impact could that have on the 2020 election donna brazile fox news contributor i think the biggest mistake and he aposs made a lot of mistakes is that you know by saying the word hoax this is a serious public health potential public health crisis wallace now let me just say he aposs saying it aposs the hoax isn apost the crisis it aposs what the democrats are saying brazile i understand he cleaned it up yesterday wallace right brazile but here aposs the thing and i and i take this as serious as anything else we don apost want this to be president trump aposs katrina i experienced katrina no one wants to see their president fail at the notion that the president of the united states is out there pointing fingers at democrats when he should be doing everything to ensure that we have test kits that we have the public health sector mobilized to help people that our hospitals have supplies that is what you want a president to do in crises like this to put politics in the middle of this and i understand that the president wants to react every day to every different headline but he has to mobilize the federal government to make sure that we can handle this emergency right now we aposre looking at governors who are like basically saying give us kits give us kits we aposve got to test people we haven apost tested enough people chris and that i think that is the number one priority the president should be focused in on wallace all right there is other big news this weekend and that is that the u s and the taliban signed a peace deal yesterday that provides for a partial drawdown of u s troops the taliban renouncing al qaeda and talks between the afghan government and the opposition here was secretary of state pompeo at the signing ceremony begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state the agreement that we will sign today is the true test of this effort we will closely watch the taliban aposs compliance with their commitment and calibrate the pace of our withdrawal to their actions end video clip wallace kristen at this point in what is by far america aposs longest war how much of a consensus is there among americans that we need to get out kristen soltis anderson fox news contributor there aposs very broad consensus this over the last decade and a half has been an issue where americans went from saying this is the conflict that aposs worth it it aposs good that we are there remember this was the good war in contrast to iraq sort of being the bad war during the obama administration to the point now where significantly more americans say that it was not worth it to go to afghanistan that we ought to be withdrawing our troops and so even though there is plenty of criticism i think of this deal that it perhaps give the taliban too much at this point because americans are so exhausted with the blood and treasure we have spent there they may be willing to say any deal is good let aposs bring our boys home wallace but mo a lot could go wrong and and even with the best intentions and even with the the feelings of the american people the taliban may not keep their promises that certainly seems quite likely al qaeda or isis could reconstitute and become a terror threat to the united states what happens to afghan women who have thrived in the absence of the taliban i guess the questions is is this the smart play politically for 2020 pull our troops out mo elleithee fox news contributor i think it aposs the smart term it aposs the smart short term political play for this president this is a president who obsesses over winning the moment and this is winning this moment capitalizing on people aposs very legitimate weariness over a very long war but it does have the potential for it to come back which is why you do see foreign policy very serious foreign policy people conservative and on the left raising serious concerns about this plan giving too much away to the taliban and it might actually force us to come back in or faces some repercussions down the road that we don apost want to deal with that will be a long term bad political and strategic play for the president but he tends to focus on winning the moment and in this moment it aposs a good play for him wallace all right so if it aposs trump versus sanders they aposre both going to say pull them out but if it were trump versus biden you might have biden in a situation where he aposs the one not that he was for a lot of the things we did in afghanistan anyway certainly was against the troop surge under barack obama where biden is taking the more moderate position is that something that you think is going to get much backing from americans elleithee i think saying we want to get out let aposs do it the right way so that we don apost have to go back in later is something a lot of people can respond to but in sort of today aposs you know twitter defined communication landscape it takes a few extra steps so the president i think is leaning on as i said something that aposs going to work very well with his base and with people who are rightfully weary but it is it does have the potential to come back down the road and hurt him if the taliban do not keep their promises which a lot of people believe is a very likely scenario pavlich but they aposve they aposve blunted that argument at the beginning because this is not the administration spiking the football you have pompeo and secretary of defense mark esper saying we are cautiously optimistic about this we have a number of steps that the taliban has to meet before we are willing to do our part of this agreement including coming to the table with every sector of afghan civil society and hammering out their own internal deals so yes there is potential we could have to go back in but the administration is not saying that this is a roaring success at this moment they are saying we have many steps to go before we are capable and able to completely withdraw troops from afghanistan which will happen in sections not all at once wallace you elleithee the secretary is making that point i think fairly effectively the president is not bringing it the same sort of level of sobriety to that pavlich he made that point yesterday when he had his press conference you know before speaking about coronavirus elleithee well he aposs out on the stump at these rallies and he aposs declaring all but declaring victory right it just it creates a sense i think amongst his voters that this is maybe a little bit more certain than i think you very rightfully pointed out it aposs not wallace donna brazile well first of all i the taliban cannot be trusted and i think what aposs going to happen is that they aposre going to undermine the the government they don apost control all of the territory and so first of all we aposve got to make sure that the afghanistan government works with the taliban to ensure that this can go forward before we withdraw not just our troops but nato troops and others who are also invested in this wallace but we have about 30 seconds left katie you aposre quite right the agreement keeps you talk about conditions based on the other hand clearly this president has made has made it evident he wants to get out pavlich and the country has made it evident that he wants to get out and there are previous presidents like barack obama who have who have promised to do exactly what they aposre trying to do now does that mean that it will happen right away that there won apost be hiccups in as the administration has said spoilers along the way absolutely not but the fact that they have agreements now that the taliban will distance itself from al qaeda and that they will work with the afghan government to come up with a long term peace agreement that aposs a victory that should be celebrated that has not happened before wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week after spending 37 years in the army she aposs working to make sure all women who serve get their due commercial break wallace picture a veteran in your mind this person was a marine or an air force pilot or a naval intelligence analyst did you picture a man our power player of the week wants you to think again begin videotape phyllis wilson women in military service for america memorial i aposve always wanted to just be a soldier and not a woman soldier many times we find when you go to other museums we aposre almost a footnote in the storyline wallace phyllis wilson is trying to change that at the women and military service for america memorial at arlington national cemetery opened in 1997 the museum is built into arlington aposs iconic ceremonial gate wallace on camera i have driven past this space countless times and never knew this existed i take it that aposs not unusual wilson it aposs not unusual at all sadly wallace voice over while three million people come to arlington each year the museum is lucky to get 100 000 visitors what they see is the history of women in the military their uniforms and metals and their changing role from working as nurses to air force service pilots in world war ii to serving in combat today wilson there are about 2 million women that have served in the military but there are a total of three million women that have actually defended the nation wallace wilson served 37 years in the army rising to the rank of chief warrant officer five she worked in an intel unit for special operations in iraq over the years she says women aposs opportunities have expanded dramatically wilson trying to go to jump school was a hard thing for me to get a crack at and now we have rangers we have women that are leading infantry units this is unheard of until just the last five years wallace despite the progress wilson says women service members and veterans often don apost share their stories wilson when we asked them they said well i was just a supply sergeant i was just a clerk i was just a cook well there aposs no just to it if you raised your right hand and said i aposm willing to defend this nation with my life then you aposre a veteran when you aposre done wallace and they don apost get the same respect something wilson has experienced first hand wilson i had a parked in a veteran parking spot and as i got out of the car there was a gentleman that that quickly called me on that and said is your husband with you had it been a man whether he had served in the military or not in a veteran parking spot when he got out of his car i don apost think he would have been challenged wallace wilson took us to the memorial aposs roof terrace where glass tablets carry quotes about women aposs service wilson let the generations know that the women in uniform also guaranteed their freedom wallace and visitors get a view of this hallowed ground wilson there are 400 000 people that are buried here and many of those are women we are here at the memorial to tell the story not only of all of those that have passed before us but those that are still here to carry the torch forward end videotape wallace women make up some 17 perce
