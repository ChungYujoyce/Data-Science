control of the senate and increased their majority in the house what s most important for them and pres obama 2014midterms voters handed control of the senate to republicans for the first time in eight years on tuesday putting the gop incharge of congress for the remainder of president obama apos s term republicans swept to victory in a string of contests across the country retaining every one of the gop held seats up for grabs and picking up more than the six seats needed to take control of the senate republicans enjoyed a banner night after mounting campaigns from coast to coast that almost without exception sought to cast their opponents as rubber stamps for the unpopular president senate minority leader mitch mcconnell who fended off a democratic challenge in kentucky is now poised to ascend to majority leader next year republicans also are projected to retain control of the house and gain at least 12 seats expanding their majority beyond their post world war ii record of 246 seats set in 1946 the landscape means republicans will have new powers to challenge obama apos s agenda in the final two years of his term able to launch investigations and hold hearings from both chambers hold up key appointments and pass gop favored legislation if only to force the president to employ his veto pen the division of power also could yield areas of agreement on areas ranging from immigration to energy though the affordable care act and efforts to undermine it could continue to sour talks on other issues obama plans to hold a press conference at the white house at 2 50 p m et on wednesday on the heels of the election results mcconnell after winning his own race said some things won apos t change next year but stressed that lawmakers and the white house don apos t have to be in perpetual conflict and have an obligation to work together tomorrow the papers will say i won this race but the truth is tonight we begin another one one that apos s far more important than mine

challenger greg orman in kansas in a setback for republicans democratic sen jeanne shaheen beat republican challenger scott brown despite brown apos s late surging campaign but republicans apos momentum was undeniable a handful of other races remain too close to call most notably in virginia where republican ed gillespie is running a late surging campaign against democratic sen mark warner according to fox news exit polls this race is looking much closer than it did in pre election polling in which warner a former virginia governor held a months long 20 point lead over gillespie the
