interference are testing beijing s efforts to project its power overseas in its latest maneuver china sent three scholars to spell out in interviews with australian media and other appearances steps to mend the deepening rift with beijing a move that appears to have fallen flat in a recent press conference at the chinese embassy in canberra chen hong the head of australian studies at east china normal university accused australia of acting as a pawn for the united states in lobbying other countries against huawei s involvement in the nascent 5g networks top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state australia has been in one way or another so to speak pioneering this kind of anti china campaign even some kind of a scare and smear campaign against china chen said that is definitely not what china will be appreciating and if other countries follow suit that is going to be recognized as extremely unfriendly he said after meetings in beijing last week richard marles the opposition s defense spokesman assessed the relationship as terrible a growing number of australians are convinced that beijing has been using inducements threats espionage and other clandestine tactics to influence their politics methods critics believe beijing might be honing for use in other western democracies australia is seen as a test bed for beijing s high pressure influence tactics said clive hamilton author of silent invasion a best seller that focuses on chinese influence in australia they are testing the capacity of the australian democratic system to resist he said still australian officials have downplayed talk of a diplomatic freeze they must balance a growing wariness toward china and their desire for strong ties with the u s with the need to keep relations with their resource rich country s largest export market on an even keel australia relies on china for one third of its export earnings delays in processing of australia exports of coal and wine at chinese ports have raised suspicions of retaliation by beijing while prime minister scott morrison appeared to side with president donald trump on the issue of china s trade status during a recent visit to

well with china morrison replied trump and morrison did agree that china has outgrown trade rule concessions allowed to developing nations advantages it insists it should still be able to claim

conservative was elected in may to represent a melbourne district with a large population of ethnic chinese voters she says she has resigned from such organizations and any honorary positions she might have held some possibly without her knowledge or consent morrison accused her critics of smearing the 1 2 million chinese living in australia that was a decent gesture the global times said but while it seeks to control damage from the tensions with beijing the australian government has been moving to neutralize its influence by banning foreign political donations and all covert foreign interference in domestic politics opposition lawmakers likened liu s situation to that of sam dastyari who resigned as a senator in 2017 over his links to chinese billionaire political donor huang xiangmo huang successfully sued australian media outlets for defamation over the allegations of his involvement in chinese political interference but he lost his australian permanent residency after
