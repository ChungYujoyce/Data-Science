tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn president trump is underwater in key battleground states that are likely to decide the 2020 election and polling shows trouble for him even in the traditional republican bastions of texas and arizona while allies of the president cautioned against reading into polls so far away from election day they acknowledged mr trump s path to 270 electoral college votes will be tight his 2016 victory was sealed in rust belt states of michigan wisconsin and pennsylvania but the latest numbers show he will be hard pressed for a repeat the leading two democratic candidates former vice president joseph r biden and sen bernard sanders both hold double digit leads over mr trump in michigan according to a glengariff group poll released this week top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time just 36 of the state s voters are firmly behind mr trump the majority said they are looking to vote for someone else the blue wall seems to be real and president trump s 2016 victory was an anomaly which will be tough to repeat saul anuzis a former chairman of the michigan republican party told the washington times the news wasn t any better for mr trump in a broader batch of approval numbers in battleground states released wednesday by morning consult another polling firm by double digit margins majorities of voters in michigan and wisconsin said they disapprove of the job mr trump is doing his deficit is 7 percentage points in pennsylvania the bright spot was florida where his approval disapproval was dead even at 48 each but iowa new hampshire ohio north carolina and even arizona showed more disapproval republican pollster whit ayres said the midwestern states are always competitive and polls at this point in the 2016 cycle likely showed mr trump in a similar position it s the economy that s his ace in the hole he s very unlikely to change his basic message regardless of what polls say mr ayres said the trump campaign cited the booming economy and mr trump s record of bringing back manufacturing jobs as reasons that they will not only hold the 2016 map but also expand it america s economy and its workers are thriving with many of these key states experiencing record low unemployment rates said sarah matthews a spokeswoman for the president s reelection campaign when there is a clear choice between a defined opponent and president trump the president s record of success will always win against the democrats socialist job killing policies mr ayres agreed with that logic but said mr trump s ability to capitalize on the strong economy is dependent on whom the democrats choose as their nominee if they nominate someone who can consolidate the majority of americans who disapprove of the president then the economy s clearly not enough he said but if the democrats nominate some socialist who is going to divide the non trump voters then the economy s probably enough to get him reelected that difference was on display in texas where a shock poll from quinnipiac university on wednesday showed mr trump trailing mr biden by 4 percentage points quinnipiac poll assistant director peter a brown said the numbers could spell trouble for president trump quinnipiac says mr trump leads sen elizabeth warren 46 to 45 and leads mr sanders 47 to 44 still troubling news for a republican president seeking reelection mr trump has seen scare polls out of texas before including a washington post sponsored survey in september 2016 that showed hillary clinton with a 1 percentage point lead mr trump won the state by 9 points ted harvey chairman of the committee to defend the president a leading outside backer of mr trump said he is not that concerned about what polls say this early in the campaign he predicted that the president s record on major issues such as the economy immigration and trade will consolidate support behind him certainly trump s effort to deal with the unfair trade practices that we have with many of our trading partners with china specifically and with mexico and canada and bringing manufacturing jobs back to america that s going to help us in those rust belt states mr harvey said but that could be a tough sell for some in the midwest the glengariff poll found that by a 47 to 26 margin michigan voters said mr trump s policy of putting tariffs on chinese goods is bad for the state trade wars with our major trading partners obviously threaten the economic recovery mr ayres said that s not exactly economic rocket science mr harvey s group and great america pac another pro trump group on wednesday announced a joint 1 million plus effort to register voters in battleground states such as michigan pennsylvania florida and north carolina mr harvey said a wealth of people who did not vote in 2016 and wouldn t necessarily show up in current polling likely back the president and can be persuaded to turn out we have a very sophisticated effort being put forth to identify these voters figure out where they lean politically where they lean ideologically and then work heavily on them to get them to register to vote and participate in the next election cycle he said the effort will expand into states that the president lost in 2016 such as new hampshire and colorado where mr harvey used to be a state senator there is no reason why we should have lost colorado in the last election he said but mr trump is underwater in those states as well and looking for new battleground states to try to make competitive would be an uphill battle particularly if the campaign has to deploy resources to shore up support in traditional republican strongholds the path to 270 is very narrow which is why trump suggested he preferred a national popular vote and would have campaigned nationwide mr anuzis said in an email mr trump last year said he would prefer a popular vote because it s easier to win but in march said the electoral college system is far better for the country he
