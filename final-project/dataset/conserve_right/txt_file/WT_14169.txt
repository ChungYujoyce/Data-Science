apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a u s intelligence gathering ship was harassed by a chinese security ship last month in an incident that analysts say indicates beijing is stepping up aggressive maritime encounters toward the u s navy in the asia pacific a chinese website sinocism posted photographs of what it described as a fierce confrontation between the usns impeccable an electronic spy ship and a china maritime surveillance ship the web posting said the chinese ship videotaped the encounter and posted it online as a way to expose the activity photos of the impeccable indicate they were taken on june 21 top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the chinese ship also warned the navy vessel it was operating illegally despite being in undisclosed international waters the chinese also said the ship was not a noncombatant ship the american vessel usns impeccable is far from being a noncombatant the chinese posting stated the impeccable is one of five american surveillance ships equipped with passive and active low frequency towed array sonar and it is effective at detecting submarines directly serving the american naval fleet by doing so the navy is stepping up surveillance of china s submarine force which has expanded by more than 50 submarines in the past two decades the sinocism posting stated that the u s ship was within 100 nautical miles of the chinese coast and that china had not granted permission for it to operate in that region the chinese photos appear to have been taken by a cellphone camera from a distance of about 10 000 yards analysts suggested the chinese were engaged in long distance countersurveillance thus raising questions about chinese claims of a fierce encounter a video of the confrontation posted on another website shows a chinese security officer on ship speaking into a microphone and demanding that the u s ship must first get china s permission to be in the area an unidentified u s official was then heard in the radio message as saying the impeccable was operating legally in international waters the video can be viewed at cjdby net redianzhuizong 2013 07 04 military 4476 html the last time the impeccable was harassed by the chinese was in march 2009 when five chinese ships shadowed the surveillance vessel and sprayed it with water in what the pentagon at the time said was a dangerous effort to force the ship out of its operating zone another spy ship the victorious also was harassed several years ago a u s pacific command spokesman would not address the u s china ship incident capt chris sims the spokesman referred inside the ring to comments made last week by adm samuel j locklear head of u s pacific command asked about an increase in chinese naval activity around guam and hawaii in apparent retaliation for u s naval spying on china adm locklear said the united states and china disagree on u n definitions of controlled waters we believe the u s position is that those activities are less constrained than what the chinese believe the four star admiral said in a meeting with reporters july 11 adm locklear said economic exclusion zones cover most of the major sea lines of communication that are vital for trade and shipping asked about earlier chinese military provocations and if the chinese today are less provocative adm locklear said i would say it s not provocative certainly i d say that in the asia pacific in the areas that are closer to the chinese homeland that we have been able to conduct operations around each other in a very professional and increasingly professional manner some of this had to do with the lessons that were learned a number of years ago by some of the unfortunate encounters he added the u s military is holding an ongoing dialogue with the chinese military with the aim of creating rules of the road as china s navy expands and operates farther from its coast adm locklear said the u s presence in the asia pacific s not going anywhere he said so we have to manage our ability to operate around each other and i think that s a doable thing pentagon fears power doctrine pentagon officials are worried that the anti u s views of samantha power president obama s nominee to be u s ambassador to the united nations will have a negative impact on the u s defense and military establishment a defense official close to policymakers said the official said there is serious concern within the pentagon about what will happen under the new samantha power doctrine if she is confirmed for the u n post people are shuddering over its implication for the department of defense the official said the official noted that during her nomination hearing before the senate foreign relations committee on wednesday ms power did not back down from her past contention that the united states was guilty of war crimes apparently carried out by omission or commission by the u s government and military dod senior officials believe she is very influential with the left wing of the administration so they are following closely what senators are asking and her replies the official said ms power supports humanitarian intervention including aid to syrian rebels she was the key policy driver behind the leading from behind policy used to oust libyan leader moammar gadhafi that has left the oil rich north african nation unstable and facing a growing problem with islamist militias pentagon officials are concerned there will be policy disputes between ms power and defense secretary chuck hagel who opposes all u s interventions and argues that there is no budget for military intervention because of the pentagon s current funding crunch ms power came under sharp questioning during her senate hearing wednesday from sen marco rubio florida republican mr rubio asked the ireland born ms power about a 2003 article she wrote calling for a historical reckoning with crimes committed sponsored or permitted by the united states after repeating several times how much she likes the united states ms power then explained that she was referring to the lack of response by the clinton in administration to the 1994 rwanda tribal genocide mr rubio pressed her to explain what crimes the united states had committed or sponsored in rwanda ms power sidestepped the question saying only i think this is the greatest country on earth i we have nothing to apologize for but do you believe the united states has committed or sponsored crimes mr rubio asked she repeated that she believed the united states is the greatest country on earth ms power did no repudiate her demand for an accounting of u s crimes but suggested she would absolutely have stated it differently obama putin talk snowden president obama last month dismissed any suggestion that he should get involved in bringing edward snowden to justice for disclosing top secret national security agency programs and documents obtained while he worked as a computer technician contractor for the agency the president appeared to be signaling to the u s and international press that dealing with the illegal release of u s secrets and getting a leaker to face prosecution was something below his paygrade i m not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29 year old hacker mr obama said june 27 at a news conference in senegal during his weeklong trip to africa i m not going to have one case with a suspect who we re trying to extradite suddenly be elevated to the point where i ve got to start doing wheeling and dealing and trading on a whole host of other issues simply to get a guy extradited so he can face the justice system that apparently changed friday when russian president vladimir putin called mr obama to discuss the snowden case the white house readout of the call said the two leaders spoke about the status of mr edward snowden among other issues asked if the president asked mr putin to return mr snowden white house national security council spokeswoman caitlin hayden did not answer directly our message to every country continues to be that there is a legal basis to expel edward snowden back to the u s and we want to see that happen without delay she said russia made clear on wednesday that it would not return the renegade nsa contractor who has requested temporary asylum in moscow mr putin however said relations should not be upset by squabbles between special services
