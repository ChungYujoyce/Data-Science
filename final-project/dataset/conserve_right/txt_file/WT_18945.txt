 michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic senate majority leader harry reid says the china currency bill is the most important jobs legislation congress can enact while house speaker john a boehner calls it dangerous and the white house has refused to take a stand we share the concern of members about the valuation of the chinese currency and the need to appreciate the value of the chinese currency we also are concerned that any action that might be taken would be effective and consistent with our international obligations white house press secretary jay carney told reporters tuesday demurring yet again on the issue that is dominating capitol hill he wouldn t commit to taking a stand before the senate holds a final vote which could come later this week the senate officially began debating the bill tuesday after a 79 19 test vote monday cleared the way mr reid used parliamentary moves to block out any amendments trying to prevent the debate from spinning into a freewheeling fight over free trade and u s debt top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey but even if the bill clears the upper chamber it faces a stiffer path in the house where mr boehner said that congress is not the right place to make such complex decisions i think it s pretty dangerous for us to move legislation in the united states congress forcing someone to deal with the value of their currency the ohio republican told reporters at the capitol this is well beyond i think what the congress ought to be doing while i ve got concerns about how the chinese have dealt with their currency i m not sure this will fix it he said the bill has become enmeshed in campaign politics and the escalating focus on trade after mr obama on monday submitted three long delayed free trade agreements for congress approval sponsored by democrats and republicans the measure would push the administration to find that china is getting an unfair trade advantage by holding down the value of the yuan the measure would allow compensatory tariffs to be imposed on goods from countries that are deemed to be undervaluing their currency chinese officials warned that if congress passed the bill and mr obama signed it that could ignite a trade war between the two nations however supporters said that s already the reality we are already in a trade war with china and it s not going that well said sen charles e schumer new york democrat american companies are fighting for survival in the united states and around the globe battling subsidized chinese exports with a built in price advantage of 20 percent to 40 percent mr reid on monday had said he was certain the measure would pass the senate and the house but mr boehner s opposition makes it tougher house democrats said if it comes to the floor of their chamber it has a chance minority whip steny h hoyer said a house version of the china currency bill has 218 co sponsors 61 of them republican and easily would pass the chamber he added that a similar bill passed the house in the last congress with broad bipartisan support this is a bill that has enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support said mr hoyer maryland democrat even though he won t take a stand on the currency issue mr obama wasn t entirely mum on china on tuesday in his campaign speech to an audience in texas he warned that the u s risked falling behind in having newer infrastructure or faster railroads the bill presents a thorny problem for mr obama many in his political base want to take steps to punish china whose economy appears poised to eclipse that of the u s but presidents also try to keep as free a hand as possible in the conduct of foreign relations and having a policy dictated from capitol hill could be problematic mr carney the white house spokesman said the administration is always in discussions with congress about issues such as china s currency he would not say what the thrust of those discussions is however mr reid brushed aside the administration s silence on the measure choosing to see the optimistic side they haven t said they re against it either he said there s no question that we re going to come up with something mr reid said the house will come up with theirs we ll come up with ours and we ll work something out in conference there s wide support that s why we got 79
