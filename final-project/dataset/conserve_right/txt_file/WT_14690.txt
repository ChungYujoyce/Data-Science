apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic albany n y ap america s recycling industry is in the dumps a crash in the global market for recyclables is forcing communities to make hard choices about whether they can afford to keep recycling or should simply send all those bottles cans and plastic containers to the landfill mountains of paper have piled up at sorting centers worthless cities and towns that once made money on recyclables are instead paying high fees to processing plants to take them some financially strapped recycling processors have shut down entirely leaving municipalities with no choice but to dump or incinerate their recyclables top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century there s no market we re paying to get rid of it says ben harvey president of el harvey sons which handles recyclables from about 30 communities at its sorting facility in westborough massachusetts seventy five percent of what goes through our plant is worth nothing to negative numbers now it all stems from a policy shift by china long the world s leading recyclables buyer at the beginning of the year it enacted an anti pollution program that closed its doors to loads of waste paper metals or plastic unless they re 99 5 percent pure that s an unattainable standard at u s single stream recycling processing plants designed to churn out bales of paper or plastic that are at best 97 percent free of contaminants such as foam cups and food waste the resulting glut of recyclables has caused prices to plummet from levels already depressed by other economic forces including lower prices for oil a key ingredient in plastics the three largest publicly traded residential waste hauling and recycling companies in north america waste management republic services and waste connections reported steep drops in recycling revenues in their second quarter financial results houston based waste management reported its average price for recyclables was down 43 percent from the previous year a year

connecticut received 95 000 for recyclables last year the city s new contract requires it to pay 700 000 a big part of the problem besides lower commodity prices overall is sloppy recycling in the early days of recycling people had to wash bottles and cans and sort paper plastic glass and metal into separate bins now there s single stream recycling which allows all recyclables to be tossed into one bin while single stream has benefited efficiency and customers like it it s been a challenge on the contamination side a tour of republic s facility in beacon about an hour s drive north of new york city makes the challenges clear a third of the material dumped by collection trucks is non recyclable contaminants such as garden hoses picnic coolers and broken lawnmowers workers have to pull that out and truck it to a landfill adding to overall costs plastic bags contaminate bales of other materials and tangle machinery spilled ketchup and greasy pizza boxes turn otherwise marketable material into garbage the death of recycling was completely avoidable and incredibly easily fixed says mitch hedlund executive director of recycle across america which advocates standardized labeling

signs of market improvement in the u s to offset the lost business said david biderman ceo and executive director of the solid waste association of north america he noted chinese paper manufacturers that had relied on recyclables imported into their country have recently purchased shuttered mills in kentucky maine and wisconsin meanwhile recyclable materials processors are re negotiating contracts with municipalities to reflect the fact that prices paid for recyclables no longer offset the cost of collecting and sorting them what we re advocating is to step back and re look at recycling republic s coupland said this is the new normal the model no longer funds itself associated press w
