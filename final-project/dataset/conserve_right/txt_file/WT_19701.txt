choice of mr ratcliffe as far as i can tell his only qualification is loyalty to this president said pete buttigieg the mayor of south bend indiana at a fundraiser for his 2020 presidential campaign

ratcliffe was selected because he exhibited blind loyalty to president trump with his demagogic questioning of former special counsel robert mueller if senate republicans elevate such a partisan player to a position that requires intelligence expertise and nonpartisanship it would be a big mistake he said sunday evening the statement by mr schumer s republican counterpart majority leader

thoughtful and unbiased approach was at the helm of our intelligence community mr mcconnell singled out mr coats helping intelligence agencies getting a better handle on the malign behavior of russia china and other adversaries in particular his role in the administration s comprehensive response to russia s ongoing efforts to interfere in our democracy the intelligence community s great leaps
