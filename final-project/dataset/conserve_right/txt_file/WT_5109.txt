apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump s next navy secretary will be walking onto a command deck with a massive number of headaches including a lingering navy seal scandal a string of shootings on bases and a competition with china to define the 21st century mr trump last month said he will tap kenneth braithwaite currently the ambassador to norway to take over the navy after the sudden firing of richard v spencer mr spencer was forced out as secretary after revelations that he held secret talks with the white house over the legal fate of chief petty officer edward gallagher analysts say the next navy boss will be tasked with cleaning up the fallout from an incident that has divided military leaders and seemingly put the service at odds with the president if mr braithwaite is ultimately confirmed by the republican controlled senate he also will be expected to assure navy service members and their families that bases are safe after shootings at pearl harbor hawaii and at pensacola florida top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender those are only the most prominent issues analysts say mr braithwaite a retired navy rear admiral and trump 2016 campaign official will simultaneously face the daunting challenge of retaining the navy s global edge while china encroaches on american military dominance decisions made now are likely to affect the service for decades to come i think it s a competition to maintain naval supremacy said jeff benson a military fellow at the center for strategic and international studies and former commanding officer of the destroyer uss stethem if you look at china the only element they re missing is that naval component of being the largest and the greatest he said when you look at the next 10 years the decisions made now in the next two to four years is the navy we re going to have in 2035 we re at a pivotal moment in terms of the navy and what direction we re doing we ve got to maintain that capability advantage in addition to overseeing the navy s modernization efforts which include integrating unmanned technology into the service s capabilities the next secretary also will be challenged to restore confidence in commanders leadership at sea after the shocking crashes of the uss fitzgerald and the uss john s mccain in 2017 mr spencer lost support in the white house and in congress over repeated mechanical failures associated with the uss gerald r ford aircraft carrier s weapons elevators despite declaring it a top priority beneath those nuts and bolts considerations however some analysts argue that mr braithwaite must put the navy back on track after the chief gallagher saga damaged the service s relationship with the white house and sowed doubt in its ability to police its own affairs chief gallagher was convicted this year of posing with the corpse of an islamic state fighter in iraq in 2017 though he was acquitted of more serious charges he was demoted by the navy but had his rank restored by the president navy officials then announced plans to formally review the case and potentially strip chief gallagher of his trident pin which symbolizes membership in the elite seals unit mr trump publicly declared that the navy would not go down that path but officials planned to move ahead with the review board anyway defense secretary mark t esper said he ultimately fired mr spencer for holding secret talks with white house officials those talks apparently included a private guarantee that the review board would allow chief gallagher to remain in the seals cleanup job the entire episode resulted in a stain on the navy s reputation another key challenge is resisting the climate of political correctness which led to the overzealous prosecution of chief gallagher and seal officers in his chain of command said j d gordon a former pentagon spokesman and trump campaign national security adviser navy leaders then dug in to the point of apparently undermining president trump something which should have never reached that point mr gordon dubbed mr braithwaite a trump loyalist his role in the 2016 campaign and close political alignment with the president could result in a much smoother relationship between the navy and the white house mr spencer was a favorite among some liberal think tanks and insiders say was never ideologically aligned with the trump administration in his departing letter mr spencer told mr trump that i no longer share the same understanding with the commander in chief who appointed me in regards to the key principle of good order and discipline i cannot in good conscience obey an order that i believe violates the sacred oath i took in the presence of my family my flag and my faith to support and defend the constitution of the united states mr spencer wrote mr braithwaite could have an easier relationship with mr trump as ambassador to norway he has been a vocal defender of the president s leadership style donald trump is not a politician he speaks his mind and sometimes without a filter he said during an oslo security conference speech on oct 16 as quoted by defense news he s definitely not a diplomat i think we all know that he s a businessman mr trump has delivered a major spending boost to the pentagon but the navy faces perhaps the toughest budget situation of any of the services the associated press reported last week that navy officials are proposing construction cutbacks and ship retirements in order to fund other priorities the cuts would shrink the 293 ship fleet and lead away from the stated goal of a 355 ship navy the preliminary proposed cuts would target precisely the destroyers and cruisers that private analysts say are critical to meet the challenge from russia and especially china if you were serious about facing down the chinese you d probably want more of that than less defense industry analyst norman friedman told ap mr esper and other top pentagon officials have expressed confidence in mr braithwaite s ability to lead the navy the defense secretary even said he personally recommended mr braithwaite for the job but mr esper and the next navy secretary face a daunting challenge to reassure sailors and their families that u s military facilities are safe and secure over the past month a number of incidents at naval bases across the country have raised fears and led to a reinspection of security procedures on nov 30 master at arms 3rd class oscar temores was killed when his vehicle was struck by a gate runner at joint expeditionary base little creek fort story in virginia days later two sailors were killed in a shooting at the pearl harbor naval shipyard earlier this month saudi student mohammed alshamrani killed three people and wounded eight others at naval air station pensacola the pensacola shooting spurred an internal debate about programs to train saudi students at american facilities top military officials say those pro
