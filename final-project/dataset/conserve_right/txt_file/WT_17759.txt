called occupy central which is spearheading the protest in the financial district the occupation of the central business district is just one battle in the long run hong kong needs a stronger civil society he said china took control of the british colony in 1997 and granted hong kong certain civil liberties via a mini constitution and the expectation of free elections in 2017 for its top leadership post planning for the vote started late last year but in proposed guidelines for the vote published in late august beijing s leadership granted the one man one vote rule but nixed an open nomination process for candidates for the city s top post of chief executive china wants to limit the number of candidates and make sure those selected are vetted by a committee the way it currently is done by pro beijing elites which essentially leaves the top post under the control of the mainland communist party activists say china s requirement that hong kong candidates be screened is unacceptable pre selected candidates by a controlled nominating committee can only represent vested interests not the general public s alex chow secretary general of the hong kong federation of students said monday at a student rally at the chinese university of hong kong since the guidelines were released last month pro democracy activists have been planning protests and the upcoming boycott occupation of the financial district and recruiting locals to their cause they held an initial protest sept 14 with about 4 000 demonstrators student organizers expect the boycott to double

newspaper at the same time hong kong s business elite meeting with mr xi to discuss democratic reforms say chinese leaders will stand by its conditions for elections they pleaded with protesters to recognize the consequences of the boycotts and strikes hong kong is a financial center and if the city s main financial district is in chaos then hong kong will be ruined billionaire property
