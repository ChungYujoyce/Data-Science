national review making the click through worthwhile why you shouldn t quite buy the hype about the democrats winning control of the senate this november nbc finds a convenient scapegoat for metoo concerns and a bit of intrigue about a disputed recount in massachusetts why the democrats senate chances are overhyped the past week brought another round of buzz that democrats could win control of the senate the washington post declares this morning republicans have grown increasingly worried about losing control of the senate roll call sstuart rothenberg pronounces the senate is now in play even fox news concurs for republican leaders seeking to maintain control of the senate some races are becoming a little too close for comfort but josh kraushaar s column at national journal is called against the grain and it s apt because he regularly enjoys puncturing the balloon of the political conventional wisdom he s not quite so convinced about the latest democratic optimism if republicans can defeat two of the six vulnerable democratic senators up for reelection they ve locked down their majority for another cycle strategists from both parties agree that republicans have pulled ahead in north dakota where sen heidi heitkamp is facing a spirited challenge from rep kevin cramer public polls show missouri s and florida s contests as pure toss ups while indiana remains highly competitive democrats have the momentum in west virginia and montana but the conservative nature of those electorates give republicans an outside chance if north dakota already leans in their direction republicans would need just one more of these red state races to clinch a majority regardless of what happens with the several seats they have to defend even if republicans fall short democrats would still need to win a gop held seat on deeply conservative turf either in tennessee or in texas take another look at those vulnerable democratic seats while florida should be a close race incumbent bill nelson hasn t led a public poll since june missouri s looking very similar with several surveys showing ties or small leads for republican josh hawley incumbent claire mccaskill hasn t led a public survey since may we haven t had a public poll of north dakota since june but that one had republican kevin cramer up by four and note this is with the political wind at democrats s back at least nationally there s mixed evidence of whether undecided voters tend to break to the challenger a washington post analysis pooh poohed that conventional wisdom in 2014 but then later that year republican senate candidates across the map overperformed their final polling averages sometimes by double digits if republicans win in florida missouri and north dakota it means the drama ends early on election night at least for control of the senate democrats can assure themselves that indiana s joe donnelly west virginia s joe manchin and montana s jon tester are in stronger shape than expected but there s another shoe that hasn t dropped yet all of these incumbents have to vote for or against brett kavanaugh to be the next justice on the supreme court a yes vote probably frustrates the democratic grassroots in their states a no vote outrages and energizes the grassroots republicans nr s afternoon roundup of the day s best commentary must read analysis now let s go through the vulnerable republican seats a new poll of arizona s senate race out this morning put republican martha mcsally up by three points over kyrsten sinema the previous poll put mcsally up by one nevada s senate race has only seen one recent survey and that put democrat jacky rosen up by one point progressives are really excited about beto o rourke in texas and he s no doubt performing much better than the typical democrat in texas but he still hasn t you know led a poll if o rourke wins it will indeed be a huge deal but if cruz wins this closely i wonder if democrats will be kicking themselves over the national hype and attention paid to o rourke throughout the summer if you re aiming to pull off a huge upset sometimes the best option is to be under the radar for as long as possible to let the incumbent get complacent ask dave brat or scott brown in fact building strength under the radar while the incumbent puts in minimal effort is a big part of how o rourke won his house seat no doubt team cruz will be pulling out all of the stops between now and november and while tennessee democrats have reason to cheer over phil bredesen s two point lead over republican marsha blackburn in the latest poll i can remember 2006 when harold ford jr was on the cover of newsweek under the headline not your daddy s democrats one week before election day newsweek declared ford had republicans running scared yet he was the only democrat to lose a competitive senate race that year as bob corker beat him by three points in other words the last time democrats enjoyed a big blue wave midterm election tennessee bucked the trend there s no doubt that there are some disappointments for the gop this cycle there s not yet any sign that minnesota or michigan have gotten really competitive nbc hey we can t have any sexual harassment commentary around here right right because if there s any institution that s covered itself in glory since the metoo movement arose it s nbc norm macdonald s appearance on the tonight show starring jimmy fallon was hastily canceled tuesday after the comedian stirred controversy with remarks about the metoo movement and the treatment of louis c k chris hardwick and roseanne in recent scandals out of sensitivity to our audience and in light ofnorm macdonald s comments in the press today thetonightshow has decided to cancel his appearanceon tuesday stelecast nbc said in a statement tonight show s decision to drop macdonald came even after he apologized for his comments later in the day in an interview with hollywood reporter macdonald said he was happy the metoo movement has slowed down a little bit he further opined it used to be one hundred women can t be lying and then it became one woman can t lie and that became i believe all women and then you re like what like that chris hardwick guy i really thought got the blunt end of the stick there nbc might tolerate matt lauer s secret door lock button and predation for years and throw roadblocks in front of ronan farrow but boy they sure as heck come down hard on norm macdonald then again norm macdonald might be used to getting a raw deal from nbc back in 1998 macdonald was fired from saturday night live and the rumor was that an nbc executive who was friends with o j simpson found macdonald s relentlessly scathing o j jokes intolerable because if there s any demographic nbc couldn t afford to offend it s the o j simpson fanbase ironically in 2017 macdonald said he saw simpson slightly differently i m not completely sure he s guilty anymore i malmostcompletely sure but i m not completely sure recount intrigue among massachusetts democrats what are the odds keep your eyes on the massachusetts third congressional district as the state is stepping in after problems with the regular recount process in the democratic primary a recount to settle the tightly contested democratic primary in the third congressional district will take place over the next week under the watchful eye of secretary of state william galvin who said monday he was taking over the election departments of lawrence and lowell due to understaffing in one city and the irregular certification of primary ballots in the other galvin ordered the district wide hand recount of almost 89 000 ballots after andover s dan koh who is currently sitting in second place 122 votes behind the leader lori trahan filed the requisite signatures by last friday s deadline the state s chief elections officer galvin said the recount must be completed by sept 17 in order for him to have enough time to print ballots and get them to overseas and military voters ahead of the nov 6 general election this is a pretty heavily democratic district scoring a d 9 in the cook partisan voting index but who knows whether the recount fight will stir up bad blood on the democratic side meanwhile republican candidate rick green is unveiling a funny new ad this morning depicting himself swimming across the merrimack river in lowell mass while his brother waits in traffic on rourke bridge green is a former aerospace engineer with nasa and founder of 1a auto an auto parts manufacturer plus apparently he s a pretty good swimmer addendum deroy murdock with a sobering thought perhaps the absence of the fear and loathing that legitimately followed 9 11 has let us shift our energies from repelling a largely exterior threat to devouring each other instead as america s civil discourse devolves into a bloodless civil war between two sides that increasingly loathe each other maybe this is ironically a luxury seemingly freed of the dangers posed by al qaeda isis and their ilk we now have moved on to clobbering our fellow americans get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national
