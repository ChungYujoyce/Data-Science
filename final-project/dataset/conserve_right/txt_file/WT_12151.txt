orange head scarf or a cap when entering the site located in northern punjab province close to the pakistan border via kashmir an administration official said the white house nixed the visit over worries that photographs of the president at the temple wearing a scarf would add to mr obama s image problem as a muslim the white house became sensitized about the issue after a pew research center

sites mosques churches synagogues on foreign travel mr rhodes said we ll do so on this trip probably in indonesia so i think that the decision we made was driven by again the interests of time how to best advance our common interests with india in these three days and unfortunately we re not going to be able to get to get to every place we advanced a diplomatic official in new delhi told agence france presse last month that the head scarf is one issue and there were other logistical issues that led to the cancelation pla commissar visit despite the chinese military s break in relations with the pentagon over arms sales to taiwan china is sending the political commissar of beijing s national defense university ndu to washington this weekend lt gen liu yazhou will take part in the asean regional forum meeting of heads of defense universities that begins saturday at the ndu campus on fort lesley j mcnair gen liu is considered among the more hard line anti u s and anti japan military officers in china in 2005 when he was deputy commissar in the air force gen liu published a statement on the internet with other military officers protesting beijing s canceling of a symposium he had arranged on policy toward japan u s officials said the forum was blocked because of concerns about the potential impact on security during a period of anti japanese demonstrations the general is one of china s princelings as the privileged sons and daughter of senior communist officials are called he is the son in law of the late li xiannian former president of china and a member of the ruling politburo his wife is li xiaolin daughter of former chinese communist prime minister li peng gen liu also is a key promoter of china s large scale and largely secret military buildup he wrote the foreword to the recently published book china s dream which says china would replace the united states as the world s superpower the book promotes the chinese propaganda theme that china s rapid arms buildup is defensive mainly to avoid being attacked by the united states ndu china specialist phillip c saunders who reviewed the book for the jamestown foundation defended gen liu s foreword as brief noting that the general did not support the book s call for chinese military dominance mr saunders is viewed by critics as having sought to minimize china s military buildup he wrote in 2006 that china did not have the technological prowess to develop anti satellite weapons only to be embarrassed in january 2007 after china conducted its first successful test of a satellite destroying missile the ndu has a poor record of china studies despite being the joint staff think tank after congress mandated ndu s creation of a center for the study of chinese military affairs the first head was ronald montaperto who in 2006 pleaded guilty to charges of passing classified documents to chinese military intelligence gen liu raised eyebrows in asia last august when he was quoted in hong kong s phoenix magazine as saying if a system fails to let its citizens breathe freely and release their creativity to the maximum extent and fails to place those who best represent the system and its people into leadership positions it is certain to perish that raises the question of whether gen liu will be asked to comment on international efforts calling for the freedom for imprisoned nobel peace prize laureate liu xiaobo whom beijing has described as a criminal for his calls for political reform an ndu spokesman had no immediate comment donald d mosser dean of ndu s institute for national strategic studies and host for the meeting did not respond to an e mail asking whether gen liu will be questioned about the fate of mr liu who earlier this year was sentenced to 11 years in prison for helping
