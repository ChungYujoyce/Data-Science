apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hong kong ap it s still the world s freest economy one of the biggest global financial centers and a scenic haven for tycoons and tourists but the waves of protests rocking hong kong are exposing strains unlikely to dissipate as communist ruled beijing s influence grows the end of the former british colony s 50 year grace period after china took control in 1997 is years away and the protests have made only a minor dent in day to day business but they point to issues clouding the outlook as investors and residents fret that the city will lose its western style freedoms many in hong kong believe their future hinges on keeping the civil liberties independent courts and other advantages beijing promised to preserve for at least a half century after britain ceded control under an arrangement dubbed one country two systems top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender we re still talking about 28 years says grant strudwick vice president for asia for pinkerton which provides risk management services the spotlight is on china as to how they treat this transition period hong kong s economy once was about a fifth the size of china s now it s a tiny fraction of that thanks in no small part to an industrial boom driven by hong kong tycoons who set up factories across the border after china opened to outside investment in the 1970s the territory s success as a center for trade and investment is grounded in its independent legal system and the free flow of information said joseph cheng a political analyst and leader of a pro democracy coalition the alliance for true democracy these are two important assets enabling hong kong to have a distinct edge over major coastal cities in china like shanghai like shenzhen he said he believes that without further moves toward democracy hong kong will likely become more unstable confidence in the one country two systems experiment was already feeble when the top local leader chief executive carrie lam put forward legislation that would allow authorities to send suspects held in hong kong to face trial in mainland chinese courts that provide no assurances of independent judges due process and other western legal protections as tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of hong kong residents took to the streets in protests and business groups and foreign governments registered their concerns lam suspended the proposed legislation pro democracy activists have pressed on with the protests demanding she permanently withdraw the bill order an independent inquiry into heavy handed police tactics and resign on tuesday lam insisted that the extradition bill was dead hong kong s government also issued a statement saying it doesn t plan to implement the social credit system used in the mainland to penalize and reward behavior measured using various technologies including data processing and facial recognition that critics have described as orwellian most of the demonstrations have been peaceful though some have turned violent protesters vandalized the local legislative building earlier this month such sights might deter some investors but they also show the city is a world apart from the rest of china where public dissent is banned the protests are part of the checks and balances in place in hong kong that support institutional strength the ratings agency moody s said in a recent update the conservative think tank heritage foundation has ranked hong kong the freest economy for 25 straight years the city is the no 3 financial center according to an international survey of bankers behind new york and london it plays a pivotal role in financing for china and was the top location for initial public offerings in 2018 with nearly 37 billion raised as small as it is relative to china as a whole hong kong retains an outsized strategic role for beijing says ken courtis chairman of starfort investment holdings if trade tensions between the u s and china worsen further leading washington to curb financial activities of mainland companies in american markets hong kong s role for launching ipos could grow further he notes for now it s hong kong s proximity to china and its special status that make it such an important location for businesses analysts say strudwick said beijing s efforts to build a greater bay area encompassing hong kong and other parts of the manufacturing heavy pearl river delta are helping to integrate the territory more closely with neighbors such as guangzhou and shenzhen that might help revitalize its economy which expanded at an anemic 0 6 annual rate in the last quarter battered by slowing demand and trade tensions while unemployment is low bread and butter issues such as how to afford to live in a city with the world s priciest real estate are adding to frustrations salaries come nowhere close to matching the territory s per capita gdp of nearly 50 000 a year a reflection of the vast disparities in wealth between those living in villas on victoria peak and the majority occupying tiny apartments that sell for about 24 000 per square meter everything has changed i am not talking about democracy it seems no matter how hard you work your life remains hard in the past you could afford an apartment if you worked hard said a laundry shop worker who like many protest

residents taking to the streets in protest it s the better part of a lifetime it s how the social strata and those freedoms are managed that is going to be the focus of future potential protest
