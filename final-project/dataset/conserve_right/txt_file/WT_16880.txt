trucks and vans discarding kitchenware and other belongings that wouldn t fit they called us at 5 a m and by 8 a m they had arrived with demolition equipment said bi yan ao a 54 year old migrant worker who has lived in beijing for 13 years describing what it was like to have to move out of his apartment in daxing in just a few hours last week clutching his belongings in just one hour they flattened a 100 meter 330 foot long stretch of land how scary is that after that bi went to work with his relative at a shop selling cosmetics but then they were told this week they had a couple of days to move out on monday evening bi stood in the store surveying the piles of boxes of merchandise around him at a loss for what to do he teared up i want to cry he said i don t have anything left now last week the city launched a 40 day campaign to clear out tenants from buildings deemed unsafe after a massive fire killed 19 people at apartments rented mainly by low income chinese migrant workers the eviction drive has been met with widespread anger and criticism online with people saying it has laid bare the stark inequality in china that prevents poorer migrants who provide essential services in cities from enjoying the same status as the cities residents under china s much criticized household registration or hukou system chinese migrant workers who can t obtain hukou in the cities they work in are often denied access to subsidized health care education and social services most tenants living in such homes on the outskirts of the city are factory workers construction laborers delivery people drivers cleaners or hairdressers who come from poorer parts of china others run their own small wholesale businesses and shops selling cheap goods some have lived for years in the city with their children along the same street that bi was on the owner of a luggage store described a similar experience saying officials came and told her family to leave within days before the area was to be sealed off and demolished people have feelings we cannot accept this to be asked to leave suddenly said the store owner who gave only her surname yang we ve lived in beijing for a long time and it s not about how much contribution we ve made in the end we ve ended up with not even a place to live i feel sad so deeply sad a group of intellectuals signing an open letter to the central government urging the city to stop the evictions and provide temporary housing for the migrants one of the signatories independent political commentator zhang lifan said anger over the evictions showed that rapid economic growth has resulted in a massive accumulation of wealth and also rising inequality and a sense of unfairness zhang said many chinese were quick to extend a hand to displaced migrants because they too had once been in their shoes having worked their way up the socio economic ladder to secure a decent middle class life when they saw that the migrants had been evicted they realized that similar tragedies could have happened to them zhang said in the wake of the evictions individuals and organizations have offered to help displaced migrants with free accommodation wang qi an employee of a real estate company in langfang a nearby city in hebei province said it would provide apartments as temporary homes for the migrant workers free of charge for up to three months a posting online describing the offer said priority would be given to the sick elderly and pregnant our boss himself was once a migrant worker in beijing wang said but now that he has become wealthier he wants to help out the beijing work safety administration has denied that the campaign is aimed at driving out low income migrants saying it covers unsafe housing across the city the nov 18 fire in daxing district that killed 19 people including eight children was a very painful lesson for the government and the cleanup campaign was aimed at not allowing such a tragedy to be repeated a statement on the administration s website said it acknowledged that the evictions have caused temporary difficulties to people who have had to leave at short notice and it pledged to fix such problems the beijing city government said last year it plans to cap the city s population at 23 million by 2020 and cut by 15 percent the number of people in six main districts china labor bulletin spokesman geoffrey crothall says the evictions are part of an ongoing effort by the government to redevelop land and capitalize on rising land prices with the evictions the government is effectively driving out the backbone of the city s labor force crothall said beijing needs migrant workers to do all the low cost efficient service jobs that middle class beijingers depend upon said crothall but if you push them out of the city altogether then there is going to be no one to do those jobs liu reported from hong kong associated press re
