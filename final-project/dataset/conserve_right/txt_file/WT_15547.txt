on of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion while the united states negotiates with russia on dismantling america s nuclear arsenal china has become the world s busiest builder of nuclear weapons if america s allies especially in asia lose confidence in the u s nuclear deterrent the obama administration s vaunted pivot to the pacific will become irrelevant national security columnist bill gertz has just finished a series of reports about what the pentagon will not tell the american people china has just completed a series of intercontinental missile tests that mark the start of a new era for china s nuclear forces one in which they deploy missiles with multiple warheads and penetration aids mirvs two apparently successful tests of the jl 2 submarine launched ballistic missile signal that the two new operational type 94 jin class nuclear missile submarines of a fleet of five may soon start strategic patrols on land china s new df 41 mobile icbms are soon expected to demonstrate mirv capabilities and are estimated by some to be able to carry up to 10 warheads for about two decades american intelligence has been watching china s development of mirv warheads and has been commenting publicly on it since the 2002 issue of the pentagon s annual report to congress on china s military power an expected near term deployment of mirvs would add to already existing anxiety caused by the disparities between published u s estimates of china s arsenal several hundred nuclear weapons according to the u s strategic forces commander gen c robert kelher and 1 600 to 1 800 according to retired former russian strategic forces commander gen alexander yesin top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey adding further suspicion to the pentagon s official public estimates of china s arsenal was a late 2011 report by the georgetown university center for arms control which documented china s history of strategic use of underground tunnels and estimated that china has up to 3 000 miles of tunnels that can be used to store and move missiles and other weapons undetected the sheer vastness of china s strategic tunnel networks suggests they hide more than just a few hundred launchers but there is something else that the obama administration hasn t been telling taxpayers or congress about the nuclear balance wikileaked documents reflect growing u s and european anxieties about china s nuclear weapons during secret nato meetings in february 2008 an american undersecretary of state noted with alarm that the american nuclear stockpile had been cut by three quarters since 1968 meanwhile china is building up its nuclear arsenal and opposing the fissile materials cutoff treaty at another secret session in november 2008 also courtesy of wikileaks which took place in paris the british foreign office s director general for defense and intelligence mariot leslie wondered if china could be somewhat vulnerable to public pressure if we expose the fact that china is building more weapons while others are reducing their levels ms leslie observed that the chinese goal seems to be to catch up with the u s in weapons capabilities to avoid american strategic dominance in asia seeing the pax americana as a blip in world history in june of 2008 again wikileaks american diplomats pleaded with chinese counterparts in beijing to understand that the united states has not built any nuclear weapons since the early 1990s and therefore has the oldest arsenal in the world and underscored that the united states is the only p5 one of the five permanent members of the united nations security council country without the capability to produce a nuclear weapon this is common knowledge among strategists in washington who only recently have awakened to the realization that the united states is rapidly and involuntarily disarming the washington post recently devoted four full pages to this story three years ago washington post reporter walter pincus revealed that the united states had ceased to produce fogbank likely the code name for an aerogel suspended neutron booster which is a critical component in miniaturizing trident ii submarine launched ballistic missile warheads after decades of neglect the united states is losing the facilities infrastructure raw materials and most important the trained nuclear weapons workforce necessary to sustain a nuclear arsenal without fogbank it is likely that the half life of america s remaining and dwindling stock of nuclear weapons is about 12 years as the fog lifts the world can look forward to a pax sinica a chinese nuclear pre eminence in east asia and the pacific that will supplant a pax americana it makes one wonder if the obama administration has thought through its nuclear disarmament ideology as rep michael r turner chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on strategic forces counsels china s unprecedented military buildup requires that we as prudent national security thinkers must plan for the worst hope for the best and determine how to make clear to china where our interests lie china need not be a threat but if our history proves one thing it is that american timidity encourages aggression john j tkacik jr is senior fellow and director of the future asia project at the international assessment
