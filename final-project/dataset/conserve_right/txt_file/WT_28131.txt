ng home policy florida race for house seat becomes bellwether for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion the u s economy just delivered bad news to the white house the trump miracle economy is over second quarter growth was a paltry 2 1 percent and the american machine is unlikely to deliver significant wage increases booming corporate profits and double digit stock market gains in the months ahead lackluster economies sunk the reelection hopes of jimmy carter and george h w bush mr trump s polarizing debate with socialist democrats and the pain inflicted on midwestern farmers by chinese retaliation against his tariffs make matters worse many forces having nothing to do with who occupies the oval office negatively affect u s growth his trade wars notwithstanding china and europe are stuck in the mud and saddled by political dysfunction top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick president xi jinping s strategy for dictatorial control penalizes private companies and entrepreneurs to boost its highly inefficient state owned enterprises germany s trade surpluses require southern eu states to endure endless growth sapping trade deficits and german and italian banks are in terrible shape granted the u s economy is creating lots of jobs but america spends badly on labor force training universities graduate fewer than 60 percent of their students and inadequately prepare for high skill work many who manage to get a diploma mr trump s learn while you earn private sector apprenticeships are a great answer but parents simply won t accept not everyone should go to college those alibis are not enough however and the president and his top advisers national economic council director kudlow and treasury secretary mnuchin need some soul searching on the demand side growth must be driven by consumers spending businesses investing and fixing the trade deficit the latter sends too many consumer dollars abroad that don t come back to purchase u s goods consumer spending has proven robust but is shifting away from big ticket autos to high tech gadgets uber and other services notably a good deal of the job growth is low skilled occupations and highly skilled occupations the middle is hollowing out small wonder a good deal of poorly trained college diplomates end up at venues like starbucks and income inequality worsens sorry sen elizabeth warren that social malady is not a devious scheme cooked up in monopoly bank and corporate boardrooms what ails the economy most is foreign protectionism and the status of the dollar it is increasingly the currency used by businesses to transact international trade even when americans are not involved and by foreigners to invest their savings well off italians and brazilians would be nuts not to stash some of their wealth in dollar denominated assets and that pushes up the value of the dollar against other currencies our principal competitors china japan and germany have growth policies premised on undervalued currencies that cheapen exports and protect domestic manufacturing but mr trump s trade war is a bust the trade deficit is up over 100 billion on his watch efforts to pressure china are delivering a stalemate because he refuses to deliver the knockout punch for example he cut a deal with zte and is imposing only partial measures on huawei whereas absolute restrictions on their purchases of u s components and sanctions on foreign businesses and banks that enable their lawless behavior would put zte out of business and seismically shake huawei and mr xi s grasp on power china s economy has been hurt by tariffs but not so much that president xi can t punt until after the 2020 elections doing so could elect a democrat more enamored by middle kingdom socialism than interested in compelling it to behave like a civilized nation multinationals are diversifying supply chains from china despite the promises of trump trade adviser peter navarro factories have moved to other asian locations consequently american businesses are investing their tax cut money abroad and u s imports of manufactures are shifting their origins rather than creating new jobs here meanwhile chinese retaliation has pushed down u s exports the net effect is a bigger trade deficit that is an even
