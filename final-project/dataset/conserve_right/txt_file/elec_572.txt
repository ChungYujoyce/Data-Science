clinton a total disaster for america s closest middle east ally when i become president the days of treating israel as a second class citizen are over trump said in his speech before the american israel public affairs committee the country s most influential pro israel group hillary clinton and president obama have treated israel very very badly the front running trump s speech followed one by

a nuclear weapon in exchange for the lifting of billions in economic sanctions my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran trump said to applause it s a bad deal in a largely measured speech trump also argued that iran is a problem across the middle east supplying weapons to an array of terror related groups including hezbollah which he intends to eliminate we will totally dismantle iran s global terror network trump said believe me a planned walkout by some rabbis during trump s speech did not appear to happen trump also said he would move the u s embassy from tel aviv

groups including the taliban al qaeda and the islamic state kasich says he would like to move the u s embassy to jerusalem but that it s not a priority he also said he would suspend the nuclear deal because iran has already invalidated it with recent ballistic missile tests aipac bills itself as nonpartisan and has never endorsed a candidate yet the organization has delved into highly partisan political debates over issues of interest to israel most recently and notably the nuclear deal which it vehemently opposed clinton and sanders support the deal cruz said he would move the u s embassy to jerusalem a perennial republican campaign promise america will stand with israel and defeat terror he added we need a president who will stand with israel clinton as secretary of state oversaw the
