apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the power demands of modern life require the infusion of fuel and the disposal of resulting waste if the nation is to move beyond fossil fuels common sense dictates that a future run on clean energy must include a robust role for emissions free nuclear power while building a dependable supply chain for nuclear fuel the trump administration must take steps to break the long standing deadlock over its hazardous end product president trump is mulling several proposals for ensuring the nation s uranium stockpiles remain sufficient for both military and commercials needs as described in a recent op ed by heritage foundation policy experts steven moore and katie tubb in this publication the creation of a federal uranium security stockpile admittedly would saddle taxpayers with a bill exceeding 1 billion over a decade for purchasing and storing a reserve few shortages would prove more costly during a time of armed conflict though than the failure to fuel the nation s nuclear powered arsenal or keep the lights on in american homes ensuring the nuclear fuel supply is half the battle the other half is solving the nuclear waste storage dilemma the president who has won trade concessions from the ruthless chinese and even prevailed upon implacable democrats to sign a long delayed trade agreement with canada and mexico should put his deal making skills to work in ending a generation of opposition to a permanent u s repository for nuclear waste top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk in a prime example of political farce a nuclear storage facility burrowed under a desolate mountain range in nevada at a cost of more than 15 billion sits silent and empty a warren of underground tunnels and storage vaults the yucca mountain project is nearly ready for use but strident political opposition led by nevada s congressional delegation and backed by anti nuke activists has halted the issuance of government permits required for its opening as a result washington has shelled out more than 7 billion in taxpayer funded fines to public utilities that have funded the project and have been denied its use for disposal of spent nuclear material that is an expensive waste still in light of the view that all politics is local obstruction is understandable given a choice who wouldn t assail a nuclear dump in his backyard that would require radiation monitoring for 10 000 years a land of hundreds of millions of citizens faces issues that transcend the local level though and some controversial decisions must serve the national interest nuclear waste disposal is such an issue toddlers may delight in dirt and grime but most americans prefer their environs clean the green revolution campaigning for a world energized by sunlight and breezes isn t ready for prime time only supplying about 11 percent of the energy consumed by americans in 2018 according to the u s energy information administration in contrast nuclear reactors supply about 20 percent and like renewable sources and unlike fossil fuels don t emit greenhouse gases clearly there is no rational way to advance the nation s clean energy goals without a nuclear component a blue ribbon commission appointed to review nuclear fuel cycle policy recommended in 2012 that the federal government abandon yucca mountain and select a new repository location with the consent of state and local officialdom amidst a hypersensitive political era in which half the country still yammers for the overturning of the 2016 presidential election reaching unanimity on a nuclear waste site is as likely turning up the remains of jimmy hoffa congressional democrats are wedded to the green philosophy that shuns nuclear energy for its historical association with the world s most powerful weaponry they have successfully blocked funding for revival of the yucca mountain licensing process and if they have their way nuclear power could eventually be banned for lack of storage space for depleted fuel sen john barrasso wyoming republican introduced a measure last month to determine whether the nevada storage site should be cleared for operation while also funding construction of a temporary facility to contain waste currently held in 39 states if we re serious about reducing carbon emissions in a meaningful way we need to get serious about dealing with nuclear waste mr barrasso said in a statement there is no safer repository for spent uranium than the remote nevada wilderness mr trump should throw his weight behind legislation to end the deadlock and finally put to good use the billions american taxpayers have spent on yucca
