apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic toronto canada is dealing with its own problems with beijing as president trump prepares to sign phase 1 of his trade deal with china on wednesday some officials north of the border are worried that the u s deal will take pressure off beijing to release canadians imprisoned in china for over a year canada s relations with china its second largest trading partner after the u s have badly deteriorated as ottawa tries to balance competing demands from washington and beijing several canadians including a well known diplomat have been languishing in chinese prisons since their arrests after canada detained huawei s meng wanzhou one of china s best known tech executives on an extradition request from the trump administration see also schumer rips china trade agreement as result of 2020 campaign politics former canadian diplomat michael kovrig and businessman michael spavor both living in china were arrested on dec 10 2018 just days after ms meng was detained they remain in jail as ms meng the daughter of the founder of huawei prepares to fight extradition to the u s in addition to the detentions of canadian nationals a furious beijing cut its imports of canadian canola peas pork and other meat prime minister justin trudeau faces a tough decision on whether to allow huawei to build part of canada s 5g telecommunications infrastructure in the face of warnings from washington that huawei represents a security risk all of this means hard times are in store for canada and china said margaret mccuaig johnston senior fellow at the university of alberta s china institute canada is suffering in the wake of the u s extradition request and the phase 1 deal will be another blow because pressuring china to buy more american agriculture means they will buy less from canada that hurts our farmers and reduces our influence she said canada has asked the u s to delay its phase 1 deal until the canadians are released but that doesn t look likely ms mccuaig johnston said canada has even less leverage while it waits for the u s congress to pass the updated north american free trade agreement chinese officials have openly mocked canadian efforts to get u s help in their fight with china while warning americans not to get involved if you pull chestnuts out of the fire for others you will end up being the one getting burned said geng shuang a spokesperson for the chinese foreign ministry many canadians worry that mr trump s confrontational trade stance with beijing and his willingness to cut a bilateral deal just for american producers will end up hurting canadian exporters the phase 1 deal is bad news for canada and we can t do a thing about it columnist barrie mckenna wrote this week in the toronto based globe and mail newspaper ratcheting up the pressure china s pressure on canada has been growing in incremental steps two other canadians were arrested in china and charged with drug offenses that include the death penalty in 2018 the fashion outlet canadian goose faced a short lived boycott of its flagship store in china while huawei bids for a contract to expand telecommunications in canada s far north and sell its equipment for the nation s 5g network china has declared itself a near arctic nation intent on claiming a piece of the arctic s resources even though it has no coastline there ms mccuaig johnston said canada and the u s share an interest in the arctic and arctic security but she worries that china plans to build military support structure in the arctic and that the u s will not push back as the climate warms the northwest passage the waterway linking the atlantic and pacific oceans through the arctic is becoming more commercially navigable canada considers this route inside its national boundaries because it runs through its arctic island archipelago however the u s and china see the passage as international waters that they can freely transit with commercial and military vessels china s behavior is getting worse with its militarization of the islands in the south china sea and boldness in holding canadians hostage and countering that will be a tricky challenge for mr trudeau ms mccuaig johnston said although much of the global economic growth in the past 30 years has been fueled by expanding global trade and interconnected trade networks the u s and china are seeking ways to decouple that relationship said guy saint jacques former canadian ambassador to china china has declared it wants to be a model for the world and decouple itself from its dependency on foreign suppliers while at the same time canada is pulling back from its plans to expand business with china while canadian citizens remain in its jails he said the battle over huawei and 5g in canada and europe is forcing some global supply chains to choose between the two camps mr saint jacques added that debate is also taking place in canadian academic circles where pressure from china is squelching criticism he said although the west would like to ensure china plays by its rules as it steps up as a global superpower chinese officials believe mr trump needs a deal with them more than they need a deal with the u s he said wesley wark a history professor at the university of ottawa told the cnbc financial news network that tensions are forcing
