is facing some brutal odds this super tuesday in his quixotic quest to wrest the gop presidential nomination from incumbent donald trump weld who lost to trump by nearly 96 percentage points in iowa and nearly 77 in new hampshire then watched helplessly as nevada and south carolina ceded all delegates to the president rather than hold elections has not as an official candidate polled higher than 14 percent in any of the 13 states worth a combined 785 delegates voting tuesday trump s margin in national polls has not dipped below 80 percentage points since october and his approval rating among republicans rests at 93 percent the president s combined campaign finance juggernaut is outraising weld by a ratio of 300 to 1 and yet the perpetually chipper redhead still sees some upside to his long shot bid more than half of super tuesday states including trump averse utah have not been polled in his home state of massachusetts weld was endorsed by the boston globe in an effort to salvage time honored conservative principles and to change the shabby tone of the trump era and though he no longer dreams of being 1992 pat buchanan or 1968 eugene mccarthy robert mueller s old boss does hold out hope that his minor electoral contribution might yet be enough to derail the 2020 trump train steve bannon said that if the president loses four percent of the traditional republican vote he cannot be re elected weld told me in a phone interview monday afternoon if that s true that s a marker i can meet and it would not pain me to think that i had some responsibility for bringing it about that donald j trump was not re elected president weld who has campaigned consistently on reducing debt deficits updating 1990s flavored moderate conservative reform for the 21st century and railing against trump s unfitness also told me that he still thinks the republican party might go the way of the whigs and that a strong third party including centrist democrats and centrist libertarians might rise from the ashes in 2021 or 2022 he also said he would back joe biden or michael bloomberg if they became the democratic presidential nominee though not sen bernie sanders i vt at this time the following is a lightly edited transcript of our conversation reason what results do you need to see tomorrow to stick in until wednesday weld well i ll be sticking in anyway i mean we ve got michigan coming up on the 10th we ve got florida coming up on the 17th so i don t want to miss those in terms of tonight i would say my top three states are probably vermont massachusetts and utah i ve been endorsed by evan mcmullin who got 20 percent plus in utah last time had some very nice visits out there with the latter day saints folks who i get along with very well so that s why that s in the top three colorado is an open primary and i think unpredictable i m not predicting victory there but that could be an interesting state california likewise not predicting victory because it s a closed primary but trump has really declared open war on california so that could be of interest otherwise i d like to see what happens in texas and north carolina tennessee it should be an enjoyable evening reason what have you learned in this process since you jumped in weld i ve learned that the duopoly in washington d c is every bit as bad as gary johnson and i thought it was four years ago it s really paralyzing the country and preventing forward motion when you have a president of the united states who shares that poisonous view and is vengeful into the bargain that makes it even worse so that s what i ve learned it s all about washington d c the bad stuff it s not about the state capitals and states it s not about the trump voters i think it s about donald trump the increased negativity reason what have you observed on a state by state level including even in massachusetts to the extent that it s relevant about the way that trump and the national gop has muscled in on state gops or that just state gops know that in order to be popular you need to stay in good with the president weld well no it s not that they re inferring anything it s that they re told things because once the republican national committee merged its operations with the trump campaign then from that point forward the republican state committee in every single state was is and remains the trump organization so it doesn t pay me to try to bark up that tree my strategy needs to be and has been to try to increase the number of people voting in the republican primary more women more younger voters more minorities et cetera et cetera just voters who are perhaps marginally more likely to rally to my flag than a classical republican voter who s voted in the last five republican primaries reason you mentioned that the duopoly is every bit as strong if not stronger and yet we re on the verge of having trump who was an outsider take over the republican party and mold it in his image largely and bernie sanders is on the verge of being a democratic socialist independent who might do the same with the democratic party what do you make of that paradox so the duopoly is super strong and yet vulnerable to takeover by kind of anti establishment figures weld well i m not sure sanders is going to get there frankly most people seem to think that he will i think donald trump essentially cemented his takeover of what i ll call the trump faction of the republican party when 52 republican senators not only said we don t want to hear any evidence they also said we really don t want to consider whether you should be removed from office although the constitution requires us to do so that was not a good showing and i know that a number of them have said to the press on background since their vote i did it because of fear i did it because i was fearful the president would run somebody against me to my right in the primary and i would lose my seat i ll tell you if that was the case with me i would never have admitted that to anybody on or off the record that s a shameful admission reason you and i talked a lot in 2017 and 2018 when you were still doing a lot of activities within the libertarian party you had an analysis of the republican party facing a future in which maybe they go the way of the whigs maybe they kind of split apart and get reborn anew into something else or explode i want you to re evaluate that analysis and then also might that be happening on the democratic side as well weld well victory is a wonderful salve and if the democrats win the election i don t think that ll happen democratic side on our side yeah no i think the same thing i did last time and this time because of their votes to acquit without hearing any evidence i think the republican senators are vulnerable this year i saw this happen with the nixon impeachment when people who had gone through the draining exercise of defending president richard nixon all summer long and saying there s insufficient evidence that he knew about the watergate conspiracy to tank the jaworski investigation they lost their seats including people like rep wiley mayne from iowa who had won handsomely before but was voted out i mean they looked kind of ridiculous i m not sure that a number of the republican senators this time around don t look ridiculous so i think there s a decent chance that the republicans will lose the senate then you could see some finger pointing and forces at play that could cause a split up of the party similar to the split up of the whigs in the 1850s with the know nothing faction which was founded on anti immigrant prejudice it was all the catholics from germany and italy and ireland that they hated and they had violent rallies and they had conspiracy theories it s a carbon copy of the trump faction now but they did pinwheel out into outer space and were never heard from again except for speaker nathaniel banks of the massachusetts house who also became speaker of the u s house i think but he was an outlier so i think that could happen again and i m not sure it d be a bad thing you might see a third party a strong third party not a single issue third party emerge out of the remnants of traditional republicans some centrist democrats some centrist libertarians that could be an interesting party i ll just call it the unity party for the time being that s something that could happen but it s not going to happen in 2020 it would be 2021 2022 reason it s not hard to look at your situation and see some pretty bad math so what are some glass half full analyses of the numbers going into tomorrow even if there are some lopsided defeats weld well although you d always like to win any contest you get into and i m no stranger to long odds my first governor s race i won even though i started at sub asterisk levels and everyone laughed and said you got to get out of this race however i do think that of the reasons that i m running number one is i think i could start monday on the job and i have half a dozen things that i think desperately need doing but number two is and the reason i ran as a republican this time as opposed to a libertarian one of the reasons is that every vote for me even a write in vote for me is not a vote for trump steve bannon said that if the president loses 4 percent of the traditional republican vote he cannot be re elected i don t know whether bannon was being serious or not but he s usually serious and if that s true that s a marker i can meet and it would not pain me to think that i had some responsibility for bringing it about that donald j trump was not re elected president reason i know you don t spend a lot of time commenting on the democratic race for obvious reasons but is it safe to assume that if it s candidate biden or bloomberg you would vote or encourage people to vote democrat and if it s candidate sanders you re going to wait and see who the libertarians nominate weld that s exactly correct next federal court invalidates lake erie bill of rights matt welch is an editor at largeatreason show comments 98 editor s note we invite comments and request that

professional fake libertarian gaslighting to be fair we also dont care what welch says just like most of us never cared what chris matthews said the operative phrase in that every conservative writer you know conservative writers likely don t give the current t reason staff the time of day the ones that do are probably folks like george will or bill kristol who don t even get invited to cpac anymore because they were exposed so badly as hypocrites by their tds or maybe maybe jonah goldberg who got drummed out of national review by the readers and is now positioning himself to be kristol2 0 so yeah go ahead and off the entire staff of the weekly standard nobody will notice grifter gonna grift i wonder if old bill realized that welch was secretly fantasizing about hacking him to bits geld is another neoliberal democrat who gets his jollies pretending to be anything other than what he really is welchie boy wants to kill conservatives not his fellow neoliberals he s just running for the free drinks even fourth tier candidates can drink for free at their miniscule campaign events now would be a good time to throw a big cocktail party in new york or washington and invite every single conservative writer you know redwedding2 welch would still not get a cocktail party invitation perpetually chipper redhead this sounds like a future commenter s screen name steve bannon said that if the president loses four percent of the traditional republican vote he cannot be re elected weld told me in a phone interview monday afternoon if that s true that s a marker i can meet and it would not pain me to think that i had some responsibility for bringing it about that donald j trump was not re elected president after complimenting hillary clinton while pretending to be a libertarian in 2016 weld admits he s trying to help democrats win in 2020 possibly a socialist bill weld is a joke even if trump could not or did not want to take the republican nomination republicans would not pick bill weld to be the republican candidate bill weld s sole purpose in the campaign is to make sure that republicans lose he also said he would back joe biden or michael bloomberg if they became the democratic presidential nominee so he s for gun control and medicaid for all well he supported clinton too so yes that s why reason has always supported him they are from the self described even this article quixotic libertarian party unreason supports bill weld because he is willing to keep libertarians and republicans from destroying the democrat party bill weld has always been a democrat but there are no real barriers to people signing up for whatever political party they want it is the east coast show vote form of libertarianism they dont actually want wins because then they d have to do hard work and work their philosophy inside of reality they prefer the amash level of effort of shallow votes on principle while not actually integrating their goals with a populace that doesnt fully accept their principles i m not saying two parties only is the best way but if the two parties were libertarians and the other party was libertarian ish the voters would have to pick the better of two good rather than the lesser of two evils use incrementalism to return to government fiscal sanity i thought weld pretended to be republican he s not even trying anymore he pretended to be libertarian last time who on earth cares what bill weld thinks says or does seriously he supported hillary clinton last go around what a joke bill weld is a joke but hey idiots still give him money so weld might as well get lunch on that money while campaigning no republican wants bill weld no libertarian wants bill weld i am so glad that trump won in 2016 and bill weld never got near the white house go away asshole bill weld i m not dropping out after super tuesday that s nice am i supposed to care yup bill who bill weld was never any competition to donald trump anyway actually he s convinced me to vote in the republican primary in michigan for the first time in my life i ll be voting against some county spending anyway but still anecdotally he s having the opposite effect from what he hopes then go bill weld help make sure voters don t pick politicians like you and vote to cut government spending and centrist libertarians that is as funny as the concept of a centrist state socialist or a centrist authoritarian libertarians are centrist on a l r political spectrum while libertarianism is a spectrum range of positions that range never included bill weld gayjay dragged bill weld along for the ride and we knew that neither would ever be in the white house i might as well announce that i m not dropping out after super tuesday either and neither is my wife morgan fairchild yeah that s the ticket awww that s cute sure bill you can have some more time to play in the sandbox if you want to as many commenters already made note why right this article why not maybe right an article about oh i don t know a libertarian candidate why does this site give so much press to the parties it purports to detest why not right articles showing how freedom and liberty have the solutions to these problems instead of just pointing out the problems so often i mean you could have written an article about jacob hornberger instead of bill weld but maybe you thought this was more interesting or important somehow really an article about vermin supreme would have had more opportunity to showcase the strengths of the libertarian philosophy rather than an article about this guy terran why right this article should ve left this article am i write haha yeah you got me more to your point i think this was a worthwhile read if nothing else it was a good laugh at the walking absurdity that is bill weld i didn t get the feeling that mr walsh was necessarily promoting the old flip flopper definitely agree though that i would like to see more articles about libertarian candidates particularly hornberger and jorgensen unreason staff hates libertarians because libertarians were mean to them trump is a meanie too no libertarian would dream of endorsing bloomberg can we stop pretending this statist clown is one of us weld isn t a long shot he s a no shot literally he s so far down there that if trump died tomorrow weld would still lose and why is a nominally libertarian publication promoting a candidate whose express purpose is to make sure the less libertarian major party candidate wins rhetorical question reason is only nominally libertarian these days unreason is so fucked up and lying about being anything libertarian unreason is not even covering any libertarian candidate or any pro libertarian ballot issue anywhere in the voting states today yeah i m wondering if the nominally is even deserved at this point unfortunately reason not totally devoid of libertarian news magazine still makes it better than many alternatives the comments are not the articles you can find the same propaganda nonsense at nbc ap npr fox politico vox i do think they get some credit for criminal justice reform occupational license stuff including the engineer traffic light story and 1st and 2nd amendment issues but it s becoming fewer and farther between and doesn t even always make the case from a strict libertarian pov demonstrably untrue welch has covered libertarian candidates clearly its not a huge part of reason s coverage by why would it be there are a bunch of libertarian podcasts websites etc that spend very little time covering the lp is tom woods now a fucked up libertarian too just because he doesn t really cover the lp on his podcast except for a random episode here and there as if it matters trump s outgunned primary challenger says he d endorse biden and bloomberg but not sanders and that republicans might still go the way of the whigs this isn t particularly surprising since weld effectively endorsed hillary clinton when he was running for vice president on the libertarian ticket in 2016 here s welch s former colleague kennedy skewering weld to his face for it too https www youtube com watch v jfrp4sny8 0 no one in the libertarian party should care what weld has to say about anything and hardly anyone in the republican party knows who he is much less what he s saying kennedy is probably the only true libertarian on corporate media right now bill weld i m not dropping out after super tuesday let s see if anyone notices and it would not pain me to think that i had some responsibility for bringing it about that donald j trump was not re elected president because what says libertarian more than aiding socialism the only evidence that utah is trump adverse that is ever offered is the 2016 election results were there was a mormon constitutional party nominee on the ballot who was well known in utah politics this isn t evidence trump is unpopular he did really well in wyoming and idaho who are number 3 and number 2 respectively in mormon population trump did really well in the mormon counties in these states trump also won 6 of the top 10 states with the largest mormon population washington oregon hawaii and nevada are the other four he didn t lose these states because he underperformed with mormons if the recent reaction to romney s impeachment vote is any indication trump is plenty popular in utah the fact was was that utah was never competitive and many voters decided to cast a vote for someone they knew knowing it didn t matter weld is a rino i rarely use that term and unlike romney he isn t mormon weld basically rolled over and let the dems rub his belly when he was mass governor agreeing to every tax hike they sent to him and the big dig i wouldn t even call him a rino he also was a big fan of law and order lock em up policies so definitely not a libertarian either he s a narcissistic schmuck basically his nomination as vp was one of the main reasons i had misgivings about voting for johnson though i did in the end yep and i regret it now what s the point of throwing my vote away based on principle for a party that isn t doing a good job following those principles i and others have mentioned it before but the party s reaction to kaitlin bennett s incident at ohio u showed me a complete lack of understanding of the nap the fact was was that utah was never competitive and many voters decided to cast a vote for someone they knew knowing it didn t matter weld is a rino i rarely use that term and unlike romney he isn t mormon he is also and i will admit this is anecdotal based upon my personal experience with some very devout mormons my mom s family is very mormon and very large one cousin has ten kids and another 9 at the time of my grandma s death there were 6 kids three of whom belonged to the church 37 grandkids 120 great grandkids almost 75 of the lds my best man and best friend since childhood was also lds they are almost uniformly pro trump some extremely so i argued with them quite a bit in 2016 about it why wouldn t mormons be happy with trump he leaves them alone got lower taxes rates need large incomes to support 9 10 kids and exposed how bad mitt romney is for utah basically someone has to be the gay candidate now that pete has quit a day or two after ruby ridge bill weld was extolling the federal agents who assassinated vicki weaver and sammy weaver weld was lamenting the loss of a hero william degan one of the assassins exactly this guy makes trump look like an angel which is not an easy feat maybe evan mcmullen will fill that role steyer blew something over 200m wasting our time with his hot air i can only hope that weld blows his bottom dollar in a similar effort he spent 3500 on every vote he got sorry flagged your comment by mistake trying to kill stupid popup video serious question why do you go work for the weld campaign or even more puzzling volunteer for weld for president he ain t winning he ain t even making a serious statement i get why weld might do it it raises his personal profile and he does get some credit from the establishment for being a nevertrumper but if you are a 26 year old polysci major and you want to build a career in politics weld my neighbor s son was a wanna be paramedic but couldn t pass the tests so his dad got him a job with a couple of local d campaigns and he went and got a job working for bloomberg s original presidential run then he worked for biden for a few years now he s pretty high up in the biden campaign that s a career path that makes sense pick the right ass to kiss and you can come along for the ride but weld that s not even a stepping stone that s kinda like having bulkhead engineer for the titanic on your resume yet presumably he has donors and volunteers and a staff and everything opensecrets org william f weld r i don t think weld has much of anything as of february 21 2020 he has 18 190 cash on hand and no campaign donations weld spent 1 834 341 out of 1 852 532 as of jan 31 2020 almost 2 million in donations seems nuts to me cut that check to me i ll put it to better use hell bender would put it to better use on hookers and blow cash on hand 18 190 debts 250 800 lol that is a huge scam and everyone in the beltway knows it lefties blame trump for stiffing contractors iirc some of that was from bankrupt casinos some of its straight bullshit since new contractors worked with trump all the time 250 800 means that someone is getting actually stiffed and there will be no bankruptcy politicans never want to leave unclaimed in those campaigns weld is finished and he knows it so he s running up as much as he can before the credit and donation river runs dry everybody stiffs contractors occasionally the very reason you only pay part up front and the rest on completion to your satisfaction is that it allows you to stiff them if they don t finish the work or screw something up and as a general rule nobody gives politicians unsecured loans unless they mean for them to be donations disguised as loans everybody knows politicians spend every cent they can get or borrow and then welsh on their campaign debts and how many of those expenditures were on liquor i m betting at least 10 who dis dis is reason s favorite libertarian a man who who now double plus good status at reason hq because he doesn t like the bad orange man ugh i guess edit buttons are for the bourgeois how can he drop out when he never dropped in weld tune out drop out drop dead while your still not ahead pick me as the republican candidate or i m voting democrat yeah that ll work most amusing i ll be voting for him today would it be too much for hilary to at least mumble it s his turn bill weld is such a snake i ll bet that mr trump is endorsing bernie sanders too mr trump can t wait to mop the floor with him in the national debates does hold out hope that his minor electoral contribution might yet be enough to derail the 2020 trump train wow someone needs to tell mr bill to step away from the crack pipe every time bill weld opens his mouth while running as a libertarian yet endorsing democrats and democrat principles yet claiming to also somehow be a republican and vouching for the viability of made up parties like centrist democrats i realize just how sane and viable of a candidate john mcafee is bill can you please just fade away into history already the worldwide political paradigm i e initiation of force fraud is a disaster to liberty no matter who rules just as benevolent dictator is an oxymoron so is benevolent ruler representative politician the lessor disaster is still a disaster if you prefer to compromise and accept a disaster to avoid a worse disaster you have accepted a false alternative accept neither disaster no disaster at all reject the coercive paradigm completely be consistent be principled be practical moral it s only logical reply i gave upon the dems to vote for ed clark in 1980 reading this interview with welds almost makes me sorry i didn t change my registration this morning to vote against him having him on the lib ticket in 16 was a big mistake i think i dislike him more than any of the 2020 dems i m considering voting in the gop primary and just writing in funk bill weld weld is such a snake endorse bloomberg every libertarian should be upset about this schmuck first he promised to stay with the lp then reiterated he planned to stay in the lp then after about a month ditched the lp and returned to the gop let s not forget how he shunned lp candidates in 2016 in alaska new hampshire why spend time on weld he has had no support at all up to this point and new england is his strength he basically doesn t even exist who wants to know about what bill weld thinks lol https computerdeskcorner com tresanti adjustable height desk review bill weld the power addict sara have made 17448 buck last month by working online from home i am a student and doing

hungry sack of shit too bad reason goes out of their way to give this hack press he was never a libertarian his own policies and his own words prove that he should ve just ran on the demonrat ticket he is a big government asshole through and through and the libertarian party destroyed any credibility by backing the johnson and this jerk if bill weld is a republican then bernie is a libertarian he
