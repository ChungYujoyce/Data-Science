persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump took a victory lap as global oil prices ticked up slightly monday a day after his personal diplomacy helped nail down a deal among russia saudi arabia and other major players to cut production in response to an unprecedented collapse in demand because of the covid 19 pandemic mr trump hinted that the size of the cut may be even larger than the top suppliers revealed but the modest price increase indicated that traders still have a lot of skepticism analysts said it is far too soon to tell whether the agreement will help raise rock bottom oil prices but mr trump latched onto the pact to claim a badly needed policy win as the economy craters top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time indeed some analysts said the president deserved credit for putting public pressure on moscow and riyadh to end the brutal price war while shielding u s producers from committing to further reductions or allowing washington to be sucked into the feud the u s has been of two minds about the price war mr trump originally touted the sharp fall in prices for consumers as massive production led to a vast oversupply but with oil prices under 25 a barrel and heading lower mr trump was looking at pain in texas and other oil producing states that he is counting on for his reelection this fall brent crude prices the international standard rose 26 cents monday to close at 31 74 a barrel after sharp declines last week brent crude is still down by some 55 since the start of the year u s benchmark crude rose more than 1 before closing the day down 35 cents to settle at 22 41 a barrel the weekend agreement between russia and the saudi led opec calls for suppliers to cut daily output by about 9 7 million barrels a day about 10 the reductions are to be phased out by 2022 the president took to twitter and boasted of an even grander scale and said american frackers and drillers will be the big winners once the economy reopens having been involved in the negotiations to put it mildly the number that opec is looking to cut is 20 million barrels a day not the 10 million that is generally being reported mr trump said if anything near this happens and the world gets back to business from the covid 19 disaster the energy industry will be strong again far faster than currently anticipated saudi estimates offering at least some support for mr trump s hints saudi energy minister prince abdulaziz bin salman al saud said the deal will result in a de facto daily cut of about 19 5 million barrels when taking into account other factors such as cuts by non opec countries and the movement of oil to reserve stockpiles rather than to market energy analysts say it s hard to overstate the role mr trump played in securing the landmark deal his public demands on russia and saudi arabia and his behind the scenes negotiations with the leaders of both countries seem to have dramatically changed the tone of talks in the past week when mexico s government balked at the cuts it would be forced to make as part of the deal mr trump stepped in friday to say he would help mexico recoup some of its losses many of us believed given how the saudis were digging in how the russians were digging in that we would get no offramp in this price war until the june opec meeting helima croft managing director at rbc capital markets said during a conference call hosted by the atlantic council president trump s intervention i think really changed the trajectory of this crisis still it could take months before the true impact of the deal is felt and it remains to be seen whether such a large cut in supply will make up for a sharp contraction in demand as countries shut down their economies to fight the pandemic the cut of 9 7 million barrels per day doesn t take effect until may 1 and it s not entirely clear when nations will begin to lift social distancing orders which have ground domestic and international travel to a halt and slashed demand for gasoline as a result early signs however were mostly positive the international benchmark brent crude price rose by 2 1 closing at 32 14 per barrel overall prices have fallen by about 60 since the beginning of the year and analysts warned that they would have dropped further without the russia opec truce the final terms of the agreement also represented a win for u s oil and gas producers on two major fronts the american fuel sector had urged mr trump to steer clear of imposing tariffs on foreign fuel imports a move he threatened earlier this month if russia and opec didn t cut output because such a strategy they argued could raise the prices of production materials for u s firms they also praised mr trump for ensuring that the u s oil industry did not have to make concrete promises to cut their own production even further a condition russia and other producers had pushed for early in negotiations u s producers who have higher costs that rivals in saudi arabia and russia say they ve already cut output in response to market factors and that the weekend agreement merely brought the rest of the world onto the same playing field u s praise for deal industry groups and a number of republicans from oil patch states on capitol hill hailed the agreement senate energy and natural resources committee chairwoman lisa murkowski said monday she was glad the saudis and russians are taking a step back from their economic warfare against u s producers and i thank president trump and energy secretary dan brouillette for their leadership in reaching this agreement the alaska republican said she and two gop colleagues talked with saudi minister al saud for two hours saturday to push the production cutting deal we commend the president s leadership and his administration s diplomatic engagement to urge nations to bring global oil supply in line with the lower energy demand as a result of the pandemic mike sommers president and ceo of the american petroleum institute said in a statement but a win for the u s seems to be a major loss for russia according to some analysts as the coronavirus economic shutdown began last month moscow initially resisted calls to cut its own oil production early talks with saudi arabia centered on russia cutting around 300 000 barrels per day a number the kremlin refused to meet the final deal calls on russia to cut more than 2 5 million barrels each day entering a price war with saudi arabia was a strategic mistake and now we re paying the price a much higher price than we could have paid andrey kortunov director of the kremlin founded russian international affairs council told worldoil com this looks like a victory for the u s and russia ends up a bigger loser than saudi arabia despite its huger reserves russia is facing a tough dilemma lower oil prices versus lower oil output evghenia sleptsova an analyst with oxford economics told the moscow times our analysis shows that the impact on gdp of either oil at 25 a barrel or output at 9 7 million barrels per day is almost the same both cost about 2 2 3 of gdp under the russia opec deal production will drop by 9 7 million barrels per day for two months beginning may 1 for six months after that the reduction will be 7 7 million barrels per day the reductions will gradually decrease
