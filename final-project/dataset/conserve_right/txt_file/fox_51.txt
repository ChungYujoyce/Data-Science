yesterday morning we lost power here and the winds have not died down and have continued to grow right now you can tell that the wind is gusting over 100 miles per hour from where i m standing if i m going to step away for a second to give you an idea of the storm s wrath and the rage of the storm the eye is going to pass about 40 miles we believe to our west so we re right on the side of the storm you can see trees split in half across our parking lot from the secure location that we are located to the tree about four feet around it stands about 10 feet above ground you know i ve been in 10 hurricanes but i ve got to tell you this one is the most powerful one that i felt this far away from the center and it s been just nonstop the storms here in key largo started yesterday at about 11 00 p m we left the area on the ocean side storm the east side of the key the water has already come up about three feet and was headed towards the interstate here on the bayside it has not yet gotten that high at all the wind and rain is battering us we know that also evacuations here began several days ago people that stay for andrew 25 years ago saw the picture saw the video coming out of the

different picture for now here in the central part of the state sixty seven counties in the state of florida 58 of the 67 counties chris are under hurricane warning that is just extraordinary and now it aposs become a guessing game after hitting landfall in the keys as to where irma goes next twenty four hours ago all the attention on the storm shifted to the west coast and now towns like naples and fort myers and sarasota and saint pete aposs and tampa out now bracing for the possibility of severe impact we were in tampa yesterday and again last night in downtown was nearly empty evacuation orders given out for more than 6 million statewide and the governor rick scott had this final message late yesterday begin video clip scott i m a dad and i m a grandfather i love my family more than

end tweet hotels are sold out more than 400 shelters have opened housing more than 120 000 floridians and these numbers are massive chris you can drive 50 miles to the east the atlantic ocean in daytona beach or you can drive 80 miles to the west and tampa florida and the gulf of mexico it is likely over the next 24 hours the entire width of the state of florida it will feel hurricane force winds never in recorded history has the united states had two cat four hurricanes hit in the same season but yet it is happening now as we wait here in orlando chris back to you in washington wallace bill hemmer reporting from orlando and the calm before the storm there bill thank you now let aposs get the latest track on irma aposs path over the next few hours chief meteorologist rick reichmuth is in the fox weather center in new york rick rick reichmuth fox news chief meteorologist hi chris so first of all today is the statistical peak of hurricane season september 10th very appropriate we are watching the storm right now on our shores continuing to pull up towards the north a little bit towards the northwest and that means we re going to be watching we ve had the first landfall in the keys we re going to see another landfall later on today a little bit farther up the coast i tell you what things are just going to get worse we have hurricane warnings in effect throughout the entire state of florida except the far western panhandle but hurricane warnings go all the way into georgia albany georgia tipton towards way across in valdosta hurricane warnings in effect tropical storm warnings in fact all the way towards the north georgia mountains so by tomorrow evening we are probably seeing wins 60 70 miles per hour as far north as atlanta here you go we always are talking about this track and this is why it aposs so misleading the strong winds extend very far out we ll see hurricane force winds likely all the way up the state of florida and then extending in towards georgia we re also going to watch a lot of onshore flow the wind will continue to pull on the east shore of florida and that aposs where we re going to see the storm surge extending all the way into georgia and south carolina but take a look at the wind gusts we are watching them in the 100 range up to 145 in marathon key by noon we aposre looking at wins at 115 miles per hour in naples this continues by 5 00 still over 100 miles an hour in naples by tonight over hurricane force winds in tampa and then by tomorrow morning into the afternoon we re going to be seeing hurricane force gusts all the way in towards southern georgia so it s a long duration event about 36 hours before this finally winds down across the state of georgia and alabama chris wallace rick thank you joining us now live from fema headquarters here in washington is brock long the head of that agency mr long how has irma aposs swing farther to the west changed your assessment of the storm has it become more dangerous or less dangerous long this is a worst case scenario for monroe county florida keys in the west coast of florida any time you re in that northeast quadrant as the storm is moving forward that aposs where the maximum radius winds are that defined the intensity of the storm that aposs where storm surge is most prevalent and you know the inland winds are going to be tough and also you know 80 percent of your landfall in hurricane bring with them tornado so we are already seeing some tornado watches and warnings spread across the state wallace does irma aposs new course put more people in jeopardy are folks now in alabama and georgia are they more now in more danger with this new path long so we re in good communication with alabama as well and they are definitely watching the storm any shift to the west has implications for them and we re also in great communication with georgia as well because as this thing moves inland you know that tornado threat is going to persist in land range are going to are going to persist as well so we are moving very quickly the president has been in great communication not only with me but been moving very swiftly to put proper declarations in place and so today it s all about you know as the president requested from last night he said do everything you can to take care of people and that aposs what we aposre doing we re positioning as many teams and commodities in place today and ready to go wallace over the next few hours mr long what is your biggest immediate concern and does the fact that the storm is going up the gulf coast which means bigger storm surges how big a concern is that right now long storm surge has the highest potential to kill the highest amount of people and cause the most amount of damage and so you know my biggest concern is when people fail to heed a warning early from local government officials and then they make a last minute ditch to try to get to a shelter or into a facility to withstand the winds and in some cases the water starts to rise and they get trapped because they didn apost heed the warning early and that aposs my greatest concern you know we care about people and try to put that message out and sometimes people listen and sometimes they don apost wallace is it too late for people to try to get out and i m talking about people now let aposs say up to naples is it too late or fort myers should they shelter in place long well it aposs too late for folks in the monroe county florida keys maximum radius winds moving over as we speak right now it aposs going to be very hard to get out of the keys i m sure you know if you are going to move and leave southwest florida from marco island on up the coast your time is running out in some cases if the water starts to rise around you and you become isolated try to get into a facility that you think can withstand the winds and get elevated and get out of the storm surge wallace one of the big changes in fema since hurricane katrina is that you folks are now a more proactive in terms of positioning personnel positioning equipment than then fema used to be before but i wonder with this change because we kept thinking until what the last 24 hours it was up headed up to the east coast the atlantic coast now to the gulf coast does not mean that you some of our equipment and people are out of position is that going to create a new problem long no not at all you know we aposve been in great position we are leading way far forward and we ve had people in teams in place i actually have liaisons in 11 counties you know on the west side of florida working directly with local emergency managers to make sure we understand what the state aposs demands are and what the local demands are so that we can help back their capabilities we pushed three days apos worth of commodities and ready to go but you know it aposs going to take some time this is a complex event because of the south and north trajectory of the storm the power is going to be out for a long time it s going to be tough for us to get in to perform search and rescue in south florida we have to wait until that you know until all the elements pass through this is a complex event but as far as positioning goes you know we aposve done pretty much all weekend wallace finally sir you of course are still dealing with hurricane harvey and congress just passed 15 billion in disaster relief to deal with that but do you have the money you need do you have the people you need to deal with the situation in the southeast united states florida and neighboring states post irma long sure so the congress did its due diligence and you know passed the supplemental to allow us to keep moving and as i ve been saying paperwork and money should not get in the way of saving lives and i believe the congress recognizes that there aposs great communication between the white house and the congress in regards to emergency management so right now we are moving forward i have all the authorities from the president that i need to be able to move forward as well and you know once this system passes through it s going be a race to save lives and sustain lives wallace mr long thank you thanks for talking to us on this very tough morning sir long thank you wallace and joining us now from the state capital of tallahassee is florida governor rick scott governor does this new path for irma mean that folks on the atlantic coast the east coast like in miami have dodged a bullet and folks on the gulf coast the west coast are now in the crosshairs gov rick scott r florida well this is going to impact our whole state you know you re going to get the wind and the rain on the east coast but right now it aposs impacting the keys it aposs going to impact my home town of naples florida all of the west coast and what s scary is the unbelievable storm surge potentially in my own town 15 feet of storm surge above ground level and we are talking about that and some thing with the keys so we re going to you know people have asked what can we do the first thing i tell them is pray pray for everybody in florida they can donate to disaster text disaster at 2022 or we need volunteers and we have over 400 shelters open now i need more volunteers for my shelters i need more volunteers helping distribute food after the fact we need nurses for special needs patients so we re but i ll tell you chris this is a great state people are going to come together we re going to protect everybody we re going to work together and we re going to do everything we can to make sure everybody survives this and get back to a normal life wallace i want to talk about the storm surge we all become amateur hurricane experts and one of the things that i ve learned in the last 24 hours is the danger of the storm surge is greater in the shallower gulf of mexico than it is over and the atlantic coast where there is a steeper drop off if you aposre talking about 10 12 15 feet storm surge i know naples i know tampa what impact is that going to have on the coastline scott i was talking to the president this morning he called to see how we were doing and i told him the story of a hurricane we had last year in the panhandle and there was a lady along the coast she didn apost want to evacuate and she had probably you know it was a one story house an older house she didn apost want to evacuate because of her pets when it got to three feet she knew she was not going to survive because the water was rushing in thank god that somebody was as she left her home to try to get to safety there was a high water vehicle that leaving for the last time and she was able to get in it and they were able to drive out she would have died this water is going to come in very quickly it s going to cover your first floor potentially or more and then eventually it aposs going to come out i don apost know how you aposre going to survive that you don apost know what it aposs going to do to the structure of your home so my concern right now is people are hopefully everyone has evacuated i looked at our traffic cameras around the state this morning people are off the roads i just hope everybody has evacuated and gotten to safety so i hope everybody will pray for us wallace i want to talk about this not an individual level but on a bigger level the last time that a major hurricane hit tampa bay was in 1921 when there were 10 000 people living in that low lying area there are now 4 million people living in that same area so what happens when a 10 foot storm surge comes into tampa bay scott you know all along the coast where we are getting the storm surges we didn t you know had the evacuation zone i hope everybody listen it aposs going to be devastating to these areas we re going to we re going to rebuild we have wonderful people this is a wonderful state but right now with these storm surges everybody is going to make sure they hunker down and take care of each other so but i m very concerned about the west coast now i m concerned about the whole state because of all the wind that we are going to get but the storm surge is absolutely life threatening wallace every storm in florida is compared to hurricane andrew that was a cat five that hit 25 years ago killing 61 people causing 26 billion in damage the costliest u s storm until katrina how does irma compare to andrew sir scott oh it aposs so much bigger i mean just the size of the storm is coast to coast and andrew i was in the hospital business back then i evacuated two hospitals and i actually moved patients to another hospital that eventually was completely completely rebuilt because all windows blow open lost the power everything but we didn apost have an andrew we didn t have a storm surge and that s when i was talking to the president the president said look i will provide for whatever resources you need when i talk to him i talk to him pretty much every day but i said here is the hardest in this one is when it s covered it aposs impacting our whole state and the storm surge is just life threatening on the west coast and through the keys wallace one last question sir because i know you aposve done so much to try to get people to evacuate you tried to put shelters up put people in place but now that the storm has hit let aposs say over these next 12 hours how much can you do are you basically sitting there waiting it out scott we re you know well we can pray that aposs one thing we can do we can pray but right now with the first responders can apost get out because of the wind and the rain and in the west coast as the storm surge comes up so hopefully everybody aposs got into their shelters or got into a safe place but i can tell you we will do everything we can to keep everybody safe the moment we can get out there to save somebody aposs life you know our first responders will be there i ve called up 7 000 members of the national guard will be there the federal government has resources down here we will do everything we can we will spare no expense to say every life in the state wallace governor scott thank you thanks for your time today and i you know our thoughts are with everyone in florida and in the path of the storm sir scott thank you chris wallace we ll have more on irma later this hour as it begins it aposs destructible on up florida aposs west coast but when we come back that head scratching deal between president trump and democratic leaders chuck schumer and nancy pelosi did the president aposs snub his own party we ll ask house freedom caucus member jim jordan that aposs next commercial break wallace president trump has infuriated republicans and surprised democrats with his decision this week on how to get funding for hurricane harvey through congress but how real is his new partnership with chuck and nancy joining me here in washington is congressman jim jordan a founding member of the house freedom caucus of hard line conservatives congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep jim jordan r ohio house freedom caucus co founder good to be with you chris wallace i want to start with the deal that shook washington president trump siding with pelosi and schumer over his own republican leaders over his own treasury secretary and his effort to link harvey disaster relief funding to a three month extension a three month extension of government funding and the debt limit and even talking about a deal on daca here aposs the president on air force one begin audio clip donald trump president of the united states chuck and nancy would like to see something happen and so do i and i said if we can get something to happen we re going to sign it and we aposre going to make it we re going to make a lot of happy people end audio clip wallace congressman are you one of those happy people jordan no i don apost think this is a good deal for the american taxpayer we didn apost do anything to address the underlying 20 trillion debt problem but frankly what options did the president have in front of him the first time the republican conference talked about the debt ceiling was wednesday morning and the freedom caucus we had called for nine and a half weeks ago chris we did a press conference and said don apost leave town until you actually have a plan on the debt ceiling and outlines the tax reform plan that we are going to do and until we deal with health care and instead we went home for the longest august recess in a nonelection year longest break in the nonelection year for more than the last decade so the break was even longer than some breaks you have an election year you know how politicians like to be home at election time so that was we should have stayed here and put together a plan we offered ideas in the freedom caucus i said let aposs cap spending at the percentage of gdp and raise the debt ceiling so the problem is we didn apost address the underlying problem the problem wasn t a three month six month time frame you know i learned a long time ago that when you fail to prepare you get a bad outcome and that aposs what happened here wallace there are two issues one is your concern and the concern of a lot of conservatives that you didn apost get anything in return for raising the debt limit that you didn t get jordan that is almost every other time you raise the debt limit wallace and you get spending cuts there aposs another issue and that is the significance of giving schumer and pelosi all this leverage when the issue comes up again in the case of government funding in december and maybe shortly thereafter on the debt limit and the question i have for you giving the democrats the democratic leadership more leverage is that good or bad for the trump agenda when it comes to tax cuts and immigration and obamacare jordan i don t i don apost look at it that way i look at it is it a good or bad for the american people you know i say this all the time our job is pretty basic what did we tell the american people were going to do at election time what they did elect us here send us here to accomplish let aposs focus on that so i don apost think it aposs good for the american taxpayer i don t think it s good for the american people that to me is the focus wallace why isn t it good jordan well when you just raise the debt ceiling and don apost do anything to address the underlying problem i mean this is like your kid in college who s got your credit card and he is spending more than he takes in and he aposs already piled up a lot of debt and he gets to say oh for the next three months i ve got unlimited borrowing authority i think if that was your son or my son we d have a problem with that that s what this deal in essence did so that s why it s not good for the taxpayers wallace what about the fact that you re giving the democrats another bite at the apple on all those issues in december jordan chris i m an american you have to be an optimist so i look at this way we get another bite at the apple we re going to put forward a plan that says let aposs cap spending this is where we the freedom caucus we took a position let aposs cap spending as a percentage of gdp let aposs bring it back down to its modern times historic norm below 20 percent of gross domestic product and then let aposs get this economy growing i do agree with the president we do need to focus on tax cuts we need that because that aposs going to get us the kind of growth we need to deal with it 20 trillion debt burden but i look at this as an optimistic from the republican side as well we have a chance now to put together a plan take that case to the american people early not wait until the last minute like we did before and sell that plan to the american people and pass that wallace but what do you think of the idea of this alliance between the president and as he calls them chuck and nancy do you see are you concerned about the possibility that he might go with him jordan i think i think the president is focused on doing what he told the american people he was going to do cutting their taxes building a border security while dealing with obamacare all those issues crosstalk wallace wait wait wait chuck and nancy are against repealing obamacare chuck and nancy are against funding for the wall chuck and nancy have a very different idea of tax cuts than the president does and you do jordan i know and that aposs why we ve got to get our plan out there and push it early and take the case to the american people i think if we do that we can win i think this was a unique situation where unfortunately there wasn t any good options presented to the you know i learned a long time my background sport is wrestling you don apost prepare you don apost to the preparation and go we didn apost even have a practice to figure out what we were going to do to give a good plan to the president so that aposs the problem i think this is a unique situation not what aposs going to happen in the future what aposs going to happen in the future i think with this president and certainly with us conservatives in the house we are solely and totally focused on what the american people elected us to do wallace i just want to press this one more time because there were always doubts about whether or not this president was a true conservative you heard it from a lot of folks on the right members of the freedom caucus do you worry that he may be more interested now in scoring victories than he is in pushing a true conservative agenda jordan what i worry about is i hate to keep saying it but it aposs what drives our mission statement of the freedom caucus is the countless number of people who feel like this town is forgotten them our job is to remember them and fight for them i think president trump has that same vision that same focus in this situation he wasn apost presented in good options he does want to get focus on tax reform i get all that so we ve got to make sure we push forward the things the american people elected us to do give those options to the president and i m confident that when that happens he will pick those options that are conservative and are consistent with what the american people elected us to accomplish wallace given what you just said do you have full confidence in house speaker paul ryan jordan yes no one i mean there s these stories that what one story said mark meadows and jim jordan met with the speaker i mean that aposs hardly news we meet with the speaker every single week no one is talking about changing the leadership what we are talking about is just what i said what was the what was the agenda at the american people voted for on november 8th let aposs get that done wallace but you say there s no interest in changing the speaker and i m not pushing you to do so but you aposre saying you offered ideas you wanted to stay in session in august to come up with a solid serious plan to tie raising the debt limit to spending cuts jordan yes wallace the house and senate leadership of your party didn apost come up with that jordan right and that was a mistake crosstalk wallace whose mistake is it jordan i think in hindsight well it wasn apost ours because we called for staying wallace whose is it jordan well you know leadership makes the schedule not jim jordan so we should have stayed here i think if you ask the american people should we stay here and get done what you sent is here to get done i think they would overwhelmingly say well heck yes you should and the fact that you didn apost again the longest nonelection year break in over a decade that aposs really what we are supposed to be doing when we are trying to get these critical things done at a time when we got a 20 trillion debt at a time when our border security is not where it needs to be according i mean that aposs the kind of thing we ve got to focus on wallace on friday the treasury secretary this is before you guys took the vote and you were one of the 90 republicans who voted against jordan yes wallace the whole package treasury secretary mnuchin and the budget chief mick mulvaney came to meet with house republicans to try to get you to pass the harvey package a couple questions i want to ask you widely reported is it true that mnuchin asked the caucus to pass the debt limit for him jordan i don apost recall it being framed that way i do recall them making a you know a strong case for us to vote for it of course there were there was pushback from members like you would expect because when you have a 20 trillion problem you probably shouldn apost just allow unlimited borrowing authority for the federal government for the next three months without doing anything to address the 20 trillion problem now to me that is just common sense but again that aposs where we wound up they were pushing for it and you know 90 of us said this is not a good deal for the american taxpayer inaudible wallace well that brings me to my final question mick mulvaney who used to be a member of the house freedom caucus jordan yes caw a budget hawk ph i emphasize i see the smiling on your face used to be he wouldn apost commit as i understand it that when the debt limit comes up again in december or shortly thereafter that you will tie it to spending cuts and i want to ask you about that one and two the fact that the president is now talking with chuck schumer about doing away with any vote on the debt limit you basically lose the opportunity to use that as a tool jordan well that aposs yes that aposs a that aposs a bad idea i mean again you go back to the example of the your college son has got the credit card he he wants to say i want to raise the limit dad and i don apost want to even have to even talk to you about it i think that is just a but particularly when you have the debt burden that we currently have so that that is a a bad idea look all the more reason why we need to have a plan early i mean this is politics you put together your argument your plan and you take the case to the american people and i aposm confident if you said to the american people we are going to raise the debt ceiling that is important or if there aposs the financial markets out there we understand how important that is but we are not going to do that unless we address the problem why don apost we cap spending and get it back down to the historic levels in modern times below 20 percent of gdp i think that makes a lot of sense it aposs a phase down that aposs the kind of you take that case to the american people you do it early enough you do the preparation early enough you can actually win the match wallace congressman jordan thank you jordan thank you wallace and i tell you i aposm going to make sure my kids i aposm taking all their credit cards away jordan good good move ph wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the new balance of power in washington plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs deal with the democrats just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up president trump with a new take on the art of the deal begin video clip trump we have a a great respect for the sanctity of the debt ceiling and chuck does and nancy does and we all do end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how the move affects his relationship with his own party commercial break begin video clip trump we had a great meeting with chuck schumer nancy pelosi and the whole republican leadership group and i aposll tell you what we walked out of there mitch and paul and everybody kevin and we walked out and everybody was happy end video clip wallace president trump bragging after his deal with democrats to link harvey aid to a short term plan to fund the government and lift the debt ceiling and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service and former national security council staffer gillian turner brit i want to follow up with what my conversation with the congressman what do you make of the president siding with and i can apost say it enough chuck and nancy i love that phrase and undercutting not only republican senators but his own treasury secretary he was in the middle of making his pitch in the oval office when the president sided when them brit hume fox news senior political analyst not everybody was happy i think no doubt chuck and nancy were happy he got rolled the president got rolled and his administration therefore got rolled because as you pointed out correctly doing this short term deal attached to the hurricane harvey money which was a must pass and therefore a good vehicle to do a longer debt limit extension and perhaps other things as well is now a three month deal and we aposre right back where we started except without the hurricane harvey leverage when december rolls around so it aposs a terrible deal and i think the president he wanted to sign something so he got something to sign but he got he got rolled wallace is it a one time thing or do you believe that hume well i look you listed correctly for your guests the different issues that now are coming along you know tax reform the border wall and the rest of it wallace obamacare hume obamacare chuck and nancy are not going to be with him on those things so this this this new so called alliance it seems to me is more likely to be a one off than it is the beginning of some new coalition that aposs going to last and abolishes a new york times headline to get today two party rule it aposs ridiculous wallace i i talked with a number of republicans on the hill over the last few days and the two words that i kept hearing from them worth flabbergasted and seething and i would definitely put republican senator ben sasse in the latter category here he is begin video clip sen ben sasse r nebraska chuck schumer whose title is minority leader not majority leader just made himself the most powerful man in america for the month of december this is an embarrassing moment for a republican controlled congress and a republican administration end video clip wallace well extending the debt limit and funding for just three months how much leverage does that give pelosi and schumer mo elleithee former dnc communications director look i think i think brit was was right in that the president has just lost a lot of leverage moving forward on the republican party has just lost a lot of leverage moving forward i don apost think anyone should be all that surprised by what the president did and for a lot of reasons not the least of which is he proved during the campaign that he was not a partisan or an ideologically driven kind of guy that he was the kind of guy who was going to kind of look out for himself first and here he was with the ability to cut a deal with the democrats that would be completely antithetical to what his own party would want and frankly antithetical to what he himself in the past had said right i mean it just wasn apost that long ago that he was out there tweeting attacking the republicans in congress when they did a four month deal to extend the debt ceiling difference saying it was he was a terrible negotiator look i know i aposm with brit in the sense that i don apost think this is a new alliance i don apost think this is a new balance of power i don apost think democrats are going to get everything that they want from this president moving forward but i think what it showed is that this president aposs not as strong of a negotiator as he made himself out to be and that is something that the democrats are probably going to try to take advantage of as much as they possibly can wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of the president aposs deal with the democrats a lot of you were as surprised as we were beerpotus tweeted will this lead to bipartisan legislation in the future or did the dems just pull one over on trump with this deal but rick connor sent this on facebook since the republicans have dragged their feet on every bit of the president aposs agenda who can blame him for trying to find someone in d c that will help him gillian how do you answer them gillian turner former white house national security council i would say i agree with mo and brit that the president has given up some leverage here in the short term but to me that aposs a tactical problem and i think this deal really is a strategic victory for the president in the sense that hume what for three months for a three month strategic victory turner because i think at this at this moment the terms of this particular deal are less important than the fact that the president is showing that he can make a deal this has been the the sad story of the first six seven eight months of administration has been somebody who ran on the platform of being a dealmaker has been unable to cut deals when it really matters for the american people so far on health care gearing up for a big battle on the national economy i think for the american people forget the political class in washington they don apost care so much as we do as the you know the question you discussed a few moments ago with the congressman is the president a true conservative for them the question is is the president a true dealmaker is he really going to be able to prove his mettle on these issues where where we need him to come forward we they want him to be bipartisan i think that is more important here than the particulars that went into this wallace but but the question to me juan is what is the deal about and and if you aposre talking about deal working with chuck and nancy their positions on issues that people care about a lot more than whether or not the president got a deal on border security on obamacare on tax cuts they aposre diametrically opposed i think juan williams fox news political analyst i agree with you i mean so if we were to pick out one point where you would say there is some common ground it would be infrastructure spending but again republicans are going to stay say wait a minute what about the cost and how are you going to compensate if you aposre going to put a big lump of money into infrastructure but on as you pointed out tax reform he wants cuts for upper brackets and the corporations they want tax reform that would benefit middle class voters you think about the wall clearly they don apost support the wall and obamacare looms large he wants to repeal it they want to improve it but i would say this i i am taken by the idea that this president we aposve heard so much talk for my fellow panelists this morning about the notion that he aposs a dealmaker but i just got to wonder you know we aposre going into an election year 2018 i don apost see that he aposs going to get any better deal from the democrats in an election year and certainly not at christmas time when everybody aposs dying to get out of town it seems to me if you look forward and i guess i aposm speaking to you gillian but he just gave up all leverage that the deal is coming on the budget will not have anything for the republicans or for conservative turner but i hume you can always make a deal if you aposre willing to capitulate to the other side aposs demands which is essentially what the president did so i don apost think it says very much that or is or inaudible to his favor that he made this deal because it aposs such a bad deal wallace all right i guess we aposve all weighed in on that a strong letter to follow panel we aposre going to take a break here when we come back a lot of focus this week on irma and the president aposs deal with the democrats but there is other news hillary clinton talks and so does steve bannon and north korea surprises the world by not launching a missile we aposll get to all that plus we aposll go back live to the storm zone for the latest on the hurricane commercial break begin video clip hillary clinton former secretary of state i think my composure which i have developed over years being in the public eye has well equipped me for being a leader but i think in this time we aposre in particularly in this campaign you know maybe i missed a few chances end video clip wallace former democratic nominee hillary clinton pushing her new book what happened expressing regret she didn apost tell donald trump to back off when he crowded her in their second debate and we aposre back now with the panel well mo in the book hillary clinton blames almost everything on almost everybody from the russians to james comey bernie sanders to matt lauer occasionally rarely she takes personal responsibility how happy are democrats that mrs clinton aposs going to be spending the next two months rehashing her defeat elleithee so first let me say i think you know in an election that was decided by what 70 000 votes over just a couple of states it aposs all right everything had an impact whether it was russia whether it was the comey and yes her own strategic mistakes which from the excerpts i aposve seen of this book she is speaking about more candidly than she has up till this point and so you aposre seeing i think her take more responsibility for the loss but also pointing to some of the other some of the other factors and i think that aposs what people have been criticizing her for not doing up till now inaudible before wallace do you think that will help the democrats to revisit the clinton defeat elleithee you know i think there aposs going to a huge russia publicity around this now i think moving forward democrats need to be looking forward so i don apost think there aposs a problem with reflecting on what happened if we aposre truly learning from those mistakes and i think the parts that she aposs taking responsibility for about the fact that you know some of the excerpts i read where she talked about how she missed the the mood of the country right now that is something democrats do need to understand before we head into 2018 so that they don apost make those same mistakes again wallace juan why do you think she aposs doing it do you think it she aposs trying to make a buck and there aposs nothing wrong with that that she aposs trying to rehabilitate her legacy and will it work williams well you know how these reporters are they aposre they aposre like wolves chris and inaudible yes it was money yes i think money apparently pre sales for the book are off the chart so you know but and also i think attention i think she and her husband love the limelight and it certainly is inaudible and we aposre having this conversation here wallace do you think it aposs helpful for the democrats williams well i think if camilla harris ph and corey booker and elizabeth warren and patty murray you know you know amy klobuchar if they can apost get out there and establish themselves in this environment they aposre not going to do it i don apost see the clintons seeding power or prominence in the party as a convenience to them i think from the political standpoint i pick up on something mo was talking about which is i think hillary clinton believes in buyer aposs remorse and thinks that a lot of voters especially in those swing states we aposre talking wisconsin michigan ohio pennsylvania have gone back so you get a lot of people who were were so called reagan democrats swing voters who now say you know boy donald trump hasn apost delivered for me and they aposre hope i think that gives clinton hope that she may have a future here which is wallace a future williams yes that aposs what wallace you think she aposll run again williams i don apost know i aposm just thinking to myself today last night i was having a conversation like that with somebody who says this may be the introduction to the hillary clinton 0 2 wallace oh boy let aposs switch subjects former trump adviser steve bannon is also talking this week in the self proclaimed enemy of the establishment the swamp the mainstream media is coming up this weekend on 60 minutes of all places to say that he is going to lead the charge against the establishment here he is begin video clip steve bannon former white house chief strategist they do not support the president aposs program it aposs an open secret on capitol hill everybody in the city knows it obviously unidentified male and so therefore now that you aposre out of the white house you aposre going to war with it ph bannon absolutely end video clip wallace brit how much of a player do you think steve bannon aposs going to be in national politics how much clout do you think he aposll have hume i think much less of a player than a lot of media accounts and current speculation suggests breitbart news which is a popular website is not the same as being in the white house his microphone is tiny by comparison to what he might once have had although he you know didn apost do a lot of public talking in the white house i think he mostly did leaking but i just don apost think he aposs as big a factor as one thinks he aposll get you know the 60 minutes interview will generate some discussion as indeed it already has but i don apost think from the platform at breitbart news he aposs going to be able to wage much of a war against the so called swamp wallace do you agree with that gillian turner yes i do i agree with that i think you know i also think that everybody wants to be the master of their own universe and the center of their own story and this is a way for him to really create a narrative that puts him at the center of all these things that creates a narrative for him where he was the one you know cherry picking cabinet members for the administration so it aposs a little bit of a self serving journey that he aposs on right now wallace it is interesting too that this guy who talked about the mainstream media comes out on 60 minutes and hume exactly right turner yes wallace and does an interview with the new york times hume right caw what do you make of that hume well i mean he aposs going where the numbers are he aposs going where the viewers and the readers are the new york times for whatever we may think of it in terms of its fairness is still a very big voice in this town and in this country and the same is true of 60 minutes which is you know a massively successful and hugely watched so that aposs where he went you noticed he didn apost you know we don apost know what he aposs been saying lately on breitbart news because well it aposs not the new york times and it aposs not 60 minutes elleithee i still think he aposs speaking to an audience of one more than any though he knows that this president is moved by media coverage and what he reads in the media more than anything else and i don apost know if the president watches 60 minutes but he does get those breitbart news clips in the morning and if he sees maybe he believes that if he can stir up enough there that the president may may react wallace i want to get to one more subject and that is north korea gillian there were a lot of predictions that this weekend that the north koreans were going to launch a missile it aposs the 69th anniversary of the founding of that country and that aposs the kind of thing that kim likes to do to celebrate an anniversary he didn apost but the trump administration kept up it aposs tough talk begin video clip nikki haley u s ambassador to the u n nuclear powers understand their responsibilities kim jong un shows no such understanding his abusive use of missiles and his nuclear threats show that he is begging for war end video clip wallace gillian does this administration have a clear policy on north korea turner i think we aposve got a clear ultimate goal we meaning the united states has a clear ultimate goal which is not to be captain obvious here but to avoid a nuclear showdown that produces nuclear holocaust i think the strategy is fairly clear the strategy is to emphasize diplomacy and keep that front and center but also to maintain a credible threat of military force and in that sense the trump administration strategy is not different from the obama administration from the bush administration even going back to the clinton administration we aposve been fairly consistent wallace so you don apost take this tough talk that seriously turner i take it seriously but i think that it aposs a rhetorical difference i don apost think it aposs a substantive policy difference between president trump and his predecessors wallace thank you panel see you next sunday we aposll be right back with a live report from miami on the latest with hurricane irma commercial break wallace a look at the wind picking up in tampa as hurricane irma comes ashore this morning let aposs check in with phil keating live in miami on florida aposs east coast with the latest there phil phil keating fox news correspondent good very miserable morning to you chris it aposs been like this for 12 hours now
