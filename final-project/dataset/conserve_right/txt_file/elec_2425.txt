eight ball that is always wrong tampa fla george gold has voted democrat in every presidential election since he cast his first ballot for john f kennedy in 1960 but he is breaking the streak this year to back donald trump caught up in the anti establishment fervor that has become the republican nominee s best hope for a nov 8 surge against democrat hillary clinton mr gold a jewish new yorker who moved to the sunshine state two decades ago is an unexpected rider on the trump train and his unbridled excitement about upending the status quo in washington demonstrates the enthusiasm gap benefiting mr trump i want a change i want to shake things up in washington said mr gold a 78 year old owner of a small publishing business people in the united states have just had enough even if you think there are questions about trump the country needs a change we are going downhill and mrs clinton represents the cronyism the favors the pay to play top stories 500 doctors tell trump to end the coronavirus shutdown say it will cause more deaths cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces ann coulter turns on trump most disloyal actual retard that has ever set foot in the oval office mr trump tapped into the anti establishment undercurrents that have been building in the electorate for decades he is relying on the energy of the moment to put him over the top in florida and other battleground states on his narrow path to the 270 electoral votes needed to take the white house the stunning announcement friday that the fbi has reopened its investigation into mrs clinton s secret email setup as secretary of state threatens to widen her enthusiasm gap the gap already was recognizable even to mrs clinton s die hard supporters i m not jumping up and down and clapping my hands said willis williams 60 a retired federal employee who attended mrs clinton s rally last week in a riverside park in downtown tampa he said the rally which drew several thousand people would help generate more energy behind the former first lady u s senator and secretary of state i think it s going to increase mr williams said aubrey jewett a political science professor at the university of central florida in orlando said the disparate enthusiasm levels could determine the outcome in what appears to be a close race in the state a new york times siena poll showed mr trump ahead of mrs clinton by 4 percentage points in florida 46 percent to 42 percent it helped make the real clear politics rolling average of polls in the state a tie the polling average showed a virtual dead heat in ohio another crucial battleground with mr trump edging out mrs clinton by a statistically insignificant 1 percentage point the core trump supporters are still just rabidly excited about him it s just amazing the numbers he is turning out said mr jewett a researcher on florida politics it reminds me in an ironic way because they have almost nothing else alike of barack obama and his first run when he would just get thousands of people showing up and they would get so excited at his events mr obama rode a wave of excitement and thirst for political change to a decisive victory 2008 the enthusiasm and voter turnout decreased in his 2012 re election win and the energy level further diminished for mrs clinton however her crowds have grown in the final stretch of the race her campaign was taken by surprise by the long line in tampa they had to turn away at least 1 000 supporters because the park was fenced off to accommodate only 2 000 people in front of the stage still the clinton crowd paled in comparison with the more than 20 000 people who filled a nearby amphitheater two days earlier to see mr trump gesturing to the throng at the midflorida credit union amphitheater tom sachs said he absolutely agreed with mr trump that the political system is rigged this is proof pudding that the american people are not going to stand for it said mr sachs a 63 year

collapse in argentina 20 years ago gave voice to the urgency of mr trump s followers he ll turn this country around from becoming third world like where i m from argentina lot s of corruption lot s of lies lot s of throw bones for one vote and forget you she said mrs merrette a devout catholic said she wholeheartedly supports mr trump s plan to build a wall on the southern border and opposes what
