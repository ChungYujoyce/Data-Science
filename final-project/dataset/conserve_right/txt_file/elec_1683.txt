always wrong davenport iowa sen marco rubio is emerging as the gop candidate most likely to unite the various wings of the republican presidential primary electorate and that broad appeal was on display when he made a campaign stop here wednesday at a popular sports bar and restaurant some of the 300 people crowded into the jersey grille to hear mr rubio on the stump were looking for a family values candidate some wanted a strident fiscal conservative and yet others hoped for a get tough military leader mr rubio didn t disappoint any of them top stories you are not going to die from covid 19 cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces australian researchers see virus design manipulation much as he did in a sturdy debate performance the previous evening in milwaukee the florida republican delivered a message that brought together the party s three pillars pledging reverence to family values vowing to cut taxes and saying the military needs an injection of funding to preserve its role as the most powerful military force in the world he bemoaned that without these remedies the country risked losing sight of the america dream you also feel it in our society where a growing number of people feel out of place in their own country because those of us who hold traditional values are stigmatized as haters and bigots he told the crowd the family the most important institution in society without strong families nothing else matters and the family is under duress the diversity of the republicans in the room was reflected by their choices in previous caucuses which ranged form mitt romney to newt gingrich to former sen rick santorum who won the iowa caucus in 2012 but has struggled to gain traction for his run this year he s family oriented said sarah teel 36 who caucused last time for mr santorum an outspoken advocate for faith and family she said she was leaning toward supporting mr rubio when the state hold s the country s first nominating contest feb 1 though she is still looking at sen ted cruz of texas a strong conservative who is increasingly wooing evangelical voters after the speech ben van raalte 58 a physician from nearby bettendorf said he planned to caucus for mr rubio because he was going to tackle the federal debt with reforms to social security and medicare including raising the retirement age and means testing benefits i m glad he didn t get hung up on the social issues he said i like that he spoke more in ideas than in sound bites we ve got too many running on sound bites maggie brown 56 a contracting specialist for the federal government called mr rubio a principled conservative i like that she said i m all for military spending that s the federal government s job mr rubio s ability to unite the republican party s core constituencies has helped place him firmly in the top tier of candidates in a crowded field currently mr rubio and mr cruz are best positioned to burst into the lead should front runners donald trump and ben carson falter in recent polls mr rubio has been vying for third place with mr cruz with the two trailing about 10 points behind mr trump and mr carson gop rivals have attempted to drive a wedge between mr rubio and the party s conservative base by denouncing his policies especially his proposals to increase spending as not conservative at the debate in milwaukee sen rand paul of kentucky leveled the charge and pointed to mr rubio s proposal to boost military spending and expand the earned income tax credit for low income families which is estimated to cost 1 trillion over 10 years add that to marco s plan for 1 trillion in new military spending and you get something that looks to me not very conservative said mr paul whose political views skew libertarian mr rubio defended the tax credit as an investment in families if you invest that money in a piece of equipment if you invest that money in a business you get to write it off your taxes but if you invest it in your children in the future of america and strengthening your family we are not going to recognize that in our tax code he said nevertheless it is not very conservative marco responded mr paul mr rubio then stressed the need to rebuild the military i know that rand is a committed isolationist i am not he said the exchange scored points for both candidates with their supporters paul campaign officials said they saw an immediate uptick in online contributions likely flowing from budget hawks and the anti war crowd for mr rubio the performance resonated with family values and pro military voters at the sports bar mr rubio s fans were not hung up on the cost of the proposed child tax credit he s conservative enough said bill doeckel 79 who backed mitt romney in 2012 you got to shake them down they ve all got pluses and minuses he said i agree with rubio most copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint permission click to read more and view
