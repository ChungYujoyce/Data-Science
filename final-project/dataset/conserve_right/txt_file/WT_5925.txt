india to end its militarized curfew over kashmir pakistan s top diplomat in washington said wednesday claiming that india s prime minister has turned a vast section of the disputed muslim majority region into practically a concentration camp pakistani ambassador asad majeed khan lamented during a wide ranging interview that millions of people inside indian controlled jammu and kashmir have been on lockdown without access to medicine or electricity let alone telephones and internet for nearly a month since the government of indian prime minister narendra modi revoked the area s special constitutional status top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches thousands are being put in prison he said the world needs to be aware mr khan in an interview with reporters and editors at the washington times also weighed in on the prospect of a breakthrough in u s peace talks with the taliban in neighboring afghanistan and on islamabad s delicate balancing act as a partner of both china and the united states but it was the kashmir issue that dominated the ambassador praised president trump for not taking sides in the decades old conflict over the territory but he said more must be done he said no other country has the same clout or influence as the united states of america to basically urge india to nudge india raja farooq haider khan the prime minister of the pakistani controlled side of kashmir sought to promote the same message on a visit to washington this week he said in an interview tuesday that he wanted to give a wake up call to the united states that it should intervene immediately it has all the capabilities said the prime minister who called on the trump administration to demand a meeting between indian and pakistani leaders to stave off an escalating standoff between the two nuclear armed south asian nations mr trump has appeared this week to back away from an early august offer to mediate between india and pakistan the president met with mr modi at the group of seven summit in france on monday and said he has good relations with both india and pakistan but when asked whether his offer to mediate was still on the table mr trump said i think that they can do it themselves they ve been doing it for a long time outrage in islamabad the diplomat s comments reflect mounting pakistani frustration over the modi government s deployment in early august of nearly 200 000 indian troops to a central section of jammu and kashmir along india s northern border with reports that the indian forces were arresting hundreds of local kashmiri political figures and cutting telephone and internet service across the territory pakistani prime minister imran khan warned that india was on the verge of carrying out a major ethnic cleansing against muslims in the territory and replacing them with hindus from other parts of india indian officials reject the allegations the indian embassy in washington said wednesday that electricity is functioning in indian controlled kashmir telephone lines are being restored and there is no shortage of medicines the precautionary and preventative measures put in place for public safety and maintaining law and order have been largely lifted indian ambassador harsh vardhan shringla told the times in a statement with regard to the comments of the pakistan ambassador we are not sure where he is coming from we believe he is referring to conditions in the part of jammu and kashmir occupied by pakistan mr modi has justified his moves on grounds that the territory s previous status some political autonomy and a ban on outsiders buying land and taking public sector jobs had fueled a movement for separatism and was unjust for kashmiri women but critics say the indian prime minister is a hindu nationalist bent on ending muslim control over kashmir india has actually laid down the ground to influence the demography of the state ambassador khan said they want to alter the ethnic composition of the state he took specific aim at mr modi s ruling bharatiya janata party bjp claiming the indian prime minister is aligned with hindu nationalists who see india as a historic hindu homeland ruled for too long by invaders mr khan pointed to mr modi s history as chief minister of the indian state of gujarat in 2002 when the state was rocked by violence between hindus and muslims that history haunted mr modi upon his rise to prime minister in 2014 when the state department briefly banned him from entering the united states because of allegations that he played a role in fomenting the violence look back at his career he was someone who was banned from coming into the united states because of what he had done in gujarat in terms of killing thousands of muslims said the ambassador although disputes have long lingered over the number of people who died in the 2002 riots most accounts put the number of deaths at roughly 1 000 muslims and as many as 300 hindus mr khan said india s recent moves in kashmir are not just about the dispute over land but the right of self determination of the people and i think what india has done is try to take away the identity of a people by reconstituting the territory by redesignating areas two front challenge more broadly pakistanis argue that india s escalation in kashmir is meant to keep its rival on edge by creating what the ambassador called a two front situation pakistani leaders are already dealing with security developments on the nation s border with afghanistan as trump administration officials near a much anticipated deal with the taliban to end the war there and clear the way for u s and foreign troops to draw down their forces analysts have long accused islamabad of tolerating instability in afghanistan to suit its own strategic needs but mr khan expressed high hopes for a breakthrough in the taliban talks he said pakistani leaders have played our part in trying to bring about a deal he was however cautious about specific aspects of the negotiations and whether pakistan would support a small u s counterterrorism force in afghanistan for the foreseeable future something the pentagon has said it wants despite taliban resistance to such a force the ambassador also declined to say whether the taliban should be required to recognize the legitimacy of the u s backed afghan government what is important is for all afghans to be able to reach a common understanding he said we also believe that a sustainable peace agreement is the one that all afghans are able to sign onto noting the positive tone of pakistani prime minister khan s recent visit with mr trump at the white house the envoy said it showed the two leaders want to see a peace agreement reached in afghanistan he also praised u s pakistani relations more broadly noting that more remittance money flows into pakistan s economy from the nearly 1 million pakistani americans than from any other nation the ambassador expressed hope for expanded economic ties pakistan s perceived ambivalence to the u s led war on terror in the region and the discovery that al qaeda leader osama bin laden was living in pakistan for years after the 9 11 attacks added strain to the complicated bilateral relationship mr trump earlier in his presidency attacked pakistan and its leaders harshly on twitter and at one point suspended nearly all u s security aid the president more recently hinted at restoring the aid during his meeting in july with prime minister khan a onetime international cricket star who appeared to have a rare kind of personal chemistry with mr trump on a separate front wednesday ambassador khan defended his nation s growing economic relations with china he said islamabad seeks close ties with both washington and beijing even if u s officials are critical of pakistan s expanding embrace of sizable chinese government loans and infrastructure financing we never see these two relationships as mutually exclusive he said asserting that islamabad is relying on chinese investments in infrastructure to help boost pakistan s export potential which in turn will help the country pay back loans to the western aligned international monetary fund china came to us at a time when no one else was even looking at us said mr khan adding that he would be happy to facilitate greater u s public and private investment in pakistan s economy he pushed aside the notion that pakistan an overwhelmingly muslim nation has stayed quiet about the chinese government s actions against the uighur muslim population in northwestern china while washington and international human rights groups have sharply criticized the crackdown we don t normally comment on the internal affairs of friendly states and how they treat their minorities said mr khan we have a long history of not inte
