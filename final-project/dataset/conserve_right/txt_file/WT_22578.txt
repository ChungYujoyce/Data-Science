apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap explaining circumstances that sparked a democratic impeachment inquiry president donald trump said wednesday he froze u s aid to ukraine earlier this year because he s tired of his country being the only one helping there his rationale rings hollow other allies pitch in plenty trump also pointed to developments in the stock market as

states why is it only the united states putting up the money remarks to reporters tuesday the facts it isn t only the u s putting up money it s false to say nobody else is there european union institutions have provided far more development assistance than the u s 425 million in 2016 2017 compared with 204 million from the u s eu members japan and canada also contribute significantly since
