session this sunday they aposre considering whether to ask the u s to withdraw troops from their country now that consideration comes just a couple of days after that american drone strike took out an iranian general on iraqi soil sparking fears of a wider regional conflict begin video clip kevin corke over the weekend iraq aposs prime minister strongly criticized the u s drone strike that killed iranian general qassem soleimani and prominently took part in the massive anti u s protest in baghdad white house officials said it was soleimani who directed the recent assault on the u s embassy in baghdad and was responsible for killing hundreds of americans worldwide in iran a massive funeral procession through several cities to honor the slain general who many considered the second most powerful man in the islamic republic overnight president trump tweeting if iran attacks an american base or any american we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way and threatening to strike 52 iranian sites representing the 52 american hostages taken by iran many years ago iranian foreign minister javad zarif responding targeting cultural sites is a war crime and iran aposs telecommunications minister called trump a terrorist in a suit end video clip after a two week vacation here in florida the president makes his way back home where he aposll be considering entanglements abroad and a possible impeachment trial here in the states chris chris wallace kevin corke reporting from mar a lago kevin thank you joining us now here in washington the secretary of state mike pompeo welcome back to fox news sunday sir mike pompeo chris it aposs great to be with you thanks for having me on this morning chris wallace do you know that the iraqi parliament is holding an emergency session today to discuss the question as to whether u s troops the 5 000 troops we have there should remain in country it has just come across the wires the iraqi prime minister says it is in the interest of both iraq and the u s to end foreign troop presence in iraq and he also says that the killing of general soleimani and also a top militia leader who was backed by iran muhandis were political assassinations your reaction sir mike pompeo chris the american people should know that president trump will never shy away from protecting and defending america it aposs what we aposve done over these past weeks and days it aposs what we aposve done over our entire three years with our middle east strategy the activity that you aposre seeing today is fully consistent with that the american people should know we will continue the president tweeted it again last night we will take the actions necessary to keep americans safe you know as for the activity today with respect to iraq we aposve been in their country we aposve been supporting iraqi sovereignty we aposve been continuing to take down the terrorist threat against the iraqi people the prime minister is the resigned prime minister he aposs the acting prime minister he aposs under enormous threats from the very iranian leadership that it is that we are pushing back against we are confident that the iraqi people want the united states to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign and we aposll continue to do all the things we need to do to keep america safe chris wallace but if iraq it is a sovereign country if they demand that we leave one will we leave and if we do won apost that dramatically hurt the fight against isis and stability in the region mike pompeo so we aposll have to take a look at what we do when the iraqi leadership and government makes a decision but the american people should know we aposll make the right decision we will take actions that frankly the previous administration refused to take to do just that chris wallace president trump says that general soleimani was planning a imminent attack against americans you have said it was a big action that could potentially kill hundreds of american diplomats and soldiers what was the plan who were the targets and how soon mike pompeo yes president trump was right in what he said so was i we ll share all the intelligence if we can i was the cia director for a little while chris there aposs things we simply cannot make public about what it is we knew at that time and what in fact we know today about the continuing activity i think general miller got it right when he said we would have been culpably negligent had we not gone after soleimani when we had the opportunity he was actively engaged and plotting against american interests we need to look no further than what he had personally done over the days before that where an american was killed on december 27th there aposs no surprise there aposs plenty of public evidence about the bad behavior of qassem soleimani he was a designated terrorist and we did the right thing chris wallace i just want to press to this degree the he had been targeting americans and other people around the region for decades the blood of 600 americans was on his hands for during the iraq war the question is that there are some intelligence agents who are talking to media outlets who are saying yes he was doing bad things but it was another day in the middle east and some congressional leaders who have been briefed now say that the intelligence was not of an imminent attack that was bigger more worrisome don apost the american people have the right to some understanding of what it was why it was so urgent to take out soleimani now mike pompeo it aposs interesting i haven apost heard any of the congressional leaders who have seen the full set of intelligence make the comments that you just described i think any reasonable person who saw the intelligence that the senior american leaders had in their possession would aposve come to the same conclusion that president trump and our leadership team did about the fact that there would have been more risk to america more risk through inaction than there was through the action that we took i think it aposs very clear i think it aposs very plain we aposll do everything we can to share this information with the american people but i think the american people understand too there aposs certain things you just can apost you can apost put out in public you got to protect americans who are out collecting the intelligence the intelligence we will need in the days and weeks ahead to continue to defend and protect them chris wallace iran aposs leaders are vowing a crushing response using words like a hard revenge what do we do if they strike back if they retaliate is there a plan and is there because of the fact that we went after soleimani has there been a change in u s response where we aposre no longer going to go after the enemy in the field we aposre now going to go after iran aposs command and control mike pompeo well chris the american people know that there aposs a strategy there aposs a strategy that has been several years in the making now that we aposve been working on it aposs been a diplomatic strategy it aposs been an economic strategy you aposre now seeing elements of the military strategy and with respect to targets president trump talked about 52 targets last night that aposs not new in the following sense we aposve made clear to the theocrats and kleptocrats that are running iran today running it into the ground against the will of their own people we made clear to them that we would not respond just against these proxy forces that they run in yemen and in syria and in iraq and in lebanon we made clear that this cost would be brought home to them to the leadership regime in iran and that we would raise costs we wouldn apost just attack their asymmetric efforts we would respond in a way that imposes costs on the decision makers who are putting american lives at risk chris wallace so you aposre saying to the supreme leader ayatollah khamenei you aposre saying to president rouhani you aposre saying to leaders of the revolutionary guard don apost think that you aposre off limits mike pompeo what i aposm saying is exactly what president trump has said we will take responses that are appropriate and commensurate with actions that threaten american lives that aposs what we aposve done so far chris there aposs no reason that the american people or the iranian regime should ever expect we aposll do anything different chris wallace you talk about the strategy the president has been pushing what he calls the maximum pressure strategy since he took office he pulled out of the iran nuclear deal in may of 2018 he imposed tough economic sanctions and this summer he suggested that the strategy was working take a look begin video clip president trump iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago when i took over iran was all over they had 14 to 18 different sights of confliction they were all over and now they just want to oh they want to negotiate a deal so badly end video clip chris wallace but in 2019 alone iran hit six ships shot down a u s drone launched an attack against saudi oil facilities a damaging attack and for all the talk of isolating iran they just conducted joint exercises with china and russia so the question is has the president aposs maximum pressure strategy made iran less aggressive or more mike pompeo panicked aggression on the part of the iranian leadership because they know that the iranian people are demanding enormous change and they know that the iranian people are supported by america in that demand for change yeah we aposve built out a huge coalition chris gulf states israel countries all across the whole world who are joining us they are joining us not only in the efforts in the strait of hormuz but in air defense efforts all across the region the malign actor of iran has been identified remember where we came in chris remember where we came in in 2015 the obama biden administration essentially handed power to the iranian leadership and acted as a quasi ally of theirs by underwriting them underwriting the very malicious that killed americans those resources the money that they had to build out those forces throughout the shi aposa crescent was provided to them by the nuclear deal we allowed europeans to go do business there we provided them 150 billion pallets of cash all of these things are the very challenge that the trump administration has had to correct the strategy is working we aposre going to stay the course and we will protect and defend the american people at every step chris chris wallace just so you know i will be asking senator van hollen about that in the next segment president trump also says that he is keeping his campaign promise to pull u s troops out of the middle east here aposs what he had to say in october begin video clip donald trump the plan is to get out of endless wars to bring our soldiers back home to not be policing agents all over the world it was a quick hit except they stayed for almost 10 years let someone else fight over this long blood stained sand end video clip chris wallace but just this week this week the u s deployed 100 marines to the u s embassy in baghdad plus 750 to the region and now another 3 500 is the president pulling us out of endless wars in the middle east or with this action this week did he take a big step back in mike pompeo endless wars are the direct result of weakness and president trump will never let that happen we aposre going to get it right we aposre going to get the force posture right we aposre going to get our facilities as hardened as we can possibly get them to defend against what iran may potentially do but make no mistake america aposs mission is to have our footprint in the middle east reduced while still keeping america safe safe from rogue regimes like the islamic republic of iran and from terrorist activity broadly throughout the region chris wallace so is it fair to say that while the big strategy is to pull the u s out of endless wars at least in the short term there could be more of a commitment mike pompeo the obama administration created enormous risks to the american people in iran this administration is working to reduce that risk chris wallace finally some analysts suggest that the impeachment of president trump has emboldened enemies like iran and north korea to think that they can confront him do you think that as misguided as it may be that some of our enemies think that this president is more vulnerable because of the impeachment effort mike pompeo you should ask mr soleimani chris wallace i understand that but he was going ahead before you killed him and the question is do you think that impeachment is emboldening our enemies mike pompeo i don apost i think that our adversaries understand that president trump and our administration will do the right thing to protect american people every place that we find risk chris wallace secretary pompeo thank you mike pompeo thank you chris chris wallace thanks for coming in on a very busy weekend sir mike pompeo you bet yes sir thank you chris wallace when we come back democrats raise questions about the wisdom and legality of the president aposs decision to take out soleimani we aposll talk with a top democratic senator chris van hollen that aposs next commercial break chris wallace the senate returned friday to its continuing stand off over how and when to hold a trial after the impeachment of president trump and now that aposs further complicated by the explosive developments with iran joining us now here in washington democrat chris van hollen of maryland senator welcome back to fox news sunday chris van hollen good to be with you chris chris wallace as soon as the drone strike took out soleimani you and other democrats started criticizing the action president trump and his top officials say that there was an imminent attack and that that taking out soleimani prevented it you just heard secretary pompeo say that again on this program don apost you believe them chris van hollen i think we learned the hard way chris in iraq in the iraq war that administrations sometimes manipulate and cherry pick intelligence to further their political goals that aposs what got us into the iraq war there was no wmd and chris wallace let me just interrupt i understand that that aposs happened in the past are you saying it aposs happening now chris van hollen i aposm saying that they have an obligation to present the evidence they did not notify the gang of 8 the one opportunity they had just two days ago to brief senior staff at the top secret level they provided no evidence to support their claim of an imminent threat look everybody knows that soleimani was a very bad despicable guy there aposs no debate there but the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported and what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting americans at greater risk in fact secretary pompeo aposs own state department right after these attacks urged americans to leave iraq so obviously they thought it was a more dangerous situation there the day after than the day before and as you ve just reported we sent 4 000 additional troops to iraq this from a president claiming he wants to get out of wars in the middle east chris wallace all right but there s no question and you certainly would agree that soleimani was our enemy he had been responsible directly or indirectly for the deaths of hundreds of american soldiers during the iraq war there s no question that he was he wasn t taking a vacation as he was traveling around the middle east this last week he was making more plans for terror attacks spreading iran s malign influence why not kill him chris van hollen well because you have to look at what the consequences are right we don t go around killing all the very bad people in the world we have president trump embracing kim jong un the leader of north korea who s got a lot of blood on his hands and is responsible for the death of otto warmbier an american citizen and yet he s getting love letters from the president of the united states so the question is do we further our interests by killing soleimani and everything we ve seen is we ve actually increased the risks of war dramatically we ve put americans at greater threat and we seem to have accomplished soleimani and the iranians main goal which is to undermine our influence and support in iraq we now have the top iraqi leadership the president and the prime minister condemning the united states action we have parliament meeting to talk about expelling u s forces what was soleimani s main goal in iraq it was to get the americans out to undermine our influence so we seem to have accomplished what soleimani was trying to do but couldn t so in death he s actually accomplished his goal that is a that turns back u s interests in the region chris wallace you have been tweeting ever since the soleimani takedown here s one of them the constitution makes clear that a president may not go to war without authorization from congress and we have not authorized war with iran but senator the white house says this is not war that soleimani was a terrorist and this was an act of self defense which a commander in chief can always take chris van hollen my point chris is we re now headed very close to the precipice of war you just heard the president this morning talk about targeting iranian sites including cultural sites which is in fact a war crime if the president was to carry that out the point we re making is that the president is not entitled under the constitution to continue this escalation and take us to war without congressional action that s what the constitution requires look i heard secretary pompeo talk about this you asked him about the maximum pressure strategy they ve not accomplished any of their goals they had very unrealistic goals all they have done under maximum pressure is escalate the chance of war with iran something president trump said he wanted to avoid but a lot of people around him like secretary pompeo have been urging a confrontation with iran for a very long time including when he was a member of congress chris wallace i want to pick up on this because here was another one of your tweets in the last couple of days the administration aposs reckless policy over the last three years has brought us to the brink but the president and you just heard secretary pompeo say no it was president obama who brought us to the brink it was the obama nuclear deal which funneled billions of dollars back into the regime that they used to spread their brand of terror across the middle east and also it was the obama administration s decision to focus exclusively on the nuclear program and to ignore all the other malign activity by iran throughout the region chris van hollen well first of all they didn t ignore it but the obama administration correctly observed that a nuclear armed iran would be even more dangerous than an iran that did not have nuclear weapons and so what this administration did was they ripped up that agreement essentially divided us from our allies and the result has been this increased actual activity from iran in the region chris wallace well not necessarily i mean you look at the reports that because of the fact that there are economic sanctions and iran is economically strapped that hezbollah is starved for money hamas is starved for money isn t that a good thing chris van hollen so look there s no doubt that the maximum pressure campaign is putting pressure on iran but to what end secretary pompeo had a list of like 11 things the iranian regime had to do and it was never realistic and that s why they ve got no endgame and that s why we re here right now after this latest escalation at much greater risk of going to war with iran which would be very damaging to the united states obviously it would be damaging to iran but it would be very damaging to the united states chris wallace all right chris van hollen iran has continued to prosecute its efforts in syria throughout the time of this administration so the notion that they ve succeeded in doing anything to stop iran s malign influence is nonsense what they have done is dramatically escalate the chance of war chris wallace all right i want to switch dramatically different subject how long do you think that speaker pelosi should hold on to the articles of impeachment mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader has made it very clear he s not going to be cowed by her he s not going to be pressured by her the senate is going to run its own trial at some point doesn t she have to hand over the articles and for the good of the country doesn t the senate have to get on with a trial chris van hollen well speaker pelosi has made very clear she will send over the articles of impeachment chris wallace when chris van hollen she s also been chris wallace wait wait when chris van hollen when she feels it s appropriate and i think that you know that will happen but the issue chris is that we have a constitutional duty in the senate to have a trial and it needs to be a fair trial and every american recognizes that a fair trial means you get to call witnesses you get to have relevant documents we ve seen in the last two weeks more emails that have surfaced that show this trump administration trying to cover up key emails showing that the president of the united states confirming again he ordered the hold on vital u s ukrainian military assistance and so why not get those documents president trump himself said that he wants mulvaney to testify he said that months ago why shouldn t we have witnesses that is the question chris wallace okay i ve got one last question i ve got less than a minute for you to answer do you have any concerns about holding this trial right now with the president in this growing confrontation with iran and potentially an international crisis is that a good thing for the senate to be trying whether or not to remove the president at this particular moment chris van hollen we have a constitutional duty when it comes to the issues of war congress and the constitution has the power to declare war despite what the president may think and we have a constitutional duty to try the president in an impeachment trial when the house of representatives sends us the articles of impeachment chris wallace even chris van hollen i think our system is strong enough that we can do both i very much worry about what the president is doing right now to escalate tensions and the likelihood of war in iran but our country will have to deal with both these issues at the same time chris wallace senator van hollen thank you thanks for coming in today sir chris van hollen thank you chris wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss what happens next in the growing confrontation with iran plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump s decision to kill general soleimani just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break chris wallace with the world on edge over possible retaliation after the u s killed iran aposs top military leader we want to replay part of an interview we conducted with iranian president hassan rouhani back in september he said then it aposs not iran that aposs the main sponsor of terrorism but the u s begin video clip male translator today america unfortunately is the supporter of terrorism in our region and wherever america has gone terrorism has expanded in the wake wherever we have gone on the other side we have defeated terrorism chris wallace you have given hundreds of millions perhaps a billion dollars to hezbollah to hamas to various groups that is not a support of terrorism hassan rouhani well when you label people who fight for the defense of their country and their lands as terrorism so those who are the subjects of occupation what should they do be passive and just look end video clip chris wallace and it aposs time now for our sunday group josh holmes former chief of staff to senator mitch mcconnell mo elleithee of georgetown aposs institute of politics and public service former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and former trump national security council spokesperson michael anton michael does the decision to escalate dramatically and i think we would agree it was a dramatic escalation to take out qassem soleimani does it make the u s more safe or less safe and if iran decides as keeps its promise to retaliate dramatically does the trump administration have a strategy michael anton i don apost know that i necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation you could interpret it as justified retaliation for all kinds of things that you aposve talked about earlier in the program that iran has been doing without much of a response so the main point i would want to make here is the iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive getting used to not facing pushback not getting retaliation and when they finally do get pushback they tend to back down and go into the turtle mode for a little while and that may yet happen again we aposve seen that happen in the past they haven apost faced much retaliation for as you said spending the enormous windfall they got out of the iran deal all around the middle east creating proxies creating little colonies building out their empire and they i think got overconfident and to some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that soleimani went right into iran and the airport sorry into iraq in the airport completely confident that he owned the place and that nothing would happen to him so i think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to maybe make the regime retreat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess chris wallace all right we asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of the president aposs decision to take out soleimani we got this on facebook from phil martin what is the difference between what president trump did and what former president obama did to osama bin laden congresswoman edwards how do you answer phil donna edwards well i mean there are two main differences and one is that osama bin laden was a non state actor and here you have an attack directly in the iraqi iranian hierarchy and look nobody aposs out there you know saying that soleimani was not a bad guy he was a bad actor had been for a couple of decades but the question is whether this was the smartest way in which to conduct an overall foreign policy in the region and whether and i believe it has actually made the region and the united states interests a lot more vulnerable chris wallace well let me just pose this then so they iranian backed militias in iraq launch a number of strikes last the week before last i think it was a week ago friday and kill an american contractor and hurt a number of american soldiers we respond with a number of strikes that kill about two dozen of those militia men they then attack our embassy no they didn apost kill anybody but it was pretty shocking what they did to the u s embassy in baghdad are we supposed to just let it go donna edwards well what i aposm saying to you is that i think among the options the range of options that the president has the question is do you take one and i believe they did in taking the action in killing soleimani that actually you know the downstream puts us in a much more difficult position and i don apost and i think right now it aposs not really clear to me that just like pulling out of the iran deal that this administration has said has mapped out what the end game is what aposs the next part of this strategy chris wallace all right donna edwards and i think without that then the united states interest and our ability of our allies to stand with us in this becomes much more complicated chris wallace josh i want to move to a different aspect of the questions that people are asking this week president trump very publicly and has reaffirmed it as recently as this fall that the situation in syria ran on getting the u s out of endless wars in the middle east but as i discussed with secretary pompeo this week alone he sent more than 4 000 u s troops into the region so are we getting out are we getting deeper josh holmes well i don apost think that aposs inconsistent at all i mean i think his overarching policy as secretary pompeo articulated very clearly is to remove america from these endless wars and these conflicts in syria the conflicts in iraq and beyond but that also cannot override immediate security threats you need to be responsive to that and i will just say i aposm totally stunned at the notion that somehow america is the one that is bringing this to a higher escalation level the president aposs critics may not have been paying attention to what aposs happened over the last couple of years but just because they aposre more focused on trying to impeach the president of the united states than the health and well being of american soldiers in iraq doesn apost mean that things aren apost happening this guy has tried has killed over 600 american soldiers all right just last week we watched him storm the embassy in baghdad now how america is the aggressor here is beyond me but what they did is for the first time in a long time and i aposll argue that the president has been extremely reluctant to engage in this kind of thing but first time in a long time tell iran not anymore you aposre not going to be attacking american assets or american personnel without severe repercussions and i think that aposs a great thing for this country chris wallace well here is how the president described and explained his action on friday begin video clip donald trump we took action last night to stop a war we did not take action to start a war end video clip chris wallace mo what about the argument that as i aposve recited in the interviews with the two previous guests that there are a number of actions that iran has taken this year going after ships shooting down a drone attacking saudi oil facilities just in the last week they killed an american contractor hurt badly injured a number of american soldiers and then stormed the u s embassy what about the argument that president trump needed to stand up to this iranian aggression and show resolve mo elleithee yeah it aposs interesting one of the president aposs rationales for withdrawing from the iran deal was that by doing so and imposing these crippling economic sanctions on the regime it would bring the regime to its knees in fact the exact opposite has happened the regime has become more and more emboldened and has done has been escalating its rhetoric look my concern here is and as others have said is what are the ramifications regionally this was not our first opportunity to go after this guy stan mcchrystal who was no you know who was fired by president obama he was no fan of obama foreign policy chris wallace he was one of the top generals and he was at one point leading our effort in afghanistan mo elleithee talks openly about the time he had an opportunity to take him out but that there were bigger regional concerns we aposre going to chris wallace he now says he thinks the president president trump made the right decision mo elleithee well we aposll see right i mean if you look at what just happened moments before this panel came on the air where the iraqi prime minister standing before the iraqi parliament called this a political assassination and that the united states should withdraw all troops from the country this is there is now a huge mess on the ground in the middle east and the united states is going to have to be ready for that the fact that chris wallace okay male speaker the government the president has to be ready for all these unknown chris wallace i male speaker moving pieces chris wallace he absolutely does i aposve got about a minute left in this segment and michael i want to leave it with you you aposve posited that maybe they needed a punch in the nose and now they aposre going to pull back and they aposve gotten too aggressive there aposs a flip side of that what if iraq goes ahead and expels u s troops what if iran and that certainly is much of a possibility as your scenario strikes back what do we do then michael anton well if the iraqis decide they want u s troops to lead one thing i could say with confidence is president trump will not be on the phone begging them to say please let us stay he aposll call their bluff and i think the iraqi leadership knows that the big winners of that will not be iraq necessarily it aposll be iran and so chris wallace i understand but that michael anton so chris wallace would hurt us wouldn apost it if iran is takes more over control of iraq michael anton well as you said earlier the president really would like to get as much out of the middle east as possible but he didn apost run as an isolationist it aposs important to remember he ran as kind of a jacksonian his philosophy of foreign policy is very simple live and let live we will live and let live as much as possible but if you hit us if you mess with us if you strike us if you kill our people we will hit back very very hard that aposs why what he what he aposs doing is essentially retaliatory it aposs not long term nation building he has no interest in staying in the middle east or rebuilding it or transforming it for the long term josh holmes but does that mean we would cede control of iraq after all we aposve put into that and all we aposve lost male speaker we can apost unintelligible michael anton it is a sovereign country as you have and others have said if the iraqi elected government says we don apost want you there we don apost have a way to stay and the president aposs not going to beg them to say chris wallace we have to take a break here panel because we aposve got more to talk about when we come back democrats state of play on trying to remove president trump how long can nancy pelosi hang onto the articles of impeachment and hold up a senate trial commercial break begin video clip mitch mcconnell their turn is over they aposve done enough damage it aposs the senate aposs turn now to render sober judgment as the framers envisioned chuck schumer there has never never in the history of our country been an impeachment trial of the president in which the senate was denied the ability to hear from witnesses end video clip chris wallace with the senate back in session majority leader mitch mcconnell and minority leader chuck schumer making no progress in agreeing on ground rules for an impeachment trial of president trump and we aposre back now with the panel so josh where are we on a senate trial is your former boss there mitch mcconnell is he going to hold firm and say nancy pelosi you aposre not going to dictate what aposs going to happen here and secondly you had over the recess you had two republican senators collins and murkowski both express concerns about mcconnell aposs hardline stance what do you think of the chances that mcconnell holds firm that you could get them and maybe two other republicans which would give democrats potentially a majority to call witnesses and basically run the kind of trial the democrats want to josh holmes well first off this whole thing is kind of confusing to me as to why nancy pelosi believes that it increases her leverage by holding the papers i mean every day that she holds them they look more and more bizarre and the closer and closer that they get to the iowa caucuses which of course throws off the closing arguments for every 2020 democrat running against president trump ultimately but secondly she has no leverage here this is not about trying to control the contours of the senate she aposs never going to be able to do that so this ends only one way and that aposs when she sends the papers over without any kind of preconditions that aposs basically what mcconnell said this week chris wallace okay and what about my second question which is if you you aposve got 47 democrats if they were to get four republicans they aposd have 51 they aposd have a majority assuming they all vote together and then they could call mick mulvaney they could call john bolton what aposs the prospect of that josh holmes yeah i mean that aposs like the if and ifs and buts and candy and nuts unintelligible christmas in every day there aposs no chance of that happening let me tell you why specifically because what mcconnell was advocating for is an imminently reasonable process one that was adopted 100 to nothing in the clinton impeachment trial in the 1990s and what that does is provide the impeachment managers from the house and the president aposs defense team the opportunity to lay out their cases and what is agreed to at the front end is that framework after you get through that framework then senators are after they go through a series of questioning are able to look at what aposs missing and at that point you can have a discussion about whether you bring in different pieces of evidence whether you bring chris wallace like witnesses josh holmes right and so the question is as are we concerned is there a concern that senators are ultimately going to back a democratic proposal to lay out this entire thing on the front end chris wallace right josh holmes no no absolutely not because what it does it create complete chaos and i aposve got to tell you democrats don apost want it either because they aposre a lot closer to getting 51 for hunter biden than they are for anybody in the trump administration chris wallace congresswoman edwards how long can nancy pelosi hang on to these articles of impeachment i mean it was the democrats it was pelosi it was schiff who said donald trump we aposve got to move forward because he is a clear and present danger now they are the ones holding up the process to remove him donna edwards well no i mean i think we should examine that where we are right now is precisely because mitch mcconnell openly said that he wasn apost going to have a fair process and i think it aposs legitimate for speaker pelosi to actually keep open this process as long as she needs to i mean she aposs going to turn over the articles of impeachment but she does want assurances given that mcconnell came out straightforwardly and said he wasn apost going to have a fair process and that he was coordinating with the president and so you know and i think that she actually has created leverage because in fact she opened up the space for murkowski and collins and i aposm waiting for this phase for mitt romney who stands nothing to gain in this process by aligning himself with the administration with the president to make sure that there is indeed a fair process chris wallace all right we aposre going to continue we aposll have plenty of time to continue that conversation let aposs turn to the democratic presidential campaign because we just got the fourth quarter the end of 2019 fundraising numbers for all of the democratic candidates and they re pretty interesting put them up on the screen bernie sanders led the field in the fourth quarter raising 34 5 million pete buttigieg joe biden and elizabeth warren are closely bunched about 10 million behind and then it s another 5 million back to andrew yang mo how do you handicap the race at this point mo elleithee it s jump ball i mean look iowa is going to winnow the field to some extent you know typically people historically have talked about two or three tickets out of iowa you could have as many as four or five out of iowa this next time and it s anybody s game those are tremendous numbers for bernie sanders but they re tremendous numbers for everyone in the field the biggest question heading into iowa just under 30 days from now is will those senators that are running elizabeth warren bernie sanders amy klobuchar cory booker will they be able to be on the ground in iowa or are they going to be stuck here in washington and for someone like an amy klobuchar or an elizabeth warren who are like right there right they re right there to get one of those tickets they can t afford to cede weeks of ground to someone like vice president biden or mayor buttigieg chris wallace so maybe this is nancy pelosi s strategy hold up the senate trial so they can campaign mo elleithee my guess is it s not that that s not it but it is going to be a real issue chris wallace we should point out that while they were raising that amount of money donald trump in the fourth quarter raised 46 million far more than any of the others he s built up a huge campaign war chest has more than 100 million cash on hand which raises the question michael how big an advantage for the president how big a disadvantage for the democrats that he s building up this war chest just sitting there basically he s got a couple of people running against him but nobody serious while the democrats with the money they ve raised which is impressive are going to spend all of it going after each other michael anton well it s been a long time since an incumbent president was defeated for reelection 1992 there s enormous advantages to incumbency chris wallace and he faced a primary challenger michael anton and he faced a primary challenger and it also took a third party independent who got the highest independent vote in u s history at least in the 20th century so chris wallace unintelligible michael anton it was an extraordinary confluence of circumstances that don t look to be repeated and president bush who was defeated in 1992 also faced a very bad economy which is remember it s the economy stupid the number one issue bill clinton ran against him on and was able to seize on the democrats don t have that right now i think you know anything is possible the economy could turn sour sometime during this year but at this point in the 1992 campaign the economy had already been in recession for a while and people were very discontented that s not the case right now so president trump looks very strong to me chris wallace congresswoman edwards when you look at not just the money but also the polls i mean the thing that i have to say surprised me bernie sanders had a heart attack in the fourth quarter and there was a lot of talk about that the party wasn t going to go as far left that they were pulling the voters they were pulling back to the center you saw the rise of buttigieg biden with considerable strength there are a lot of people out there that still support and are giving money to bernie sanders donna edwards well there are i mean he s shown you know resilience and energy but i would say that joe biden has actually shown a lot of resiliency too for all the attacks and for all the talks of the demise of his campaign i look to see a resurgence frankly of somebody like an elizabeth warren she s got money on hand she s got a ground game in states like iowa and new hampshire and has the ability to organize that forward and then amy klobuchar i think you re right i mean she s on the rise but she can t afford to be taken off the field chris wallace you realize you haven t winnowed at all laughter donna edwards i haven t at all chris wallace you haven t winnowed out you ve winnowed in donna edwards i m not ready i m like most voters i m not ready to do that quite yet but i do look at the collective energy in the democratic field you can see that in the fundraising where collectively the field still seems to be able to demonstrate that from small donors across the board that democrats do still have the you know wind at their sails chris wallace thirty seconds josh who in that field is the biggest threat to donald trump and the reelection campaign josh holmes oh i don apost think we know yet i think they all have vulnerabilities i think some unique vulnerabilities i think the bernie sanders elizabeth warren wing in the midst of a really good economy is absolutely devastating for democrats i don t know how you make the case that you change the american economy when you re doing this unintelligible chris wallace so basically they re all going to lose right josh holmes so that s what i m saying chris wallace laughs all right thank you panel see you next
