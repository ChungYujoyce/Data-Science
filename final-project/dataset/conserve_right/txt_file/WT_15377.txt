apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic yokota air base japan ap for president barack obama expanding u s influence in asia is more than just countering china or opening up new markets to american businesses it s also about building his legacy fresh off re election obama will make a significant investment in that effort during a quick run through southeast asia that begins sunday in addition to stops in thailand and cambodia the president will make an historic visit to myanmar where his administration has led efforts to ease the once pariah nation out of international isolation the trip marks obama s fourth visit to asia in as many years with a second term now guaranteed aides say obama who kicks off his schedule in bangkok will be a regular visitor to the region over the next four years as well top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century continuing to fill in our pivot to asia will be a critical part of the president s second term and ultimately his foreign policy legacy said ben rhodes obama s deputy national security adviser the president s motivations in asia are both personal and strategic obama who was born in hawaii and lived in indonesia as a child has called himself america s first pacific president the region gives him an opportunity to open up new markets for u s companies promote democracy and ease fears of china s rise by boosting u s military presence in asia the president like many of his predecessors had hoped to cement his foreign policy legacy in the middle east he visited two major allies in the region egypt and saudi arabia on one of his first overseas trip as president and attempted to revive peace talks between israel and the palestinians but those talks stalled and fresh outbursts of violence between israel and the palestinians make the prospects of a peace accord appear increasingly slim the obama backed arab spring democracy push has had mixed results so far with islamists taking power in egypt and progress in libya tainted by the deadly attacks on the u s consulate in benghazi obama hasn t been back to the region since 2009 in asia however obama will be viewed as something of an elder statesman when he returns less than two weeks after winning re election the region is undergoing significant leadership changes most notably in china where the communist party tapped new leaders last week japan s prime minister and south korea s president are also stepping down soon most of the leaders he ll meet with will not have a tenure as long as he will as president said michael green an asia scholar at the washington based center for strategic and international studies so he ll go into this in a very strong position the centerpiece of obama s whirlwind asia tour is his visit to myanmar it will be the first time a u s president has visited the former pariah state myanmar has become something of a pet project for obama and his national security aides who have cheered the country s significant strides toward democracy obama lifted some u s penalties on myanmar appointed a permanent u s ambassador and hosted democracy leader aung san suu kyi at the white house this year many of the same strategic motivations behind obama s larger focus on asia are at play in myanmar the country long has oriented itself toward china but the easing of sanctions gives american businesses a chance to gain a foothold there it s also an opportunity for the obama administration to show other nations in the region and elsewhere in the world that there are benefits to aligning with the u s still there s little denying that history has been a draw for obama s team when it comes to its dealings with myanmar that s led to criticism from some human rights groups that say obama s visit is premature given that the country continues to hold political prisoners and has been unable to stem some ethnic violence this trip risks being an ill timed presidential pat on the back for a regime that has looked the other way as violence rages destroying villages and communities just in the last few weeks said suzanne nossel the u s based director of amnesty international obama s other stops in the region also underscore the potential pitfalls of going all in in asia thailand s 2006 coup which led to the ouster of the prime minister strained relations with the u s and raised questions in washington about the stability of its longtime regional ally cambodia where obama s visit also marks the first by a u s president has a dismal human rights record white house officials have emphasized that obama is only visiting cambodia because it is hosting the east asia summit an annual meeting the u s attends aides say the president will voice his human rights concerns during his meeting with hun sen cambodia s long serving prime minister still human rights groups fear obama s visit will be seen within cambodia as an affirmation of the prime minister and a sign to opposition groups th
