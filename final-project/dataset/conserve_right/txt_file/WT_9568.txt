apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president obama needs to fire himself not literally of course but practically he needs to shake up his team so thoroughly that the new blood imposes change on how he manages the federal bureaucracy and leads says ron fournier a veteran national news correspondent and editorial director for national journal a series of self inflicted wounds during his fifth year in office capped by the botched launch of the affordable care act have americans questioning the president s competence and credibility history suggests that second term presidents rarely recover after their approval ratings fall as much as obama s have this year he says history also suggests that there are two types of white house shake ups the first is mostly cosmetic and is aimed at sending a signal that the president is serious he fires somebody anybody as a sacrificial lamb the second is deep cleansing that rare occasion when a president rebuilds his team to change himself mr fournier insists the latter is what obama must do top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian

day trip to japan china and south korea all meant to reaffirm our enduring presence as a pacific power and the enduring strength of the u s japan alliance the white house says in its neutral description of the journey yes everyone can be enduring and maybe endearing on the visit crisis management skills and some sabre rattling are likely requirements as well it s only been a week since china established the air defense identification zone over a disputed portion of the east china sea requiring all foreign aircraft to reveal their flight plans and constantly communicate defense secretary chuck hagel deemed the designation a destabilizing attempt to alter the status quo of the region officials in japan australia and europe voiced similar discontent a pair of b 52s recently buzzed the airspace over islands that both china and japan claim as their own the rightist apologists of japan s atrocious past and belligerent present find it a thorn in their side and wish the world would forget about its existence the china hating politicians in washington display collective amnesia when and where it gets in the way of demonizing china counters an op ed published tuesday in china daily the nation s state supported english language newspaper like it or not the cairo declaration issued 70 years ago yesterday remains the ultimate key to sorting out the convoluted territorial dispute between china and japan the paper says in the cairo declaration it was agreed that all the territories japan has stolen from china such as manchuria formosa and the pescadores shall be restored to the republic of china the paper later concludes when vice president joe biden and british prime minister david cameron visit this week our new air defense identification zone may be a hard to navigate topic but our leaders should review with them the cairo declaration and tell them challenging our legitimate claim to the diaoyu islands is an outright betrayal of the declaration and the tricky numbers mr biden s journey prompted the pew research center to revisit its poll numbers about asians and their opinion of one another even as the white house seeks to rebalance and rebrand its policy on china china s military power is regarded with alarm in japan and south korea nearly all japanese 96 percent see china s power as bad for their country as do 91 percent of south koreans says senior editor bruce drake who cites findings released six months ago but it s complicated very almost seven decades after the end of world war ii a big majority of south koreans 98 percent and chinese 78 percent believe that japan has not sufficiently apologized for its actions in their countries during the 1930s and 1940s according to our spring survey mr drake says sixty nine percent of japanese regard the u s favorably compared with only 5 percent who have a positive view of china he adds in south korea 78 percent have a favorable view of the u s compared with

buying or how much it s going to cost me declares stephen green a colorado based political columnist for pj media who dutifully sat down to navigate healthcare gov over the weekend following the site s major overhaul i can t really know there s another one of those notices alerting me that all health plans and stand alone dental plans may not be available at this time due to technical issues we ll update this information as soon as it s available well i m certainly not going to buy anything today based on that i can tell you mr green continues he had intended to find out if the obamacare sign up site was as problematic as it has been portrayed answer it is there is no more information to be gleaned my insurance options remain a riddle wrapped in a subsidy smothered in regulations mr green concludes know thy healthcare let us all remember that a reported 684 million in taxpayers funds has been spent to promote obamacare in recent months americans younger than 30 a key group targeted by the affordable care act continue to be the least familiar with it says frank newport director of the gallup poll upon revealing that 37 percent of those younger than 30 don t know much about obamacare ironically enough democrats are in second place with 34 percent indicating they re also unfamiliar with the health care reform law that figure is 12 percent incidentally among republicans those who are familiar with the health care law are significantly more likely to oppose it than those who are not familiar with it mr newport observes white house youth well this could be what the doctor ordered or maybe not the white house plans a white house youth summit on wednesday to be attended by young people from around the country who can ask senior white house officials questions about
