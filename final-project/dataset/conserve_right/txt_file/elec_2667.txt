driven by destiny panicky hillary starts shoutingyou can turn the volume back up on your televisions the democratic debate is done and the shouting has ended apparently believing that commitment and sincerity can be measured in decibels hillary clinton turned up the volume in sunday night s showdown with rival bernie sanders she also matched her louder volume with sharper attacks on sanders but the vermont socialist came ready to fight counterpunching and even landing a few blows you d have to give him the win if only narrowly on the grounds that not only did he dominate the discussion but that she was strangely treating him as the frontrunner or maybe it was just that she was trying to fight on sanders turf he s been shouting since before it was cool clinton seems to be abandoning the mantra of her campaign i m a fighter for an effort to approximate the anger that candidates on both sides of the aisle have been trying with varying degrees of success to ape but it s hard to believe that clinton is angry or at least that she is angry about something other than the fact that her party seems to delight in spurning her life has been very good to the clintons over the past 16 years to say the least except for the politics part clinton and her crew could assuage themselves after her 2008 primary loss that they were victims of history the sudden ascendance of a gifted african american candidate was more of a force of nature than a reflection of her political weakness but what if she were struggling with a guy who was deeply white and five years older than her what if the guy this time was not a gifted speechmaker but one who gave shout y campaign boilerplate in a brooklyn honk what if he had been honking around washington for 25 years and was generally written off as a crank it has apparently all been enough to rattle clinton whose onetime indulgence of sanders has turned into attacks and who seems to be on the verge of yet another campaign reboot tied or trailing sanders in the first two nominating contests it s hard to say she s wrong a huge lead in south carolina and what last month at least was a wide advantage in nevada still suggest that clinton isn t yet in danger of being toppled a second time and that her strategy of aggressively pursuing black voters and other parts of the obama coalition is paying off but would those leads look so stout if clinton were to lose the first two contests certainly not just ask south carolina democratic powerbroker rep jim clyburn who told the nyt the reality is if mrs clinton loses iowa and new hampshire that could create new and real problems for her here as of now you can still call clinton the presumptive democratic nominee but we are now seeing a scenario in which she might have to waste several damaging months on a fight that will harm her general election chances and distract public attention from the bazooka blasts on the gop side with your second cup of coffee america seems to owe an awful lot to high living french noblemen and if you like the idea of separation of power between branches of government then say joyeux anniversaire tocharles louis de secondat baron de la br de et de montesquieu born on this date in 1689 montesquieu led something of a dissipated life as a young nobleman at court in paris but became increasingly serious about his political writing and philosophizing a visit to england would open his mind further and give birth to a riot of political thought but perhaps chief among his insights was the value of divided government britannica explains dividingpolitical authorityinto the legislative executive and judicial powers montesquieu asserted that in the state that most effectively promotes liberty these three powers must be confided to different individuals or bodies acting independently though its accuracy has in more recent times been disputed in its own century it was admired and held authoritative even in england it inspired thedeclaration of the

a nasty guy he was so nice to me i mean i knew it i was watching i kept saying come on ted let s go okay but he s a nasty guy nobody likes him nobody in congress likes him nobody likes him anywhere once they get to know him he s a very he apos s got an edge that s not good you can apos t make deals with people like that and it apos s not a good thing it apos s not a good thing for the country

two man race what happens if jeb bush or chris christie can succeed in crippling marco rubio and leaves the republicans with only two choices one might assume that establishment support would flow to cruz a lifelong republican and sitting senator not necessarily says molly ball in a dispatch from the trail some republicans who have moved through the stages of grief from denial to bargaining if not yet acceptance have begun to suggest that trump might be preferable to cruz trump is if you squint a sort of moderate republican he s a dealmaker and surely he s craven enough to reverse his most alienating positions and say what people want to hear if he gets to the general election cruz on the other hand is an ideologue the scariest prospect of all is that he really means what he says and might if elected take it upon himself to actually upend the establishment s cherished status quo gop power index christie fadesnew jersey gov chris christie has painted himself a straight talker since he was elected to the governorship in 2009 and has made it a cornerstone of his presidential campaign s telling it like it is slogan town hall videos of his early days as governor hit the internet and people around the country were drawn to this frank no nonsense guy when he took on the teacher s unions and was asked about his own children s private education he responded it s none of your business which resonated with people tired of hearing exhaustive explanations from politicians but his straight talk attitude hasn t quite delivered on is message of late as christie tries to find a path from the middle of the pack in new hampshire to national viability he s come under increasing scrutiny and voters are hearing a lot more run on sentences than they were used to from christie in the fox business network debate last week christie claimed that he never supported justice sonya sotomayor s appointment to the supreme court but his statement at the time reads i support her appointment to the supreme court and urge the senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bi partisan support it s been the same of gun control although he has vetoed limits on clip size and photo ids for gun owners christie s record on guns is scattered national review s jim geraghty points out that in a 1993 race for new jersey senate christie issued a statement asserting that we already have too many firearms in our communities the issue which has energized me to get into this race is the recent attempt by certain republican legislators to repeal new jersey s ban on assault weapons in today s society no one needs a semi automatic assault weapon in november 2015 christie told bret baier in an interview for

luther king jr npr shares the reminiscence of tom houk king s driver and body man at the peak of the civil rights movement houck headed to atlanta to join the movement and was surprised at being picked up by dr king and his wife coretta scott king with the reverend at the wheel after lunch that day she asked houck if he might drive the children to school the following day j ust like that
