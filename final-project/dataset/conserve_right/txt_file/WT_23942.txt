with russia during the election cohen says trump did not directly tell him to lie but he would look me in the eye and tell me there s no business in russia and then go out and lie to the american people by saying the same thing top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots cohen says that in his way he was telling me to lie he adds that lawyers for trump had reviewed and edited the statement in which cohen falsely said a proposal for a trump tower in moscow had been abandoned in january 2016 cohen has since acknowledged he continued pursuing the project for months after that in the prepared testimony cohen apologizes for his actions i am ashamed that i chose to take part in concealing mr trump s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience he says trump at a vietnam hotel before a planned meeting with north korean leader kim jong un and unable to ignore the drama playing out thousands of miles away lashed out at cohen on twitter saying that cohen did bad things unrelated to trump and is lying in order to reduce his prison time cohen ahead of his appearance said tuesday that the american people can decide exactly who is telling the truth when he testifies wednesday before the house oversight and reform committee setting the stage for an explosive public hearing that threatens to overshadow trump s summit in vietnam with kim on wikileaks cohen says in the prepared testimony that he was in trump s office in july 2016 when longtime adviser roger stone called trump trump put stone on speakerphone and stone told him that he had communicated with wikileaks founder julian assange and that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage hillary clinton s campaign according to cohen trump responded by saying wouldn t that be great cohen says that month wikileaks released thousands of emails hacked from the democratic national committee s server a lot of people have asked me about whether mr trump knew about the release of the hacked democratic national committee emails ahead of time cohen says in the prepared testimony the answer is yes cohen says he does not have direct evidence that trump colluded with the russian government during the election but that he has suspicions of a meeting in trump tower between campaign advisers including trump s oldest son and a russian lawyer cohen says that trump had frequently told him that donald trump jr had the worst judgment of anyone in the world and he would never set up any meeting of any significance alone and certainly not without checking with his father cohen once trump s loyal attorney and fixer has turned on his former boss and cooperated with special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation he begins a three year prison sentence in may after he pleaded guilty to lying to congress in 2017 and committing campaign finance violations while he was working for trump he met senate intelligence committee for more than nine hours behind closed doors on tuesday cohen said in brief remarks afterward that he appreciated the opportunity to clear the record and tell the truth to the senate committee after acknowledging he lied to the panel in 2017 it was the first of three consecutive days of congressional appearances for cohen after the public hearing wednesday he will appear before the house intelligence panel thursday again speaking in private republicans are expected to aggressively attempt to discredit cohen given that he has acknowledged lying previously white house spokeswoman sarah sanders said in a statement tuesday it was laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like cohen at his word and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies one republican house member did more than just question cohen s credibility florida republican matt gaetz tweeted tuesday that the world is about to learn a lot about cohen and suggested he knew of disparaging information that could come out during the hearing gaetz later apologized and said he was deleting the tweet gaetz a trump ally who talks to the president frequently is not a member of the committee that will question cohen democrats have been alternately suspicious of cohen and eager to hear what he has to say sen mark warner the intelligence panel s top democrat suggested in a brief statement to reporters outside tuesday s interview that cohen had provided important information two years ago when this investigation started i said it may be the most important thing i am involved in in my public life in the senate and nothing i ve heard today dissuades me from that view warner said in addition to lying to congress cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations for his involvement in payments to two women who allege they had affairs with trump federal prosecutors in new york have said trump directed cohen to arrange the payments to buy the silence of porn actress stormy daniels and former playboy model karen mcdougal in the run up to the 2016 campaign cohen told a judge that he agreed to cover up trump s dirty deeds out of blind loyalty cohen says in his prepared testimony that he lied to the first lady melania trump about the affairs trump has denied that he had the affairs lying to the first lady is one of my biggest regrets he says she is a kind good person i respect her greatly and she did not deserve that cohen also says he will present the committee with a copy of the check trump wrote from his personal bank account after he became president to reimburse him for the hush money payments he claims he has other exhibits as well including some financial statements on the matter of racism cohen says the president made racist comments disparaging african americans saying at one point that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid cohen is not expected to discuss matters related to russia in the public hearing saving that information for the closed door interviews with the intelligence committees house oversight and reform chairman elijah cummings has said he doesn t want to interfere with mueller s investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election and links to trump s campaign members of the oversight panel are expected to ask questions about the campaign finance violations trump s business practices and compliance with tax laws and the accuracy of the president s public statements according to a memo laying out the scope of the hearing associated press write
