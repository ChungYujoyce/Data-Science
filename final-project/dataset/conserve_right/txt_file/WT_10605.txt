environment protection and international security are the driving forces of the assembly and could be the source of fierce policy disputes in the next several years some smaller powers say they don t want to get trampled in the rush as the major powers stake their claims the guiding spirit of the arctic council is that we don t want this to be a race for resources on the contrary the model of the wild west has been refuted by the nations bordering the arctic iceland president olafur grimsson said earlier this year mr grimsson and ms rogoff co founded the arctic circle assembly to raise awareness around the world particularly in the united states of the important issues the u s could be more engaged and could be more involved mr grimsson said the arctic is america s backyard it is

new route going over the north pole reduces the average europe to asia shipping times by 45 percent with the melting of the arctic sea ice we are already seeing a new northern sea route shortening the
