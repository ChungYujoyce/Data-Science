job in the chinese media remains a risky proposition it shouldn t be the constitution of the people s republic of china guarantees freedom of the press as does the official national human rights action plan which commits the government to strengthening the legitimate right and interests of chinese journalists instead government officials security forces and plainclothes thugs continue to deny
