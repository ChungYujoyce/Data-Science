who in 1999 was a department head at the military technical institute in belgrade as saying while not completely invisible to radar the f 117 s shape and radar absorbent coating make detection extremely difficult the radar cross section was further reduced because the wings leading and trailing edges were composed of nonmetallic honeycomb structures that do not reflect radar rays experts
