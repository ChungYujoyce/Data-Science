apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic dubai united arab emirate ap u s allies in the persian gulf have loudly pushed for hawkish policies by washington to pressure isolate and cripple iran but this high stakes strategy is now being put to the test by the unexpected u s strike that killed iran s most powerful military commander last week thrusting the region closer to full blown conflict even as gulf arab states like israel lobbied hard for tough u s sanctions and maximum pressure on iran saudi arabia and the united arab emirates have wanted to avoid outright war friday s airstrike that killed the revolutionary guard s powerful quds force commander qassem soleimani appears to have caught america s gulf allies off guard now they are trying to make sure the major escalation by president donald trump doesn t drag them further into the cross hairs of rising tensions between washington and tehran top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk iran which held an unprecedented multi city funeral procession for soleimani that drew millions to the streets to mourn him retaliated early wednesday by firing a series of ballistic missiles at two military bases in iraq where american troops are stationed trump signaled he would not retaliate militarily but vowed to continue his campaign of maximum pressure and economic sanctions on iran as the region braces for what comes next saudi arabia and the uae are calling for de escalation saudi arabia dispatched deputy defense minister prince khalid bin salman to washington where he met with trump and the u s president s son in law and adviser jared kushner at the white house on monday the kingdom says he discussed efforts to reduce tensions and avoid escalations that could further destabilize the region in light of the iranian regime s provocations and destabilizing activities qatar s foreign minister meanwhile traveled to tehran the day after the killing of soleimani and also called for de escalation nobody wants the outbreak of conventional war because when conventional war happens there are no winners there are just a series of losers said mohammed alyahya the saudi editor in chief of the al arabiya english news website this latest round of tensions has pushed oil prices up with brent crude trading around 70 a barrel uae energy minister suhail al mazrouei said on wednesday there is no risk at the moment to the movement of oil in the region or any shortages in oil supply he noted however that soleimani s killing was definitely an escalation iran is a neighbor we are geographically very close to iran and the last thing we want is another tension in the middle east the energy minister said reiterating calls for de escalation the uae and saudi arabia have long wanted the u s to push back tehran s drive to spread influence and power across the region and soleimani was central to iran s ambitions viewed by sunni muslims across much of the region as a menacing figure his role as quds force commander put him in charge of lethal shiite proxy militias in lebanon iraq syria and yemen fighting against gulf arab interests in iran he s hailed as a national hero who defied u s pressure even after soleiman s killing there s little indication they ve stopped skirting the dangerous line between maximum pressure and war alyahya said the pressure strategy is still needed to stop iran s quds force but he acknowledged that it is a very risky game and if it backfires the consequences are grave robert malley who heads international crisis group and served on obama s national security council said gulf countries are likely satisfied that soleimani was killed but are also worried because iran could inflict serious damage on their economies i think they are now sending the message to the u s and to others let s not let this go too far because you re living very far away we re going to be the ones who will pay the price and you won t be here to protect us he said the persian gulf could be another target of iranian retaliation it hosts more than 30 000 u s troops including the navy s 5th fleet stationed in bahrain u s army s central forward headquarters in kuwait and at the sprawling al udeid air base in qatar the u s also has hundreds of troops in saudi arabia and advanced drones f 35 fighter jets and several thousand military personnel in al dhafra air base in abu dhabi already over the summer a series of attacks on oil tankers in the persian gulf and a major missile and drone attack on saudi oil facilities were blamed on iran tehran denied responsibility though it did seize oil tankers around the crucial strait of hormuz the narrow mouth of the persian gulf through which 20 of the world s crude oil travels over the weekend the u s warned american citizens in saudi arabia of a heightened risk of missile and drone strikes particularly near military bases oil and gas facilities and other critical civilian infrastructure since the september attack on saudi arabia which temporarily halved its oil production there appears to have been a quiet effort at diplomacy between iran and the kingdom to ease tensions but there s no sign either side had inched closer to overcoming their rivalry iraqi prime minister adel abdul mahdi told lawmakers in baghdad on sunday that he had been scheduled to meet soleimani the morning he was killed he said soleimani was carrying a message from iran s supreme leader in response to a saudi message relayed through iraq to iran about important agreements and breakthroughs in iraq and the region neither iran nor saudi arabia have confirmed abdul mahdi s comments alyahya called abdul mahdi s account an intricate tall tale echoing widespread saudi sentiment he said soleimani was no dove for peace u s secretary of state mike pompeo on tuesday also dismissed the notion as propagandist and suggested that the saudis share his view that soleimani was not in iraq on a peace mission complicating the gulf rulers calculations are questions about whether trump s decision to order the strike on soleimani was made impulsively or is part of a longer term strategy gulf allies have been questioning trump s reliability as a security partner though he has strengthened america s military presence in the gulf amid rising tensions with iran trump did not step in to militarily defend saudi interests after the attack on oil sites and backed away from retaliation when iran shot down a u s surveillance drone in the strait of hormuz in remarks on wednesday trump stated we are independent and we do not need middle east oil and said he would ask nato to step up its involvement in the region the constant thing about trump is he s unpredictable emirati political analyst abdulkhaleq abdullah said we didn t that he would do this now we don t know what he will do next is america ready for revenge of a sort coming from iran is the region ready for a sharp escalation asked a
