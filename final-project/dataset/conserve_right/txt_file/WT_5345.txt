apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the 1979 u s embassy takeover in tehran may have ended after 444 days but both america and iran still remain captive to a crisis that began 40 years ago while those held hostage at the embassy ultimately would be released iran to this day holds dual nationals and those with western ties as bargaining chips for negotiating deals cries of death of america still echo through hard line rallies as iran s supreme leader criticizes the untrustworthiness of the great satan over president donald trump unilaterally pulling the u s out of the 2015 nuclear deal that mutual suspicion has reached a level unseen since the hostage crisis and perhaps in some ways has gone beyond it top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state while president jimmy carter ultimately expelled all iranian diplomats from the u s during the crisis america kept issuing visas to iranians today the trump administration s longstanding travel ban on iran and other nations largely keeps iranians from getting visas at all despite large iranian american populations in cities like los angeles the ban has brought non immigrant visa issuance for iranians down from over 35 000 in 2015 to some 6 000 in 2018 according to state department statistics that has cut off families from each other as well as shut down a crucial source of information about iran that u s diplomats gather during visa interviews meanwhile the chance for an armed conflict has risen something avoided even during the hostage crisis the u s blames iran for a series of attacks across the middle east in the last six months culminating with a drone and cruise missile attack on saudi arabia in september that halved the kingdom s oil production and caused energy markets to spike iran denies being responsible for that attack as well as for explosions that targeted oil tankers off the united arab emirates however tehran proudly claimed shooting down a u s military surveillance drone in june and has seized other tankers how did the u s and iran get here a direct line can be drawn back to the american miscalculations before during and after the islamic revolution iran is not in a revolutionary or even a pre revolutionary situation a cia analysis on the country circulated in the white house declared in august 1978 there is dissatisfaction with the shah s tight control of the political process but this does not at all at present threaten the government by january 1979 shah mohammad reza pahlavi would flee iran while suffering from a fatal illness the u s knew nothing about the islamic revolution would take hold in the next month which also would see marxist students overrun the embassy in tehran and briefly hold it the u s in part realized the danger its diplomats employees military advisers and spies faced the u s presence in iran dropped from over 1 400 civilian and military personnel to about 70 by the time of the nov 4 1979 embassy takeover however the carter administration sought to establish a relationship with iran s revolutionary government there had been billions of dollars in arms sales to the shah including advanced f 14 tomcat jet fighters that required american support the u s also wanted to maintain access to its secret listening posts in iran to monitor signals and missile tests in the soviet union america long had seen the shah as a bulwark in the persian gulf against soviet expansion soviet forces would invade afghanistan amid the hostage crisis leading to the carter doctrine that the u s would use military force to defend its interests across the energy rich region all this blinded washington to warnings from tehran when carter allowed the shah into new york for medical treatment oct 23 he lit the fuse for the islamist student takeover a protest nov 1 saw the embassy protected that wasn t the case nov 4 both the 15th anniversary of the shah expelling ayatollah ruhollah khomeini from iran and of a bloody attack by security forces on students the year before police faded into the background as hundreds of students jumped the fence and took over the embassy in 3 1 2 hours but the students themselves would date their anger back further to the 1953 coup that overthrew iran s elected prime minister and cemented the shah s power a putsch organized by the cia and british spies the hostage crisis ultimately ended on the day president ronald reagan was inaugurated in 1981 it saw both sides agree to the algiers accords which promised to end disputes over unfulfilled military purchases made by the shah outstanding court cases and u s political and military intervention in iran s internal affairs yet today some payments from the shah s era remain outstanding as iran continues to detain dual nationals a u n panel has described an emerging pattern involving the arbitrary deprivation of liberty of dual nationals in iran in the case of detained iranian british national nazanin zaghari ratcliffe some have tied her case to 400 million pounds 530 million held by the united kingdom from a never completed tank sale to the shah meanwhile iran routinely accuses the u s of interfering in its internal affairs it points now to the trump administration s maximum pressure policy which it describes as trying to topple its shiite theocracy iran has sought to challenge trump s renewed u s sanctions after his pullout from the nuclear deal before the international court of justice at the hague but like with everything in this crisis iran s argument took root in the long history between the two countries
