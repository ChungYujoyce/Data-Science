apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic dubai united arab emirates in back to back asian summits this month iran s president made sure to carve out special time to look east at one gathering in azerbaijan mahmoud ahmadinejad reminded the president of kazakhstan about the vision of a railway linking the heart of central asia with iran s warm ports at another meeting in kuwait he held talks with tajikistan s leader about their growing trade ties top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning even as u s and european sanctions tighten around iran s economy officials in tehran are busy reaching out to asian markets as a critical lifeline for months iran s oil sales to energy hungry nations such as china and india have been the focus of intense western efforts to reduce the flow as part of the pressure over iran s disputed nuclear program yet lesser but not insignificant economic pathways for iran also run along the ancient silk road connecting china and the middle east while iranian trade and projects in central asia are tiny compared with oil sales to the continent s economic powerhouses the outreach represents another way for tehran to seek economic buffers from sanctions in a region where washington holds relatively limited sway it also displays some of iran s first steps at trying to diversify its economy away from oil which still represents 80 percent of foreign currency revenue and develop backyard markets for its construction and technology industries the iranian economy is so strong that it could live without oil revenues mr ahmadinejad said at a pan asian summit last week in kuwait our people could get accustomed to that and i think that things will change in the near future on tuesday iranian oil minister rostam qasemi told an energy conference in dubai that iran has contingency plans to run the country without the critical oil revenue including investments in solar and other renewable sources while iran is a long way off from functioning without its oil income and may never reach that stage the remarks reflect real ambitions to turn central asia into a key market for iranian goods and technological expertise while offering the landlocked former soviet republics access to the sea in august carmaker iran khodro announced plans to boost exports to kazakhstan and turkmenistan in tajikistan iranian construction firms are major builders with projects such as hydroelectric power stations and a 39 million tunnel that connects the capital dushanbe to northern tajikistan but the centerpiece of the islamic republic s outreach an uninterrupted rail link through central asia remains caught up in disputes and competing ventures more than 15 years after the first leg was opened between iran and neighboring turkmenistan last month turkmen president gurbanguli berdymukhamedov abruptly canceled a reported 700 million contract with iran s pars energy to continue the rail line to kazakhstan along the caspian sea coast the reasons were unclear but turkmenistan has been reviewing its deep trade ties with iran as western sanctions widen meanwhile turkmenistan and uzbekistan have expressed interest in joining a rail project running from azerbaijan s caspian coast to the eastern turkish area of kars such a railway would bypass iran and still provide the sea access coveted by the central asian states iran has no choice but to turn to asia for trade because of the western sanctions said sasan fayazmanesh an economic affairs expert and head of the middle east studies program at california state university fresno but that of course will not solve iran s problem of selling its oil since the central asian countries for the most part do not need iran s oil but for tehran its overtures to central asia mean more than just a price tag iran has been a cultural point of reference for centuries across the ex soviet states through books films and traditions dating back to persia s pre islamic zoroastrian faith iran s main central asian foothold tajikistan also shares linguistic ties that give iran an important commercial edge over china and russia a weak link for iran however is the rifts within islam much of central asia is sunni muslim and governments are cautious about any moves that could stir sectarian tensions with shiite minorities these same divides in turn help cement
