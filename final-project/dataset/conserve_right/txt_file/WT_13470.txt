exchange the center for strategic and international studies which has taken a turn to the left under current president john hamre recently held an unusual series of meetings in china on cybersecurity china s state run newspaper global times reported last month that u s and china were discreetly engaged in cyberwarfare exercises involving u s and chinese think tank specialists the problem according to u s officials is that the chinese think tank involved was a front for the political police and intelligence services known as the ministry of state security the front group is the china institutes of contemporary international relations known as cicir pronounced kicker which is notorious among u s security and intelligence officials for its work on behalf of chinese intelligence according to
