today s new york times addressing an open letter to the commission on presidential debates cpd the bipartisan if technically nonpartisan outfit that is scheduled to announce the sept 26 debate participants as soon as tomorrow though likely a few days after in the ad the libertarians point out that solid majorities of americans want them up there on stage that they are polling at 15 percent in 15 states and that the conditions of the presidential election of 2016 are extraordinary and without precedent as if to underscore that last point a new sept 8 13 quinnipiac poll which shows johnson with a record tying level of 13 percent support also found that less than one third of hillary clinton and donald trump voters are doing so because they like their own candidate the johnson weld letter ends with this flourish allow us to make our case to the american people if in the polls that follow we fail to meet that 15 standard we ll make no further efforts for inclusion in the subsequent debates your board was empaneled to ensure fairness in the political process this is an unparalleled moment in our nation s history and the eyes of the world are upon us all we invite you to be on the right side of that history the cpd last month said it would announce the sept 26 finalists in mid september which technically occurs midnight tomorrow however two of the five survey the commission selected to determine average polling numbers cbs news new york times and nbc news wall street journal haven t produced results in more than six weeks almost certainly the debate commission will wait until those two polls come in as mentioned here previously johnson would have to average 25 percent across both to meet the 15 0 threshold with the minutes to d day ticking down and after nearly four months including today at the detroit economic club of repeating that to win we have to be in the presidential debates johnson and his campaign are lunging desperately for any available stick bill weld has been warning all month that the debate commission could lose their tax exempt status if they don t let the libertarians in a threat that campaign manager ron nielson slyly alludes to near the close of his let them debate op ed in today s l a times the cpd a private tax exempt organization under section 501 c 3 of the tax code has the opportunity to do the right thing keep in mind that the libertarians were plaintiffs in a lawsuit against the commission as recently as last month cpd co chair mike mccurry meanwhile shot back a week ago that changing the pre established criteria at this late date could put the commission in legal jeopardy though it s hard to imagine exactly who would sue johnson did score some nice points however by snagging a debate inclusion endorsement by an actual commission member former indiana governor and current purdue university president mitch daniels daniels was also quite generous in holding a public q a with johnson last night at purdue attended by around 1 000 people about which more stay tuned to this space the campaign is also trying to work the refs using argumentation of dubious quality when it comes to the way the polls themselves are being conducted and received nielson in his piece today complained that the cpd s big five polls often restrict themselves to head to head match ups between trump and clinton which just flat out isn t true johnson in detroit today complained at some length that his name has never been listed as the first option on a national poll and that this has skewed results politifact looked at this claim in late august and judged it false finding that eleven of the 25 polls we looked at close to half included johnson in their first or only question about the presidential horse race none of these polls vaulted gary johnson to 20 percent in fact he did slightly worse on average when he was included in the first horse race question the debate desperation is beginning to seep over into the pro johnson superpac world as well if all these hail marys fail to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat the campaign has been preparing the way for counter programming outside the debates that would depend on stoking outrage among the press and the public over the system being so obviously rigged to that extent nielson makes perhaps the best argument of the lot there is also precedent to consider in 1992 h ross perot polled well through early summer when matched up against then president george h w bush and bill clinton after he temporarily dropped out of the race his numbers plummeted and by the time he got back in he was only at 7 to 9 in national polls that s lower than johnson by most accounts nevertheless he was invited to participate in the debates and he went on to win 18 7 of the popular vote if voters had not been given the opportunity to see him go head to head with the standard bearers of the obsolete two party system he would never have gone so far shouldn t johnson get the same chance next lionel shriver praises cultural appropriation attacks super sensitivity while wearing a sombrero matt welch is an editor at largeatreason show comments

political process sheesh i had hoped johnson was going to tell the truth the cpd s official mission statement is to provide the best possible information to viewers and listeners they are nakedly violating their own mission their arbitrary criterion should never be given a pass as anything other than the institutionalized corruption it is start working at home with google it s by far the best job i ve had last wednesday i got a brand new bmw since getting a check for 6474 this 4 weeks past i began this 8 months ago and immediately was bringing home at least 77 per hour i work through this link go to tech tab for work detail http www highpay90 com quit grovelling these guys have the mission of sidelining guys like you creative protests alternate debate forums live youtube answers to debate questions troll the shit out of the cpd until they become irrelevant or maybe they could try not trashing libertarian positions to side with the left i ve been fairly free with my criticisms i m not saying i ll vote for them but to the extent they have the potential to attack the duopoly i am still withthem that s the thing though it would not have been hard for theme to win your vote or mine or the scads of other anti trump conservatives that was their best shot at 15 and they wouldn t have had to stray nearly as far from libertarian positions as they have in pursuing the center left and msm support that s already in the bag for hillary anyway it would not have been hard for theme to win your vote or mine or the scads of other anti trump conservatives paradoxically that wouldn t ultimately be in our favor hear me out i propose that the election result that gives the most liberty for the most of us is for hillary clinton to lose or stein but let s get real here not hillary is a better result than any other therefore if there should be a third party and if that third party has no real shot of winning then construct the third party so that it pulls more votes from hillary s side which is what the johnson weld ticket does it s not a good ticket for libertarianism seriously when did the libertarian party be in favor of public accommodation laws but that doesn t matter the ticket is good enough to maybe just maybe get to the thresholds for public campaign money and exposure plus debate exposure and it looks like it ll torpedo hillary s chances more than help them that s better than a purer ticket imho where purity might get in the way of the preceding two good results or the scads of other anti trump conservatives no clinton is a better fit for anti trump conservatives than johnson could ever be agreed somehow these guys failed to notice that hillary is a better neocon than trump or johnson show me some johnson spineless grovelling has been his whole campaign strategy why stop now yes i hope that gary johnson gets in the debates to educate the public about the horrors of religious freedom and freedom of association and weld to inveigh against gun rights this is our chance for a libertarian moment people shhhhhhh those things don t matter because they ve walked them back however trump is the devil because he said some ridiculous things and then walked them back but they re different johnson weld may not be the second coming but they re the lesser of three evils so you re just a yokel republitarian if you don t vote for them sarc i look forward to gary johnson getting into the debates so he can educate the world about the evils of climate change his proposal for a carbon tax is excellent if the cartoon captain planet gets remade i fully expect a gary johnson character to go after evil corporations polluting gaia with co2 and when hillary clinton talks bout raising the minimum wage and trump counters with paid maternity leave gary will be ready to pounce gary will one up them both with a guaranteed minimum income gary understands that government is just another name for things we do together it s not you or me it s we i personally can t wait to hear another rant about using the word illegal versus undocumented don t worry trump will wave the libertarian banner proudly a border wall mass deportations higher spending no entitlement reform a bigger badder military bring back torture spy on everyone feel the freedom thank you for bringing things into perspective for the haters don t forget trade war with china which is probably the single most disastrous thing trump proposes johnson weld to debate commission let down your 15 threshold just this once and break the rules we have rules in place for a reason and if we make an exception for you we ll have to make an exception for everyone you see that s what exception means changing the rule for all time and yet it will remain an exception logic johnson weld to debate commission let down your 15 threshold just this once uh uh no trophies for participation just heard a gary johnson commercial on the radio during rush limbaugh it was hilarious on many levels first that it was explicitly speaking to millennials not much of limbaugh s audience i m afraid second that it didn t say anything about johnson other than that he wasn t democrat or republican it just as easily could have been a jill stein or constitution party ad and he wonders why he can t get 15 i can t believe someone with gayjay s top shelf political savvy could miss that big rolls eyes so hard they flip over yeah it s ads 30 seconds isn t really enough to go in depth he can t get 15 percent in the polls because he gets 0 1 percent of the news coverage the 15 percent standard is stupid all johnson needs to say is that he s qualified 2 term governor and he s on the ballot people want a third choice here i am if voters had not been given the opportunity to see him go head to head with the standard bearers of the obsolete two party system he would never have gone so far and matt wins the internet s answer your own question competition for today apparently the 2 party system wasn t obsolete just then mike mccurry when he isn t busy rigging an election i assume he s somehow lobbying against my freedom cpd co chair mike mccurry meanwhile shot back a week ago that changing the pre established criteria at this late date could put the commission in legal jeopardy though it s hard to imagine exactly who would sue nobody has to sue the irs can go after them independently and mccurry is absolutely right making an exception for one candidate would put their tax exemption on much shakier ground than adhering to an objective standard but who is harmed by being more inclusive rather than less people who don t want to be bored to death by feyjay just add the rule that if you can get your name on the ballot in 50 states you get in the debates so oklahoma can hold the debates hostage with its hostile ballot access laws and what if someone is recognized as a write in candidate is that the same as being on the ballot i prefer the ability to get to 270 that plus 3 any candidates who are on the ballot in enough states to have mathematical possibility of winning should be in the debates any other standard is partisan mathematically being on the ballot only in one medium sized state means a possibility of victory that is they could mathematically take that state s electoral votes depriving the other 2 candidates of an electoral majority and throwing the election into the house where they will be mathematically capable of being elected it could be any size state not just a medium sized one 269 268 3 still throws it to the house the likelihood of a candidate not from the party that controls the house never mind not from one of the two major parties being selected by the house is practically nil however let s pretend i knew how many total electors there were 269 266 3 the republican dominated house hates the man who destroyed their national party trump they would love to appoint a former republican governor to be president house gop would have to grow quite a pair to spit on the deplorables like that unless johnson won more ec votes than trump too early in the day for that pipe dream i said mathematically not pedantically have to say that this seems like the decent way of deciding who gets to be in the debates if you re going to be on the ballet in enough states that you could potentially win then you should be in the debates it s not for some biased bigwigs to decide whose voice is worth hearing on a big national level how are gary johnson or jill stein supposed to meet that 15 threshold when the vast majority of the people haven t the slightest clue who either of those two people are because some biased bipartisan commission says they aren t worth wasting the public s time with because the majority of the public doesn t know they exist 270 electoral vote access not write in to show you have an actual campaign party behind you and 1 percent in the polls to show you re not a crank or cult or say your poll numbers have to be higher than your share of the media coverage johnson says just the tip just the first third pretty please let me into the debates is somewhere just under publicly begging for sex in the list of moves guaranteed to make you look pathetic to all outside observers but hey live by the establishment media cred die by the well you get the point i d prefer an attack ad quoting the league of women voters the headline says 62 percent of americans want him in the debates he s making the cpd look like bullies if gary and jill aren t in the debate i think the doj should be forced to issue a dear colleague letter to the all public universities and schools banning the debates from being broadcast because they are excluding people which is a violation of the title ix begging for sex would be the most libertarian thing garry johnson could do that or yell you aren t the boss of me at his dad is his dad even still alive though better off begging for sex if he wants to consolidate the liberatarian base or maybe he could make up stories about getting laid in high school that s pretty libertarian too don t forget trying to get people to believe you re some sort of cowboy construction worker navy seal from your air conditioned office while you contemplate the pros cons of a standing desk sorry for the repost just in case anyone would like to see here is the hillary clinton 20 questions tweet parody or lacking self awareness she is getting killed in the replies twitter com hillaryclinton status 776094652336369664 sorry not very computer savy omit the space oh god he used right side of history i wouldn t let him in just on principle now yea i didnt like that phrase either johnson to the debate commission debate commission tear down this threshold out of an abundance of caution shouldn t we ban bipartisan debate commissions a part of me had hoped that the truly terrible quality of the candidates in this election cycle their blatant lies the media corruption and the systems set in place to maintain the two party system would cause people to finally lose their faith in government and politicians but from what i see and hear from acquaintances this isn t happening everyone keeps looking for the right top men yeah they re screwed desperation hail mary s yes that will be quite enough sit tight in 12 days fans of gj will be pleased they didn t have a podium as dt and hrc will sink further imagine if weld is subsequently invited to the oct 4 vp debate gayjay should sue the presidential debate commission for discrimination under the americans with disabilities act debates are a black hole gary was just endorsed by the most influential paper in nh the union leader first time in its history they endorsed a non republican three major newspaper endorsements in less than two weeks va nc nh more to come in next 6 weeks we need gary johnson there can you imagine the exchanges clinton citizen united is bad gary johnson she s a fine public servant clinton we need more gun control johnson we need to keep guns out of the hands of the mentally ill you guys clinton churches need to pay for other people s birth control and abortions johnson religious liberty is a black hole you guys seriously clinton i will appoint the most progressive judges ever johnson breyer is a super great judge you guys riveting clinton free college free medical care big military more wars beef up social security trump bigger military who do we bomb first i ll fix the economy so much social security will be fine johnson cut spending by 20 percent you make the call just as patrick answered i am inspired that you can earn 5103 in 1 month on the internet see this website http www businessbay4 com just as patrick answered i am inspired that you can earn 5103 in 1 month on the internet see this website http www businessbay4 com 15 percent is crazy high 1 percent is high enough in the primary debates to keep out the riff raff no access on all ballots is the only defensible criterion your board was empaneled to ensure fairness in the political process no it fucking wasn t its entire purpose is to make damned sure that no ruling party hack ever has to face another ross perot jcr the rank partisanship by the demublicans is why the league of women voters opted out of sponsoring the debates several cycles ago the demublican duopoly made it impossible for lwv to be neutral the cpd should lose their 501c3 status they shoudl be a 501c4 org not for profit but not contributing to the public good so donations are not deductible to the giver i really thank the author of this article freedom apk the article has great significance for me it just leads me to do better things for this life true skate mod apk very meaningful thank you very much wish you happy your board was empaneled to ensure fairness in the political process since our lawsuit charging that you are a corrupt cartel which is a tool of the major parties was thrown out we ll try brownnosing the people in this country are getting a little tired of media rnc and dnc manipulating our elections the elections are the last fallacy that we have a free society and if enough people finally realize that elections are just another scam the results may not be pretty don t worry americans today are too effeminate for a revolution for the record here is a link to the ad link begging level desperation is one of the most unattractive traits a man can have ask any normal heterosexual woman she ll confirm what a turnoff it is besides why does gayjay want to embarrass himself for an even bigger audience than he already has you ve repeatedly shown that you re not ready for prime time son just this once i thought the whole point of selling out was to get the party into the debates going forward not just johnson it s not like his debate style is going to earn the lp another shot his rise in the polls has nothing to do with him or libertarianism he s merely benefiting from being the most viable non trump non clinton alternative the only benefit to having him in the debates is that it will draw more support away from clinton but that s not worth trashing the lp label for this seems to be more about appeasing johnson s ego if they let him in without the needed 15 then i can only come to the conclusion that the establishment is indeed pushing trump if they keep him out then they re backing hillary johnson should cut a deal with one of the other networks to give his solo responses all within the time limits to all the questions posed to both candidates noting if some are skipped or altered for relevancy considerations and altering some with note to indicate how q s would have been altered if aimed at him it should be broadcast immediately after the debate so voters would have t c s responses fresh in their minds and would see how j stacked up against them my guess is that within 48 hours he d poll at close to 20 alternatively he could record it releasing first to a major network and perhaps then to an inet provider or all of youtube an hour 5 10 or 24 hours later michael j mcfadden philadelphia pa such an awesome article you must also
