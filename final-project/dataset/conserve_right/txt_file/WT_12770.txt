be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion alast month as the world awaited news of tense negotiations between iran and the so called p5 1 the united states russia china united kingdom and france plus germany over tehran s growing nuclear program a rising giant with an already sizable nuclear arsenal made its own headlines the news once again proved why asia and not the middle east is the world s most dangerous corner of the world and a place where america can ill afford a show of weakness or indecision with the people s republic of china s unilateral creation of what has been called an air defense identification zone over a large section of the east china sea that overlaps contested territory claimed by japan beijing has sown the seeds of what could quickly become a full blown military crisis with clear ramifications for the united states to be fair an air defense identification zone essentially an area that carves out an early warning buffer zone supporting the detection of intrusions into a nation s sovereign airspace is not aggressive on its own many nations including the united states canada and japan have created such defensive areas what is aggressive is declaring such a zone over the contested senkaku islands claimed by both tokyo and beijing thanks to a deadly brew of budding nationalism on the chinese mainland the discovery of valuable national resources and a historic rivalry with japan that stretches back over a century china has set its sights on laying the groundwork for what beijing officials have called indisputable sovereignty over the islands top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches in fact beijing s recent move is part of a carefully crafted plan to control the seas and now the skies around the senkakus for the past year beijing has played a calculated game of chicken with japan over the group of five uninhabited islands that have been under japanese administration since the 1970s when tokyo formally purchased three of the islands from private japanese owners last summer beijing used the incident to aggressively press its claims china has dispatched nonnaval maritime vessels surveillance planes unmanned aerial vehicles and elements of its increasingly advanced air force to patrol the area around the islands tokyo has responded by deploying its own forces and reportedly threatened to shoot down any foreign unmanned aircraft within its airspace the situation almost spiraled out of control at least once when in january a chinese naval vessel locked its firing radar on a japanese destroyer and helicopter chinese academics even went as far in may as to make an argument that okinawa where a sizable amount of u s forces are based should also be contested chinese aspirations don t stop with just the declaration of this new air defense identification zone however or in the east china sea either indeed such a move is just the latest in a series of provocative acts beijing has committed in the wider asia pacific that go back several years in the south china sea china has been locked in a deadly competition with the philippines over a disputed area known as scarborough shoal an area rich in fishing stocks but clearly within manila s territorial waters as recognized by international law beijing has effectively seized the area just 124 nautical miles off the philippine coast in fact china is also actively contesting the control of another philippine shoal in a race for supremacy throughout the area beijing has been so bold as to claim 80 percent of the south china sea drawing what has been described as a nine dash line around an area where trillions of dollars of commerce traverse every year and placing it in direct conflict with vietnam taiwan brunei and malaysia with china declaring it could also create additional air defense identification zones in the near future the next logical location for such a move would be in the south china sea beijing s recent deployment of an aircraft carrier to the region could be the first step toward such a move the danger for the united states is clear a shooting war between china and japan in the skies over east asia or between beijing and its neighbors in the south china sea would be a disaster of global proportions maybe even a third world war however china s recent actions can only have one intention to change the status quo in its own favor for washington there are a number of options to ensure that beijing understands we will support our allies and ensure the peace and prosperity of the wider asia pacific china may need to be reminded that the status quo a peaceful neighborhood where beijing has risen economically and militarily is no guarantee if it continues along such a dangerous path washington should announce that increased arms sales to taiwan such as the stealthy f 35 or even submarines and increased defense collaboration with japan and south korea could be under consideration as a response to chinese acts if beijing does declare an air defense identification zone in the south china sea washington must strongly consider increasing the amount of forward deployed forces to the region such as missile defense batteries and nuclear attack submarines such strong signals will not only indicate american resolve in the face of chinese aggression but demonstrate to our allies we are committed to their defense clearly the stakes in asia could not be any higher history will not forgive president obama if he chooses to lead from behind in asia harry j kazianis is managing editor for the national interest and a non resident fellow of the center of strategic and internationa
