apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic retired army gen michael flynn is picking up where republicans left off last year as he tries to turn the fbi inside out to find new evidence the house gop in 2017 18 launched an aggressive investigation into decisions by the barack obama administration to put the fbi s russia probe squarely on president trump and his colleagues among other discoveries republicans found out that the fbi relied on a now discredited democratic party financed dossier to obtain wiretaps and run down its anti trump allegations see also read flynn s court motion demanding all evidence the midterm elections ousted gop house control stopping the inquisitors now flynn s new attorney sidney powell has filed court motions to try to unearth documents on how the fbi pursued not just the former general but the trump cast ms powell a texas appeals attorney wants to prove that former special counsel robert mueller didn t abide by u s district judge emmet g sullivan s brady order in february 2018 the term derives from the 1963 u s supreme court decision in brady v maryland that mandates that prosecutors turn over exculpatory evidence to the defense michael caputo a trump campaign adviser says ms powell has documented justice department chicanery in the past when the bogus russia investigations started many of us caught up in the hoax passed around sidney powell s book licensed to lie to prepare for the worst mr caputo told the washington times she s a real expert on the justice department s habit of hiding exculpatory information today she s representing all of america shining a light on this systemic corruption and advancing our knowledge of the origins of this politically commissioned inquiry ms powell filed an extraordinary motion last week listing a smorgasbord of documents she wants judge sullivan to force the government to relinquish her aim is twofold first find brady material by delving deep inside the fbi and the justice department s trump russia probe akin to how republicans did the same chore last year second ask the judge to dismiss the case based on a brady violation special assistant u s attorney brandon van grack quickly rejected the bid saying the prosecution ended with flynn s guilty plea the government has exceeded its discovery and disclosure obligations in this matter including those imposed pursuant to brady v maryland mr grack said in an aug 30 filing said ms powell not only have the prosecutors thumbed their noses at this court s order they have ignored the rules of ethical conduct for the d c bar in a list of 40 plus items she is demanding access to fbi agent interview notes or 302s internal memos wiretap transcripts and records of any anti flynn leaks to reporters some are tantalizing ms powell asserts that the british embassy may have sent a letter to the new trump white house warning that christopher steele the dossier writer was unreliable flynn briefly mr trump s national security adviser pleaded guilty to lying to two fbi agents they visited the white house on jan 24 2017 to ask him about phone calls he conducted with russian ambassador sergey kislyak the agents including peter strzok knew what flynn had said flynn committed a falsehood by saying he had not urged kremlin restraint over obama economic sanctions when he did in fact say that flynn s sentencing was delayed while he cooperated with prosecutors in a case tied to foreign lobbying not russian election interference mr mueller concluded his 22 month probe in march with a verdict that he could not establish that the trump campaign conspired with moscow in 2016 election trespassing since flynn s guilty plea on dec 1 2017 20 months ago new revelations emerged about how the fbi went about targeting trump aides including flynn he fired his defense team and summoned ms powell long a brady champion among new disclosures since the guilty plea the republican majority on the house permanent select committee on intelligence reported in may 2018 on closed door testimony from then deputy fbi director andrew mccabe mr mccabe testified that the agents who interviewed flynn didn t think he was lying former fbi director james b comey said at a public event that he sent agents to interview flynn when he knew the white house was in its early chaotic days and he didn t have to first go through the president s counsel flynn had no legal counsel to prepare him for the agents one of whom mr strzok held great hostility toward the new president ms powell s long list of brady demands stefan halper s role in providing the fbi with any information on flynn mr halper is a washington national security adviser and cambridge university professor who was retained by the fbi to spy on trump campaign advisers flynn wants all payments notes memos correspondence and instructions by and between the fbi cia or dod with stefan halper all un redacted text messages between mr strzok and his then girlfriend former fbi counsel lisa page they both expressed deep dislike of candidate trump and his supporters any wiretap applications that deal with flynn it is known the fbi obtained four wiretap warrants on trump

associate deputy attorney general at the time the phone records of former director of national intelligence james clapper and washington post columnist david ignatius mr ignatius broke the story on u s intercepts of flynn s phone calls with mr kislyak conservative pundits say someone in the obama administration committed a felony with that leak any fbi records on leaks to the press on flynn from top obama officials judge sullivan said in a written order sept 11 there is a strong presumption in favor of public access to judicial records during his cooperation phase flynn sat down with the fbi for multiple debriefings in 2017 18 the final mueller report said regarding flynn the report focused on his time in the presidential transition as he conducted phone calls with mr kislyak there is no evidence of any russia election collusion when flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 the media including the new york times wrote stories implying that his mueller cooperation meant big trouble for mr trump in the russia probe flynn provided no such evidence the new york times wrote mr flynn s decision to plead guilty to lying to investigators about those conversations marked a significant new phase in the investigation of the special counsel robert s mueller iii and a politically treacherous development for the president and his closest aides whose activities in the west wing are being scrutinized by f
