aposs truly safe for people to return to work end videotape meredith meanwhile a government program to help small businesses key people on payroll is out of money the president is calling on congress to refund the program immediately democrats say they are willing to do it but they also won additional for hospitals and states negotiations chris they remain ongoing this weekend chris wallace mark meredith reporting from the white house mark thanks and joining us now live from his office in the west wing vice president mike pence mr vice president welcome back to fox news sunday mike pence vice president of the united states morning chris wallace i want to start with those growing protests across the country against the stay at home orders some of the protestors ignoring social distancing what do you think specifically of their protests and how they aposre carrying them out pence well first let me say from the moment president trump asked me to lead the white house coronavirus task force two months ago he made it clear that we had one objective and that was to save lives and in the intervening two months the american people have stepped forward have embraced the social distancing have done the mitigation efforts and as we sit here this morning we continue to see encouraging results declining cases declining hospitalizations because of what the american people have done because of the president aposs leadership and what governors have done around the country we are slowing the spread we aposre hastening the day when we can put the coronavirus in the past and re open the american economy beyond the focus on lives the president also made it clear that we wanted to ensure that our hospital workers incredible men and women had the resources and equipment that they needed we aposve sent hundreds of millions of medical supplies to the critical areas around the country and i must tell you the fact that no american who has needed a ventilator has been denied a ventilator it aposs a great testament to our national response at every level and on the subject of testing we aposre continuing to scale and expand testing and will do that because as the president laid out those guidelines this week no one wants to re open america more than president donald trump and what you see i think among millions of americans who have been embracing those social distancing measures and making the sacrifices is they want their governors to find a way to responsibly and safely re open their state economies and what the president laid out last week is a framework a phased framework to re open america to do that and we aposre going to work very closely with governors to implement that as soon as we can responsibly wallace vice president pence do it around the country ph wallace it but mr vice president in a number of these cases these protestors who are not social distancing are saying they don apost want to wait in many cases they aposre protesting your own guidelines to stop the spread on friday the president tweeted this and i want to put it up liberate minnesota liberate michigan and liberate virginia and save your great 2nd amendment it is under siege washington governor inslee responded the president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and deadly so what does the president mean because you aposve got guidelines that are calling for social distancing and staying at home even your new guidelines to re open the country are very phased and gradual what does the president mean when he says liberate these states pence the american people know that no one in america wants to re open this country more than president donald trump and on thursday the president directed us to lay out guidelines for when and how states could responsibly do that and in the president aposs tweets and public statements i can assure you he aposs going to continue to encourage governors to find ways to safely and responsibly let america go back to work and the guidelines for opening up america again give a roadmap for doing just that chris for states that have 14 days of consecutive declining cases that have proper hospitalization capacity we recommend that they wallace right pence can begin under phase one to ease the social distancing measures that have been put into effect allow some people to begin to come back to work allow some activities in the community to begin to happen and when the president speaks about re opening america it aposs all about encouraging governors as soon as they determine as most proper and most appropriate to be able to do that and do that quickly america works when america wallace mr vice president pence is working and the president wants to see us put the coronavirus in the past by these strong measures the american people have embraced but we want to get america working again just as soon as we can wallace understood mr vice president i want to talk to you about your plan to re open the country because there are a number of health experts that say that we need triple the number of tests that are now being conducted and much more contact tracing in order to safely re open the government can you tell us that how soon that you aposre going to have 500 000 tests a day which is what they aposre calling for we aposre doing about 150 000 now how soon are we going to have 500 000 tests a day or don apost you think that aposs necessary pence well under the guidelines for opening up america again we create in phase one a specific criteria for testing that we believe is appropriate to be able to test people that have symptoms with ph coronavirus and be able to monitor people that are particularly vulnerable to serious outcomes nursing homes and particular populations in our cities that have shown some vulnerability that aposs we believe the testing that we have today chris across the country once we activate all of the labs that can do coronavirus testing is sufficient for any state in america to move into phase one we aposre doing about 150 000 tests a day and you remember a month ago we had done 80 000 tests total now we aposve cleared 4 million overall but at 150 000 tests a day we think we can double that number by working with governors to activate all of the laboratories in their states around the country that can do coronavirus testing that would put us at roughly 300 000 but what we aposre going to make clear to governors again tomorrow in our weekly conference call and i want to make clear to the american people is that president trump aposs direction we aposre going to continue to fully partner with governors around the country and health officials in increasing and scaling the amount of testing and we have every confidence that we can have a sufficient amount of testing to be able to re open america not just in phase one but continue in the weeks and months ahead to expand testing in ways that will give the american people the confidence and the tools to be able to go back to work wallace mr vice president i aposve got limited time with you so i aposm going to try to squeeze a few more questions in the 350 billion program to provide loans to small businesses has run out and you still don apost have a deal on replenishing that with another 250 billion how close are you to a deal with the democrats pence the paycheck protection program that the president signed into law has been an incredible success and literally has made it possible for small businesses around america to keep people on the payroll over a two month period of time while we weather the storm of the coronavirus but as the president and i were literally on a phone call with republicans and democrats last week we learned that the fund had run out and we are urging democrats in the house and the senate to step forward and approve an expansion of the paycheck protection bill we aposre close chris wallace so briefly pence we aposre encouraged wallace how close are you to it sir pence the negotiations are going on we aposre very close but i think every american has seen the success of the president aposs program to provide payroll support and we aposre going to work to expand that so that no one working in a small business in america would have to worry about missing a paycheck during the trial and difficulty of the coronavirus epidemic wallace several sources now say that the coronavirus originated in a lab in wuhan and that the chinese government covered it up for some period of time which allowed the virus to spread now speaker pelosi says while the president imposed his travel ban in january he didn apost he minimized the threat from the virus here she is sir begin clip rep nancy pelosi d ca speaker of the house of representatives instead of calling it a hoax instead of calling it a minimizing and say it ph was magically disappeared we lost time in delaying and the denial caused deaths and that aposs just the way it is end clip wallace mr vice president i aposm getting this question a lot and again i aposve got to ask you for a brief answer what specifically is this administration going to do to hold china accountable pence well i appreciate you referencing the fact that by the end of january of this year president trump took the unprecedented step of suspending all travel from china no american president had ever done that and there aposs no question all of our health experts agree that that bought us an invaluable amount of time to it aposs enabled us to save lives and make sure healthcare workers have the resources that they need to meet this moment but it is clear to us that not only was there a failure by the world health organization to communicate to america and the world what was happening in china but also that china was not as forthcoming as they should have been with america or the world about what was happening wallace so are we going crosstalk pence well the president aposs made it clear he aposs not happy he we aposre going to make proper inquiries into this at the proper time but i have to tell you the one mission that this president has given the white house coronavirus task force is to save lives to put this coronavirus in the past we aposre going to stay focused on that mission it aposs one mission and one team we aposre going to work with governors across the country in both political parties and i just want the american people to be encouraged by the fact that we are making progress we really do see downward trends in cases and in wallace right pence hospitalizations and we really believe that because of what the american people have done because of our incredible healthcare workers that we are together as a nation hastening the day when we will put the coronavirus in the past and get america working again wallace vice president pence thank you thanks for your time during a very busy period please come back sir pence thank you chris wallace as we said the relief program meant to support small businesses run dry and leaders in congress and the white house can apost agree on how to replenish it we aposll ask house speaker nancy pelosi what it will take to break the stalemate and provide more funds that aposs next commercial break wallace talks continue this weekend as congressional democrats and the white house try to strike a deal to provide more money for a program meant help small businesses shut down by the coronavirus earlier i talked with the speaker of the house nancy pelosi about that and more begin videotape wallace speaker pelosi good to talk to you again the 350 billion fund to provide loans to small businesses has run out president trump says you and other democrats are blocking a deal to provide another 250 billion here he is on that begin video clip trump nancy pelosi she aposs away on vacation or something and she should come back she could come back and get this done i don apost know why she aposs not coming back the fact is she aposs not doing her job end video clip wallace the president says he now supports your call for more money for hospitals but you aposre also calling for more money for first responders for food assistance for states and local governments how long are you prepared to hold out speaker rep nancy pelosi d ca speaker of the house of representatives well i think we aposre on a very good path first of all i support the cares act we aposre very pleased to be able to turn it from a corporate trickle down bill to a worker aposs first bubble up and support the ppp the paycheck protection program in there and so as they have committed the money that is there we want to add more money there it is very urgent though that we support our our police and fire our healthcare workers our nurses our teachers and that aposs what the state and local government is about is meeting the needs of the coronavirus and everything that we aposre doing is about the corona virus understand that we aposre not going afield on any other thing and also to make sure that everyone has access to the the program i aposm very pleased at the progress that is being made we aposve worked in a very bipartisan way all along we continue to do so we all pay tribute to our small businesses which are the optimism the entrepreneurial spirit of america and we don apost want there to be any doubt that if they are participating in the program that they will be funded and if they meet those standards of the program that those loans will be forgiven wallace so is there going to be a deal and if so how soon you know there are a lot of small businesses that are running out of money and are hanging on by their fingernails pelosi yes and and we want all of them to get what their entitled to under the under the law and even more than we aposre some of these small businesses have other request in terms of the additional loan program in addition to this grant program and that aposs part of our request as well the money has not all been distributed although it has all been committed and that aposs that means there aposs no more money they will have more money as soon as we come to an agreement which will be soon and i think people will be very pleased because these small businesses must thrive in a community where they aposre again health is essential to them opening up and they have to open up in order to fly it aposs one thing to say to them today it aposs another thing to have customers at the end of the day wallace the president announced a plan this week to reopen the country and you immediately criticized it i want to put up what you said the white house aposs vague and inconsistent document does nothing to make up for the president aposs failure to listen to the scientists and produce and distribute distribute national rapid testing but dr anthony fauci endorsed the plan take a look begin video clip dr anthony fauci director national institute of allergy infectious diseases if these things are done correctly what i believe they can we will have and there will be enough tests to allow us to take this country safely through phase one end video clip wallace don apost you believe dr fauci pelosi yes well he said if this were done properly well it hasn apost been done on march 4th we passed our first bill bipartisan testing testing testing it aposs over six weeks and it hasn apost been done so he aposs saying if it is done properly we aposre already very late on that but he aposs right it has to be testing it has to be tracing contact tracing it has to be treatment and it has to be quarantine it aposs part of something bigger as well to be done properly but we aposre way late on it and that is a failure the president gets an f a failure on the testing but fauci dr fauci aposs right if it is done properly it hasn apost been and i i think when he puts in the if it aposs done is admission that it hasn apost been done wallace you as you are right now have been very critical of president trump especially for what you say is the time that he lost initially in january and february in responding to the virus but i i want to point out that on february 24th you went on a walking tour of chinatown to try to promote tourism there and here is some of what you had to say begin video clip pelosi that aposs what we aposre trying to do today is to say everything is fine here come because precautions have been taken we think it aposs very safe to be in chinatown and hope that others will come end video clip wallace if the president underplayed the threat in the early days speaker pelosi didn apost you as well pelosi no what we aposre trying to do is to end the discrimination the stigma that was going out against the asian american community in fact if you will look the record will show that our chinatown has been a model of containing and and preventing the virus so i aposm confident in our folks there and thought it was necessary to offset some of the things that the president and others were saying about asian americans and making them a target a target of violence across the country hate crimes crosstalk wallace but but forgive me don apost you think don apost you think that you you when you aposre about walking without any mask i understand this is february not april when this happened and saying that there aposs no threat it aposs perfectly safe there weren apost you also adding to this perception that there wasn apost such a threat generally pelosi no i was saying that you should not discriminate against discriminate against chinese americans as some in our administration were doing by the way they were labeling the flu and that no indeed and again i think you if you check the record and it aposs current you will see that our that chinatown has been a model in all of this and so what we aposre saying look to them for answers don apost look to them to place blame wallace as you know protests against the stay at home orders are growing across the country people are taking to the streets pushing back against some of the more stringent restrictions in some states can you understand why they aposre doing that pelosi no not really because what we have to do is is is shelter in place that is really the answer testing tracing treatment shelter in place and i do think that it aposs unfortunate but you know people will do what they do but the fact is we aposre all impatient we all want out but what they aposre doing is really unfortunate because what is great though is the america are the american people the american people know that the good health of themselves and their families and their loved ones is what is important and that aposs why you have seen such an overwhelming commitment to shelter in place distancing people distancing because really it is the key to how we will open up our economy the health issue is the key to opening up the economy unfortunately this what you see there is you know they aposre not ph respectful to whatever people think that they should say but the fact is this has to be science based evidence based data based and evidence and the science and the data says shelter in place testing contact testing tracing treatment quarantine is the answer to opening up our economy sooner and i think by the way if i just may add i do think wallace sure pelsoi is a major distraction from testing testing testing and so does it serve as a distraction yes but that aposs not what this is about we aposre supposed to be focusing on getting over this so that we can open up our economy the sooner the better and i aposm proud of the american people wallace i aposve got a couple crosstalk pelosi because by in large they have embraced that wallace a couple of questions i want to get in just this week you called president trump a weak person a poor leader now i understand that he goes after you so this is fully a two way street pelosi yes wallace but you think those kinds of partisan attacks by in this case you are constructive in the middle of a national crisis pelosi well i aposll tell you why it came to that i was so prayerful on easter it was one of the first days i didn apost have to be working every minute and i could reflect and be prayerful and what i decided was that the president aposs made many mistakes ok let aposs have an after action review of that but if he continued to put forth proposals that were not science based continuing his you know what aposd he say it aposs a hoax it aposs magically going to go away ok put that aside but to to proceed with policies which were not science based which are not evidence based and to blame others blame anybody blame the governors blame me blame the world health organization leaders leaders take responsibility so i said he aposs a weak leader he doesn apost take responsibility he places blames blame on others and that might have been ok before but we cannot continue down a path that is again i aposll come back to science science science evidence data on how we should go forward wallace right finally and i aposve got about a minute left here speaker pelosi when this crisis started you opposed the idea of congress voting remotely something it has never done before pelosi yes wallace but in the last week you have said you could support remote voting under certain circumstances what would you accept in that regard and why the change of mind pelosi well it wasn apost a change of mind it was that i tasked our chairs of jurisdiction chairman jim mcgovern of rules committee chairwoman zoe lofgren of the house administration committee to say what are the options we can give members this was weeks ago what are the options we can give members constitutionally security wise and technologically they came back this week with saying proxy voting is probably something that passes muster on those scores in terms of just for this purpose not for life in general but for this purpose and so that is i aposm taking their recommendation it wasn apost a change my my attitude was always if it aposs possible let aposs see what the options are this is what they have come back and said is possible and we aposll see and it has to be bipartisan we aposll see how our colleagues on the other side of the aisle i think there aposs some openness to it you aposd have to ask them but we would want to do it in a in a congress house wide not just a determination of the democrats that that aposs the way we want to go forward we want to do it in a bipartisan way as we have done all of this chris wallace fox anchor right pelosi three bills in march all partisan bipartisan not partisan at all and as this interim package will be bipartisan and want to keep the faith on both sides and with the public that this is this is how we have to compromise we we want to make improvements but we have to compromise to get the job done and i might say i aposve worked with the republicans to pass the keep government open until december to pass the u s mexico canada trade agreement we we don apost get credit for where we do work together and i want to point that out wallace speaker pelosi pelosi again wallace credit where credit is due criticism where criticism is due thank you so much for coming and talking with us please stay safe and please come back and talk to us pelosi thank you and credit to the american people for their patriotism and their concerns for their families thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss how and when to reopen the country commercial break wallace president trump backs off his suggestion he has the authority to reopen the country even against the wishes of some states begin video clip donald trump president of the united states let individual governors run individual states and come to us if they have difficulty and we will help them end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how restarting the economy will work now commercial break donald trump president of the united states governors will be empowered to tailor an approach that meets the diverse circumstances of their own states every state is very different end video clip wallace president trump announcing new federal guidelines thursday for reopening the economy saying it aposs governors who will take the lead and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove executive director of the serve america pac marie harf and the anchor of special report bret baier karl what do you think of the president aposs plan as announced this week to reopen the economy and what about the concern that we don apost have enough testing and contact tracing to do it karl rove fox news contributor yes well first of all this fame it aposs not really a plan it aposs a framework a road map i thought it was very well crafted it shows the president recognizing the differences between states and even the differences inside states it recognizes the primacy of governors and mayors in executing this making these decisions it relies clearly upon health experts and being drafted contrary to what speaker pelosi said this is clearly got the fingerprints of dr fauci dr birx all over it i aposm glad that aposs the case and it depends ultimately on three things lots of testing which unlike you know nancy pelosi seems to think you can just click your fingers and there aposs going to be plenty of tests it aposs difficult having been in the white house when we were at sars and mers or excuse me in h5n1 the testing that has to be done for this are is difficult to organize difficult to create difficult to to validate but it aposs being done it also requires that we continue our social distancing practices and it aposs going to require a lot of prudent common sense steps by businesses as they begin to bring back employees and customers so i think it aposs a good excellent road map it aposs going to take some time we aposre going to have to be we aposre going to have to be willing to accept that even if a state does meets all of these thresholds for all three phases wallace right rove we aposre talking about six weeks before we can get areas of the country back to anything that looks sort of normal wallace marie a number of democratic officials are saying that the president is moving too fast but to pick up on karl aposs point isn apost that a hard case to make when this plan has been endorsed by dr fauci the kind of unchallenged expert on all this and especially when you see growing restiveness and frustration with the stay at home orders and the economic consequences of that marie harf fox news contributor there are a number of independent medical experts who have been very clear publicly that we do not have enough testing yet and that until we do pushing to reopen to early will just result in more outbreaks in places we thought we had it contained so when you see some of these protests that you talked to your previous guests about in places like michigan in places like ohio they aposre not social distancing they are promoting reopening the economy while ignoring all of these national guidelines and so each of these governors have huge responsibilities right now to to message to their citizens in a way that convinces them that these are in place for their own good to help protect them and their families but the bottom line chris is that there are very few indices in this country that can actually get the number of tests we need that can bring together industry that can use the defense production act to get the tests we need which right now have plateaued and that aposs the federal government so that aposs one place we actually do need a little more action is getting more testing and getting industry around doing that wallace president trump got into fights with governors this week over everything from who has responsibility for more testing to the question of who has responsibility for ending the lockdowns and some of the governors fought back take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states if we came into this room today and said the battle is over we have won it aposs 100 percent gone the democrats would say the president has done a horrible job gov andrew cuomo d ny if he aposs sitting home watching tv maybe he should get up and go to work right end video clip wallace bret the president often ended up in a less controversial place like when he eventually said it aposs up to governors to open up their own states at the pace they choose but he sometimes took a circuitous route to get there bret baier fox news chief political anchor chris you know i covered and wrote about president eisenhower the 34th president and he used to say words matter and less is more the 45th president takes a much different communication style he thinks more is more as evidenced by these press briefings and his supporters will tell you that words matter less if i said last week if president obama had said that he had total authority to tell the states when to open that conservatives heads would have exploded well two days later when the president said the governors will make the call if obama had done that turnabout conservatives apos heads would have exploded too but the bottom line is that it aposs the actions and it aposs dr birx and dr fauci and dr redfield up on that podium with the president signing off on this not flicking the switch but nuanced rollout of guidelines for states so it aposs the actions not the words his supporters will tell you but clearly the communications style frustrates a lot of people and maybe independents wallace karl let me pick up on that because there aposs no question when the president says he has the authority total authority to decide to open up states or when he talks about liberating minnesota it creates a controversy but in the end to bret aposs point does that really matter or is the is the real importance here going to be where we end up both in a public health sense and in an economic sense rove i think that aposs right it aposs going to be what aposs the result of this do we think that at the end of this that the american people think look we came through this thing about as well as could be expected nobody aposs got a sense that everything has to be perfect nobody has the sense that oh you know we we we don apost have enough testing and we can solve that problem tomorrow by invoking the the defense production act there aposs no need to do that because every business every pharmaceutical company every testing company that wants to be involved and can be involved is involved in this but you aposre right at the end of the day it aposs going to be what are the end results of this wallace yes and look it aposs governed by these you know the stafford act the you know public health emergency act the disaster act of 1974 and clearly every one of those acts to some degree looks for a balance in our federalist system between the president and the and the and the federal government and states and local governments and some there are more authorities for states and and and some more for the federal government but we live in a federalist system and they got to they got to deal with that wallace all right panel we have to take a break here but when we come back president trump and joe biden trade shots in the midst of the coronavirus over who aposs been too soft on china commercial break begin video clip unidentified male everyone knew they lied about the virus china president trump gave china his trust donald trump president of the united states president xi i think they aposre doing a very good job unidentified female a global crisis president trump took action but joe biden attacked trump after the china travel ban joe biden d presidential candidate xenophobia and fearmongering end video clip wallace political ads for both joe biden and president trump now focusing on the other aposs record on china in the midst of the global pandemic the website attacking the former vice president called beijing biden and we aposre back now with the panel bret obviously things can change dramatically between now and november but are the the health crisis and the economic crisis such an overwhelming event overwhelming substantive event and political event that this is likely november to be a political referendum on how president trump is handled it baier one hundred percent i think it aposs the election and i aposll quote a a very well known anchor who said just that about a week and a half ago chris wallace i think it comes down to how we get out of it and how the president handles this but you know you put on the intro there the china part and i think that aposs going to be a big part of the election how china is used not only and you can see this by the biden campaign putting out a foreign policy advisor tony blinken pointing to president trump aposs comments about china being positive but there are about 80 percent according to the internal polls cited by the new york times of the public who believe that china really covered up at the beginning u s officials are convinced that aposs the case it aposs not conclusive that it came from this lab accidentally or otherwise yet but they are convinced that china really covered up at the beginning and that aposs going to be a big focus of this the fascinating part chris was the question to nancy pelosi about her walk in chinatown on february 24th february 19th there was a democratic debate in las vegas three words weren apost sad virus coronavirus or covid 19 never came up wallace well to throw a bouquet back at you obviously china becoming a bigger issue after your reporting this week about as some sources told you the biggest political cover up in history by china about its role in the virus karl let me switch subjects to you joe biden there aposs asymmetric warfare here because joe biden is stuck in the basement tv studio in his home in delaware if you were advising him how would you tell him to try to strike a higher profile or would you say that aposs a mistake at this point look everybody aposs focused on the virus just let the stage to the president rove well you aposve got to recognize there are limitations because you aposre right the president dominates this this is a time where no matter what he does he aposs going to biden is not going to have the profile of the president i would say three things first of all don apost pick a don apost pick a fight over china if the question of this election is who aposs tougher on china donald trump is the answer not joe biden second of all i would not follow the practice of nancy pelosi which joe biden is unfortunately following and that is just to pick at the administration and say defense you aposre not using the defense production act da da da da da da da da da that aposs you know look he aposs quickly and she aposs quickly becoming what bill sapphire ph once called nattering nabobs of negativism to me one of the things that would be important is for joe biden to if he wants to contrast with the president to herald the actions of these democratic governors like cuomo and newsom and others who are getting very high marks in their states for managing this well and thirdly the third piece is i would be focused on what it is that would be necessary to convince people in the fall that joe biden ought to replace donald trump and that aposs not the moment of the immediate controversy it aposs sharing a broader and bigger vision as a traditional democrat and he ain apost doing that he is going continuing to go hard march hard to the left and i think if he keeps doing that by the time we get to august and september those small group of swing voters are going to are going to be forced with the issue do i want to keep donald trump in office after i voted democrat for congress in 2018 or do i want to go with a guy who seems to see seems to be like bernie sanders only not so much bernie sanders i mean that aposs not a particularly good choice to for those independents to make if you aposre joe biden wallace all right let i aposve heard from the republican strategist about what joe biden should do let aposs hear now from the democratic strategist about what joe biden should do he aposs he aposs obviously doesn apost have the platform the president has how critical should he be and how much should he try to struggle for a stage and attention he aposs just not going to get it at point harf president trump aposs platform is a little bit of a double edged sword though because he does have the power of the bully pulpit and the white house briefing room every single day but some of the things he aposs said are literally writing their own attack ads when president trump stood up there and said i take no responsibility when he promised we would all be able to get a test if we wanted one donald trump talks a lot as bret mentioned earlier and and those are writing their own ads for the democrats right now joe biden aposs whole theory of the case has been a return to normalcy and competence that was before the crisis that was his theory for why he should be the nominee and why he can beat donald trump that is even more of his theory of the case now that he is running a someone who can bring normalcy back to this country and confidence back and overwhelmingly polling shows that aposs what people want people want in this election and you know he will continue doing cable chris he will continue doing virtual fundraisers but that fundamental question come november is where joe biden thinks he can bring democrats and independents and some disaffected republicans along with him wallace bret to marie aposs point the white house briefing room can be a double edged sword as we aposve seen some cases it shows the president in charge i i think it aposs fair to say that the rollout of the phases and the gating that was you know the very gradual reopening of the country was well received on thursday but some of the things the president has said over the last couple of weeks have gotten him in trouble and in fact you aposve seen a bit of a dip in public approval for the president even with these long national briefings baier well that aposs true and there are all kinds of different you know questions that of all different flavors that come up and sometimes the president is out there longer than his supporters and aides would like him to be but he aposs running this show and it just how we get out of it most importantly how the economy recovers twenty two million americans filing for unemployment small businesses one in four saying they aposre teetering on closing or closing this is massive it aposs a nuclear bomb in the u s economy so there aposs the health side but the economic side is as important of how we crawl out of this wallace and when you talk about people wanting those briefings to be shorter as the anchor of special report which is usually on at 6 00 p m eastern when the briefings are happening i suspect sometimes you aposre looking at your watch baier we aposre we aposre ready either way we aposre ready either way last yesterday or i the other day i had 22 minutes so that was great wallace well that aposs a very good answer but i should say because i know your staff is working hard to do an entire hour show and they don apost always get to put it on the air you should put it somewhere so we can all see it thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week top chef jose andres on another rescue mission this time it aposs not a
