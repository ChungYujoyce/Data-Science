national review respectfully dissenting from judge luttig on flynn mandamus order forcing nursing homes to take covid patients scrubbed from n y state website four minneapolis cops fired over george floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge every profession has its in house lingo which may be confusing to amateurs for example in the world of campaign professionals there s a term for a candidate who spends most of his time complaining about the media loser ask bob dole where s the outrage he demanded and he was right to ask but that moment also announced the effective end of his presidential campaign he wasn t running against bill clinton any more or even against the media which are after all only a medium he was running at that point against the american people who weren t buying what he was selling unless something radical and unexpected happens donald trump is going to lose the 2016 presidential election he ll lose it more than hillary rodham clinton will win it for more or less the reasons that his critics on the right have been explaining for more than a year now in short the sort of thing that makes hearts go pitter patter out in derka derka talk radio land doesn t necessarily fly in the rest of the country and may in fact even come off as creepy and weird which is why three times as many people watch the middle a show i d never heard of as watch sean hannity s nightly trump fest on fox news there s more to america than your uncle bob s right wing facebook circle and trump isn t very well prepared for that our friend hugh hewitt found this out the hard way the talk radio host was tryingto help the republican nominee explain away his absurd and surreal claim that barack obama is the founder of the islamic state i know what you meant hewitt said you meant that he created the vacuum he lost the peace but trump refused to take hewitt s good counsel no i meant he s the founder of isis trump insisted i do hewitt pointed out that president obama does from time to time invest a fair amount of time and energy in killing islamic state operatives trump i don t care related does sean hannitywant hillary to win many americans only metaphysical experience in this life will have been seeing with the mind s eye hugh hewitt wincing through the radio trump had been halfway following the advice of benjamin disraeli even though he s almost certainly never heard of him never complain never explain he can t help but complain but now he s in explaining himself mode too when his remarks on president obama and the islamic state were greeted as yet another piece of evidence that donald j trump may in fact be bats t crazy he started backing away from his claim waving his hands and calling it sarcastic share trump s descent into full bore toddler mode is not unexpected he already is making excuses for losing in november and boasting that it doesn t matter that much to him because as he put it i go back to a very good way of life and the people who supported him go back to seeing their liberties curtailed and their constitutional order perverted by an old fashioned democratic machine politician who could have been beaten by a dozen actual conservatives from whom republicans had the opportunity to choose he blames the media for making him look nuts by reporting the things he says which are nuts the race in ohio will probably be decided to a large part in hamilton county where trump hadn t bothered to set up an actual campaign operation as of last week as of early august the trump campaign had one staffer in southwest ohio in florida where trump is down at 39 percent his campaign had one field office as of last week he s getting killed in virginia north carolina and colorado where clinton leads him by 14 points and where trump s field operation is in terms of personnel and offices only a fraction of what the clinton campaign has put on the ground you can complain that the media is unfair to republicans it is but it isn t the media that s stopping trump from organizing the basics of a presidential campaign trump is set to lose georgia trump probably will end up winning texas and utah but it is not inconceivable that he could lose them and all that brave talk about the new yorker making the race competitive in northern democratic strongholds clinton is up 21 points in the latest new jersey poll 17 points in the latest new york poll 10 points in the latest from michigan and 25 points in the latest from illinois the only democratic states trump currently is winning are the ones that were really democratic until about 1994 or so and he s not even doing that great there either up by only 3 points in mississippi related trump vs trump trump cannot imagine cannot even entertain the notion that this is trump s fault he blames the media for making him look nuts by reporting the things he says which are nuts talking with hannity he moaned i ll say something at a rally and i look out and see all these tv cameras taking every word down no one in politics has ever been subjected to this kind of treatment okey dokey related most recently he has been looking for an excuse to skip the debates against hillary rodham clinton clearly terrified that she is going to hand him his ass does anybody think ted cruz would have been looking for an excuse to dodge a debate with clinton he d have been asking for 40 of them it s too early to begin the bloody and tearful recriminations but there will be a time not to blame trump for being trump which is exactly what anybody with a lick of sense would expect him to be but those who enabled him who plumped him and the largely fictitious establishment vs the base soap opera for their own personal audience building and money making agendas we are going to need to have a word about them come november kevin d williamson is national review s roving correspondent correction the quote from trump
