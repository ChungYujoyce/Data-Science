tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn miami ap president donald trump was in full sales mode monday doing everything but pass out brochures as he touted the features that would make the doral golf resort the ideal place for the next g 7 summit close to the airport plenty of hotel rooms separate buildings for every delegation even top facilities for the media there s just one detail he left out he owns the place government ethics watchdogs have long railed against the perils of trump earning money off the presidency and hosting foreign leaders at his properties but they say trump s proposal to bring world leaders to his miami area resort takes the conflict of interest to a whole new level because unlike stays at his washington they would have no choice but to spend money at his property top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens it s ethics violation squared said kathleen clark of washington university school of law in st louis added larry noble a former general counsel at the federal election commission this is him making it perfectly mandatory that they stay at his resort trump s proposal at the current g 7 summit in biarritz france portrayed the doral resort in the most glowing terms even though he said later he was more interested in logistics for the meeting than making money we have a series of magnificent buildings very luxurious rooms trump told reporters we have incredible conference rooms incredible restaurants it s like it s like such a natural trump s pitch comes as several lawsuits accusing the president of violating the u s constitution s emoluments clause which bans gifts from foreign governments wind their way through the courts it also comes as doral by far the biggest revenue generator among the trump organization s 17 golf properties appears to have taken a hit from trump s move into politics the trouble began during soon after trump announced he was running for the presidency in 2015 with a speech that called mexican immigrants crossing the border illegally rapists and murders businesses started cutting ties to the president the pga and nascar moved events that used to be booked at doral elsewhere eric trump who is overseeing the business with his older brother don jr told the associated press last year that the doral is on fire but a financial disclosure report filed with the federal government this year showed revenue at the club has barely been growing up just 1 million to 76 million trump s financial disclosure also shows he owes a lot of money to deutsche bank for the property which helped him buy it in 2012 as of the end of last year trump had two mortgages on the resort one for more than 50 million the other for as much as 25 million a trump organization consultant told the miami dade value adjustment board last year that the property was severely underperforming according to the washington post the local government cut the resort s assessed value for 2018 from 110 3 million to 105 6 million according to county records another sign of trouble is the long list of former doral members who quit the club years ago but are still waiting for their initial deposits back new members have to join first for old ones to get refunds but that isn t happening according to doral member peter brooke he says some former members have been waiting for 10 years or longer brooke said a g 7 summit would bring in considerable income for the club citing the need to accommodate secret service guards and other staff that must accompany each foreign government delegation they would have to house all of them at the various lodges not to mention food and more staff he said in an effort to assuage critics trump agreed before he took office to donate profits from foreign government spending at its properties but the company is private so it s not certain the 340 000 donated so far is all of the profits or even precisely how profits is defined the company has also said it doesn t actively seek foreign government business and even tries to turn it away earlier this year eric trump said the company goes to great lengths to discourage such spending it s not clear how hosting the g 7 would square with this policy the trump organization did not respond to several requests for comment at monday s news conference trump spoke as if the idea of making money off the summit never entered his mind in fact he said other people were pushing doral as a venue not just him he said the secret service and the military have been visiting various sites and appear to have formed a bit of consensus already they went to places all over the country and they came back and they said this is where we d like to be trump said it s not about me it s about getting the right location he then added i m not going to make any money i don t want to make money i don t care about making money associated press writer steve
