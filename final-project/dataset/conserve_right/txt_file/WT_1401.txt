socialist green new deal was a no show why they chose white is a mystery unless they were 1 trying to convey virginal innocence to contrast with mr trump s famous coarseness or 2 they were mimicking the real heroines of cuba s ladies in white who resist the island s communist regime no they d be for castro or 3 they re all racists in any case rumors are floating about a second impeachment attempt based on new evidence uncovered by the democrats ongoing mugging of the trump administration you can say this about them they re like a rottweiler with a bone even when they ve got nothing who else could have dragged out the russian collusion fiasco for nearly three years the real scandal is the politicized fbi s lying by omission to the fisa court so they could spy on the trump campaign in 2016 shouldn t that be actionable likewise the dems still deny that the russian collusion investigation was centered on the discredited steele dossier full of racy stories about mr trump nevermind the

affidavit saying he was dismissed for probing the gas company burisma holdings on whose board hunter biden racked up more than 80 000 a month for apparently being the son of joe who was mr obama s

explanation for the bureau s role in justice brett kavanaugh s confirmation to the supreme court for those living in a cave that was the circus like hearing in october 2018 featuring feminists wearing red riding hood cloaks inspired by the anti christian hulu miniseries the handmaid s tale a left wing professor and other women accused justice kavanaugh of sexual assaults and sen cory booker proclaimed himself spartacus justice kavanaugh was confirmed by a 50 48 senate vote mr nadler reassured everyone that the kavanaugh probe would not be resumed to be clear i have no intention of re litigating the confirmation process here that should be a relief to the women who later admitting lying about justice kavanaugh when are they going to be hauled in and charged with defamation and
