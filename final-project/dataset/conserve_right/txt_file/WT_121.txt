apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap senators like to float above messy politics in what s known by some as the dignified upper chamber home of congress cooler heads and lofty rhetoric but as a court of president donald trump s impeachment the senate beginning tuesday might seem more like the economy cabin of an oversold flight on an especially tense mandatory work trip rock star legal teams will cram the airy well of the chamber just a few feet from each other and chief justice john roberts four television screens take up rarified space staff will snap up seats near the wall a podium stands at the center aisle top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens as for phones it s worse than airplane mode they are banned from the chamber that maroons 100 chatty senators including four democrats in the heat of a nomination fight for the serious constitutional business of the impeachment trial for hours at a time i m going to be stuck in washington for god knows how long sen bernie sanders told supporters in des moines monday night what and whom to watch when the trial gets underway around 1 p m est tuesday ground rules but first naturally some talk the senate opens with debate on the structure and rules of the proceedings senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is proposing a condensed two day calendar for opening arguments on the articles passed by the house on dec 18 they charge trump with abusing power by pressuring ukraine to help him politically and obstructing congress when it tried to find out what happened mcconnell s ground rules are outlined in a four page resolution that must be voted on as one of the first orders of business it pushes off any votes on witnesses until later in the process rather than up front as democrats had demanded but mcconnell s plan on witnesses lines up with the organizing resolution that set the structure of president bill clinton s trial in 1999 whatever the rules this journey is expected to end at a known destination trump s acquittal drawing the curtain at all times according to senate rules a majority of senators present can vote to close the proceedings and debate in private that would mean the cameras shut off and everyone who s not a member of the senate kicked out of the chamber until the senators choose to reopen it senators did that at various points during the clinton trial mcconnell then argued that members of the chamber listen to each other better in private marathon haul mcconnell defending his gop majority and up for reelection himself wants to make this trial go quickly he s proposed a compressed schedule with long days after the four days of opening arguments maximum 24 hours per side senators will be allowed up to 16 hours for questions to the prosecution and defense followed by four hours of debate only then will there be votes on calling other witnesses democrats said that structure is an attempt to rush the trial and cover up the president s actions senate rules say the trial must proceed six days a week all but sunday until it is resolved there s some question about whether it s finished by feb 4 the day of trump s state of the union speech white house officials say that appointment remains as of now trump can ask the house to postpone it but here again there s precedent for trump to consider clinton delivered his state of the union speech in the midst of his senate trial he wasn t running for reelection however as trump is off the trail off the grid watch a coterie of democratic senators who literally would rather be somewhere else specifically iowa and new hampshire ahead of their party s kickoff votes for the right to try to unseat trump in the november election watch sens elizabeth warren of massachusetts bernie sanders of vermont michael bennet of colorado and amy klobuchar of minnesota for signs of fatigue from flying between washington and these places and coping with being off the internet for hours at a time

personal lawyer jay sekulow are expected to lead the argument that trump committed no crimes that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense and that the president is a victim of a political witch
