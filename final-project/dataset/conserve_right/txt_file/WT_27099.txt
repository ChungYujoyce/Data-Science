a trade deal and potentially conclude a yearlong tariff war with beijing there s either going to be a good deal or it s not going to be a deal mr trump said wednesday of the negotiations but i think they re moving along very nicely the worsening u s trade position was partly out of mr trump s control caused by a strong dollar and a global economic slowdown that weakened demand for american
