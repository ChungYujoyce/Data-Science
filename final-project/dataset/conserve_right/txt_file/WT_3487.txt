director of having role in deep state his warning came after both democrats and republicans questioned trump s decision to give turkey a green light for a military incursion against kurdish fighters who were u s allies in syria however the u s sanctions announced monday did not match the rhetoric analysts and financial investors saw them as minimal the measures were limited to the turkish defense and energy ministries and three turkish officials the ministers of defense energy and interior security they block transactions involving any assets they may have in the u s financial system and bar u s residents and businesses from dealing with them the u s also raised tariffs on turkish steel exports from 25 back to 50 where they were in may and suspended talks over a u s turkey trade deal given the dominant role that u s financial institutions and the dollar play in world commerce such measures fall far short of what the u s could do by targeting turkey s banks and their links to the global financial system turkey s currency and stock market both rose tuesday as investors breathed a sigh of relief that harsher measures were not imposed timothy ash emerging market strategist at bluebay asset management called the sanctions minimal and window dressing noting that the trade deal was years off in any case the muted initial response from investors flies in the face of president trump s threat said jason tuvey senior emerging markets economist at capital economics in london one risk from the current sanctions tuvey said is that they may be a prelude to tougher ones given support in congress for action against turkey and even though the direct impact on the economy may remain slight the bigger risk could be on investor and financial market confidence in the country the imposition of sanctions has re started talk of turkey possibly putting limits on the flow of money to prevent it from being taken out of the country that could support the country s currency but deter foreign
