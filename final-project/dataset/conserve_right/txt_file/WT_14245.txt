apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump and russian president vladimir putin will cross paths friday on the sidelines of a summit in vietnam but u s officials still aren t sure they have enough to discuss to justify a formal meeting secretary of state rex w tillerson speaking to reporters in beijing on thursday as mr trump wrapped up two days of talks with chinese president xi jinping said a meeting with mr putin requires substantive topics to discuss we have been in contact with them and the view has been if the two leaders are going to meet is there something sufficiently substantive to talk about that would warrant a formal meeting mr tillerson said there s been no conclusion made on that top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning both leaders are attending the asia pacific economic cooperation summit and mr tillerson said it wouldn t be at all unusual if they ended up with some kind of a pull aside mr trump has said he wants mr putin s help in pressuring north korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missile programs a crisis for which china had no clear answers this week mr tillerson said other possible topics for mr putin include finding a solution to the war in syria eradicating the islamic state terrorists in the middle east and addressing russia s military incursion in ukraine asked about moscow s meddling in the 2016 presidential election mr tillerson said it stays on that list a kremlin spokesman said mr putin likely will meet with mr trump but there is no agreed agenda the two leaders met face to face meeting for the first time in july at a summit in germany where mr putin disavowed russian interference in the election before leaving china mr trump toned down his criticism of beijing saying china isn t to blame for the mammoth trade imbalance with the u s he expressed the hope that mr xi will work hard to reduce tensions with north korea mr trump said the very one sided and unfair trade relationship between the u s and china is actually the fault of his predecessors in washington he called mr xi a very special man i don t blame china mr trump said after all who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens i give china great credit he told chinese and u s business leaders at an event i do blame past u s administrations for allowing this out of control trade deficit to take place and to grow we have to fix this because it just doesn t work for our great american companies and it doesn t work for our great american workers it is just not sustainable mr trump later clarified on twitter i don t blame china i blame the incompetence of past admins for allowing china to take advantage of the u s on trade leading up to a point where the u s is losing 100 s of billions how can you blame china for taking advantage of people that had no clue i would ve done same mr trump said china must immediately address the unfair trade practices that drive the trade imbalance while u s and chinese companies signed nonbinding deals worth hundreds of billions of dollars thursday mr tillerson said there s much more work ahead to trim the u s trade deficit with china that totals 223 billion for the first 10 months of this year i think the best way to characterize it is that while we appreciate the long hours and the effort that our chinese counterparts have put into those trade discussions quite frankly in the grand scheme of a 300 to 500 billion trade deficit the things that have been achieved are pretty small mr tillerson told reporters adding that in terms of really getting at some of the fundamental elements of why this imbalance exists there is still a lot more work to do during the presidential campaign in 2016 mr trump said the u s can no longer allow china to rape our country and complained that grossly incompetent u s officials were allowing china s currency manipulation and intellectual property theft senate minority leader charles e schumer of new york was among the democrats accusing mr trump of backing away from his get tough campaign rhetoric about china the president may not blame china but i do and so do millions of americans who voted for him and others who have lost their jobs at the hands of china s rapacious trade policies mr schumer said in a statement after campaigning like a lion against china s trade practices the president is governing like a lamb rather than treating china with kid gloves the president should be much tougher with china as he promised he would be on the campaign trail rep tim ryan ohio democrat said mr trump is backing away from promises to confront china over unfair trade practices such as currency manipulation and steel dumping while president trump acts tough on china in front of friendly crowds at campaign rallies this week we saw how he acts when he is face to face with chinese leaders mr ryan said mr tillerson said he thinks the president was making a light hearted remark to his chinese audience about a trade deficit that he has previously called embarrassing there was a little bit of tongue in cheek in that characterization mr tillerson said but there was also a lot of truth to it on thursday in beijing mr trump said of the trade relationship we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us mr xi smiled widely when mr trump said he does not blame china for the deficit of course there are some frictions but on the basis of win win cooperation and fair competition we hope we can solve all these issues in a frank and consultative way mr xi said we will never narrow or close our doors we will further widen them on north korea s nuclear weapons and missile programs mr trump said both leaders agree on the urgency of the problem china can fix this problem easily and quickly and i am calling on china and your great president to hopefully work on it very hard mr trump said with mr xi at his side if he works on it hard it will happen mr xi reiterated that china would strive for the denuclearization of the korean peninsula but offered no hint that china would change tack on north korea we are devoted to reaching a resolution to the korean peninsula issue through dialogue and consultations mr xi said mr tillerson told reporters that mr trump had urged mr xi privately you re a strong man i m sure you can solve this for me
