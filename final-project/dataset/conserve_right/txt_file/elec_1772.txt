the health care law that would become obamacare tea party protests were about to spring up around the country in opposition to the law and president barack obama was on the verge of delivering a major address defending the law from its critics and hoping to rally support from his own party in that speech obama positioned his approach as a middle ground between two extremes there are those on the left he said who believe that the only way to fix the system is through a single payer system like canada s where we would severely restrict the private insurance market and have the government provide coverage for everyone on the right there are those who argue that we should end the employer based system and leave individuals to buy health insurance on their own the following year obamacare became the law of the land and the signature initiative of obama s two term presidency but in last night s democratic primary debate which featured a full half hour segment focused on health care which was introduced as the number one issue for democratic voters it was virtually absent instead the evening s leading contenders extensively defended medicare for all a single payer plan that captured elements of both the extremes obama said he wanted to avoid medicare for all as proposed by sen bernie sanders i vt and vigorously supported by sen elizabeth warren d mass would end the nation s employer based health care system and in the space of four years replace it with a fully government run system that is closest to canada s but even more restrictive leaving virtually no room for private insurance it would according to both independent estimates and sanders himself raise government spending on health care by something like 30 or 40 trillion over the next decade and it would require tax hikes or tax like fees or premiums on the middle class in terms of both cost and transition complexity it would dwarf obamacare sanders and warren spent much of the debate s opening segment defending these ideas from tough questioning by the moderators and criticism from more moderate candidates who argued that the plan was too radical too unpopular and too unworkable the polls at least suggest that there is some truth to this medicare for all is popular in the abstract but quickly becomes unpopular when respondents are told that it would eliminate private health insurance or raise taxes arguably the strongest criticisms came from john delaney a maryland democrat who in the early 1990s founded a health care financing company delaney warned that the radicalism espoused by warren and sanders would turn off more moderate voters in an election we don t have to go around and be the party of subtraction and telling half the country who has private health insurance that their health insurance is illegal he said my dad the union electrician loved the health care he got from the ibew he would never want someone to take that away half of medicare beneficiaries now have medicare advantage which is private insurance or supplemental plans it s also bad policy it ll underfund the industry many hospitals will close this was a point that delaney had made before the sanders plan as expensive as it already is calls for paying medicare rates for all services which would mean a substantial reduction in rates for doctors and hospitals he repeated it later in the evening i ve been going around rural america he said and i ask rural hospital administrators one question if all your bills were paid at the medicare rate last year what would happen and they all look at me and say we would close warren and sanders had essentially no response to this warren accused moderates on the stage of spinelessness and both she and sanders argued that questions and criticisms about single payer health care amounted to republican talking points they took shots at drug makers which represent about 10 percent of total u s health care spending and insurance companies which on average have profit margins of less than 3 percent for profiting off of health care but never addressed questions about payment rates for providers nor would warren respond directly to a question about whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to fund the plan sanders has admitted that it would require higher taxes and warren has said she s with him on his ideas but when asked by moderator jake tapper whether she s with bernie on medicare for all when it comes to raising taxes on middle class americans to pay for it she prevaricated so giant corporations and billionaires are going to pay more she said middle class families are going to pay less out of pocket for their health care and then she went on to attack insurance companies repeating the same basic formulation about total costs going down when tapper pressed her again on taxes warren clearly didn t want to answer the question following the debate cnn s anderson cooper pressed her on the question of upheaval what would she say to people to liked their current health plans how did she respond to the idea that obamacare was already a tough sell politically and medicare for all would therefore be even more difficult once again warren deflected accusing critics of timidity and spinelessness looked at one way medicare for all had a rough night facing difficult questions and a phalanx of criticism from the stage s more moderate contenders but the critics who fought with warren and sanders last night have essentially zero support in the party delaney for example currently polls at 0 7 percent and while better polling contenders like kamala harris and pete buttigieg have plans that call for something less than full fledged single payer they are speaking something like the language of warren and sanders the only democratic candidate who has strongly attacked medicare for all who has performed well so far is former vice president joe biden who will appear in the debate s second round tonight but even biden s plan has been framed largely as a response to medicare for all a way of pushing back against its excesses somehow in the space of 10 years democrats have drifted away from obama s performative centrism his at least rhetorical sense that what americans want is a middle way an anti radical solution rather than the big structural change that warren insists is needed medicare for all and all the troublesome questions it raises is defining the 2020 democratic race and the democratic party with it advertisement next elizabeth warren hates your cheap foreign made electric guitar

that the gop controlled the house as of 2011 and the democrats spent all their political capital on obamacare from jan 2009 jan 2011 you said something true now if only you could refrain from doing unpaid pr work for some of the most parasitic industries on the planet you ll be halfway to having good ideas esmeralda i say true things all time you just don t like the truth since tony can t answer any difficult questions about his preferred policies everyone else evil pr people tony is one very stable individual but you are you doing pr work for the most parasitic institutions on the planet cannot stand the competition crazy lefty legislation yeah you re right tony he nailed it glad you agree haha bingo obama would say one thing and hidden cameras at union events would be where he d admit what he was actually for obama s main boy ben rhodes bragged about lying to the population so did the obama architect even voxs iglesias bragged about lying and changing the narrative on the trump tax cuts how fucking stupid are democrat voters oh nm tony is here to show us is progress for democrats at least that they admit obamacare is a failure and they want to replace it medicare for all is defining the 2020 democratic race good thing there wont likely be a democrat to win the presidency ever again all the lefty policies democrats want to implement indicate that even democrat leadership knows they are done for nationally let s assume for the sake of argument that medicare for all is a terrible and radical idea fine so one aspect of the democratic platform is unacceptable to us koch reason libertarians you know what s even more unacceptable the literal concentration camps drumpf has built at this point it s counterproductive to focus on the minor disputes within the progressive libertarian alliance the fact is we have two major parties in this country one is pro concentration camp the other is anti concentration camp i know which side i m on votedemocratforopenborders immigrationaboveall abolishconcentrationcamps those aren t concentration camps https www nationalreview com corner alexandria ocasio cortez concentration camp comment immigration facilities good grief they can leave whenever they want to by agreeing to return to where they came from atlas shrugged was supposed to be a warning not a newspaper hello you must be new here welcome that s a parody account and not a good one a waste of time to engage oh i don t know if his shtick is to mock looney left positions with the textual equivalent of a straight face i d say he s ok on the other hand if he really believes the crap that he posts haha nahhhhh a waste of time to engage yes that s true a decade after obamacare the democratic party has embraced health care radicalism well that s two decades after they first tried radicalism see clintoncare the following year obamacare became the law of the land and the signature initiative of obama s two term presidency and that s all you need to know about obo s presidency that and all the killings and new wars done by a noble peace prize winner that might be something you need to know but what i want to know is how many people you can kill before they revoke your peace prize apparently the number is pretty high in february 2018 i had a brief discussion with mr david bossie confidante of president trump and head of citizens united i warned him that medical delivery aka healthcare would prove itself a decisive issue in the forthcoming election that november it did the republicans offered americans nothing in that regard i recommended a plan based upon the science of human behavior and nominated unsolicited for two national awards by the american insurance industry a plan now contained in the semi fictional novel retribution fever what did mr bossie do with my advice i ve no idea but i can guess good and it would require tax hikes or tax like fees or premiums on the middle class raise people s taxes to pay for insurance they can t afford brilliant facepalm didn t you know the first law of thermodynamics doesn t apply to government programs nor the second that was the penalty in obamacare if you can t afford it they will fine tax you for not buying it maybe we can end homelessness and hunger the same way just fine or tax you if you don t buy food and a home i for one am not at all surprised that health care in this country is nothing more than clowns to the left and jokers to the right i got the feeling that something ain t right i m so scared in case i fall off my chair very very good article sir thank you so much for sharing with us does medicare for all mean we have to pay into the system for 40 years before we get coverage i m waiting for the true libertarian solution not the solution to the problem but the solution to the utter stupidity and paralysis that has pervaded this issue on all sides for gong on 30 years now that being eliminate all the subsidies tax exemption for pay in the form of benefits and mandates on larger employers that require coverage then at least we ll see if the free market has a solution or if that s a dead end and at least everyone will be awake and likely pissed off to the issue i m sure godot will arrive first jfree july 31 2019 at 12 47 pm i m waiting for the true libertarian solution no it s been offered many times get the government out of the medical market what you really mean is that you are waiting for a solution you like the first thing is mandatory coverage and allow ala carte insurance why do i have to pay for chiropractic care or holistic healing or crystal therapy or etc i should be able to tailor my service for the coverage me and my family need also allow me to purchase catastrophic care and invest unlimited funds into my health care savings account with no requirement on when i use it allow across state insurance sales end laws requiring employers to pay for insurance end the ama and nurse associations monopoly that leads to them controlling how regulations are written if we are going to spend money on improving health care access not stating we need to or should but the first thing is to increase the number of medical students and nursing students and other specialties allow nurse practitioners and pa to cover more stuff allow pharmacist who are medical doctors more prescribing power end regulatory capture at the fda make it easier for doctors and nurses who immigrate to the us to acquire their license in the us make it easier for churches and other private charities to operate clinics hospitals etc if you are going to use taxpayer funds to provide insurance again i would rather not give the recepients a prepaid debit card and allow them to purchase the plan they want and the rest deposit into a hsa those are just off the top of my head i agree with some of that but it wouldn t do much once we based our healthcare system on current employment then we created a situation where most people are oblivious to and want to ignore it all and the rest of the population is split into weird groups where the market will fail rationing by price doesn t work for the poor the really sick can t work and the old are often both sick and can t work and the nature of employment has changed too permanently so yeah of course the entire thing has become a cronyist cluster and we can t even have a rational discussion either my solution just gets us to the rational discussion part insurance itself is was the final nail in the coffin for church charity based hospitals but they had failed badly as early as the spanish flu epidemic 1918 when send them home we don t want them here exacerbated the epidemic and led to waves of muni owned hospital construction muni owned were actually the hospitals that were providing most care for most people on the eve of ww2 when the first federal tax subsidies for employer insurance started but obviously that leads one towards thinking the solution is more of a local tax issue which is entirely incompatible with multi state employers who have good national bargaining power over nothing specific but none locally or a national medicare for all likewise most of the stuff re the training reg of doctors occurred cuz carnegie rockefeller decided our doctor system sucked for them so they had a guy named flexner write a report recommending changes in 1910 and within a couple decades the power of big donor dollars on medical schools and state level govt changed the sorts of doctors being produced within a couple more decades the nature of the existing doctor population had changed irreversibly but that s not an outcome of fedl govt but of a few billionaires who decided what is good for everyone else in fact one could argue that medicare itself was the cronyist creation of medical specialists not the elderly providence health services is one of the largest health care organizations in the us guess who runs them both the catholic church the lutheran church runs hospitals throughout the upper midwest deaconess health group is protestant ran there are numerous jewish ran hospitals so what was that about religious charity hospitals failing they are literally all over the place i never mentioned the federal government in connection with medical schools it is mostly at the state level but trust me it exists the same with nursing schools you asked for solutions i gave them you dismissed them and were wrong in most of your dismissals so basically you just wanted to move the goal posts so you can claim libertarians and conservatives have no health care plan right jfree peace health opened a new hospital in my small community in the san juan s it replaced a medical center that was just a doctors office huge upgrade my liberal friends complained that you can t get an abortion at peace health facilities you couldn t get one at the old medical center either no shit it is that stupid there s just no pleasing the everything is so terrible and unfair crowd haha most private non profit hospitals which is roughly 50 of hospitals in the us the rest split evenly between for profit and govt owned were started by churches many still have saints or the religious origin in the name the two nearest hospitals to me are religious origin hell at one point close to 1 3 of colorado s population had tb before they realized it is a contagious disease and every denomination in the us built their respiratory specialty hospital here and sent patients here for the clean air cure but they are all very standard non profit hospitals now my statement was not that the hospitals themselves disappeared it was that insurance used to be something that hospitals offered and bought themselves to insure their own big expense reinsurance risks blue cross is the surviving much morphed entity of what used to be a bunch of local hospital networks offering pre paid medical care those hospitals themselves took on medical risk that is the business model that broke when employer insurance and then medicare took over it s actually a good model for most people who only need local medical care but it broke and just fyi municipal or county owned still provide most of the care in rural america jfree july 31 2019 at 6 17 pm once we based our healthcare system on current employment courtesy harry truman courtesy of fdr giving the unions a handjob by pushing limits to keep ford from paying more than unionized gm didn t know that was the beginning but after the war s end truman kept wages fixed so the companies competed for help the only way they could offer non taxed benes truman of course thought they were acting not in the national interest as if the national interest is something you can show your stock holders on the quarterly reports i don t know of any potus who could claim real knowledge of econ but in his favor this one at least knows what a bottom line is that is the solution i want the politicians will never give up the power once it has been taken bernie and lizzie were attacked by the centrists in the debate and both are unfortunately too stupid to see that most democrats don t even want medicare for all only 4 5 of the candidates support mfa so it wouldn t even win among the candidates so much for dumbasses like john and lovestrumpstinymushroomdick1789 and their idiotic claims that all democrats have moved far left ol joe can win this thing without showing up for another event ol joe can win this thing without showing up for another event well he s never been my first choice but i ll gladly vote for him if he gets the nomination he was after all the vp during the strongest 8 year run in us economic history that s gotta count for something libertariansforbiden ol joe can win this thing without showing up for another event not showing up for another event is probably his best chance of winning best not be even tangentially associated with the rest of the candidates hmm checking my copy of the constitution again looking looking to provide for the health care of all nope still can t find it in there nor anything like it but that was written by a bunch of old white guys like 80 years ago who owned slaves and doesn t mean anything today just look behind the penumbras common mistake it is in the same paragraph as the authorization for secret fisa courts and the common usage exception to shall not be infringed and penalty taxes look on the bright side if healthcare is a basic human right that should be free to all how much more so self defense and food somewhere along the line people started equating right with free having a right means the government cannot interfere with your exercise of it does not give you a means of no cost acquisition i have a right to bear arms when is the goverernment going to purchase me a new bushmaster xm15 varminter or a sig sauer p320 m17 and why did i not get to keep my m16a2 when i was discharged damnit a man of culture i see i too carried the ol a2 longbow while deployed gotta say when i came back stateside and had to qualify with an m4 it just wasn t the same the a2 was a rifleman s rifle the m4 eh besides the buffer spring was to short and week resulting in more jams but dipshit flyboy rumsfeld decided we didn t need a new rifle system let s just issue everyone a carbine why the us military still hasn t adopted a bullpup design is beyond me the accuracy and power of a full size rifle with the ease of mobility of a carbine besides i was pretty damn good at knocking down the 300 m target with the a2 not even sure i could hit the 300 with a m4 do they still qualify out to 300 with the m4 nonsense i have a right to have government force other people to pay for my basic needs and a few wants too damn it doesn t sound so good when you put it like that never mind haha bernie i m not a socialist i don t want to nationalize industries and put them under state control except for the healthcare industry but that s it so from the perspective of economic theory he is a fascist private corporate ownership but full government control of what is produced where it is produced where it is sold and who can buy it and at what price full disclosure just finished reading a mussolini biography yup we have long lived in a private government partnership economy this isn t a new concept and the term fascism today no longer is narrowly defined as a third method of economic organization between laissez faire using this definition the entire western world is fascist rtrded hyperbole aside you re fine and will be fine once your health care is cheaper cheaper ya think haha mussolini and the wilsonites under fdr had a mutual admiration society before the austrian paper hanger brought a bad odor to talking about it out loud the only thing that stopped obama from signing crazy lefty legislation was that the gop controlled the house as of 2011 medicare for all more like bankruptcy for all tell that to canada they re making it work somehow for less than we pay if you people ever left your trash echo chamber the world would be a

as a reminder medicare only pays 80 of covered medical expenses and has no limit on out of pocket expenses but medicare for all probably gave the focus groups orgasms part b does not cover preventive care either of course if you get rid of private insurance you get rid of what has been quietly if unwillingly propping up the actual medicare system honestly best case scenario we maintain status quo or get one of the centrist dems elected with r s holding the senate the fact that the left and their media apparatus seem intent that garbage kamala harris is a force to be reckoned with after the first debate is terrifying she got black girl sassy arguing against a 40 year old policy that has little to no relevance today and made the equivalent of a middle school debate argument or what passes on social media as legit that is what passes for a win in terms of reasoning in the minds of the democratic machine and their voters she got a 10 percent bump for bringing up fucking busing not to mention most of those fuckers were on board for providing insurance for illegals and abolishing private insurance at least in the first debate until they thought for more than half a second that it will get them murdered in the rust belt i cant stand trump but they are strongly making me consider holding my nose and pulling his tacky golden plated lever omg insurance for illegals that would be so terrible medicare for all like they have in many western countries with lower costs and similar health outcomes why that s nothing but a socialist take over seriously most of your trash types arguments against left wingers hinge on them having some sort of secret motiveless malice as if it s not possible for people to simply disagree they must have some iago like motivation oh and that wonderful uk system which anyone who can afford it dodges it s non healthcare system for those who would rather be cheap than healthy nhs brings in three month minimum waiting times despite warnings

is easy peasy will the democrats have to clean up rats and other vermin from the cities they control before or after implementing medicare for all just wondering hello stereotypically racist uneducated person just a friendly reminder to stay in your lane milwaukee s best special reserve ice is on sale down the street make haste they only make a few hundred thousand of those a year leave the adulting to educated people we ll let you know what we decide ok sweety take a koozie before you go hello fucking lefty ignoramus just a reminder of how stupid you are look a bit upthread for your vaunted free medical care works are you stating that baltimore isn t rat infested and only racist rednecks would think it is gee didn t know pbs documentaries were made by racist rednecks leave the adulting to educated people you should let the ink dry on that diploma before you go waving it around like that obama was a lazy half assed coward who did pretty much nothing but those things he did do were watered down useless half measures medicare for all is a simple step towards what we should have but this crap about handing benefits out to illegal trash washing up on our shores needs to end hello reason and the alt right trash that dominates your comment boards single payer health care something many western industrialized countries already have while paying much less is radical because why reason why do we end up with so many fucking lefty ignoramuses something many western industrialized countries already have what western industrialized country of 300 000 000 already has it the greater the population the more the economies of scale tend toward efficiency that s the whole goddamn point china is not western but it covers 95 of its billion population with basic health insurance and has a goal of universal basic health coverage by 2020 that s more people in case you don t do numbers i support medicare for all funded by a very very hefty baby boomer tax to make up for all the borrowing they did at my expense while deferring trillions of dollars of maintenance on our infrastructure doing next to nothing about global warming new wars they started and the myriad tax cuts they voted for themselves without offsetting with spending cuts or tax increases i support medicare for all funded a huge tax levied on fucking lefty ignoramuses like this since they have benefited from all the work and productivity which has gone before and now think they can sit on their asses and whine about their fantasy problems i think you should put your tax on your grandparents after all they started wwii social security and the welfare state were in place before boomers started voting just sayin the author here forgets that there was support for medicare for all at the time that the affordable care act aca was passed tea party and republicans like to point out that there was greater than 50 opposition to the aca at the start what they did not mention was the part of that opposition that wanted a single payer plan the republican spend years complaining about the aca and undermining it and when they got power they had no alternative is it surprising that opposition to the aca increased support for medicare for all which is really the only alternative radicalism being the thing that every other western country has what a senseless article thanks admin for giving
