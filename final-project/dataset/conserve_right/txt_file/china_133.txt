argument s sake that the chinese overproduce steel dump some of that steel into canada and europe before it makes its way to the united states pilfer intellectual property and have a plan to dominate the world by 2025 it s still not a good reason to protect a few privileged american producers by slapping tariffs on the stuff other u s firms use to manufacture their goods or for the government to restrict the supply of goods that households consume to raise their standard of living since when do free market advocates believe that a communist authoritarian regime like the one in china can successfully and centrally plan and execute economic growth these days newspapers are full of quotes by noted free marketeers who would usually oppose trade barriers such as those put in place by the trump administration but nevertheless support such barriers because they worry that china s 2025 plan will successfully lead to its domination of many industries it s puzzling george mason university economist don boudreaux correctly commented on this inconsistency by writing that those on the political right who usually believe in markets correctly understand that the u s government cannot out perform the market at picking winners but they nevertheless believe that foreign governments especially those governments with authoritarian histories and that currently possess authoritarian powers are invested with uncanny abilities to improve the performance of their economies with subsidies trade restraints and industrial policies if these guys really believe that such a top down government controlled economy can work in china why not try it here and if it works so well in china why doesn t it work in venezuela or cuba also puzzling is the constant refrain about china producing more than it needs even if this overcapacity were a boon for china it would still be to the benefit of millions of american consumers it lowers costs for thousands of small u s manufacturers and steel consumers but in reality this overproduction is a tragedy for the chinese people because their government s subsidization of steel production inevitably diverts resources from other areas of the chinese economy i don t hear americans and europeans complaining about all the stuff china isn t producing because its government stupidly wants to produce a lot of steel so the next time you encounter someone lamenting china s overcapacity shed a tear or two for the chinese people and recognize that some american non steel production might fall if and when beijing stops diverting so many resources into chinese steel factories but what about american steel producers some plead if you think trade is the main culprit in the steel industry woes think again for decades americans have imported between 25 and 30 percent of our steel that leaves domestic steel with a healthy 70 to 75 percent of the market to the extent that steel jobs were lost the reason is that american steel executives implemented labor saving innovations read technology just like the rest of the manufacturing industries these innovations made individual steel workers more productive and raised their wages as a reminder steel employment in the united states actually peaked in 1956 long before china entered in the picture but the chinese steal intellectual property from us others say still the best way to protect the property rights of some americans many of whom freely choose to operate in china under these conditions isn t to impose import taxes tariffs and thereby penalize millions of american consumers such retaliation by the u s government is a policy of picking winners and losers which is unfair and inefficient it also puts thousands of other american jobs in jeopardy exposes us to retaliation and causes u s companies like harley davidson to move their production abroad the best solutions use international organizations to challenge china s actions and form alliances with like minded allies i hope you won t read this piece as a defense of the chinese regime there s no excuse for the way it treats its people abuses human rights and deprives the chinese from free market economic policies however many of the arguments levied against china as they relate to trade either misidentify the true victims or advocate the wrong remedies and let s not forget that new u s trade and investment restrictions won t make china more like us but more government control over the u s economy will make us more like china advertisement next assessing justice kennedy s legacy veronique de rugy ph d is

talk about not getting it making americans pay high import taxes on chinese goods will force china to change these policies because um because intentions can we have at least one article from reason that acknowledges trumps tariff war is a means to eliminate them is this that 3d chess i hear so much about not even he s explicitly said and tweeted as much multiple times wait i thought his authority in the matter was about national security now you re telling me that washing machines aren t integral to the security interests of our nation i ve been told from many authorities that the content of his tweets don t mean anything they mean nothing except when you want them to mean something they re like magic he s also discussed the subject multiple times in formal speeches look feel free to disagree with his tactics all you want but ffs at least admit that it s an integral part of his stated strategy when you people talk idiotically like this you sound just like progressives don t do that oh he said so well then objections withdraw the god king has spoken if he is serious about zero tariffs why has he surrounded himself with protectionists like peter navarro and wilbur ross trump has been talking about the need for protectionism for over 30 years do you really believe he navarro and ross had some kind of conversion last week and larry kudlow ask and you shall receive kinda of yeah because intentions are magic the reality of a trade war is that it turns into a contest of which government can impose the most punishment on their citizens who want to purchase imported goods the logical conclusion is governments putting an embargo on their own ports basically they declare war on themselves basically they declare war on themselves their own people minor nit something tells me the governments imposing the sanctions on their own people will be just fine reason wakes up real rowdy i am not ready for these comments so early in the morning great article add to this china is a lot more fragile than outward appearances suggest god knows what financial disasters lurk beneath its verneer of state directed capitalism or whatever it is they are doing over there they also have a demographic time bomb and as their population becomes more affluent their expectations will rise maybe not to full throated freedom but perhaps to something singapore lite some of this makes china more dangerous militarily as i think it likely they will pull a falklands type stunt with taiwan at some point to bolster their political legitimacy on the economic front however all america needs to do is get out of our own goddamn way regulation government spending and tax wise if we got our own act together we d do well enough to not give two shits about china george mason university economist don boudreaux correctly commented on this inconsistency by writing that those on the political right who usually believe in markets correctly understand that the u s government cannot out perform the market at picking winners but they nevertheless believe that foreign governments especially those governments with authoritarian histories and that currently possess authoritarian powers are invested with uncanny abilities to improve the performance of their economies with subsidies trade restraints and industrial policies no they don t believe government is bad at picking winners and losers they believe the losers we ve been dumb enough to put in charge are bad at picking winners and losers sad but now we have trump the most successful dealmaker in the history of the world making america great again like it s never been before so now you ll see how having the right top men in charge means central planning will beat the free market every time think about it the free market means businesses respond to every moron waving a nickel giving them what they want rather than what smart people know they should want and our lord and savior donald j trump is much smarter than all those other smart guys put together put your faith in the lord and he shall deliver you from the depths you start talking shit about our god and we ll nail your ass to a tree since when do free market advocates believe that a communist authoritarian regime like the one in china can successfully and centrally plan and execute economic growth because their 2025 plan is a 7 year plan instead of the usual 5 year plan that was the secret to successful central planning all this time an additional 2 years sarc if these guys really believe that such a top down government controlled economy can work in china why not try it here let s not give them any ideas and if it works so well in china why doesn t it work in venezuela or cuba because asians are really smart whereas dirty beaners aren t sarc i hope you won t read this piece as a defense of the chinese regime oh please everyone knows you re the biggest pinko chi com apologist at t reason also sarc use the tariff money to offset environmental and other regulatory schemes and to lower personal income tax and i would be cool with that i think that only deep pocket corporations should band together to fight taxes and us civilians should live our lives without contact with the irs the manufacturers try to pass on the cost of taxation to the consumer but there are limits and competition crony capitalists should be drawn and quartered eventually there s enough pressure through resistance to high prices that it s cheaper for a corporation to fight it in court rather than lose profits the article misses the biggest point in trade with china their currency the yuan until the yuan is freely traded in global currency markets there will not be free or even fair trade with china by omitting the yuan or addressing china s barriers into entering their markets the article seems biased towards the china side japan is was worse i think japan just got its first costco after decades of jurisprudence those on the political right who usually believe in markets correctly understand that the u s government cannot out perform the market at picking winners but they nevertheless believe that foreign governments especially those governments with authoritarian histories and that currently possess authoritarian powers are invested with uncanny abilities to improve the performance of their economies with subsidies trade restraints and industrial policies no that s not the argument at all on average chinese steel dumping does not improve the performance of the chinese economy as a whole that is china s trade policy is a negative sum game it hurts their economy and it hurts ours if china were a rational participant in a free market they would stop doing it or go out of business but they are a communist dictatorship and they aren t optimizing economic performance they are optimizing for political power and from that point of view their policies make sense it is utterly absurd for free market economists to reason about china as if the entire country were a profit maximizing economic agent yup people forget that political and or military power is as important or more important than simple dollars and cents china is trying to maximize their political and military power if that results in mildly less economic growth they re fine with that knee capping foreign industries while building their up in key sectors is seen as a worthwhile goal to them frankly i can t entirely argue with their logic either their economic growth is so robust they can afford to shave a percent or two of economic growth a year to achieve geopolitical goals they might not with a totally free market they re playing power politics not just economics in other words they re playing an entirely different game than the free ish market western world is and authors like this completely miss the point and think it doesn t make sense but they don t have the same goal in mind and it makes perfect sense if you know what they re really after there is much right in this article but as usual some minor deceptions the reason the usa still supposedly produces 70 of the steel we consume while our production has cratered to less than half what it was not too many years back is very simple we no longer have most of the steel consuming industry here anymore either we re importing tons of steel in finished form from abroad otherwise our production as a percentage of consumption would probably be something paltry like 10 20 if you import a pot from china made of steel that isn t counted as steel consumption my vintage revere ware pots were made in the usa so would have counted the chinese made ones now don t no domestic manufacturing on paper lower consumption so the way it s framed here like we re still cranking out as much as we need is a little disingenuous as a peel and stick tile supplier we do not think trade war is good please log in to post comments john stossel 5 27 2020 12 30 am
