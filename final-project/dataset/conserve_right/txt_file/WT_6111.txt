apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap facing a grim reality of surging coronavirus cases president donald trump is making premature assertions about relatively low death rates in the u s and revising history about how seriously he viewed the threat including the need for ventilators a look at his claims mortality top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state trump so we have more cases than anybody but we re doing really well and we also have a very low relative to other countries very low mortality rate and there are reasons for that interview monday with fox friends trump we ve been doing more test tests than any other country anywhere in the world it s one of the reasons that we have more cases than other countries because we ve been testing it s also one of the reasons that we re just about the lowest in terms of mortality rate news briefing sunday the facts his suggestion that the u s response is better than other countries because its mortality rate is just about the lowest is unsupported and misleading it s too early to know the real death rate from covid 19 in any country look at a count kept by johns hopkins university and you can divide the number of recorded deaths with the number of reported cases but that math provides a completely unreliable measurement of death rates and the johns hopkins tally is not intended to be that first the count changes every day as new infections and deaths are recorded more importantly every country is testing differently knowing the real denominator the true number of people who become infected is key to determining what portion of them die some countries the u s among them have had trouble making enough tests available when there s a shortage of tests the sickest get tested first and even with a good supply of tests someone who s otherwise healthy and has mild symptoms may not be tested and thus go uncounted the result is a hodgepodge of numbers that get sorted out as the crisis diminishes indeed initial death rates were thought to be as high as 4 in parts of china but a report published monday in the lancet infectious diseases calculated that 1 38 actually is the best estimate of deaths among confirmed cases across china and that accounting for unconfirmed cases could drop that rate below 1 u s infectious disease expert dr anthony fauci has estimated that the death rate in the u s might hit around 1 which would be 10 times higher than mortality from a typical flu season whatever the actual percentage the more people who become infected the higher the numbers of deaths one reason authorities are stressing social distancing measures to stem the virus spread and prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by a surge of patients and in each country the age and overall health of the population are factors too italy for example has the world s second oldest population and seniors are at an especially high risk of death federal aid for states trump i get on calls and i get on a lot of the governor calls where we ll have all 50 governors plus where we have some territories also but we have 50 governors and i ll tell you what if you could listen to those calls you d never hear a complaint interview with fox friends the facts that s false by his own accounting he s complained about the complaints of governors and the associated press has heard governors complaining to trump privately on the phone some of these governors take take take and then they complain trump groused in an interview thursday on fox news channel s hannity of democratic gov gretchen whitmer of michigan he said all she does is sit there and blame the federal government and he said washington gov jay inslee also a democrat should be doing more adding he s always complaining you know trump said from the white house we don t like to see the complaints on a private conference call thursday with governors inslee urged trump to use his full authority to spur production of necessary medical equipment according to an audio recording of the call obtained by the ap trump replied that the federal government is merely the backup i don t want you to be the backup quarterback we need to be tom brady here inslee replied invoking the football star the nation s governors have been pressing the president to do more to bolster supplies despite the perceived risks of speaking out they have pleaded with him to use the defense production act to force companies to manufacture critical equipment and begged for help in obtaining supplies like masks and testing agents on friday trump told reporters that he wants governors to be appreciative of the federal government s efforts because we have done a hell of a job still in a conference call with trump on monday several governors made clear the federal government wasn t doing enough every governor understands we are way behind the curve on test kits inslee said in the recording republican gov larry hogan of maryland voiced appreciation for the 2 2 trillion economic stimulus bill that trump signed into law last week and the president s acknowledgement that states will need more help but he emphasized that governors are still frustrated about a scarcity of medical supplies yamiche alcindor pbs newshour reporter at white house briefing sunday you ve said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting they don t actually need you said new york might not need 30 000 ventilators trump i didn t say that alcindor you said it on sean hannity s fox news trump i didn t say come on the facts he did say that in his interview thursday with hannity trump pointed out that new york gov andrew cuomo a democrat had said he wanted 30 000 of them 30 000 all right think of this trump went on you know you go to hospitals they ll have one in a hospital and now all of a sudden everybody s asking for these vast numbers trump then suggested that pleas for more ventilators were exaggerated i have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they re going to be he said i don t believe you need 40 000 or 30 000 ventilators trump continued you know you re going to major hospitals sometimes they ll have two ventilators and now all of a sudden they re saying can we order 30 000 ventilators by the following day as coronavirus cases grew he switched gears and invoked the defense production act to force general motors to produce ventilators for coronavirus patients while calling on twitter for gm to start making ventilators now and ford to get going on ventilators fast when trump was asked by reporters friday why he invoked the act if the ventilators won t be needed he said that he thought there is a good chance there ll be enough and that if there ends up being a surplus the ventilators could be sent to other countries general motors trump asserting he got immediate results from gm after invoking the defense production act those companies have come into line they re doing a great job they re working very hard around the clock and by the way general motors is doing a fantastic job i don t think we have to worry about general motors now news briefing sunday the facts trump s action didn t spur dramatic transformation by gm the automaker has been moving rapidly fronting millions in capital and says it s still proceeding on the same course gm had expected to start making ventilators in mid april increasing to a rate of 10 000 per month as quickly as it can in partnership with ventec life systems a small seattle area ventilator maker gm got into the ventilator business march 18 before trump s order on march 27 after being approached by a coalition of ceos trying to organize companies to respond to the covid 19 outbreak the organization introduced gm to ventec which makes small portable ventilators in bothell washington gm pulled together manufacturing experts engineers and purchasing specialists and the next day had people at ventec s facility a few days later gm assigned more engineers and purchasing experts to figure out how it could make ventec s machines and help round out parts supplies travel restrictions trump i stopped some very very infected very very sick people thousands coming in from china long earlier than anybody thought including the experts nobody thought we should do it except me and i stopped everybody we stopped it cold interview with fox friends the facts he didn t stop cold all the people infected with coronavirus from entering the u s there were gaps in containment and initial delays in testing leading to the u s rising last week to no 1 globally in the number of people infected by covid 19 nor did trump decide on his own to impose travel restrictions on china he followed a consensus recommendation by his public health advisers his order in late january temporarily barred entry by foreign nationals who had traveled in china within the previous 14 days with exceptions for the immediate family of u s citizens and permanent residents americans returning from china were allowed back for two more weeks they were given enhanced screenings but screenings can miss people who are carrying the virus but showing no symptoms virus testing trump we inherited a broken test the whole thing was broken and we rebuilt it interview monday with fox friends trump this administration inherited a broken system a system that was obsolete a system that didn t work it was ok for a tiny small group of people but once you got beyond that it didn t work news briefing monday the facts trump appears to be repeating a false accusation that a restrictive policy introduced by the obama administration hampered initial testing during the covid 19 outbreak food and drug administration guidance drafted in 2014 called for tighter regulation of laboratory developed tests a market traditionally not overseen by the agency trump says that step made it more difficult to come out with a coronavirus test but that guidance never took effect and if it had it would not have applied to public health emergencies like the current one the trump administration s action in early march instead undid a policy that its own fda put in place that action let labs run by companies universities and hospitals develop and use coronavirus diagnostic tests before the agency reviews them speeding up the supply previously the fda had only authorized use of a government test developed by the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc in january developed a test kit and sent it to state and county public health labs so they could test more people but most of those kits proved to be faulty delaying diagnosis of many people who unwittingly spread the disease trump on why he thinks south korea does more covid 19 testing per capita than the u s i know south korea better than anybody it s a very tight do you know how many people are in seoul do you know how big the city of seoul is thirty eight million people news briefing monday the facts that s wrong the city of seoul has a population of 10 million seoul s greater metropolitan area is home to 25 million people still far from trump s assertion of 38 million south korea s population is 51 million associated press writers matthew perrone in washington tom krisher
