bulk of its 23 million annual budget from case all six of the charity s paid board members share the last name sekulow including jay s wife pam and their sons jordon and logan that tight knit family control runs afoul of standards issued by multiple watchdog groups to help stem the likelihood of self dealing and graft the better business bureau s wise giving alliance recommends at least five independent board members and not more than one who receives direct financial benefits bennett weiner who heads the bbb alliance said it issued an advisory about aclj after the organization didn t respond to requests for more information about its finances the evangelical council for financial accountability founded 40 years ago by billy graham and other evangelical leaders to accredit christian non profits requires independent boards of directors made up of people not related by blood or marriage to staff members case and aclj are not listed among the council s 2 400 members as sekulow has positioned himself among trump s chief defenders in both the courtroom and as a legal analyst on fox news case has continued to raise more than 50 million annually through an aggressive mix of telemarketing and direct mail soliciting the conservative faithful to support aclj s courtroom advocacy but tax records show much of that money is routed to sekulow and his family over the 10 year period examined by ap more than 12 million was paid in direct salary and benefits to sekulow and his family members gary sekulow jay s 61 year old brother was paid a total of 985 947 in salary and benefits in 2017 as the chief operating and financial officer at both aclj and case two full time positions that tax documents indicate would require him to work 80 hours each week adam sekulow gary s 31 year old son was paid 229 227 as the director of development at case and 65 052 as the director of major donors at aclj the same year records show millions more each year going to for profit companies controlled by the family in addition to the 5 8 million aclj paid to cla group in 2017 1 4 million was paid to regency productions a company owned by jay sekulow that receives his fees for appearing on the radio show jay sekulow live and his television show aclj this week with jay sekulow which airs on the same christian network as pat robertson s the 700 club over the 10 year period reviewed by ap cla group and regency were paid a combined 46 million in charitable funds by aclj and case millions more were paid by the charities for airtime though the recipients of that money were not detailed in the tax records sekulow s show is often recorded at a studio located at the washington d c headquarters of aclj tax records show the office building with a current assessed value of 3 8 million is owned by case the charity controlled by the sekulow family also owns the spacious four bedroom four bath rowhouse next door which has a current assessed value of 1 8 million this week an ap photographer saw jay s son jordan sekulow 37 entering the residence a graduate of regent law school jordan sekulow is the executive director of aclj a member of trump s defense team and also hosts his father s radio show aclj s website and affiliated youtube channel have been posting daily updates about the impeachment trial reiterating gop arguments and hammering democratic house managers jordan s wife anna sekulow 36 also works at the charity as a digital media adviser according to its website the public tax records do not indicate how much they are paid about 6 8 million went to the company pfms of georgia f or producing sekulow s shows that company s website lists gary sekulow s wife kimberly sekulow 60 as president and ceo the address for that business is in the same suburban atlanta building listed on tax returns as the offices for case the charity that pays it in addition to his two paid jobs at the non profits the couple s son adam sekulow is listed as the acquisition manager at pfms his sister jennifer sekulow 27 is the head of market research the records show at least 1 2 million was spent by the charities on private jets including an unusual arrangement where case was paying to lease a plane co owned by the for profit companies controlled by jay sekulow and his sister in law the tax records show millions more were routed into numerous non profit and for profit entities which makes it challenging to determine who is really getting the money for example aclj and case made payments to the law justice institute a non profit entity created by sekulow and roth tax records show that charity s only activity was to make annual payments to two for profit companies advocacy services inc and educational resources associates virginia incorporation records list m g robertson of virginia beach as the president and director of advocacy services which received 4 million in payments marion gordon robertson 89 is better known to tv viewers by his nickname pat incorporation filings for education resources associates in washington d c list its ceo as john ashcroft who served as u s attorney general in the administration of president george w bush that company got 2 2 million in consulting fees from the charitable law justice institute ashcroft 77 is listed as a distinguished professor at regent university and has appeared with sekulow at aclj events marc owens who served for 10 years as the director of the exempt organizations division of the internal revenue service said the structure of the charities and corporations controlled by the sekulow family appeared designed to obscure just who is getting paid and how much federal law forbids charities from excessively benefiting those who have substantial influence over the organization owens said both the irs and state attorneys general should investigate this is an apparent web of organizations that seem to exist to pay compensation to sekulow and his family members said owens who is now in private practice that pattern clearly raises questions for those entities that are tax exempt under section 501 c 3 as to whether they re operating for a public benefit or the private benefit of jay sekulow and his family members sekulow s spokesman denied any wrongdoing the financial arrangements between aclj case and other entities have been reviewed by outside independent experts and are in compliance with all tax laws kapp said asked who those outside experts are and whether ap could speak with them kapp responded that he didn t have anything to add asso
