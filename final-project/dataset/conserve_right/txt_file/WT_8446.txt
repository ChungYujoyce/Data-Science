fbi on china spying threat fbi director christopher wray recently outlined the threat posed by chinese intelligence operations in the united states aggressive activities that continue despite the trump administration s tougher policies toward beijing s technology theft i would say that there is no country that poses a more severe counterintelligence threat to this country right now than china mr wray told the senate judiciary committee on july 23 mr wray described chinese intelligence operatives as fighting a generational fight here and said that counter the operations is a high priority for fbi counterspies both chinese government spies and nonprofessional intelligence collectors such as business executives scientists academics and graduate students are engaged in theft of american secrets and technology we have as we speak probably about 1 000 plus investigations all across the country involving attempted theft of u s intellectual property whether it s economic espionage or counterproliferation almost all leading back to china the fbi chief said it is a threat that s deep and diverse and wide and vexing whether it s in terms of the kinds of actors that are used the kinds of techniques used the kind of targets that are used he added we are working extremely hard with all of our partners to combat it mr wray said the threat from china is not about the chinese people as a whole and it s certainly not about chinese americans in this country the culprit is the ruling communist party of china and its government organs chinese intelligence utilizes at least four organs under control of the party the ministry of state security the civilian spy agency and the second and third departments of the people s liberation army engaged in human spying and cyberspying respectively additionally the party uses the united front work department for intelligence gathering and influence operations in recent years china also has elevated the ministry of public security once mainly a police agency to a spying and internal security organ warning on ransomware attacks the department of homeland security s cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency issued a warning this week about an increase in cyberattacks involving ransomed data schemes the growing number of such attacks highlights the critical importance of making cyber preparedness a priority and taking the necessary steps to secure our networks against adversaries the agency said in a joint notice with the multi state information sharing and analysis center national governors association and the national association of state chief information officers the notice said the prevention and preparation are the best tools to defend against ransomware a ransomware attack involves hackers locking up computer systems usually with encryption software and then demanding payment to release the electronic information the warning says three steps should be taken the deal with ransomware back up systems regularly reinforce cybersecurity awareness and develop and refine cyberresponse plans to such attacks most ransomware attacks require fooling a human in order to succeed and response plans that rely on contacting cyber first responders in internal resources are often unable to handle ransomware attacks louisiana gov john bel edwards recently declared a state of emergency in response to a series of ransomware attacks against school districts in the state several cities in recent months have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to hackers that carried out ransomware attacks in june riviera beach city paid 600 000 in bitcoin to hackers that locked up the city s data and services a second incident involved lake city florida which paid 500 000 in ransom after hackers attacked the
