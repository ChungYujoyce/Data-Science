and members of the news media the white house said monday but his press secretary said he hadn t yet watched the two minute clip the video which drew widespread condemnation was played during a conference held by conservative supporters of the president at his miami golf resort last week it depicts a gruesome scene inside a church of fake news in which a figure whose face has been replaced with an image of trump goes on a shooting rampage targeting a long list of political rivals including democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders former president barack obama and numerous news organizations top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump

growing genre of pro trump memes that routinely earn thousands of views on sites like youtube and twitter many use superimposed faces and feature the president and his chief supporters valiantly conquering challengers or members of the media the one featured at the florida conference appears to have been first posted in july 2018 on the youtube channel thegeekzteam where it has been viewed more than 250 000 times it uses a violent clip from the 2015 spy thriller kingsman the secret service in the original scene actor colin firth is depicted shooting a crowd of possessed churchgoers thegeekzteam s parody of trump in kingsman was taken down for a copyright claim late monday an email listed for thegeekzteam did not respond to a request for comment the channel frequently posts

faces of democratic rep alexandria ocasio cortez and presidential candidate elizabeth warren as well as cnn reporter jim acosta among others memes which often feature photographs of politicians with snappy text or edited video clips have become a highly shareable form of political communication on social media sites while many are innocent highlighting facts or opinion both liberal and conservative sites have used such images to push false claims and outlandish suggestions for years and trump has regularly elevated that content sharing memes that support him or attack his opponents

obscured by the cnn logo trump had yet to weigh in on the video personally by early evening despite firing off more than a dozen tweets monday including one that called on his millions of supporters to vote for former white house press secretary sean spicer who is a contestant on the show dancing with the stars the current white house press secretary stephanie grisham said in her own tweet that trump would be viewing the video later and that based upon everything he has heard he strongly condemns it the genre has become so popular online that the american priority conference featured a contest for meme makers to submit their best pro trump images and videos to be showcased alongside talks by some of the president s high profile backers including his eldest son donald trump jr and another former press secretary sarah sanders that contest was promoted online by a twitter user who goes by the handle carpedonktum and as one of trump s favored meme makers was among several conservative social media provocateurs invited to meet the president at the white house earlier this year the video of trump slaying his political opponents was part of a loop of videos that was

that it was shown last week in a side room this video was not approved seen or sanctioned by the event s organizers phillips said adding through a spokeswoman ampfest condemns all violence in the strongest terms and only wants to unite americans many political meme creators insist their work is meant to be viewed as political humor even when the images they create use hateful language violent imagery or misinformed talking points to get their message across but social media comments often promote or cheer on the false or incendiary rhetoric in the memes said lanier holt an ohio state university professor who researches political communication when the person who actually created it gets busted or identified they say oh it s a joke holt said the video controversy comes as the
