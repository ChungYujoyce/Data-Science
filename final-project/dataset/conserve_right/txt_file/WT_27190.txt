tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn des moines register march 15 2019 trump keeps conning iowa republicans his budget is only the latest proof iowa republicans you were duped by donald trump flimflammed bamboozled top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey you should have known it early in 2017 when trump stocked his cabinet with anti ethanol crusaders who did their best to water down government support for iowa grown green energy the administration s game of hide and seek with the renewable fuel standard helped keep corn prices in the basement you must have at least had a clue last year when trump shoved iowa farmers and livestock producers onto the front lines of a multinational trade war his action endangered vital export markets worth billions of dollars to iowa and his boast that trade wars could be easily won was just more snake oil now if you don t know it you must be a really slow learner trump s proposed budget slashes the agriculture safety net including 28 billion in cuts to crop insurance and commodity subsidies it cuts or eliminates many usda rural development and housing programs but hey it invests in broadband just in case anyone is left in rural iowa to use a computer this latest kick in the teeth comes just months after trump signed the 2018 farm bill by the way a flimflam and a flip flop that should be enough for iowa farmers at least to re evaluate their political decision making for 2020 but that s not all trump promised in his presidential campaign announcement speech no less to protect medicare and social security iowans who bought that line can be forgiven for not immediately realizing that trump lies almost every time he opens his mouth we certainly know that now however so the grace period is officially over the president s budget would cut medicare by a net 575 billion over 10 years the claim is that the government will save that money by reducing the cost of prescription drug prices and rooting out waste and fraud naturally but in politics cuts are cuts or don t you remember when trump and other republicans were slamming democrats obamacare for cutting medicare by building anticipated cost savings into the budget huh then there s social security if trump supporters in iowa don t care about anything else they should care about the 25 billion trump proposes to cut out of social security there s no dressing this up as a potential savings from efficiency this simply cuts the benefit trump lied to you his budget proves it republicans profess to support reining in entitlements to curb runaway federal deficits and debt but they usually at least imply they ll cut only programs that middle income white people don t care about if stiffing grandma to pay for tax cuts to the wealthy doesn t raise your blood pressure this should trump s overall budget does not slow federal spending quite the contrary it continues to explode the national debt and deficit by an estimated 1 trillion a year through 2022 by the way iowa seniors should be squealing about sen joni ernst s proposal to let young adults siphon social security to pay for family leave the long term solvency of the program depends on more money coming in from younger workers not less her plan acknowledges the need to support working parents who may lack access to quality affordable child care but using social security to pay for other spending goals smashes open that mythological lock box forget squealing republicans should run away shrieking now anyone who thinks trump s budget will actually be approved should check out some prime real estate that may be for sale on pothole lake in des moines this budget may be pure fantasy but it is still a statement of priorities it s the most obvious sign yet that this president believes he can keep on treating his iowa supporters like toilet paper and they ll keep on believing they re smelling roses and he may be right the latest des moines register cnn mediacom iowa poll shows 81 percent of republicans approve of the job trump is doing as president and only 40 percent want to see gop competition in the 2020 presidential race those red maga hats must cut off oxygen to the brain sometimes fraud victims are too embarrassed to admit they ve been conned they keep throwing their money away to keep up the appearance that they are in control predators depend on that false pride to keep fleecing their victims there s an old saying fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me how many times will trump keep fooling iowa republicans fort dodge messenger march 14 2019 keeping iowa s hogs safe hogs raised in iowa account for more than 30 percent of u s hog production iowa ranks as the nation s top hog producing state it s also the top state for pork exports those sales abroad are estimated to exceed 1 billion annually the pork industry is vitally important to iowa s continued prosperity hog farming contributes 7 5 billion to our state s economy each year an outbreak of serious disease could be a catastrophic development that s why it is very good news that the u s department of agriculture has increased its efforts to keep african swine fever usually referred to as asf from reaching the american heartland asf is a contagious and deadly viral disease according to the usda it is transmitted by contact with the body fluids of infected animals this dangerous ailment has already spread internationally having reached china in 2018 the iowa department of agriculture and land stewardship was recently the host of a two day usda exercise that largely focused on african swine fever the actions federal and state officials are taking to keep this disease away from the united states were outlined the response plan if the disease reaches iowa was also addressed the effects of a foreign animal disease outbreak here in iowa would be devastating for our producers mike naig iowa s secretary of agriculture said in a statement released by his office march 7 naig praised the preventive efforts already being taken by the usda according to information provided by idals and the usda those measures which are being taken in coordination with the u s customs and border patrol include training and adding beagle teams to reach a total of 179 at key u s commercial ports expanding arrival screenings at key u s commercial ports increasing inspections and enforcement of garbage feeding facilities to ensure fed garbage is cooked properly to prevent potential disease spread heightening producer awareness and encouraging self evaluations of on farm biosecurity procedures developing testing procedures to screen for the virus in grains feeds and additives and swine oral fluid samples working closely with canada and mexico on a north american coordinated approach to asf defense and response and coordinating with the u s pork industry leaders to unify efforts to combat asf introduction we understand the grave concerns about the asf

efforts will have the desired effect we urge prompt adherence to whatever additional prevention and response recommendations the usda may issue sioux city journal march 15 2019 get extension of save tax done this year like last year extension of the penny secure an advanced vision for education or save tax is halfway to reality at the iowa statehouse this year on wednesday the house passed an extension of the tax to 2050 the school infrastructure tax which is scheduled to sunset in 2029 passed the house last year as well but didn t get a vote in the senate this year the extension passed the senate education committee and awaits a decision by the ways and means committee if ways and means passes the bill it will move to floor debate this is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will pass all session said rep jacob bossman r sioux city not only does this bill provide schools with resources to update aging facilities improve security and upgrade classroom technology it also provides local residents with significant property tax relief it is a win win for both schools and taxpayers we agree as we have said before in this space we have an almost proprietary interest in the tax because its roots stretch back more than 20 years to woodbury county this county was the first in iowa to approve a 10 year local option sales tax for public school infrastructure the tax first passed in 1998 county voters approved a 10 year extension in 2005 the tax was supported by iowans through referendums in individual counties across the state as a local option sales tax before it became a statewide tax in 2008 the benefits of this tax speak for themselves in the form of school improvements including new buildings throughout iowa in sioux city revenue from the tax built or is building elementary schools built middle schools and built science wings at each of the district s public high schools arguably no district in the state has benefited more from the school infrastructure tax still more work remains here and elsewhere in sioux city for example the need for replacement of more elementary schools and additional improvements to existing high schools or construction of new high schools await decisions by the time the tax is scheduled to sunset local public high schools will be nearly 60 years old we urge the senate to join the house and help school districts throughout iowa plan and bond for critical future infrastructure project
