apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic internet engineers and legal scholars are worried that amendments to a u n telecommunications treaty will give repressive governments more control of the internet in their countries and could begin to undermine international sanctions against pariah states such as iran current and former u s and foreign officials scientists and scholars will testify about their concerns tuesday before a joint hearing of the house foreign affairs and the house energy and commerce committees according to prepared testimony and other documents made available by the house energy and commerce committee the witnesses will report on the outcome of december s world conference on international telecommunications in dubai where some countries agreed to revisions to the international telecommunications regulations a 1998 treaty that governs telephone services across national borders top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender while the final treaty text was disappointing it was not as bad as it could have been according to the prepared testimony of sally shipman wentworth government liaison for the internet society an association of scientists and engineers that sets standards for aspects of the internet s operation ms wentworth praises the work of the u s and allied delegations that fended off the most dangerous proposed changes to the treaty which would have given the international telecommunications union itu the u n body that administers the treaty significant new authority over the internet but she warns that the revised treaty does contain language that could have a lasting impact on the internet s infrastructure and operations and on the content that is so fundamental to its value in particular there is concern about the role the treaty creates for the itu and signatory states in controlling spam email that provision will allow repressive regimes to inspect the content of internet messages to determine if they can be blocked as spam to solve so called network congestion issues according to the prepared testimony of david a gross a former state department official who was responsible for international communications and information policy china could use that provision to do many things to monitor or disrupt communications for example of dissidents mr gross said in an interview with the washington times his testimony also highlights an unprecedented treaty revision that he warns could undermine international sanctions against pariah states including iran sudan and north korea this provision purports to give what the itu has referred to as a new human right the right to access international telecommunications services but to give the right to governments rather than individuals he says in prepared testimony that turns the whole concept of human rights on its head and could give sanctioned nations rather than individuals a basis for arguing that restrictions on the provision of telecommunications equipment or services were violations of their rights under the revised treaty mr gross says it s a way of governments trying to get around sanctions as a result of these provisions 55 nations including the u s canada australia new zealand japan india chile costa rica great britain and most other european union nations refused to sign or deferred a decision on signing the revised international telecommunications regulations eighty nine other nations including russia china saudi arabia venezuela singapore kuwait iran iraq brazil yemen and zimbabwe signed the treaty some of those countries may have to have the treaty ratified by vote in their legislatures or some other procedure mr gross said adding that 40 to 50 countries that are signatories of the original treaty but did not attend the dubai conference have not signed the revised document international telecommunications for countries like the u s which signed the original treaty but not the revised pact continue to be governed by the 1988 treaty he said that could potentially be a real mess when the provisions come into force on jan 1 2015 mr gross said china for several years has operated the great firewall a series of technical and regulatory measures that allow government censors to block access to specified sites for chinese web users while russia claims the authority to shut down websites for a wide variety of vaguely worded reasons last year iran said it is developing a national islamic pure web separate from the rest of the global internet while its security services have been implicated in surveillance of iranian users of email services like google s gmail rep christopher h smith new jersey republican said many of the same countries that want to increase government control of the internet are the same countries where internet freedom suffers the most mr smith heads the house foreign affairs subcommittee on africa global health global human rights and international organizations several witnesses note in their testimony that december s conference in dubai likely marked the beginning not the end of efforts to impose intergovernmental authority over the internet rep edward r royce california republican said international efforts to regulate the internet will continue and need to be opposed since its inception the internet has thrived in large part because of the government s hands off approach and we will continue our fight to ensure the global internet remains free from government control mr royce chairman of the house committee on foreign
