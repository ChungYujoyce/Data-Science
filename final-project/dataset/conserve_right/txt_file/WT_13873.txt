apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic yokosuka japan ap a new carrier killer missile that has become a symbol of china s rising military might will not force the u s navy to change the way it operates in the pacific a senior navy commander told the associated press defense analysts say the dong feng 21d missile could upend the balance of power in asia where u s aircraft carrier battle groups have ruled the waves since the end of world war ii however vice adm scott van buskirk commander of the u s 7th fleet told the ap in an interview that the navy does not see the much feared weapon as creating any insurmountable vulnerability for the u s carriers the navy s crown jewels top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey it s not the achilles heel of our aircraft carriers or our navy it is one weapons system one technology that is out there adm van buskirk said in an interview this week on the bridge of the uss george washington the only carrier that is home based in the western pacific the df 21d is unique in that it is believed capable of hitting a powerfully defended moving target such as the uss george washington with pinpoint precision that objective is so complex that the soviets gave up on a similar project the missile would penetrate defenses because its speed from launch would not allow enough time for carriers or other large ships to complete countermeasures that capability could seriously weaken washington s ability to intervene in any potential conflict over taiwan or north korea as well as deny u s ships safe access to international waters near china s 11 200 mile long coastline adm van buskirk whose fleet is responsible for most of the pacific and indian oceans with 60 to 70 ships and 40 000 sailors and marines under his command said the capabilities of the chinese missile are as yet unproved but he acknowledged it does raise special concerns any new capability is something that we try to monitor he said if there wasn t this to point to as a game changer there would be something else he said that term has been bandied about for many things i think it really depends in how you define the game whether it really changes it or not it s a very specific scenario for a very specific capability some things can be very impactful the development of the missile comes as china increasingly is venturing further out to sea and is becoming more assertive around its coastline and in disputes over territory late last year china and japan were locked in a heated diplomatic row over several islands both claim in the east china sea an area regularly patrolled by u s navy vessels a flotilla of 10 chinese warships including advanced submarines and destroyers passed through the miyako strait last april in the biggest transit of its kind to date experts saw it as an attempt by china to test japan and the united states and demonstrate its open water capabilities china also hasexpressed strong displeasure with u s carrier operations off the korean peninsula saying that they posed a security risk to its capital still adm van buskirk said the navy has no intention of altering its mission because of the new threat and will continue to operate in the seas around japan korea the philippines and anywhere else it deems necessary we won t change these operations because of this specific technology that might be out there he told the ap while the uss george washington was in its home port just south of tokyo for repairs last week but we will carefully monitor and adapt to it the faster than expected development of the missile has set off alarm bells in washington further china is developing a stealth fighter jet that could be used to support its navy in a potential conflict and hopes to deploy its first aircraft carriers over the next decade before visiting beijing last month u s defense secretary robert m gates said he has been concerned about the anti ship missile since he took office in december adm robert willard the head of the u s pacific command told japan s asahi shimbun newspaper he believed the missile program had achieved initial operational capability meaning a workable design had been settled on and was being developed further the missile is considered a key component of china s strategy of denying u s planes and ships access to waters off its coast the strategy includes overlapping layers of air defense systems naval assets such as submarines and advanced ballistic missile systems all woven together with a network of satellites at its most capable the df 21d could be launched from land with enough accuracy to penetrate the defenses of even the most advanced moving aircraft carrier at a distance of more than 900 miles to allay regional security fears adm van buskirk said china needs to be more forthcoming about its intentions it goes back to transparency he said using the united states as an example we are very clear about our intent when conducting routine and normal operations in international waters that is what you mig
