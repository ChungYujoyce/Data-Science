 should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion donald trump is giving the republican establishment cardiac arrest it is trying to destroy his credibility as a viable presidential candidate in 2012 it is easy to see why mr trump is soaring in the polls over the past month the billionaire real estate mogul has catapulted to the top of the prospective gop field closely trailing former arkansas gov mike huckabee and former massachusetts gov mitt romney mr trump has many positive assets he is articulate forceful and should he decide to run would have an almost unlimited war chest yet his greatest weapon is that he is not afraid to hit president obama hard on almost every major issue taxes trade deficits government spending obamacare jobs and libya he is willing to go where other gop candidates fear to tread he is politically incorrect discussing taboos such as the president s birth certificate which is considered beyond the pale by our establishment media in short mr trump is the consummate outsider and for this he is being eviscerated by gop insiders karl rove senior adviser to former president george w bush labeled mr trump s possible white house bid a joke that was echoed by the anti tax group the club for growth which branded mr trump a tax hiking liberal and the king of protectionism in international trade top stories gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed donald trump for president you ve got to be joking club for growth president chris chocola said the emerging gop narrative is as obvious as it is infantile mr trump cannot be taken seriously he is the court jester of american politics good for some laughs and nothing else this is a cheap smear designed to avoid discussing the substance of his ideas in particular mr trump is different from the other potential gop candidates in one important respect he is a nationalist he is tapping into a middle american populism previously championed by ross perot and pat buchanan mr trump is not a globalist free trader but an economic protectionist he is opposed to the north american free trade agreement the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the world trade organization he seeks to slap a 25 percent tariff on chinese imports and end beijing s predatory trade policies in short he wants to put america first for decades both parties have told americans that free trade would stimulate jobs economic growth and soaring exports both sides would benefit from a more robust exchange of goods and services in fact the very opposite has occurred america has opened its giant market to imports while other nations such as china south korea and japan have kept their markets closed beijing and seoul restrict u s imports entering their countries while washington welcomes a flood of cheap chinese products everything from computers and textiles to cars and auto parts the result is that washington has been amassing record trade deficits the main thing america has been exporting sorry outsourcing is its jobs over the past decade 6 million manufacturing jobs have been wiped out one third of our industrial base has disappeared and china has emerged as one of the world s top automakers and the premier exporting nation beijing deliberately manipulates its currency to boost exports it forces u s corporations that build plants in china to disclose their technological secrets and research and development practices effectively stealing american know how and innovation u s manufacturing is a shadow of its former self no great modern nation has ever endured without being an industrial power the most potent symbol of america s decline is detroit once known as the arsenal of democracy which built the tanks jeeps and airplanes pivotal to defeating nazi germany and imperial japan it has become an urban wasteland we no longer produce much except junk food and vulgar hollywood movies wal mart is a case in point in essence it is a huge chinese convenience store where almost every product is made in china the red dragon is on the march the u s consumer is bankrolling china s growing military and economic might beijing s communist rulers are determined to eclipse the united states this should come as no surprise china is simply following the model established by america from 1865 until 1932 the united states pursued economic nationalism led by the republican party washington championed high tariffs low taxes and strong manufacturing abraham lincoln william mckinley and calvin coolidge all embraced protectionism along with tax cutting pro growth policies this helped transform america into a prosperous industrial nation and military giant we have forgotten the keys to our success hence when mr trump says he will repeal obamacare slash government spending reverse our skyrocketing deficits terminate nafta and other trade deals stand up to the chinese and impose protective tariffs to stop america s deindustrialization he is speaking the language of traditional republicanism there is nothing funny or comical about his potential candidacy in fact it is remarkable that the same people mr rove the club for growth the gop establishment who are smearing mr trump are partially responsible for america s current crisis they were complicit in propping up the bush administration mr bush supported runaway deficit spending massive bailouts the prescription drug benefit that paved the way for obamacare bleeding wars in the middle east disastrous trade deals and the appeasement of china his failed big government free trade policies badly damaged republicans costing them control of congress in 2006 and the white house in 2008 in other words it was mr bush who ultimately gave us the obama pelosi democrats mr trump s ideas are not a joke he is rightly raising the flag of republican nationalism a once dominant tradition that desperately needs to be revived economic nationalism made america great it can do so again jeffrey t kuhner is a columnist at the washington times and president of the edmund burke
