stability in this region and do more to contribute to mutual trust and regional peace and stability u s military officials said strengthening japan s amphibious capabilities is vital as the u s

protests across china beijing increasingly has patrolled the area prompting japan to dispatch fighter jets to monitor chinese aircraft raising the risk of missteps that could trigger a clash japan s navy is among the world s best equipped and best trained but its skills at storming beaches and other amphibious capabilities have been weak since its national defense force formed in the 1950s largely in response to china s growing military might including the acquisition of its first aircraft carrier last year japan has been buying amphibious landing craft and beefing up training for potential conflicts in or around small islands japan also is repositioning its troops to better monitor and defend its southern borders and sea lanes in september a small group of japanese soldiers practiced bombing maneuvers and joint command training with u s marines and sailors in guam the san diego exercise marks the first time the country s troops will travel aboard warships so far from home and members of japanese air sea and ground forces will train together with the u s military said cmdr takashi inoue spokesman for the japanese self defense force the drill which ends june 28 will train japanese troops on truly necessary skills to help them deploy swiftly whether to defend territory or provide disaster relief cmdr inoue said with limited landing craft japan needed help from u s marines to rescue people along its tsunami devastated coast following the 2011 earthquake japan is sending three warships about 1 000 service members and about four combat helicopters to the so called dawn blitz exercise cmdr inoue said forces from new zealand and canada also will take part the troops will practice an amphibious assault on san clemente island a naval training ground off san diego s coast and also conduct a mock beach invasion at marine corps base camp pendleton tokyo s move to boost its amphibious training is hugely significant since the united states is obligated to defend
