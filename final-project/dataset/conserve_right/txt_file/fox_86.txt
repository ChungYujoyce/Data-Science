hello again from fox news in washington president trump has put the brakes on his plan to begin imposing tariffs tomorrow on all goods from mexico in return mexico says it will take in strong to reduce the flow of migrants from central america across the u s southern border the agreement staving off an economic and diplomatic crisis with this country aposs largest trading partner at least for now in a moment we aposll speak with the acting homeland security secretary kevin mcaleenan but first we aposll begin with david spunt who has the latest from the north lawn of the white house david david spunt correspondent president trump is back at the white house this morning after spending a week in europe when he got home friday night just a few after arriving her the white house he announced this trade deal that not only stops tariffs but has put significant pressure on mexico to secure its own borders begin videotape spunt president trump greeting supporters on the south lawn late friday afternoon just three hours later he made the official announcement tweeting the tariffs scheduled to be implement it by the u s on monday against mexico are hereby indefinitely suspended the specifics include mexico deploying 6 000 trips to its southern border with guatemala migrants waiting in mexico for the asylum process to play out mexico offering migrants jobs health care and education and taking action against human smuggling and trafficking operations saturday afternoon mexico aposs president held a rally in tijuana to celebrate the deal with the united states but not everyone is celebrating senate minority leader chuck schumer sarcastically tweeting now that the problem is solved i aposm sure we won apost be hearing anymore about in the future treasury secretary steve mnuchin told reporters saturday the administration could still impose tariffs if mexico doesn apost live up to its end of the deal but even the president aposs close allies in the senate have no interest in another tariffs fight with mexico sen joni ernst r ia i would probably push back depending on the circumstances again mexico is typically a very very good trade partner i do support the president aposs efforts with tariffs against china end videotape spunt mnuchin and his team are in japan right now ahead of the g20 summit at the end of the month president trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping the president of china expected to talk about those chinese tariffs when they meet they meet face to face in just a few weeks bret baier david spunt reporting from the white house david thank you joining me now the acting secretary of homeland security kevin mcaleenan welcome to fox news sunday kevin mcaleenan acting secretary of homeland security good to see you bret baier mr secretary we heard the specifics there in david aposs piece but how much of this is new mcaleenan all of it is new i mean we aposve heard commitments before from mexico to do more on their southern border the last time they deployed down there is about four or 500 officers this is more than a tenfold commitment to increase their security in chiapas that aposs where people are entering from guatemala and southern mexico baier your predecessor secretary nielsen testified that these things were happening to the house judiciary committee there were talks about moving national guard troops to the southern border with guatemala you aposre saying this is different than that mcaleenan it is very different the president put a charge in his whole dialogue with mexico with the tariff threats brought them to the table the foreign minister of mexico arrived within hours he arrived the next day with real proposals on the table this is the first time we aposve heard anything like this kind of number of law enforcement being deployed in mexico to address migrations not just at the southern border but also on transportation routes to the northern border and in coordinated patrols in key areas around our southwest border baier the president tweeted this morning that any stories that said this was not this was not new as you aposre saying or false but he said there are some important things not mentioned in yesterday aposs press release one in particular mcaleenan yes so the president tweeted out that this tariff has been suspended secretary mnuchin pointed out that there aposs a mechanism to make sure that they do with a promise to do that there aposs an actual result that we see a vast reduction in those numbers and as the state department announced there are going to be further actions further dialogue with mexico in immigration on how to manage the asylum flow in the region which is a small percentage of the total flow this is by and large an economic migrations that we need to stop with enforcement we need to be able to repatriate people successfully baier so is the administration aposs point of view that this tactic worked as far as this threat of tariffs you have the speaker of the house with a release that says threats and temper tantrums are in no way to negotiate foreign policy you aposre saying that this threat worked mcaleenan people can disagree with the tactics mexico came to the table with real proposals we have an agreement that if the implement will be effective baier i want to talk about the specifics a quote from administration customs and border officials as we are bursting at the seams it aposs unsustainable and can apost continue these numbers mcaleenan right baier can you put them in context for people at home mcaleenan so we had two prior surges of families and children of the border 2014 and 2016 at that time president obama called it a humanitarian crisis in the last two months alone we have more than doubled those two full years of crisis so to give you a sense of how many people are crossing the border 144 000 last month when i was in guatemala last week a man came up to me and said we know that bringing a child is a passport for migration to the united states the smugglers are advertising it this flow is not going to stop without coordinated efforts with mexico but also we still need congress to act we still need help both on the fundamental legal loopholes and the framework but also on funding to manage this situation that you heard about from cbp baier but specifically on the asylum what you need congress to change mcaleenan no question we need three specific changes in law one we are not able to detain families through an immigration proceeding we have to release them within 20 days by court order that needs to change families can be held together in an appropriate setting for a fair and transparent hearing and then they can be repatriated if they don apost have an asylum claim that aposs one two we want to be able to repatriate unaccompanied children just like we do in mexico and canada even if they aposre from central america or further away but also offer children a safe way to apply for asylum in the country that aposs a balance policy that we aposd like to implement and three we need to change the asylum standard so that that front bar that where we sign credible fear is not so automatic so that 89 percent of people get that while only 10 percent get asylum at the end of the court proceeding we need to align that more closely with what it might actually be a successful claim baier last year the administration separated more than 2 500 children from parents as part of this policy to prosecute anyone crossing into the united states illegally mcaleenan right baier how many separations are there now mcaleenan so now both on the president aposs executive order from june 20th last year and court order separations occur when there are any interests of the safety of the child a serious criminal prosecution unrelated to the unlawful crossing communicable disease and emergency situation where we have to bring the child or parent to the hospital these are the kind of circumstances we are seeing and very sadly and very tragically situations where there is abuse and were a child aposs safety is threatened by the adult they are traveling with baier so the inspector general found that there aposs dangerous overcrowding and unsanitary conditions at processing facilities along the border is that still the case mcaleenan that aposs absolutely the case i testify to that in december of last year and since then we aposve have more than doubled the number of crossings went down march 27th and said we have a crisis that we are at the breaking point at the border we don apost have room for the people arriving we asked congress five and a half weeks ago for supplemental funding to manage this overcrowding concern and get health and human services the money they need to take on unaccompanied children expeditiously we have seen no action on those requests baier you are the acting homeland security secretary how much time you spend on this as opposed to homeland security overall mcaleenan yes so dhs is a multi mission department and we aposve got to stay on our toes preparing for hurricane season i was with the vice president in oklahoma looking at the disaster and fema aposs response on tuesday from the flooding we have to do it all we had a big election security set of briefings on friday and we aposre going to maintain momentum there but this is a crisis and a crisis means that management time and leadership effort has to be focused on that we aposre getting good support from across the cabinet and obviously the president of the united states is dialed in and focused on this issue every single day and trying to make sure that we can secure that border and change this dynamic baier you mentioned elections is that moving forward do you feel comfortable that come election time that the u s is going to be secure mcaleenan i think we aposve got a great strategy working with all 50 states trying to get to all 8 800 jurisdictions that oversee elections at a local level this is just like a fema style management structure the federal government supports states and governments that administer this and we got great tools to help them prepare to make sure the systems are ready to make sure there aposs been no intrusions and to help educate on new threats and new emerging challenges in cyber world baier mr secretary we appreciate your time mcaleenan thank you good to see you baier well joining me here now wisconsin senator ron johnson he aposs the chair of the homeland security committee senator there aposs a lot of pushback about this tactic of using tariffs specifically tariffs against a trading partner like mexico here is the president talking about republican senators pushing back begin video clip donald trump president a lot of people senators included they have no idea what they aposre talking about when it comes to tariffs they have no absolutely no idea when you have the money when you have the product you have the thing that everybody wants you aposre in a position to do very well with tariffs and that aposs where we are we aposre the piggybank united states is the piggybank it has all the money that others want to take from us but they aposre not taking it so easy anymore it aposs a lot different end video clip baier so what was the behind the scenes sen ron johnson r wis i think just in general republicans understand that tariffs are attacks on american consumers and we don apost want to see them in place long term nor do i believe president trump does either he aposs using tariffs as leverage in trade negotiations and i think he used them as leverage in the situation brilliantly quite honestly i know for my part after those news reports were published last week i call the mexican ambassador and said regardless of what you read in the press understand if the president imposes tariffs and he aposs been serious about this there are not votes to override so take that threat very seriously you know you have to do more this is an uncontrolled situation of the board i think the acting secretary is doing excellent job i agree with everything he said an interview but this is completely out of control we aposve had groups of the thousand migrants just in el paso sector alone i was in mcallen texas their biggest day is 2 400 and brett one thing that aposs not being talked about enough is the involuntary servitude associated with this the human trafficking it aposs out of control when we were down at the border just last week 25 to 33 percent of these families are fraudulent families it aposs an adult using a child sometimes these are prearranged but there was one little 3 year old boy we were told about abandoned in a hot texas field that aposs a dimension that really we are talking about enough in terms of this problem baier you see the specifics in this deal do you think it is new i mean it had been talked about from secretary nielsen for quite some time specific thing crosstalk johnson sure i mean mexico has always talked about beefing up enforcement on the southern border but they haven apost done it the numbers we are talking about 6 000 national guard troops would be significant opening up the migrant protection protocol to more individuals right now they aposve only taken a little more than 8 000 of people waiting for asylum in mexico but again what we need to do is we need to change our laws so that we can rapidly and more accurately determine those individuals that clearly don apost have a valid asylum claim and safely return them to the home country there has to be a consequence we can apost let this go uncontrolled the way it is baier the toll the president uses now with these tariffs is having an effect if you look at the washington post hiring slowed sharply in may as companies industries hardest hit by the president aposs trade wars basically manufacturing and construction sought anemic job growth in may and they point directly to this tool are you concerned about that johnson i am concerned businesses both farmers and manufacturers in wisconsin that are definitely feeling the short term pain here but what aposs interesting bret is when i talk to these individuals feeling that short term pain their last comments and almost always is but i support what the president is trying do we have not been treated fairly by our trading partners whether it aposs europe whether it aposs mexico whether it aposs china of course china is the main abuser here so we the president had to get their attention but i think the president also realizes that the clock is running out we need to conclude these deals because some of those damage will be long term you might see manufacturing start moving overseas to for example supply their customers overseas of many manufacturing business so we got to conclude these trade dealers so we can bring certainty back to the economy that the president provided by stop adding to the regulatory burden and more competitive tax system baier it seems the pushback for the mexico potential tariffs was much more than it had been for china and holding the line against china when it comes to china and huawei in particular is that a national security issue in your mind or a trade issue johnson it aposs both their involvement there in telecommunications represents a massive security issue for all of our allies as well the united states plus when you take a look at what china has done economically because of their economic industrial policies they grossly massively increased capacity in the steel industry and put a lot of pressure on steel industries throughout the world their made in china 2025 initiative will target 10 of their industries that way will they also bankrupt those 10 industries as well so no china is aggressively using their industrial policy it aposs causing a great deal of harm economically throughout the world and china has to recognize that they have to follow the world trade organization rules they have to stop stealing our intellectual property by cyber theft through espionage and through forced technology transfers they are the main abusers of the system i aposd rather have a united world demanding that china abide by the rules but at the same time we do need to make sure other trading partners treat us fairly and with real reciprocal treatment baier if these tariffs had gone forward the deal not struck on friday night with mexico will gop senators ready to stand up against the president johnson well again we indicated that we do not want tariffs long term with mexico they are a valued trading partner it could have increased the cost to our economy 70 5 billion at 5 percent to 87 5 all the way up to 25 percent so again i believe tariffs are a tax on consumers baier no i aposm asking about the caucus johnson no baier was the gop caucus ready to say crosstalk johnson listen i think the caucus definitely supports the president and his use of tariffs as leverage to get our trading partners to treat us fairly with reciprocal treatment and i think they also supported him in this case this is out of control you aposve seen the chart i aposve shown 400 000 individuals as families or unaccompanied children have already come in for the first eight months of this year if we continue at may aposs pace it will be 800 000 and acting secretary was saying baier eight hundred thousand people johnson eight hundred thousand people in 2014 when president obama did declare the humanitarian crisis it was 120 000 so this is out of control it aposs growing exponentially and that aposs why the president had to act because mexico has not been acting and certainly congress is not we really are calling on democrats work with us this is not a manufactured crisis this is a problem we have to solve and it aposs growing out of control baier senator johnson we appreciate your time johnson thank you baier up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the u s mexico border deal and what it could mean for ongoing trade talks with china commercial break begin video clip trump they are coming up by the millions mexico can stop it they have to stop it otherwise we just won apost be able to do business end video clip baier mexico aposs president on the border saturday celebrating the agreement between the u s and mexico and president trump earlier this week demanding mexico do its part it aposs time now for our sunday group jason riley of the wall street journal neera tanden president and ceo of the center for american progress josh holmes former chief of staff for senator mitch mcconnell and anne gearan white house reporter for the washington post anne let me start with you this deal late friday it was a deadline now there aposs questions about what exactly it means and is it new anne gearan white house reporter the washington post well the president denied this morning that it aposs old that these are things that have already been agreed to some of them not known before now but already agreed to as the new york times reported yesterday what we do know is that none of the things that are part of the package that has been so far released really would fully address the problem the president himself has diagnosed of a huge number of families attempting to cross the border as you discussed with mcaleenan earlier it puts the onus on mexico in a way that the president is claiming is a victory for him but it also clearly was a political setback for the president because he didn apost get everything he wanted baier josh i mean it was a political tight rope with gop senators announcing a pushback before it even happened josh holmes founder cavalry yes you know it aposs interesting i think when you look at the humanitarian crisis on the border which is very real and the border crossing issue which is very real there aposs basically two big obstacles to getting this done first is the mexican government the second is the congressional democrats and i think by choosing tariffs what the president said overwhelmingly is that it aposs easier to deal with the mexicans than it is with the democrats so what we have here you fast forward is real action that is happening on behalf of the mexican people to try and stem this at birth the southern border and the northern border which you know say what you will that is progress baier neera your response to document specifically about democrats because we hear that a lot why aren apost democrats coming to the table with some kind of solution on immigration front neera tanden center for american progress democrats just passed a dream bill they have actually been willing to negotiate on immigration as josh will well remember even a year and a half ago there was the proposal that schumer laid out to deal with immigration he thought he had a deal that actually supported a wall the white house wouldn apost do it so the idea that democrats are negotiating is i think patently false but i think most importantly i think what actually motivated the president to make what seems to be a very weak deal was the job numbers on friday you know his tariffs are ready the existing tariffs with china seem to be producing the weakening in manufacturing and retail and obviously in agriculture and then this idea that the second round of tariffs you saw not just congressional republicans but the chamber of commerce business leaders say this is going to be an economic shock not to mexicans but to americans and i think the president saw the job numbers 75 000 very disappointing and recognized that he had advice and he took a bad deal a deal that really does not have any new enforcement and if you do care but immigration as a top issue then you should do those things that actually work which is actually ensuring that you aposre working with the countries to address the problems instead of cutting funding which the trump administration has done baier short of a comprehensive big deal at has been talked about before dealing with the asylum issue specifically you think democrats are willing to give the president and win on that front tanden i think the issue there have been discussions for years now that more judges to adjudicate these claims other issues like this ted cruz talked more judges to adjudicate these claims there are issues that we can work on in fact more money was put towards securing the border even in the last deal crosstalk baier it sounded like it aposs a big a deal though go ahead jason jason riley the wall street journal it is a big deal and it aposs interesting democrats typically talk about immigration in humanitarian terms and the facts show overwhelmingly that there is a humanitarian crisis down the system was not built to handle children it was meant to handle mainly single men crossing the border illegally and they are overwhelmed the personnel is overwhelmed there aren apost enough detention facilities and so forth but i do think that long term this could be a political win for the president partly because of what you said in other words if you look at trump aposs overall job approval numbers they are in the mid to low 40s but on the economy they are well above 50 percent and have been for some time and to the extent that he avoids tariffs with our largest trading partner he avoids an uncertainty that comes with that and further worsening a tenuous economic situation baier it is already having an effect riley certainly crosstalk tanden we have an existing tariff structure bearing riley but this one exacerbated that problem gearan and the markets were already spooked on thursday and friday at the prospect of additional tariffs on mexico baier is the sense that this is one of the pillars of the president is going to run on immigration being one of them the economy not socialism and maybe abortion gearan yes i mean we haven apost heard as much socialism talk from the president over the last month and he aposs always been saying that he is going to run on economy how could you impeach as anti impeachment argument how could you impeach a president who has the greatest economy ever and so forth it aposs now becoming clear that the two main things he wants to focus on and run on unless the economy goes south are immigration and economic turnaround that he takes credit for baier is not a win is that a winning issue holmes oh absolutely i mean the economy is always a winning issue if it aposs going baier immigration holmes well and i think he aposs made that a cornerstone since he first came down the escalator i mean that aposs his number one issue in terms of how his voters and the broader american public see his candidacy and our presidency and so this is something aposs going to be focused on throughout but you know this is far beyond a political issue as jason said there is a genuine humanitarian crisis of the border right now and there was a request that came up to congress for 3 billion or 4 billion to address that that was supposed to go into a disaster aid bill when democrats asked that that come out now you can ask why that comes out my guess is because they wanted as leverage for the dream act or other things that neera has talked about but none of that addresses this core problem that the administration is trying to get at tanden i think the issue her for the president is now he aposs an incumbent and when he faces reelection he aposs going to have a set of facts if the set of facts are that there are more border crossings now than there were two or three years ago and that his policies so far have not succeeded he argued in fact i will make he argued to the american people his administration argued family separation would be a strategy that succeeds and it has so far not succeeded now he aposs trying to do these things with mexico the strategy that would actually work and did actually have results at the end of the obama administration was dealing with these countries and their problems internally and trying to support actually keeping their economies working where they are baier for the longest time democrats on the hill and elsewhere said this was not a crisis it was in fact manufactured so now there are democrats who can concede it is a crisis tanden as jason said every democrat has recognized that was happening of the border is a crisis lots of democrats have talked it set it a minute ago democrats have been saying is a humanitarian crisis riley out of political expediency democrats are now ignoring the humanitarian crisis tanden they are not lots of democrats have talked about they just have a different strategy crosstalk riley the system the asylum system is being gamed and democrats know it they know that people are showing up other people are showing up on the border with kids because they know they will get into the country and be released tanden ok riley and most of those people released will not show up at their hearing democrats know that is happening tanden that is actually false when you have the family policies right we actually have family policies under obama 80 85 90 percent of people were showing up for their hearings the idea that people just leave is absolutely false that is not accurate and not backed up by the numbers baier but the numbers are increasing every day and there aposs not a solution up on the hill tanden my i think a lot of democrats have a lot of presidential candidates are actually talking about sane immigration policies that actually deal with these problems in the country so you don apost have these migrations we saw some of those policies at the end of the apartment administration what aposs weird is that the president cut funding for this program and has had a punitive policy that is not succeeding and i think this will be a challenge for him as he faces reelection and why is he aposs trying to do these things because he recognizes he promised people that we would stop seeing immigration and we have seen it baier last word holmes yes let me say that i don apost think sanctuary cities or any sort of an mass amnesty is going to be a enough deterrence for the problem that we aposve seen which is basically what we aposre hearing tanden that aposs not the argument that aposs not what they aposre arguing holmes so look there aposs going to have to be some enforcement but more importantly democrats are really going to have to get out the ball and deal with the humanitarian crisis here baier panel we had to take a break here up next the ongoing fallout from the mueller report house democrats prepared to vote on a resolution to hold attorney general william barr and former white house counsel don mcgahn in contempt of congress a key democrat on the house judiciary committee joins us next commercial break baier coming up house speaker nancy pelosi cautions her caucus begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif when you aposre impeaching somebody you want to make sure you have the strongest possible indictment because it aposs not the means to the end that people think end video clip baier we aposll ask a democratic leader about the speaker aposs strategy next commercial break baier democrats in the house are moving closer to suing in federal court to obtain access to the full mueller report testimony from key officials and president trump aposs tax returns joining us now from rhode island congressman david cicilline who serves on the judiciary committee and is a house democratic leader congressman welcome back to fox news sunday congressman david cicilline d r i good morning good morning bret baier i want to start where we left off with the immigration issue this deal with mexico this is john sanders the acting customs and border protection commissioner talking about the issue begin video clip john sanders acting customs and border protection commissioner we are in a full blown emergency and i cannot say this stronger the system is broken this ongoing crisis has placed a tremendous strain on our limited resources and operational effectiveness to address these unprecedented numbers of family units and unaccompanied children up to 60 percent of our agents are being pulled away from law enforcement operations end video clip baier president trump said the other day of democrats in congress were willing to make some changes we could solve this problem your response cicilline well i think look this is a very complicated issue we in fact appropriated significant additional resources in the last appropriations bill we may have to do more we need to be sure that we have enough immigration judges that people can be processed quickly but the problem has been made worse by many of the policies of this administration what the president promised was to fix this problem he aposs made it worse and frankly we need to address the underlying causes for migration that aposs part of the challenge the president proposed and has made deep cuts in the countries in central america that are the causes of this migration that will only make the problem worse so we need to work together in a bipartisan way to respond to this challenge but some of these policies of this administration have actually made the problem significantly worse baier but quickly on this issue of asylum is a possible that democrats could get around some change to the asylum law cicilline well look we should recognize asylum is the crown jewel of our immigration system america has always been a place that welcomes people were fleeing violence and war and famine and unspeakable conditions and we have a system to adjudicate those claims we ought to honor that system they reflect our values as a country but we ought to make sure that it aposs being done expeditiously and that people are not gaming the system of course baier right cicilline but that we need comprehensive of immigration reform we need to devote more resources to it but we need a president who understands the complexity of the problem and stops using this issue as a political prop to advance a political agenda baier obviously they argue that you aposre using it the other way let aposs move on to these investigations house speaker nancy pelosi quoted by politico as saying to democratic caucus members that she wants to see president trump in prison i don apost want to see him impeached i want to see him in prison number one did she say that number two do you agree with her cicilline well first of all i was not in that meeting i know it aposs been reported but let aposs remember this we have reviewed the mueller report the president of the united states directed don mcgahn to fire the special counsel and then to prepare false documents to deny that he was told to do that he directed an outside person cory lewandowski to direct the attorney general to limit the special counsel aposs investigation and a number of other instances of obstruction of justice that are detailed in this report these are specific things the president did that aposs the purpose of our hearing monday these are criminal acts obstruction of justice clearly impeachable offenses and so you know it aposs kind of rich to hear the president complain about this when he began a campaign with lock her up as his bumper sticker and you know led an effort to delegitimize the first african american president by claiming he wasn apost born in this country baier so you agree with speaker pelosi cicilline look look i don apost have any difficulty with those words i think what we aposre really what is really at stake here is the responsibility of the judiciary committee to conduct oversight to demonstrate to the american people that no one is above the law baier well here aposs cicilline including the president of the united states we aposre going to get to the truth and we aposre going to demonstrate that this president must be accountable for his own conduct baier here aposs the problem the first line of that sentence i don apost want to see him impeached whereas many of the members you aposre talking about now up to 59 members who have said publicly they would like to see the president impeached the speaker is not one of them so is jerry nadler trying to pressure speaker pelosi to start impeachment cicilline bret i i think there aposs two things to really there aposs unanimous consent within the democratic caucus on two issues number one that we have to continue to move forward on the agenda for the american people we aposve passed 250 pieces of legislation that range in everything from legislation to drive down the cost of prescription drugs to protect protection for pre existing conditions to tax relief for gold star families to child care access for vets to restoring net neutrality a really robust agenda to raise family incomes we aposve begun work on an infrastructure bill we aposve got to deliver on those things there aposs also complete agreement in the democratic caucus that this president must be held accountable that no one is above the law that we have a responsibility to conduct oversight to follow the facts where they lead and we aposre not going to let the president baier but there aposs not agreement on impeachment cicilline no we aposre not going to let the president engage in a cover up and prevent the american people from learning the truth now there is some discussion about what aposs the best vehicle to do it is it through our normal oversight proceedings or is it through the opening of an impeachment inquiry that aposs really a process question but what we really want the american people to know is that the president of the united states directed individuals to create false documents to give to lie to investigators to try to prevent this investigation from going forward those are very specific acts which baier even though it the attorney general came to his conclusion after the mueller report and it was his decision to make according to the the rules of the special counsel cicilline no actually it wasn apost his decision to make the special counsel says very clearly this is the responsibility of congress we certainly know that william barr audition for this job by completing a memorandum of law that suggested the president could never be charged with obstruction of justice a very expensive view the president hires him when he hears that wonderful view and he delivers on that promise when in a very short time he mischaracterizes the special counsel aposs report in fact so much so baier right because he says there was no underlying crime and that aposs that aposs where the argument is cicilline right in fact so much so right right in fact so much so that that the special counsel saw the need to write a letter and then ultimately have a press conference to set the record straight and that aposs what aposs going to happen on monday the american people are going to begin to see the real story and understand the conduct of this president baier well congressman there is also a political question here if you look at there are 41 house democrats who hold seats currently in districts where president trump won republicans specifically are targeting 13 democratic districts that went for president trump by at least six points those are the ones in the yellow on the screen the politics of this for those folks impeachment does not play in those districts at least when you ask them and you get them on the record cicilline bret i think that aposs the the wrong question look the speaker has said and i agree with her completely we should never proceed with impeachment for political reasons we should never refuse to proceed with impeachment for political reasons this is about defending the constitution and the rule of law it aposs not just about this president it aposs about future presidents and how they will regard their responsibilities in office the american people expect us to hold this president accountable to follow the facts wherever they lead us and the impeachment question will be decided by the facts and what those facts require it should not and cannot be a political consideration baier congressman i want to ask you about another issue and that is anti trust cicilline sure baier you aposre going forward with these hearings about facebook and google why are you setting up this investigation for services that that essentially are free and most people most people like cicilline well it aposs important to recognize this is a broad investigation of the digital marketplace the dominance of large technology platforms you know for example google controls 94 percent of searches on mobile phones facebook has 2 7 billion users the largest social network in the world these are monopolies and one of the things that i think we aposre very concerned about is the impact on consumers it you say they aposre free the truth is the data that aposs collected and there attention is then used to generate revenue so it aposs not really free there have been significant reductions in privacy there have been very you know substantial evidence of misuse of data of extinguishing rivals and engaging in anticompetitive conduct there aposs reducing innovation reducing entrepreneurship so there are real challenges in this marketplace baier yes cicilline it aposs not working well and this is an opportunity to really study it to understand how do we bring more competition into this space to protect workers and consumers and be sure that we have access to the best products and that new people can enter the market so i think you know we aposve seen some examples of the excesses of this consolidation competition is important anti trust applies even when services are free and want competition baier i guess the question the question congressman is is is how do you define success here with this effort and how does it differ from the fdc or the doj and their anti trust efforts cicilline so it aposs quite different in that it aposs not a prosecution this is an investigation to collect the best data the best information so we can make informed public policy judgments and draft legislation that will respond to the challenges and so we aposre going to hear from the best technologists in the country who have been studying this issue and thinking about it we aposll have the opportunity to depose witnesses and do witness interviews and do roundtables and do hearings to bring in the kind of the best thinking about how do we address this challenge we know the problems they aposre easy to diagnose shaping the solutions is going to be more difficult so this investigation will all ow us baier and potentially regulation cicilline oh absolutely potential regulation certainly legislation we want to make sure we get it right i don apost have any preconceived ideas about what the right answer is but we want to be sure that we aposre using the best information the best data and that we really understand how these markets are failing baier yes congressman cicilline we appreciate your time cicilline thanks for having me baier we aposll be monitoring the action on the hill this week coming up speaker nancy pelosi resists the growing calls of impeachment by democrats as president trump latches on to a report she wants to see him behind bars we just discussed that what does the war of words really mean for the continuing gridlock in washington the sunday panel is back next commercial break begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif we know exactly what path we aposre on we know exactly what actions we need to take donald trump president she aposs incapable of doing deals she aposs a nasty vindictive horrible person end video clip baier house speaker nancy pelosi holding the line against impeachment while president trump responds to that report that pelosi wants to see him in prison now we aposre back with our panel all right jason thoughts on all of this jason riley the wall street journal this is impeachment life nancy pelosi aposs dilemma is that most americans oppose impeachment in fact most of her caucus currently is not a board for impeachment impeachment is about as popular in the democratic caucus as mexican tariffs are in the republican caucus right now and it aposs not going anywhere since the republicans control the senate so what she aposs looking for are ways to let her progressives vent and so these these hearings that are being held in these contempt threats and so forth are just ways for her members to be able to let off a little steam about this without actually pulling the trigger with formal impeachment hearings because they remain so unpopular baier here aposs representative emanuel cleaver begin video clip emanuel cleaver d mo i don apost think it aposs right if somebody is shouting lock her up i don apost think it aposs right that if we aposre talking about lock him up i think i think the leak the speaker was in a private meeting where information was leaked i don apost i don apost think she would say that publicly the president ought to ought to have a little appreciation for nancy pelosi because she aposs the only thing standing in the way of a full scale move toward impeachment end video clip baier neera you think that full scale move is going to happen neera tanden center for american progress i don apost know i think actually what nancy pelosi is doing is the proper role of oversight of the administration and i think democrats went in high numbers to the polls and not just democrats moderates the house majority was built on in part on dealing with account some level of accountability not necessarily impeachment but accountability of this administration and i think that what aposs odd about the situation we aposre in is actually support for impeachment is growing it aposs at 41 percent according to some polls it aposs not a majority but really importantly a majority of americans seem to believe the president acted criminally sixty percent believe he obstructed justice and that was before mueller testified so i think the the democratic plan to go forward is to do what they promised the american people they would do which is hold the president accountable actually try to get to an airing of the mueller report and see if they see if they determine more illegal activity baier so the first line i don apost want to see him impeached but i do want to see him in prison tanden i mean i don apost know the actual quotes but i think the oddity of the of the president who chanted lock her up for years it aposs a little weird for republicans to take umbrage at the rhetoric baier josh josh holmes founder cavalry look i think suggesting the president of the united states be thrown in prison probably breaches the confines of oversight as we aposve typically defined it in the house of representatives but look i i think nancy pelosi is in a tough situation here she reminded me sort of like a a zookeeper trying to keep the lion at bay she aposs throwing little pieces of meat trying to keep him back in his cage the impeachment lion is is not going anywhere unfortunately she has to keep escalating her rhetoric time after time to get people i don apost know essentially distracted from what they really want to do which is impeach the president and i think she aposs absolutely right that it is a political disaster for the democrats every poll would suggest that i don apost have not seen any suggestion that the american people are coming around on the issue of impeachment it is wrong tanden and it aposs moved up in the polls from 35 to 40 42 holmes it has long been impeachment has long been seen as the ultimate of of extreme moves in congress republicans have had this bite them on their end now democrats are seeing it turn around baier anne anne gearan the washington post but but josh what she aposs doing is actually more complicated than that because there there are at least three distinct camps among house democrats those who want to go for it you know hell for leather those who see it as a as she apparently does as a political loser and and those in the middle and she aposs actually trying to manage all three of those equities at once which is an extraordinarily difficult thing to do and one way she aposs trying to do that is as you say throw bits of of meat to the lion but she also has to keep the everybody else on the same train and yes have as many investigative hearings as they can schedule there are two big ones coming up this week either of which could lead lay the groundwork for for mueller aposs testimony and which obviously you know touch on impeachment related activities without fully going there tanden and i think baier jason it aposs a little tougher to explain to the american people the obstruction part that clearly mueller leaves to congress when the underlying part of the conspiracy working with russia there were no indictments that came from that so it aposs a tough thing to explain why they aposre going down this road isn apost it tanden ah baier i mean i aposm asking jason tanden yes go ahead riley i think it aposs impossible to reconcile not just tough you know what was obstructed and this is you know this is prosecutorial discretion what is you know it matters what your motives are and it someone who who knows they aposre innocent and and and says something misleading to a prosecutor is different from someone who knows they aposre guilty and says something misleading to a prosecutor tanden i think riley or is later found to be guilty of the underlying crime tanden the thousand possible riley so i think it aposs it aposs it aposs prosecutors discretion the mueller report exercised discretion and and here we are and democrats won apost except that result any more than they seem to tanden i mean riley seemingly won apost accept the results of the 2016 election tanden we we we aposd like to act like nothing has happened here mueller testified basically went to the cameras to say that the president was not exonerated on obstruction of justice why did he do that because the attorney general wrote a misleading memo which is saying essentially what you said and it is actually false because in this situation just to remind everybody the actual law is that you can obstruct justice if you aposre trying to cover up and the president of the united states and his campaign team had nine 11 12 indictments that is that is incentive enough for a cover up baier josh holmes none of which had anything to do with the underlying investigation i might add right all of the indictment tanden that aposs not true flynn flynn had some what do you how are you saying this flynn had something to do with the underlying investigation manafort did baier no but they didn apost find indictments on the conspiracy with russia tanden yes they found indictments on inaudible of a range of illegal inaudible riley why why is the standard why is the standard exoneration on one side and and simply finding evidence of wrongdoing on the other holmes well you aposre asking a career prosecutor right to switch the standard of justice not to find whether or not there is reason to prosecute but to actually exonerate that aposs not just not not what they do tanden that aposs not my language that aposs the president aposs language he said he was exonerated i aposm just saying what he said and it aposs false baier all right well we will see where the house goes there will be hearings and we will cover it all tanden excellent baier panel thank you very much up next a look back at some of the most poignant moments of this past week as world leaders gathered to mark the 75th anniversary of d day commercial break baier finally today the president is back from his five day state visit to the u k ireland and france where he met with world leaders weighed in on brexit and marked 75 years since d day begin videotape theresa may british prime minister the president suggested that i sued the european union which we didn apost do we went into negotiations and we came out with a good deal trump i would have sued and settled maybe but you never know she aposs probably a better negotiator than i am queen elizabeth seventy five years ago hundreds of thousands of young soldiers sailors and airmen left these shores in the cause of freedom trump this was something that was we read about it
