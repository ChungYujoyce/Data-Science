what does hillary clinton really believe does she have strong beliefs about anything a new raft of emails from the clinton camp give us reason to doubt the documents show the clinton advisors carefully and meticulously messaging the clinton position on a wide range of issues on everything from the keystone pipeline to the trans pacific partnership agreement tppa as they emailed back and forth the advisors carefully weighed the costs and benefits in terms of votes campaign contributions and favorable or unfavorable publicity of nuanced positions on a great many issues clinton has changed her positon including gay marriage the tppa and the pipeline over the nine year period covered by the emails the clinton advisors anguish over how to position theses changes without appearing to be cynically chasing votes or giving the appearance of putting a finger to the wind but there appears to be no email exchange where anyone discusses what clinton actually believes about any issue at all as the new york times reported the private discussions among her advisers about policy on trade on the black lives matter movement on wall street regulation often revolved around the political advantages and pitfalls of different positions while there was little or no discussion about what mrs clinton actually believed mrs clinton s team at times seemed consumed with positioning and optics here is something readers need to know about voting if you want to maximize your vote total a poor way of doing it is to choose the position that most voters favor on every issue it really doesn t matter very much what a particular voter thinks about a wide range of issues what matters is what he thinks about the one or two issues that determine how he votes these are called vote determining issues take partial birth abortion or what is similar the practice of killing a fetus just moments before it is to be delivered as a health living baby most voters are against these practices but for most this is not a vote determining issue it is vote determining for some people however given an opponent who opposes almost all abortion you might think that clinton s best strategy is to move to the moderate middle ground but if she did that she would lose support from women who want no restrictions whatsoever so no matter what her opponent s position hillary is forced to take an extreme position one that almost no one agrees with other than radical feminists a similar result holds for many other issues a nuanced middle of the road approach to black lives matter probably wouldn t move a single vote among the people for whom this is a vote determining issue you either back the blue as donald trump does or you sympathize with the victims as hillary does or you get no additional votes at all ditto for the pacific trade agreement hillary would actually lose votes if she called for a better agreement to check mate trump she has to oppose what she once called the gold standard of trade agreements in its entirety kimberley strassel sums up the bottom line of all this in the wall street journal mrs clinton has been exposed to have no core to be someone who constantly changes her position to maximize political gain leaked speeches prove that she has two positions public and private on banks two positions on the wealthy two positions on borders two positions on energy her team had endless discussions about what positions she should adopt to appease the red army i e the base of the democratic party most disappoint of all is clinton s approach to education another area where her position has been shifting through time once a supporter of charter schools her stance has been inching ever closer to the teacher union view of the world as the campaign season has progressed a stanford university study found that charter schools significantly improve the performance of children in urban areas and this is especially true for black hispanic low income and special needs students in math and in reading even the very liberal new york times editorial page endorses charter schools yet i have seen no mention of how charter schools benefit students in clinton emails so far oh but of course the kids don t get to vote alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
