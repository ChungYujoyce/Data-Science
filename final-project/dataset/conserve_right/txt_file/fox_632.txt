could yet play an outsized role on the european stage whisper it softly but despite everything spain may be back then there is the rolling drama in catalonia which has intensified over the past decade an unconstitutional independence referendum held in 2017 fuelled nationalist sentiment in the rest of spain which was then opportunistically exploited by the pp ciudadanos and vox when nine of its organisers were sentenced to jail sentences last october protesters clashed violently with the police the psoe and podemos both take a relatively conciliatory position s nchez was willing to offer secessionists further talks and the prospect of de escalation possibly involving greater devolution as the price for their support but the deal is fragile and does not resolve the secessionists underlying demand for a referendum to which s nchez the self declared guardian of spain s constitutional order cannot accede it could easily break down s nchez s biggest friend in the coming months is the question what alternative his ramshackle coalition and its band of wavering sometime allies in parliament may be imperfect the portuguese government s moniker of geringon a or contraption seems apt here too but with no parliamentary majority for the right and no prospect of a left right grand coalition the only alternative is yet another election possible further gains for the right and perhaps a government reliant on vox for the time being that spectre should be enough to keep the show on the road the new government s first tests will be whether it can pass a budget and stabilise the catalan issue if s nchez manages to hold his contraption together on the domestic front the result will be significant for europe not just because spain is the continent s only large country with a wholly left wing government italy s centre left democrats are in coalition with the populist and sometimes quasi rightish five star movement but also because spain can play a major role at a
