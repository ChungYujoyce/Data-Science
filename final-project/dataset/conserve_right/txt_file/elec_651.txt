las vegas the first democratic presidential debate is in the books and for the first time frontrunner hillary clinton took on her up and coming main challenger sen bernie sanders i vt going in the odds were on which of clinton s challengers might attack the frontrunner but it was clinton who mixed it up accusing sanders as being weak on gun control senator sanders did vote five times against the brady bill since it was passed more than 2 million prohibited purchases have been prevented clinton said what i can tell secretary clinton is that all the shouting in the world is not going to do what i would hope all of us want and that is keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have those guns and end this horrible violence that we are seeing sanders rebutted and it wasn t only the participants who put clinton put on the spot just for the record are you a progressive or are you a moderate cnn moderator anderson cooper probed i m a progressive but i m a progressive who likes to get things done clinton retorted she also faced questions about reversing positions on issues like the recent trade agreement do you change your political identity based on who you re talking to cooper asked no i think that like most people that i know i have a range of views but they are rooted in my values and my experience clinton replied as for the big controversy regarding the private email server she used as secretary of state it not only wasn t an issue in this debate it actually gave clinton one of her best moments as sanders came to her defense well i ve taken responsibility for it i did say it was a mistake clinton explained let me say something that may not be great politics but i think the secretary is right and that is that the american people are sick and tired of hearing about your damn emails sanders exclaimed that friendliness came to an end when the conversation turned to the vermont senator s self described socialist views how can any kind of socialist win a general election in the united states cooper asked what democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top one tenth of 1 percent in this country own almost 90 percent almost own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent sanders explained then sanders started praising socialist type programs in europe i think we should look to countries like denmark like sweden and norway and learn from what they have accomplished for their working people sanders continued but clinton viewed the matter differently i think what senator sanders is saying certainly makes sense in the terms of the inequality that we have but we are not denmark i love denmark we are the united states of america she argued that exchange led to sanders accusing clinton of being too cozy with wall street and big banks secretary clinton you do not congress does not regulate wall street wall street regulates congress sanders said he and clinton also seemed to differ on how nsa whistleblower edward snowden should be viewed after giving away american secrets he broke the laws of the united states clinton said sanders differed saying i think snowden played a very important role in educating the american people to the degree in which our civil liberties and our constitutional rights are being undermined the other players on stage like former virginia sen jim webb and former rhode island gov lincoln chafee really couldn t break through though former maryland gov martin o malley took a dig at clinton s call for a no fly zone right now in syria i believe that a no fly zone in syria at this time actually secretary would be a mistake you have to enforce no fly zones and i believe especially with the russian air force in the air it could lead to an escalation because of an accident that we would deeply regret o malley said as democrats move forward in the nomination process you could compare clinton s campaign to the hoover dam the famous landmark controls flooding for clinton she not only has to contend with some incoming water from sanders but the floodgates may open even wider if vice president joe biden gets into the presidential race that would raise this contest to a whole other level submitted by escamp on august 31 2015 3 04pm stay informed with the latest from cbn news delivered to your inbox
