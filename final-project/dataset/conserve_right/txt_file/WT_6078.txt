apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new york ap actress olivia cheng was recently volunteering in vancouver when she says she witnessed a man drive up to an elderly chinese woman roll down his window and yell this is your fault before throwing trash at her the incident enraged cheng and also served as another reason why she feels it s so important for celebrities of asian descent to use their voices and speak up against anti asian attacks which authorities say are increasing during the coronavirus pandemic i don t think we can pretend that this isn t happening cheng who stars in the stand on cbs all access said in a recent interview with the associated press for now it would not be unwise to be a little more careful to maybe have buddy systems when possible to go get your groceries if you re not feeling safe top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump

ma au and others washing their hands and reminding people that hygiene not xenophobia is the way to help combat the virus if i can start the conversation why not said au who was also born in hong kong if we don t talk about it then it s not going to be talked about at all for cheng the recent wave of anti asian sentiment brought back painful memories of her childhood growing up in edmonton canada where she was the victim of a bias attack as a teen she went down an internet rabbit hole of attacks posted online i had to stop watching she said it brought up all those feelings again from being a kid and not being able to do anything mai says that it s not only important for asian stars to speak out against these attacks but people of other races as well these are the conversations you need to be having with your kids in your house you need to even if you re not chinese you should be explaining that this is terrible that racism is coming out of this pandemic she said so have that talk with your kid have that talk with your friends if one of your friends says yo this chinese virus is crazy say no actually man it s called covid 19 it s not the chinese virus just check them earlier this month bill maher host of hbo s real time with bill maher defended calling coronavirus the chinese virus comparing it to the spanish flu while people say it s innocuous and that it came from china it s the undertones lee said certain people will grab those undertones and attach to it there s also a worry that anti asian american sentiment could translate to a regression in hollywood after recent success of telling asian stories this year the south korean film parasite won the best picture oscar and chinese american director lulu wang took home the independent spirit award for her film the farewell crazy rich asians was a hit at the box office in 2018 and last year sandra oh became the first asian woman in 39 years to win the best leading tv actress golden globe for killing eve i worry is this going to impact our chances so soon after it feels like we finally made inroads cheng said is this going to regress us and put us however many steps back ma says the only way to proceed is to keep putting out diverse stories there s no relenting we ll keep moving forward and hopefully one day people are going to say you know what i not only accept the differences but i also accept the fact that we re very much alike this story has been corrected to show the name of bill
