tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap during the early days of the russia investigation fbi officials debated whether donald trump s chance of winning should factor into how aggressively they investigated potential coordination between his campaign and the kremlin two fbi officials told congress last year according to newly released transcripts of their interviews peter strzok the former fbi agent who helped lead the investigation told lawmakers in a closed door interview that the fbi had received information from an extremely sensitive source alleging collusion between the government of russia and members of the trump campaign fbi officials including then deputy director andrew mccabe debated internally how vigorously to follow up on that information given that democrat hillary clinton was seen at the time as likely to defeat trump and an aggressive investigation had the potential of exposing the source strzok recalled that he disagreed that a candidate s electability should be part of the equation top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick if there are members of the trump campaign who are actively illegally colluding with the government of russia that s something the american people need to know that s something candidate trump potentially needs to know and equally if they aren t guilty of anything that s also important strzok said so my statement there is we can t consider we can t take into consideration the likelihood or unlikelihood of anybody s electoral process we need to go based on the gravity of this allegation go investigate it and get to the bottom of it the comments were made during a closed door interview in june 2018 with members of the house judiciary and oversight committees the top republican on the judiciary panel rep doug collins released a transcript of the interview thursday as part of an ongoing effort to paint the early days of the russia investigation as tainted by law enforcement bias in the past week collins has released transcripts of similar interviews with justice department official bruce ohr and ex fbi lawyer lisa page with whom strzok exchanged anti trump text messages during the 2016 election and investigations into his campaign those text messages have made strzok and page particular targets of outrage from republicans and from trump strzok was removed from special counsel robert mueller s investigative team following the discovery of the texts and was later fired from the fbi page has since left the bureau in a statement thursday strzok attorney aitan goelman said his client welcomed the release of the transcript it is further evidence that contrary to the impression that the president s allies in congress tried to create with their selective and often inaccurate leaks pete at all times discharged his duties honorably patriotically and without regard to his personal political opinions goelman said in the transcript strzok said the debate over how aggressively to investigate the campaign explained the backstory of a cryptic aug 15 2016 text message he sent page that has long attracted republican attention in it he wrote i want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in andy s office that there s no way he gets elected but i m afraid we can t take that risk it s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you re 40 the name andy is a reference to mccabe then the no 2 official at the fbi strzok insisted that he did not have an insurance policy to keep trump from getting elected and noted how neither he nor anyone else at the fbi leaked details of the trump campaign investigation even though such a disclosure would have been harmful to his election efforts he said there was no conspiracy at the fbi to prevent trump from becoming president and said he and page did not secretly scheme to block his path page provided a similar explanation during her own closed door interview saying she had urged caution in the investigation because if trump didn t win there was less of a national security concern and he is saying no we have to you know do what we have to do in order to get to the bottom of this because it is like an insurance policy there is no actual insurance policy he is making an analogy page said it is like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you re 40 associated press writer mary clare jalonick contributed to this report read the page transcript http a
