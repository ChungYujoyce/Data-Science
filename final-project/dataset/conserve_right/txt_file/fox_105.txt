ent trump s attorney joins fox news sunday to discuss the latest developments in robert mueller s investigation this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday may 27 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated bill hemmer fox news i aposm bill hammer in for chris wallace the on again off again summit between president trump and kim jong un will it still happen begin videotape donald trump president of the united states we are looking at june 12th in singapore that hasn apost changed moving along pretty well hemmer we aposll discuss the about face by the president just day after canceling the high stakes singapore summit with two top senators republican roy blunt of missouri and democrat chris coons of delaware then president trump and his legal team call into question the mueller investigation suggesting the fbi improperly spied on his campaign trump if they had spies in my campaign that would be a disgrace to this country that would be one of the biggest insults that anyone has ever seen hemmer the president calls it spygate what impact does this have on an interview with a special counsel we aposll ask one of the president aposs personal lawyers rudy giuliani plus we aposll ask our sunday panel about a new warning for tehran mike pompeo secretary of state to the ayatollah and to the president of iraq rouhani and to other iranian leaders understand that your current activities will be met with steely resolve hemmer all right now on fox news sunday end videotape hemmer and to our viewers and to our veterans on this memorial day weekend welcome to fox news in washington there are fresh signs that the push is on to revive the historic summit between president trump and north korean leader kim jong un since mr trump called off the meeting early thursday morning the sides have apparently been back in contact north korea and south korea held a surprise second meeting on saturday along the dmz and a white house advance team is expected to leave possibly today for singapore just in case also this the president saying last night there is still a chance meeting on june 12th could still happen correspondent kevin corke starts our coverage live from the white house kevin hello kevin corke fox news correspondent bill hello from the north aposs previous release of three american captives to its apparent decommissioning of a nuclear test site the historic talks between the u s and north korea appeared all but certain and then unraveled but perhaps now will happen after all begin videotape corke take you back to wednesday night following u s references to the so called libyan model of denuclearization which in turn led to a letter from the north threatening a possible nuclear showdown with the u s president trump huddled with his national security advisor john bolton it wasn apost long after in fact thursday morning that we all read the president aposs letter canceling the summit adding that the u s aposs nuclear capabilities were massive and that he prayed to god they never have to be used then friday a mere 24 hours later a glimmer of hope as both the president and defense secretary jim mattis seemed to signal optimism the talks could happen after all following conciliatory statements from pyongyang all that just ahead of saturday aposs report that the leaders from the north and the south met and announced that pyongyang aposs commitment to the meeting and full denuclearization remains resolute about which president trump said this last night trump i think there aposs a lot of goodwill i think people want to see if we can get the meeting and get something done if we aposve got that done and if we can be successful in the denuclearization of the korean peninsula that would be a great thing for north korea it would be a great thing for south korea it would be great for japan and great for the world end videotape corke bill advanced teams from washington and pyongyang are set to be heading to the region perhaps as soon as today in advance to that meeting by the way that date is an interesting one june 12th 1987 you may recall president reagan famously told mikhail gorbachev to tear down this wall perhaps we aposll see a repeat of history this june 12th hemmer and we aposll see if it happens thank you kevin kevin corke reporting from the white house today kevin thanks joining me now is one of the president aposs personal lawyers rudy giuliani mr mayor welcome to fox news sunday laughter hemmer i understand you spoke with the president just a few hours ago is he too eager for this moment to happen rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney well sure he is and i think he aposs positioned it brilliantly even his opponents think ph of that i mean he wouldn apost submit to that ridiculous comment about a meeting on the nuclear battlefield he canceled it and now we have kim jong un back where he was before talking about wanting to do it meeting with the leader of south korea so i don apost want to raise expectations but i think the president aposs strategy has played out really brilliantly in the most remarkable thing he can do it with all these interruptions that i have to bring to him and jay sekulow you know this totally rigged investigation hemmer yes but did he express a level of optimism with you and just back to my question is he too eager to make the summit happen giuliani well no i mean somebody who aposs too eager to do it wouldn apost have turned it down wouldn apost have canceled it i mean he aposs playing this like ronald reagan played reykjavik and i think his achievement would be as great or greater when it aposs all finished let aposs hope hemmer ok giuliani and it might take six months reykjavik didn apost happen in a day hemmer right you are right about that and there will be stops and starts along the way and we should be certainly aware of all that but you said the summit needs to be decided before the mueller matter moves forward so let aposs move to the mueller now this weekend you said you would not go forward with mueller until you understand what was happening with an informant with the trump campaign so sir what was this person doing with the campaign giuliani well i mean i don apost know that yet i haven apost been told that i mean it just further reiterates what i aposve come to conclude after two months of being in this and the president obviously knew from very early on which is this is rigged i mean you got 13 democrats you aposve got a focus on things that didn apost happen no russia collusion no obstruction just defending yourself and now we are into the basis of it being illegitimate look at professor calabresi aposs article just a few days ago about his question whether there should even be an investigation because of the fact that they switched over from counterintelligence to criminal and we don apost i want to know did they get in the evidence in that counterintelligence probe i think they didn apost so you know that was casts doubt crosstalk hemmer so you know when you say they you don apost think they did or they did not as you just referred to there do you have that on good information because there were two classified briefings just on thursday this week and i aposm told no documents were shown no one has talked about the briefing there was a short statement that was given by adam schiff and he read it off of a piece of paper so i what can you learn or perhaps now what do you know about this informant giuliani what i know is just what i speculate not anything that has been said to me no one has shared it with me i aposm positive they shared it with the president but probably at this point it aposs better that we don apost know we have to know however before we can recommend to the president whether to be interviewed ph when you look at the backdrop of this rigged investigation when you look at how they treated manafort how they spun off into cohen how they are chasing things in the middle east i mean the reality is we are not going to sit him down if this is a trap for perjury and until we are convinced of that and if they don apost show us these documents well we are just going to have to say no let me emphasize he wants to explain that he did nothing wrong it aposs us the lawyers who have to convince him that this is a trap hemmer so take us inside that meeting with the president what do you tell him what does he ask you what is that interchange then giuliani first of all my job has been to try and negotiate grounds for an interview and we aposve been doing it i mean we have a team now not only with jay but with jane raskin and marty raskin she aposs taken she has taken the load really of doing the negotiating with the mueller people but the reality is that we have all become convinced even though we began with the hope that this would be done in good faith that there aposs too much here now some of it is mueller aposs fault some isn apost the whole thing with this investigation that was going on which we consider spying was done before mueller got involved but it completely taints his investigation hemmer entirely you believe giuliani yes i mean what aposs you aposve got to ask what aposs the basis of the investigation that and how about a leaked comey report that turns out to come from a guy who is one of the biggest liars in the history of washington hemmer well let me get back to comey in a moment james clapper said this about what you are referring to on this informant this week begin video clip james clapper former director of national intelligence no they were not they were spying on a term i don apost particularly like but on what the russians were doing trying to understand were the russians infiltrating trying to gain access trying to gain leverage and influence end video clip hemmer well you call it a spy they call it an informant what aposs wrong with the government crosstalk hemmer what aposs wrong with the government trying to figure out what russia was up to giuliani nothing wrong with the government doing that everything wrong with the government spying on a candidate of the opposition party that aposs a watergate a spygate i mean and without any warning to him and now to compound that to make it into a criminal investigation bill that aposs why this is a rigged investigation that aposs why the president has been right from the beginning way back when the president said there was surveillance of his campaign it turns out he was right it was it was human surveillance rather than technical surveillance but surveillance nonetheless hemmer all right so strategy became clear back to james comey you aposre going to put the credibility of the president up against the credibility of james comey in almost every day this week the president has referred to comey he said this just on wednesday begin video clip donald trump president of the united states the fbi is a fantastic institution but some of the people at the top were rotten apples james comey was one of them i have done a great service for this country by getting rid of him by firing him end video clip hemmer so on that same on that same day james comey tweeted this he said facts matter the fbi aposs use of confidential human sources the actual term is tightly regulated and essential to protecting the country attacks on the fbi and lying about his work will do lasting damage to our country how will republicans explain this to their grandchildren so you are putting james comey on trial and now listening to your talk today you are also putting the government on trial based on that investigation saying it aposs not legitimate i understand where you aposre coming from mr mayor but how does this end giuliani well first of all it isn apost the government it aposs james comey clapper brendan the people took this investigation and turned it on a candidate look you can apost say you aposre spying on the russians if what you aposre trying to do is to show the russians are colluding whatever the hell that means with the trump campaign so the spying turned on the trump campaign when it did that the president should have been briefed if he wasn apost it aposd be an outrage and then at that point the trump campaign should have been briefed and be asked to cooperate not treated like criminals when there was no proof of any collusion now we aposre a year and a half later and there aposs no proof of collusion so stop the investigation stop spending 20 million more hemmer if they do not if they do not do that does the president have to fire someone giuliani the president is not going to fire him because that aposd be the playing into the hands of playing the victim watergate they are the watergate the other people have committed the crimes what we have to do is go to court and seek protection from the court if we have to do that our first thing is we sure as heck are not going to testify unless it aposs all straightened out unless we learned the basis of that russian investigation they are not going to tell us because the basis is going to turn up when expected to trump to be unethical or illegal they aposre going to have to tell us what they have found so far the basis of the investigation russian collusion here aposs what they found zero nada nothing the president gee maybe they should wake up and realize the president is innocent that aposs why he wants to testify and because of them we don apost want him to testify because they aposre not fair they have rigged this investigation against him thirteen democrats angry as heck and some of them there at hillary clinton aposs funeral crosstalk giuliani i mean when she was supposed to have a victory party hemmer we are a long way from an interview aren apost we giuliani well maybe we aposre not a long way from deciding we won apost have one and then they aposre going to have to go on what they have and everybody aposs going to find out there aposs not anything ph hemmer yes but other than the week early in a week you said if the summit matters decided you could sit down in early july and may be part of mueller aposs report comes out early september is that timeline still viable giuliani it is if we could get over what seems to be fairly monumental problems that keep growing not we don apost create them bill they created the problem of this what you want to call it spygate investigation improper investigation of a candidate why does everybody get all upset when they invade the democratic national committee republicans do and now they aposve invaded the trump campaign nobody aposs angry hemmer yes giuliani they aposre not didn apost warn ph them hemmer if you sit for an interview you could walk into a perjury trap if you delay or if you say no based on your description today democrats can use this against republicans in the midterm are you essentially boxed in on that schedule giuliani well could be but i don apost think so i mean here aposs where we are we have to be lawyers the four of us five of us have to act like lawyers and we have to give him legal advice he can make the political judgment look i could put a different hat on and talk about that too his approval rating is the highest it aposs ever been i believe the democrats are going up a wrong alley here republicans did this to clinton and it backfired the reality is the american people have come to the conclusion everybody else has this investigation is rigged it aposs unfair and if they have to choose on impeachment or not the president is going to be making peace with north korea god willing and we should all be rooting for that they are not probably but we are i don apost see this could really turn on them and they are not going to have their impeachment congress that they want hemmer i have two more questions for you in that time i have left here if you don apost sit for an interview you could face a subpoena and i know you said you aposll challenge that subpoena all the way to the u s supreme court where you believe you will win because you believe you have the votes who is the fifth vote at the supreme court for you today giuliani well i think on the constitutional issue it aposs a close question i think we win it as does ted olson who wrote an article about it in weekly standard i think it was last week however on the olc question mainly do they have the authority to do it we can apost lose i think we get all votes because the justice department defines the authority of the independent counsel he doesn apost have his own authority the justice department says cannot issue criminal process to a sitting president that aposs the law basically all over the world for a head of state i can apost see how we lose that bill i mean maybe in the ninth circuit not in a fair court hemmer i pick one of your comments during the week and you said he aposs more likely to sit with chairman kim then he is with bob mueller laughter hemmer listening you talk crosstalk hemmer you described that as korean perjury i mean just listening to i don apost believe this interview will ever happen am i wrong sir giuliani no if they can satisfy us it could happen he wants to do it so far since i aposve been in this all i see are obstacles that they are putting in the way starting with cohen i mean what aposs that all about and then going off about something about the middle east which turned out to be a software that was turned down by the campaign i mean and now the spygate wow we got to get and i don apost think they aposre going to want to tell us about it because it aposs so damn embarrassing hemmer last question giuliani i want to emphasize one more time hemmer yes giuliani not to the fbi leadership at the time hemmer yes last question do you think you aposd give instruction to his defense since you came on board giuliani pardon me hemmer do you have giuliani i do i think i did i think i took over a good situation i think ty and john dowd had really done a good job they got out of the way all the disclosure of documents and now we can sit in a position and say you don apost need them also a way to resist the subpoena and i think they had they have pretty much defined the fact that this interview had to be on our terms or we can apost do it so i think maybe i gave it more structure i kind of have knowledge of him probably better than they do i mean he and i are very good friends for 30 years hemmer yes very interesting giuliani and i worked very heavily on his campaign so i know i know this great desire he has to testify but i also know this is an intelligent man who aposs got a lot of other things to do and i can apost stand it as this interview is over late today i will wait for them to call me i can apost interrupt what aposs going on with i can apost interrupt a briefing with bolton and pompeo this is not important enough hemmer mayor giuliani thank you for your time thanks for spending part of your memorial weekend with us giuliani thank you hemmer thanks up next two key senators react to the uncertainty of whether or not the singapore summit will or will not happen commercial break hemmer this week president trump canceled a long awaited summit with kim jong un but hopes are still high that the two will meet in a moment we aposll talk about that with senator chris coons a democrat from delaware but first in studio with me here in washington missouri republican senator roy blunt on the senate intelligence committee and senator blunt welcome back to fox news sunday sen roy blunt r mo senate intelligence committee good to be with you bill hemmer you were just listening to rudy giuliani what did you hear in there that you think is important senator blunt well you know i did hear rudy giuliani mention again that the president is not going to do going to try to stop the mueller investigation he aposd just like to have a come to a conclusion and i think that aposs pretty much where i am and the whole country is right now let aposs get the facts let aposs get this done find out what there was to find out and move on and i heard him once again say that just like i aposve said i don apost think we should make it impossible for the president to fire mueller by congressional action because i don apost think we have the right to do that but i think it would be a foolish thing for the president to do to take that action that he probably has under the constitution hemmer the mayor suggested he aposs not going to fire anyone blunt absolutely hemmer the president refers to this fbi informant matter as spygate should the government have an informant connected with the national campaign blunt i think it would be fine to find out what the russians were doing it would not be fine to find out what the campaign was doing i aposm frankly concerned about a lot of the things we saw happen between the fbi and both campaigns getting involved with the clinton campaign at two different times both of which i thought reached questionable conclusions and then if you actually did have someone trying to find out from the campaign what was going on in the campaign and who they were talking to as opposed to legitimately having reasons to believe that they should be there we aposll see it aposs taking a long time to get this information from the fbi and frankly from the national security team hemmer yes on north korea you said this past week that the north koreans like to pretend to negotiate what was all of this about this past week was that just pretend blunt well who knows you know it aposs right out of the north korean playbook we aposre in the three generations of that playbook now act like you want to negotiate and come up with some outlandish view of what that negotiation means and try to wind up with early benefits to your side and not following through on what you have agreed to do so it aposs not surprising i don apost think what was probably surprising to them was the president aposs agreement initially to meet and then his willingness to say hey if this is the it is not a serious meeting i don apost want to have it i do think some things need to happen here before we meet and hopefully they will hemmer may be the korean leaders meeting yesterday was another one of the surprises in a long list of surprises your colleague democrat bob menendez senate foreign relations committee this came up on thursday with mike pompeo and he said this about the korean summit begin video clip sen bob menendez d nj ranking member senate foreign relations committee the art of diplomacy is a lot harder than the art of the deal the reality is is that it aposs pretty amazing that the administration might be shocked that north korea is acting as north korea might very well normally act end video clip hemmer sometimes i think that sounds like you would describe it is he right about that blunt well i think the quote is not all that surprising that you aposd suggest that somehow the president isn apost reaching out the way he should i think the president has got the north koreans in a place that any other president might not have managed to get done he aposs very willing to reach out in new directions through the south korean president willing to meet with the north korean president but also willing to walk away and i do think some things need to be decided before we have that meeting there needs to be a strong understanding of what both sides what all three sides frankly mean by denuclearization we aposve got the south korean president i believe providing a great benefit in this discussion unless we are not all communicating in the same way you know what does denuclearization mean what do they expect to see happen and i think these talks can produce results we need results and they need to be very visible before the united states creates any benefits hemmer it aposs a very interesting comment i think you need a bit of trust here to get that back on track we aposll see whether that happens on iran quickly mike pompeo set out a dozen items that he wants the iranian regime to go ahead and meet put them on screen here aposs a few of them and these are big issues too abandon the nuclear program provide full access to inspectors end support for terror groups and ballistic missile program release u s citizens and on and on the list goes a lot of demands iran has said it has no incentive to negotiate with the u s government that rips up a nuclear deal that seems like it aposs a stalemate if it is what aposs plan b blunt well first of all the nuclear the agreement with iran was an agreement that would allow them to eventually have a nuclear weapon and it was an agreement that our government ever entered into in the way government entered into agreements it was an agreement that the president said he was for understanding the congress would never verify the agreement we had just entered into and we have to learn from what aposs happened in 20 years with north korea what we don apost want to allow to happen with iran we do not want them to be able to have a nuclear weapon the current deal allows that we do not want them to be testing ballistic missiles which they are doing and they have to stop this worldwide effort to create terror activity all over the world hemmer and you pressure the europeans to go along with that blunt well we aposll see how aggressive the president wants to be with the sanctions it actually will depend on what we decide our sanctions will be against governments and businesses that deal with this iranian government it aposs the number one state sponsor of terrorism and frankly for the last several years they have been financing that terrorism with the pallets full of money that we gave them back hemmer senator thank you for your time especially on a holiday roy blunt from missouri thank you sir with me now from wilmington delaware senator chris coons a democrat on the foreign relations committee and just to continue on iran for a moment senator thank you for your time you aposve said the nuclear deal is not a perfect deal but do you see what iran has been doing and you her what the senator just listed off here what aposs wrong with putting pressure on berlin and brussels and paris sen chris coons d del senate foreign relations committee well bill i agree with secretary pompeo and senator blunt that a lot of iran aposs behavior outside the nuclear deal in recent years has been alarming and compels us to take action what i had wished the president had done is to recognize the benefits we aposve gotten from the iran nuclear deal in constraining their nuclear program and getting us searching inspections of iran aposs nuclear activities and work more closely with our european allies with the germans the french the british to reach a second deal a bigger deal that would rein in their ballistic missile program their human rights violation in their support for terrorism i completely agree that iran is a bad regime that threatens our allies and conducts itself in ways that are unacceptable i just disagree about whether causing greater distance with our european allies by sanctioning them and some of their biggest companies is the right path forward hemmer but perhaps you could change minds yes or no senator on that coons well i hope that we will see president trump end up proving himself to be a dealmaker and not a deal breaker but in this instance i aposve heard from the ambassadors from our key european allies that they are concerned that america first is turning into america alone and whether it aposs in the path towards the singapore summit with north korea where our south korean close ally was not consulted before the announcement was made or it aposs in the path forward towards trying to ask restrain iran aposs behavior and russia aposs behavior that the close relationship we use to enjoy with germany and france and the united kingdom is fraying a bit hemmer well all these stories intersect as you just indicated there too on north korea now mike pompeo said this on thursday begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state i think the american team is fully prepared i think we are rocking i think we are ready i think we are prepared for this meeting i think president trump is prepared for this meeting we were fully fully engaged over the past weeks to prepare for this meeting end video clip hemmer well you know it aposs not easy stuff and kim has since taken a different tune of sorts do you think this summit can be put back together senator coons i think it aposs possible to have a constructive and positive summit and i certainly prefer president trump aposs choice now of diplomacy over threatening fire and fury and i commend him and secretary pompeo for gaining the release of three americans held in north korea and recently another american released from venezuela and i certainly hope that he is successful but i would caution that if we go ahead without using every ounce of leverage we have over china we aposre making a mistake i was really struck that president trump this past week was tweeting that he was going to work with xi jinping to release some of the pressure on zte let me explain how these two connect north korea critically relies on china if we don apost have china putting maximum pressure on north korea i don apost think the summit will succeed zte is one of china aposs biggest telecom companies they have repeatedly and intentionally violated our sanctions against north korea and iran and the department of commerce just imposed a powerful sanctions against zte blocking them from getting u s material for six years this is a moment where president trump has china aposs attention and should use it to extract concessions both on north korea and on china aposs ongoing theft of our inventions and innovations hemmer but you will agree coons i hope president trump will show himself able to do that hemmer yes you would agree though with with the chinese cooperation thus far with james mattis apos pressure and the pressure from this president we would not even be talking about a summit had all three of those things not even come together correct coons that aposs correct it is a significant concession to north korea to offer a summit they aposve never had an opportunity to meet with an american president it aposs something they aposve long wanted to elevate them to an equal to the united states and it aposs important that north korea has given up a number of american prisoners as a confidence building measure hemmer understood yes coons but but let aposs be clear twice before north korea under kim jong un aposs father committed to full denuclearization in six party talks in 2005 in 2007 as senator blunt just referenced only to then change their tune so we aposre going to have to be very focused very engaged i am hopeful that secretary pompeo will brief and engage congress and i aposm hopeful that we aposll work together to make sure that this summit is a success hemmer two more questions quickly if the president aposs correct should the fbi have an informant connected with any national campaign democrat republican or otherwise senator coons a critical role that the fbi provides its counterintelligence and when they began getting evidence that the russians were engaged in a broad campaign to try and influence the 2016 election i think it was appropriate for them to use a confidential informant to investigate with the russians were up to i aposm struck that rudy giuliani continues to talk about 13 democrats 13 democrats in a rigged election in a rigged investigation as he just did on this show let me remind you robert mueller rod rosenstein chris wray this is the special counsel the fbi director the deputy attorney general all lifelong republicans robert mueller the special counsel a decorated marine combat veteran someone who aposs been unanimously confirmed by the senate for senior law enforcement positions under both republican and democratic positions to continue to undermine the credibility of the fbi and the department of justice in this way does not serve ph the interest of law enforcement or the rule of law hemmer but his point was that president trump yes i apologize for the interruption i aposm trying to squeeze in one more question his point is that president trump should have been told about it what aposs wrong with that coons because president trump and his actions in the campaign are potentially the focus of an investigation into obstruction of justice and collusion i don apost think it would have been appropriate for there to be the revelation of investigatory information to president trump or his personal lawyers particularly classified information about a human intelligence source in advance of there being any decision about whether to move forward with any final conclusion by the mueller investigation hemmer well final point here in a week where jared kushner was given his permanent security clearance returned to him you were calling for donald trump junior to come back to your committee and testify you believe he aposs lying that is a strong charge coons well i aposm hemmer about what senator coons i aposm concerned that in reviewing the transcript of donald trump junior aposs questioning by a staff of the senate judiciary committee that there aposs a clear tension between his firm answers that there was no efforts by a foreign power to provide assistance to the trump campaign at recent reporting that there were meetings that he participated in where representatives of gulf states were offering some assistance to the trump campaign i do think that aposs worth our questioning donald trump junior again in front of the judiciary committee and it aposs my hope that on a bipartisan basis we aposll continue these investigations hemmer ok coons as senator blunt just said it is in everyone aposs interest for these investigations to continue without interference hemmer senator coons thank you for being here today especially on this memorial day weekend coons thank you hemmer thank you coons thanks bill hemmer in a moment here we aposll bring in our sunday group to talk about the state of that north korean summit in the new terms for that iran nuclear deal commercial break hemmer coming up will they or won apost they just how serious are president trump and kim jong un about holding their historic summit begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state i think the american team is fully prepared i think we are rocking ph i think we aposre ready end video clip hemmer we aposll ask our sunday panel what gets the meeting back on track that aposs next here on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposre talking to them now they very much want to do it we aposd like to do it we aposre going to see what happens end video clip hemmer president trump striking a more optimistic tone on friday only 24 hours after he canceled that planned summit with north korea time now for our sunday group bret baier anchor of special report author of the new book three days in moscow adrienne elrod former director of strategic communications for hillary clinton aposs campaign gerald seib from the wall street journal and jonah goldberg of the national review good to have you all on a sunday and a holiday weekend at that adrienne elrod democratic strategist inaudible bill hemmer happy memorial day gerry i think the question of the weekend is whether or not this summit happens what do you think gerald f seib the wall street journal yes and nobody knows somebody in the administration told me yesterday it aposs back on track i said well does that mean it aposs going to happen he said who knows but i think it more likely than not because i think the one thing we aposve learned in the last 72 hours is that both of the leaders chairman kim in north korea and president trump here really want this thing to happen and so that aposs probably the most important thing and the dynamic look i think what was going on was the two sides were talking past each other in preparation for this and then they stopped talking to each other at all now they aposre back to talking to each other so i i don apost think it aposs a certainty i think it aposs a likelihood that it aposs going to happen hemmer i think your piece in the wall street journal on thursday said lost in translation seib lost in translation yes hemmer a lot has happened since thursday gerry seib exactly hemmer jonah to you i think the second biggest question is probably what senator blunt just referred to and that is can you get all three sides north south and the u s to agree to something before you sit down can that happen jonah goldberg national review yes so i think it was monday which seems like a thousand years ago i was on this little show you might have heard of called special report and the host i forget his name asked what was the likelihood the summit aposs going to happen and what was the likelihood that they aposll get something out of it and my prediction was 90 percent which was probably too optimistic that we get the summit and then it was canceled two days later but also 90 percent they don apost get any meaningful agreement that gets rid of nuclear weapons out of this thing and i definitely stand by that north korea has for 20 years defined denuclearization as basically getting america off the korean peninsula for good because you know america is a nuclear power that aposs what they mean by it the administration except for john bolton publicly has been harping on the word denuclearization as if it means north korea unilaterally just get rid of all of its nukes day one that ain apost gonna happen this has been the central driving defining issue of north korean foreign policy and domestic policy for over three decades it aposs just you can apost talk a nation out of abandoning what it sees as its strategic self interest that way hemmer ok so here is the president bret he doesn apost need a name tag here you aposve got that here is the president on thursday on this begin video clip donald trump president of the united states our very strong sanctions by far the strongest sanctions ever imposed and maximum pressure campaign will continue end video clip hemmer my point to senator coons was without this president leading on this without james mattis with the military aspect of it and without the chinese agreeing to crackdown on trade we aposre not even talking about a summit with north korea bret baier chief political anchor fox news channel well that aposs right and some of the more aggressive language and some of those speeches get you to the point where possibly north korea changed its attitude but i think the china part was the linchpin and its three dimensional chess here you aposre talking trade with china you aposre talking these sanctions against north korea and all of that is a pressure campaign that continues if they don apost sit down i think they do sit down but i agree with jonah north korea aposs inherent existence is because of the weapons so something dramatic we would have to change to change that scenario hemmer and what about that calculous adriane do you give this administration points for trying elrod sure of course i give this administration points for trying and look i mean as an american citizen there aposs a lot of things that i don apost want president trump to succeed at as in his hardline immigration policy being one example but i think all americans want him to succeed in this which is why we want him to go at this in a very smart way consult with your advisers don apost wing it like we aposve read in some reports that he was thinking about doing going into this summit like let aposs actually make this work and let aposs try to solve this problem once and for all hemmer i think when we woke up on saturday morning i think we were all surprised with the fact that the korean leaders had a surprise second summit i mean that aposs an indication i think to all of us that they they want something to happen here or something to move what that end i do not know just quickly to all four of you bret you think they do sit down baier uh huh and i don apost know hemmer so you think a summit happens baier yes i do and i actually think it might actually happen june 12th which is hard to believe but i think that there is a warrant by both president trump and kim kim jong un to move this forward now if they can do it quick enough you wonder the results of that from a u s perspective hemmer quickly do you think it happens seib i think it probably is going to happen again nothing is certain in this business least of all with these two leaders but i think it aposs more likely than not hemmer just to quickly goldberg i think it happens and i don apost think it produces what we want it to produce elrod i think it hemmer does not goldberg yes hemmer ok elrod and i think it happens but i think there aposs going to be multiple cancellations along the way hemmer well mayor rudy giuliani reminded us that reykjavik took six months just to negotiate before they sat down there aposs a good book about that i aposve heard about that and it wasn apost three days in reykjavik all right gerry on the iran matter mike pompeo laid out a dozen things that they want the iranians to do it is a big tall order can this administration squeeze the europeans to come around to their side of things seib well look there aposs two two answers to that question the european governments are not going to just fall in line and say yes we aposre with you on this but on the ground this is already happening we had a story a few days ago that said european companies are already pulling back from iran they aposre starting to pull back on investments already made and they aposre not making new investments because they know that they could be sanctioned by the u s and they don apost want to get caught between doing business with the u s and doing business with iran so i don apost think it aposs likely the european governments say yes we agree with you let aposs let aposs ditch this deal that aposs not going to happen but on the ground there is already a kind of a freeze in european iranian business happening hemmer very interesting we aposll wait 90 or 180 days depending on the schedule as it aposs laid out now thank you panel let aposs get a break here when we come back president trump and his team set their sights on james comey can they derail the bob mueller russia investigation commercial break begin video clip rudy giuliani president trump aposs attorney this is rigged comey had to be fired rosenstein recommended it mueller starts off with some pretty serious conflicts of interest some of which haven apost been explored yet including some personal ones that he that maybe he aposs disclosed maybe he hasn apost but the main one of the main ones being he was in a room the day before with the president of the united states and rosenstein got rejected for the job of fbi director and then gets chosen the next day to run the most sensitive investigation in america i don apost get it against the president end video clip hemmer that aposs rudy giuliani earlier this hour president trump aposs personal attorney with us here and we aposre back now with the panel and bret you had james comey on special report two weeks ago what you think about what we heard from rudy giuliani baier well i think a couple things one is saying that the president is not going to fire anybody that aposs pretty definitive i think in what rudy giuliani has said some of these interviews he says a number of different things about the investigation overall and what aposs going to happen whether the president will sit for an interview or not or it sounded like it aposs not leaning that way at this moment i aposd be interested to know specifically what he aposs talking about on the conflicts of interest for mueller and something tells me that will play itself out either on twitter or another interview hemmer it aposs clear they aposre going after james comey they aposre putting his credibility on the line and as the mayor said we aposre not going after the government just certain individuals in the government does that strategy work for them goldberg i think it aposs working this week look i i think a lot of the things that rudy giuliani said this morning to you were factually logically almost grotesque at times and but the point is is that he aposs not playing he aposs calling himself a lawyer but what he is doing what he really is is he aposs a this is this is war by other means it aposs spin war you aposve got he has very effective spin this is the first time in a long time i think the trump administration is actually starting to win some of these fights i don apost think it aposs necessarily grounded in a lot of facts and i think some of the things that rudy giuliani was doing today would not hold up to scrutiny saying you know of course we don apost know he says you know mueller hasn apost found anything about collusion and he may not have but how would we know that he says it as if we have already been that we already know that he aposs found nothing the whole point of the investigation is waiting to see what the investigation finds giuliani is very effective a spinner her i don apost think he is a very effective debater on the facts hemmer with the argument on the informant i thought he asked a very interesting question what did the informant find anything and they aposre they aposre waiting for that answer goldberg that aposs a good question hemmer yes gerry on thursday the president as he is apt to do gave us a nickname watch begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we now call it spygate you aposre calling it spygate a lot of bad things have happened i want them all to get together they aposll sit in a room hopefully they aposll be able to work it out among themselves end video clip hemmer so there may be an ig report that comes out this week it could be tuesday or wednesday which could throw all of this back up in the air is there a way referring to jonah aposs point he was making there that they can turn this against bob mueller and his team effectively seib well that aposs why i think we aposre at kind of an inflection point here because whether they can or they can apost clearly the effort by the president and rudy giuliani is to do exactly that to and he used in the in the conversation with you he used illegitimate and rigged multiple times as terms to describe what aposs going on here in reference to the mueller investigation as much as anything else so i think they believe if they can get the spygate narrative going that discredits jim comey it discredits rod rosenstein the deputy attorney general and by extension it will eventually discredit the mueller investigation hemmer but it could be a problem for the mueller side that you get there seib right exactly although you have to keep in mind that almost a year passed between the time this informant was used and bob mueller even came into existence as special counsel so i on the on the merits of it i think mueller is not tainted by this but in the in the public perception eyes that may be a big problem hemmer yes there was an intelligence briefing two of them on thursday of this week and you had members of congress come out and no one aposs talked adam schiff read from a piece of paper adrienne this is what he said after that hearing begin video clip adam schiff d cali house intelligence committee ranking member nothing we heard today has changed our view that there is no evidence to support any allegation that the fbi or any intelligence agency placed a spy in the trump campaign or otherwise failed to follow appropriate procedures and protocols end video clip hemmer now adam schiff has done hundreds of interviews on cable news since the president was elected and he aposs reading from a piece of paper and no one has suddenly leaked in this town suddenly washington d c is quiet what are we to make of that elrod well i think first of all adam schiff is trying to be very careful in the words that he aposs using here but he is simply saying what we learned what the democrats what leader pelosi and i learned in this meeting for example is that this was a very standard operating procedure that the fbi uses when they are investigating somebody so in this case they sent in an informant because they had every reason to believe that they might gain something might learn some information by sending somebody into this to the trump campaign so again this is not a spy this is an informant that the fbi uses all the time when they are investigating people when they are investigating campaigns very standard operating procedure hemmer jonah quickly what do you make of this or what are we to goldberg i think it aposs very interesting it does feel like no one quite got what they wanted out of this meeting and that someone was told there aposs a reason why we want to keep this stuff quiet hemmer what do you think baier yes first of all it aposs not usual to have somebody in or around a campaign while it aposs happening i think the argument is that they were trying to figure out what russia was doing that aposs the argument but we don apost know all that he or she got from that hemmer no it aposs good to see all of you bret gerry jonah adrienne have a great holiday weekend goldberg thank you elrod thanks bill take care seib thank you hemmer in a moment here our power player of the week honoring america aposs fallen with 24 musical notes commercial break hemmer american flags by the nearly quarter million grave markers at arlington national cemetery it is a holiday tradition here when we profile a man who created his own special program to make every day and memorial day for our fallen heroes once again he is our power player of the week begin videotape tom day bugles across america when you aposre playing it it aposs only 24 notes but it aposs so meaningful to that family chris wallace fox anchor voice over tom day is talking about playing taps at the funerals of military veterans and he should know he aposs the founder and president of an organization called bugles across america wallace on camera all told how many funerals have you done since you started bugles across america day at 200 000 wallace really day in ten years right wallace voice over it started back in 2000 when congress gave every vet the right to a funeral with military honors including two uniformed officers to present a flag and play taps the problem was the military only had 500 bugler aposs so they sent someone to play a recorded taps on a boom box or an electronic device inside a bugle tom day who played in the marines in the apos50s didn apost like it day i call it stolen dignity that these veterans can apost get life taps when we are out there ready to perform life taps wallace so he started his organization recruiting 400 horn players within a year day now we have 6 270 horn players and we aposre doing 2 200 funerals a month wallace it aposs become quite an operation that day runs out of his basement near chicago families can go on his website to ask for a bugler a message is sent to every horn player within 100 miles of the funeral day gives away bugles and helps with uniforms while they get support from foundations he runs a deficit every year wallace on camera how do you make up for the shortfall day i kind of make it up myself wallace 15 000 20 000 a year day probably ten you finish you aposre the last of the 24 notes you put the horn down and the flag has been presented and then the family comes over the kisses the handshakes from these families there is nothing no amount of money could ever buy the feeling that i get from the family once i aposve finished the 24 notes wallace voice over with soldiers killed in iraq and afghanistan plus 1 800 veterans of world war ii dying every day there is a flood of military funerals day who is 69 says he wants to keep going until he dies then leave his organization in solid shape to carry on day i want every family to have life taps at that going away presentation of their veteran and it kind of tells the marines who are guarding the gates in heaven live taps we aposre going to let this veteran right in end videotape hemmer since we first ran that story nine years ago tom da
