chael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the united states should cease opposing china s version of the monroe doctrine and the roosevelt corollary all we have to fear is fear itself years ago i attended a meeting with a high level chinese official in the offices of the then chairman of the senate foreign relations committee the official explained that for more than a century the united states had grown bigger while china had become smaller now it was china s turn to grow bigger top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore there was no pretense that china s expansion would further manifest destiny offshore balancing regional stability or any other strategic model it would represent the adolescent gratification of power for its own sake china would redraw maps to correspond to its territorial ambitions thus china is now projecting maritime power over the south and east china seas in disputes with vietnam japan the philippines and other asian nations it is building a blue water navy and strengthening its armed forces to establish a sphere of influence in the pacific and east asia the united states is alarmed we recently sailed a united states navy guided missile destroyer within the 12 nautical mile territorial limits of subi and mischief reefs in the south china sea claimed by china president barack obama has announced a united states pivot

colonization by any european powers w ith the governments who have declared their independence and maintain it and whose independence we have on great consideration and on just principles acknowledged we could not view any interposition for the purpose of oppressing them or controlling in any other manner their destiny by any european power in any other light than as the manifestation of an unfriendly disposition toward the united states it is impossible that the allied powers should extend their political system to any portion of either continent without endangering our peace and happiness monroe however had no writ to speak for the entire north and south american continents he imply asserted in the manner of a papal encyclical that the united states would not tolerate within the western hemisphere any political dispensation in any country encouraged by a european power that conflicted with the principles of the u s constitution president theodore roosevelt s 1905 monroe

in the dominican republic haiti nicaragua and mexico to install or ensure friendly or obedient governments and to pre empt european interventions in 1961 the united states attempted the overthrow of communist cuba s fidel castro by force and violence in the bay of pigs fiasco and in 1965 the united states sent troops to the dominican republic to ensure a government friendly to our interests in
