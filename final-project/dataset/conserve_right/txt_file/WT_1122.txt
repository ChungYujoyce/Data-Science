 be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic dr anthony fauci a key member of the white house coronavirus task force warned tuesday of unnecessary suffering and death if states open their economies too early during the covid 19 pandemic striking a more cautious tone than president trump who has prodded some states to loosen lockdowns and cheered on protesters and complaining businesses my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that then turn into outbreaks dr fauci told the senate committee on health education labor and pensions the consequences could be really serious ten states are reopening or about to do so even though they have not met a key white house benchmark for loosening restrictions a

restrictions could paradoxically impair their own goals if they need to go back into shutdown mode there is a real risk you ll trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control which in fact will set you back not only leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided but could even set you back on the road to trying to get economic recovery he said it would almost turn the clock back rather than going forward dr fauci said the u s death toll is likely higher than what has been reported and that it would be a bridge too far to bank on drug treatments or a vaccine by the time the next academic year begins he said americans should look to expanded testing to keep students safe the scientist testified about the dangers of being hasty even as mr trump paints an optimistic portrait of and goads blue states to reopen their economies despite a lack of specific guidance from the centers for disease control and prevention california should let tesla elonmusk open the plant

advice and that their relationship is not confrontational though the administration has largely deferred to governors on plans to reopen white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany said mr trump wants states to follow federal guidelines that recommend a phased in approach she said however that some people are delaying needed medical care or potential cancer diagnoses because of shutdowns the coronavirus was discovered in wuhan china in december before it swept the globe it has infected over 1 3 million people in the u s and killed nearly 81 000 most of us feel the number of deaths is likely higher than that number said dr fauci responding to questions from sen bernard sanders of vermont dr fauci cited the rush of cases in new york city where people likely died at home and weren t included in the covid 19 numbers he said the virus won t simply disappear so preparations for a potential second wave this fall will be vital the doctor testified remotely along with food and drug administration commissioner dr stephen hahn cdc director dr robert r redfield and adm brett giroir the coronavirus testing czar dr fauci dr hahn and dr redfield are all in some level of self quarantine after a staffer for vice president mike pence tested positive for coronavirus infection last week all three said they are considered critical workers and will attend meetings at the white

he said south korea was more aggressive early on and kept its death count low they accomplished theirs at the beginning of the outbreak while we treaded water during february and march the senator said they have 256 deaths and we have almost 80 000 deaths i find our testing record nothing to celebrate whatsoever the fact is their test numbers are going down down down down now because they don t have the kind of outbreaks we have ours are going up up up because they have to ms mcenany reiterated the comparison at her briefing she said every state is now conducting more per capita testing than
