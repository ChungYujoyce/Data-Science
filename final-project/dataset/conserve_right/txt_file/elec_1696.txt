again generated the sexist mantra of believe women as if one gender is biologically endowed with a truth gene and the other with a lying gene there is absolutely no basis in science morality experience or law for this bias it is no different from saying believe jews believe gays believe democrats or believe lawyers generalizing about any group without an empirical basis is bigotry pure and simple those who claim that believe women is not bigoted because it a positive not a negative attribute are simply playing word games the necessary corollary of believe women is don t believe men who deny what women accuse them of in the deep south during jim crow prosecutors would sometimes argue and some judges would even instruct juries that white witnesses were more believable than black witnesses these official statements were largely unnecessary because many of the members of all white juries already believed that malignant white lie how is this lie that women are more believable than men any different several reasons are offered none of which withstand critical analysis the first is in the form of a question why would a woman ever lie about being sexually assaulted making an accusation is painful and fraught with danger a false accuser can be prosecuted for perjury or making a false report their reputations will be trashed their credibility challenged and their privacy violated all this may be true but insufficient to deter a false accuser who sees a pot of gold compensation from the accused at the end of her ordeal since the start of the metoo movement millions of dollars have been paid out to accusers while most of these accusations are likely true it is also likely that some are false a former student of mine who practices law in hollywood has told me that discretely accusing famous people and demanding hush money has become an industry even falsely accused stars are inclined to pay for the silence of their accusers rather than have the accusation plastered all over the media i am personally aware of several payments that were made to false accusers there may be other motivations beside money including revenge partisan political advantage copy cat metoo ism the point is that there are not only costs to making an accusation there may also be benefits so the argument that no woman would ever accuse a man of sexual assault unless it were true is patent nonsense moreover some of the costs are illusory women who falsely accuse men are rarely prosecuted for perjury as their lawyers surely advise them even false accusers are often lionized by radical feminists the second argument is a claim that statistics prove that there are very few false accusations but there are no empirical studies that demonstrate this we only know that a given accusation is true unless the man confesses or the evidence is conclusive every accusation should stand by itself and not be judged on what people believe the averages or likelihood of its legitimacy might be in my view even an accusation that results in a conviction doesn t prove that it is true especially today when the deck is stacked so heavily against the accused some time ago convictions of male predators were rare because women were not believed at that time an acquittal would not prove that the accusation was false today we see a similar phenomenon a conviction does not prove a given accusation is true we simply can t know for sure how many accusations are true and how many are false we do know that the number of false unfounded and questionable accusations is far from trivial as evidenced by false accusers who eventually come forward and admit they made it up consider for example the accusation made against me by a woman i never even met although she has essentially admitted in emails and a manuscript that she never met me and despite the fact that her own lawyer has acknowledged in a recording that she is wrong simply wrong in accusing me her accusation will not be counted among the false ones the last argument is that today s women deserve to be believed because so many women in the past were not believed the effort to introduce a type of affirmative action into the criminal justice system is both immoral and illegal today s innocent defendants who are falsely accused should not be asked to pay the price for yesterday s guilty defendants who were falsely acquitted so let s investigate all the evidence with regard to reade s accusation against biden let all the files be searched to see whether any contain relevant material let s look at inconsistencies corroboration and other circumstantial evidence only then can we form a view of who is telling the truth but let s not put the sexist thumb of believe women not men on the scale of justice alan m
