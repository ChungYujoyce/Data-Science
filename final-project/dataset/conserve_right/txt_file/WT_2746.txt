been involved in an operational way in the investigation mr horowitz s 434 page report on fbi abuse of wiretap laws to target trump campaign associate carter page includes scores of pages on mr ohr

controlled the former british spy as he wrote and distributed 17 dossier memos accusing mr trump and aides of various felonies mr steele contended there was a huge trump russia election conspiracy special counsel robert mueller said there was not from a july breakfast with mr steele mr ohr embarked on a year of dossier networking he sat down with top fbi agents and mingled with the justice department s criminal division all the while talking up and delivering anti trump data from mr steele and fusion mr ohr immediately rang up the fbi and in october got a session with the inner circle deputy director andrew mccabe and his counsel lisa page later he met with peter strzok ms page s lover and the agent who led the trump investigation known as crossfire hurricane mr ohr told mr mccabe

that steele could not be trusted nov 21 2016 was an eventful day mr ohr met with assistant secretary of state kathleen kavalec who had welcomed mr steele to her office to hear his dossier pitch she quoted mr ohr as saying the dossier was kind of crazy kind of wild quite a tale later that day mr ohr traveled to fbi headquarters for his most high powered meeting this was a month after the fbi executed its first electronic and physical surveillance on mr page under the foreign intelligence surveillance act in the room sat the fbi who s who of crossfire hurricane mr strzok ms page a representative of the office of general counsel a supervisory agent the chief of counterintelligence analysis and the intelligence section chief according to participants notes mr ohr drew a link between mr steele and the clinton campaign he said fusion s mr simpson was hired by a lawyer who does opposition research and the dossier was being fed to the campaign the inspector general s report said connections and contradictions in three subsequent fbi wiretap applications to a judge agents never disclosed the partisan link according to mr horowitz who found that bureau agents misled the fisa court 17 times mr steele was desperate to sink mr trump mr ohr said yet mr steele doubted his own source network reporting of kremlin activities may be exaggerated or conspiracy theory talk so steele cannot know whether all the reporting is true the notes say mr ohr assured those around the table that mr steele was not fabricating information the next month mr ohr asked for more information from mr simpson and received it in the form of a thumb drive that he delivered to the fbi supervisory agent with whom he had met in november as 2017 began mr ohr received a new fbi handler and began using encrypted messaging with mr steele by then mr steele had executed one of his most far reaching operations he delivered a hard copy dossier to mr simpson who transferred it to david kramer an associate of sen john mccain mccain hand delivered it to fbi director james b comey whose agents by then had obtained most of the dossier s memos mr kramer began spreading dossier material to news media including buzzfeed which published it on jan 10 2017 at some point mr ohr broke from his heady encounters at the top and spread steele information to an underling ohr s colleague said that ohr told her that steele provided information that the trump campaign had been corrupted by the russians the inspector general s report said the colleague told us that she asked ohr if the allegations went all the way to the president and that ohr responded yes investigators asked mr ohr why he did not at some point inform then deputy attorney general sally q yates that he had become an off the books investigator he said he feared ms yates would terminate his talks with mr steele he further stated that he did not want to stop talking to steele because he was alarmed by the information he was receiving and believed he needed to get it to the fbi the inspector general s report said none of the fbi witnesses we interviewed the report said recalled anyone tasking ohr to gather information from steele or to act as an intermediary between the fbi and steele by may the crossfire team grew weary of mr ohr as a steele intermediary after 13 debriefings but mr ohr continued talking with mr

supervisory special agent and others on december 12 2016 december 20 2016 december 22 2016 and january 23 2017 regarding ohr s ongoing communications with steele and simpson about steele s election
