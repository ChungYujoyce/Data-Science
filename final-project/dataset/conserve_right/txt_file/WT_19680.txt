apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the democratic party has lots of radical new ideas and lots of radical presidential candidates and politicos but the common hatred of president donald trump has united otherwise quite disparate democratic leaders such as house speaker nancy pelosi california democrat former vice president joe biden sens kamala harris california democrat cory booker new jersey democrat and elizabeth warren massachusetts democrat and reps alexandria ocasio cortez new york democrat rashida tlaib michigan democrat and ilhan omar minnesota democrat these diverse progressive politicians all shared faith in special counsel robert mueller and his dream team they believed over the last two years that the mueller investigation was slowly grinding down president trump t shirts were sold with the slogan god protect robert mueller top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender the unifying progressive creed assumed that mr mueller s team would eventually find mr trump unequivocally guilty of collusion with russia that buzzword was the non criminal euphemism for felonious conspiracy to rig an election the hunt for collusion would end with the holy grail of mr trump s impeachment and removal from office in 2020 there would be an almost automatic progressive takeover of government periodic leaks from mr mueller s team during the investigation s 22 months prompted giddy media anticipation that the walls were closing in on mr trump it always seemed that the noose was tightening around him and that yet another bombshell was about to go off this anti trump echo chamber lessened the need for progressives to offer a comprehensive coherent and winning alternate agenda damning the sure to be impeached trump was unity enough all progressives at least agreed on that but as mr mueller was supposedly about to indict mr trump a divisive hard left agenda was almost imperceptibly floated to the public the green new deal reparations for slavery abortion redefined as permissible infanticide open borders packing the supreme court with liberal justices the abolition of the electoral college and ice free college tuition the elimination of student debt medicare for all a wealth tax a 70 percent top marginal income tax rate a 16 year old voting age voting rights for ex felons and on and on it seemed as if today s radical proposal would become yesterday s sellout within 24 hours as progressives awaited tomorrow s even more revolutionary idea while progressives were celebrating the seemingly inevitable mueller indictment of mr trump they were also increasingly at odds over many of these divisive and mostly unpopular new issues and over the self created paradoxes of identity politics when he was not declaring mr trump guilty of treason robert francis beto o rourke a lifelong beneficiary of wealth and influence did his best to blast his own past white privilege socialist presidential candidate bernie sanders when he was not predicating mr trump s impeachment talked in the abstract as if an old white guy like himself in the concrete had no business running for president current front runner joe biden when he was not gloating over mr trump s supposed guilt tried hard to trash his own white male culture as the root of many of america s problems how odd that three of the anti white male party s leading presidential contenders were none other than the white male trio of biden bernie and beto now mr mueller has gone his report having found no evidence of an election conspiracy there is no longer a rallying cry of trump russia collusion in other words an investigation that for two years had reconciled the irreconcilable serves no longer as a source of democratic unity we are going to see hard left democrats and socialists force their mostly unpopular agenda on politicians and candidates from their own party and they are now putting their identity politics money where their mouth is by openly discouraging candidates on the basis of their race and gender with the end of the mueller investigation thousands of government documents mostly unredacted will be released the result may be that the hunters of mr trump soon become hunted by federal prosecutors sworn statements of obama administration officials in the justice department cia fbi and other bureaucracies will contradict newly released documents to escape punishment all of these players in the russian collusion delusion may now begin to turn on one another after being so united in going after donald trump the media sensationalism and optics will play out in reverse as the noose tightens and the walls close in on people such as former cia director john brennan former director of national intelligence james clapper former fbi director james comey and former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe there will also be more infighting over the collective embarrassment of the russian collusion hoax a few shamed progressive politicians and reporters will grow quiet and acknowledge their overreach but many will double down and weirdly insist that there really was russian collusion and that the steele dossier was true most will remain unashamed and simply move on to the next supposed trump scandal progressives in unison boarded the mueller express to nowhere as they now jump off the train wreck the
