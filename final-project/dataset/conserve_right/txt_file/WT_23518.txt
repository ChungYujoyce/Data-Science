tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion according to president trump s enemies the list of his high crimes and misdemeanors as well as his domestic and foreign policy failures is so overwhelming that it would be almost impossible to add something substantial to it however some tireless folks keep digging and finding more grist for example thomas friedman of the new york times has identified yet another huge foreign policy failure of mr trump s this time that he shows no interest in democracy promotion and that too is more important than ever because democracies are much less prone to war citing michael mandelbaum johns hopkins emeritus professor of u s foreign policy mr friedman asserts that the principal disturbers of the peace russia china and iran are all dictatorships that seek popular support can no longer get it through economic growth don t have the option of getting it through democracy and in fact fear that democratic demands and democratic forces will unseat them their aggressive policies are designed to protect their regimes against most of all democracy top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches unsurprisingly grand trump hunter adam b schiff chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence agrees he laments that the past decade has demonstrated that democratic change is not inevitable but must be doggedly pursued by free societies which mr trump neglects to do barack obama s ambassador to nato ivo daalder agrees for 70 years the united states has led the global effort to promote democracy human rights and the rule of law but since the start of donald trump s presidency and with few exceptions these words are no longer part of america s official vocabulary in practice to promote democracy means an increasingly confrontational approach to russia china and iran the designated exemplars of authoritarian anti democracy i cannot say too much about china or iran but when it comes to russia i believe the blame goes to those in washington whose failed strategic vision during the first decade and a half after the fall of communism and the dissolution of the ussr led to missing a historic chance for a rapprochement with that country at that time russia was ready and almost begged to be admitted to the western world but the washington swamp was not interested since it was confident that it then had the unlimited and indefinite power to run the world russia s interests could be largely ignored not only that but if the west had been sincerely interested in building a strong democracy then it would have assisted with russia s difficult transition from a planned to a market economy this was not supposed to be a charity but an investment in a potential strategic partner that by the way would be later in a position to check both china and iran billions of dollars indeed were spent but if one follows the money trail it went in the opposite direction bluntly speaking russia was robbed details can be found in janine wedel s book collision and collusion or the u s congressional report russia s road to corruption how the clinton administration exported government instead of free enterprise and failed the russian people washington under bill clinton george w bush and barack obama delivered a sharp nyet to russia s aspirations to join the west the kosovo war successive rounds of nato expansion and most damaging and crossing all of the kremlin s red lines the 2008 bucharest declaration to induct ukraine and georgia as well and color revolutions in serbia georgia kyrgyzstan and ukraine made it clear that the only acceptable russia was a satellite state begging for handouts why are we shocked that russia turned to other partners in eurasia including china iran and our nominal ally turkey since 2014 the sharpest standoff is in ukraine if president petro poroshenko gets his way that standoff will get sharper still his stunt in november trying to run naval vessels through the kerch strait from the black to azov seas produced the russian response he hoped congress obliged right on cue with more sanctions and promises of lethal weapons to kiev s regime for good measure washington has pulled out of the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty concluded by ronald reagan and mikhail gorbachev preparations are underway to test missiles in that range for deployment in europe giving russia only a few minutes to decide whether notice of an attack is real what could possibly go wrong actually something could go very very wrong in our games when we fight russia and china rand analyst david ochmanek said blue gets its ass handed to it in other words in rand s war games which are often sponsored by the pentagon the u s forces colored blue on war game maps suffer heavy losses in one scenario after another and still can t stop russia or china red from achieving their objectives like overrunning u s allies other than pumping up military spending which is already three times china s and 10 times russia s what is the benefit of running such risks democracy for what it is worth some of the american founding fathers had a poor opinion of democracies john adams democracy never lasts long it soon wastes exhausts and murders itself there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide james madison democracies have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths but mr friedman following george w bush tells us that democracies are much less prone to war than nondemocracies really how many countries has the u s bombed or invaded in the past three decades compared with the principal disturbers of the peace russia china or iran democracies are more peaceful what would serbs somalis afghans iraqis libyans yemenis or syrians say to that and maybe soon venezuelans and iranians besides one who might beg to differ on mr trump s supposed failure to promote democracy is his secretary of state mike pompeo who stated that when it comes to venezuela every option is on the table to deliver to the venezuelan people the democracy they deserve and pledged the u s to securing a free and democratic venezuela and support for the venezuelan people s aspirations to live in a democracy messrs friedman mandelbaum schiff and the rest of the democracy promoters crowd should be thrilled edward lozansky is president of the american university
