apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president elect donald trump has vowed to name china a currency manipulator on his first day in the white house there s only one problem it s not true anymore china the world s second biggest economy behind the united states hasn t been pushing down its currency to benefit chinese exporters in years and even if it were the law targeting manipulators requires the u s spend a year negotiating a solution before it can retaliate trump spent much of the campaign blaming china s for america s economic woes and it s true that the u s china trade relationship is lopsided china sells a lot more to the united states than it buys the resulting trade deficit in goods amounted to a staggering 289 billion through the first 10 months of 2016

ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds what does currency have to do with the trade gap when china s currency the yuan falls against the u s dollar chinese products become cheaper in the u s market and american products become more costly in china so the u s treasury department monitors china for signs it is manipulating the yuan lower treasury has guidelines for putting countries on its currency blacklist they must for example have spent the equivalent of 2 percent of their economic output over a year buying foreign currencies in an attempt to drive those currencies up and their own currencies down treasury hasn t declared china a currency manipulator since 1994 what would happen if the us declared china a currency manipulator probably not much at least initially if treasury designates china a currency manipulator under a 2015 law it is supposed to spend a year trying to resolve the problem through negotiations should those talks fail the u s can take a number of small steps in retaliation including stopping the u s overseas private investment corp a government development agency from financing any programs in china trouble is the united states already suspended opic operations in china years ago to punish beijing in the aftermath of the bloody 1989 crackdown in tiananmen square so naming china a currency manipulator is mostly just a jaw boning exercise said amanda debusk chair of the international trade department at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commerce department official there s no immediate consequence is china guilty of using currency to help its exporters not lately in fact for the past couple of years it s been intervening in markets to prop up the yuan not push it lower for years china pretty clearly manipulated its currency to gain an advantage over global competitors it bought foreign currencies the u s dollar in particular to push them higher against the yuan as it did it accumulated vast foreign currency reserves nearly 4 trillion worth by mid 2014 but now the chinese economy is slowing and chinese companies and individuals have begun to invest more heavily outside the country as their money leaves china it puts downward pressure on the yuan the yuan has dropped nearly 7 percent against the dollar so far this year the chinese government has responded by draining its foreign exchange reserves to buy yuan hoping to slow the currency s fall china s reserves have dropped by 279 billion this year to 3 05 trillion if beijing stepped back and let market forces determine the yuan s level it likely would fall even faster giving chinese exporters even more of a competitive edge so beijing is doing the opposite of what trump says it s doing cornell university economist eswar prasad earlier this month called trump s plans to name china a currency manipulator unmoored from reality the whole discussion is ironic said david dollar senior fellow at the brookings institution and a former official at the world bank and u s treasury department it s out of date could trump do anything on his own gary hufbauer an expert on trade law at the peterson institute for international economics notes that as president trump could nonetheless escalate any dispute over the currency on his own over the years congress has ceded the president broad authority to impose trade sanctions trump has threatened to slap a 45 percent tax or tariff on chinese imports to punish it for unfair trade practices including alleged currency manipulation brookings dollar said china likely would bring a case to the world trade organization against any protectionist measures that are a violation of u s commitments to the wto which oversees the rules of global commerce and rules on trade disputes some trade analysts wonder if trump is using the tariff threat as a negotiating tool to win concessions from china whatever the u s motive china has a consistent record of retaliating against trade sanctions when the obama administration slapped tariffs on chinese tire imports in 2009 for instance china lashed back by imposing a tax on u s chicken parts china s global times newspaper published by the ruling communist party s people s daily has already speculated that china will take a tit for tat approach if trump s tariffs are enacted the paper suggested that beijing might limit
