from fox news in washington president trump is back at the white house after the g 20 summit where he seemed to get along better with russian president putin than some of our long time european allies so where do we stand now on foreign hot spots trade and climate change and what about a newly disclosed meeting in 2016 between the president aposs son trump campaign officials and a russian lawyer in a few minutes we ll break it all down with an exclusive interview with the white house chief of staff reince priebus but first let aposs bring in correspondent kevin corke at the white house with the latest kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris no matter how far away the president travels from washington for example the 4 000 miles to hamburg germany this white house is never terribly ph far away from the russian meddling story it was one of the topics heading into the g 20 and it is again coming out of the g 20 the president talking about it and tweeting about it once again this time talk about his meeting with president vladimir putin he tweeted i strongly pressed president putin twice about russian meddling in our election he vehemently denied it i ve already given my opinion later the president tweeting on sunday putin and i discussed forming an impenetrable cybersecurity unit so that election hacking and many other negative things will be guarded this as fox news confirms that donald trump jr arranged a meeting at trump tower during the campaign with a russian lawyer with connections to the kremlin that meeting he failed to disclose on his federal paperwork but had been noted by other attendees including jared kushner and paul manafort we also heard from the trump legal team that the person who took part in that meeting may have misrepresented herself and who she worked for and may in fact have had ties with dnc operatives very interesting twist in that story as for deliverables from the g 20 summit no surprise the syrian ceasefire is an obvious one the president tweeting now is the time to move forward and working constructively with russia on that another deliverable the announced agreement with china to conduct joint military exercises in 2018 beijing s obvious attempt to mollify u s concerns over the north on trade and the final communique which acknowledge america aposs right to seek more trade equity abroad mr trump tweeted this sunday the g 20 summit a great success for the u s explained that the u s must fix the many bad trade deals it has made will get done and the summation also noted america aposs decision to back out of the paris climate accord which it called irreversible of course according to the white house it s nonbinding and we re out chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks for that joining me now president trump s chief of staff reince priebus reince welcome back to fox news sunday reince priebus white house chief of staff i m happy to be here chris wallace right let aposs start with the breaking news that in june of 2016 there was a previously undisclosed meeting and let s up all the players on the screen donald trump jr this was during the campaign jared kushner the president aposs son in law and senior advisor and then campaign chairman paul manafort met at trump tower with a russian lawyer with ties to the kremlin natalia veselnitskaya why did they meet and why are we just learning about it priebus well first of all chris i don apost know much about it other than what i ve communicated with various members there on the screen it was a very short meeting it was a meeting apparently about russian adoption and after about 20 minutes the meeting ended and that was the end of it and as far as nondisclosure look jared kushner put in his disclosure a little prematurely he has since amended it all of that is disclosed and it was a nothing meeting and now what aposs developing from that meeting if you look at the article that circa put out is that the individual that set up the meeting may have been affiliated with fusion gps which is opposition research firm that is being subpoenaed and talk to by the senate judiciary committee about their role in putting together that phony dossier that people know about in regard to the president so this is a developing story i don apost know much about it other than it seems to be on the end of the trump individuals a big nothing burger but may spin out of control for the dnc and the democrats wallace well let me ask you about two aspects of that in terms of the dnc are you suggesting that this was somehow a set up by democrats to try and link them or compromise them with the russians and this was before there was any russian interference in election so why would they have done that priebus well look why was fusion gps involved in putting together this dossier i don apost know chris and i don apost think too many people know why or how this meeting came about however what i can tell you is in my communication with our team on the subject there was nothing to it it was a 20 minute meeting it ended after everyone was decidedly sitting there saying there aposs nothing happening here they moved on and i think in the end what you re going to find in the story if you read the circa column because i think there s more questions on the democrat side than anywhere else wallace and one last question about the meeting why would donald trump jr jared kushner and campaign chairman paul manafort all want to meet with a russian lawyer about russian adoption priebus i have no idea chris you re going to have to talk to them however you know talking about issues of foreign policy issues related to our place in the world issues important to the american people like adoption is something that aposs not unusual so when you go through a campaign you re not just talking to one particular group of people about in this case adoptions in russia you have policy teams talking about our place in asia talking about trade in china you have policy teams that run the gamut it s not unusual crosstalk wallace the foreign policy meeting priebus apparently so wallace ok i want to clear up speaking of foreign policy meetings what really happened in the putin trump summit in hamburg on friday russian foreign minister lavrov says that after putin denied meddling in election he trump this is his quote said that he had accepts these assertions and that president trump said this is lavrov quoting trump certain circles in the u s are still exaggerating although they cannot prove this the topic of russia s interference with the election reince is that true did the president say what lavrov says he said priebus no it s not true the president absolutely did not believe the denial of president putin what he did his he immediately came into the meeting talked about russian meddling in the u s election went after that issue at least two separate times this was not just a five minute piece of the conversation this was an extensive portion of the meeting and after going at it with president putin more than once two times maybe even three times the president at that point after spending a large part of the meeting on the subject moved on to other topics wallace so to be clear crosstalk wallace and we re going to get to that he does not accept putin aposs denial he believes the russians meddled priebus he s answered this question many times he said they probably meddled in the election they did meddle in the election the one thing that he also says which drives the media crazy but it s an absolute fact is that others have as well and that aposs true china has north korea has and they have consistently over many many years so yes he believes that russia probably committed all of these acts that we aposve been told of but he also believes that other countries also participated in this wallace let aposs move to the next subject which is what is the response what are the consequences for doing that i want to put a tweet that your president your boss has been very busy on twitter today i want to put up this tweet now it is time to move forward and working constructively with russia does that mean that they re off the hook as far as russian meddling is concerned priebus no it doesn apost mean they re off the hook but what it means is is that we re not going to forgo progress simply because we have a disagreement in regards to this meddling in the united states election what it means is that we need to move forward with things like a cease fire in syria which is going to save a lot of lives which we are doing i think starting today in southwestern syria it means we need to move forward with working together with isis we need to move forward with working together in resolving the conflict in ukraine wallace so how do you priebus so you can have you can chew gum walk and chew gum at the same time chris wallace how do you respond to democrats like chuck schumer who are saying it aposs disgraceful that the president comes out of this meeting and basically says oh we re going to move forward priebus right well we can solve world peace and world famine and i think senator schumer would say the same thing so look they re programmatic when it comes to trashing the president when you look at what president trump did in europe and recommitting ourselves to our nato allies committing ourselves to our partners in europe our partners across the world committing ourselves to the values of the west delivering a speech in poland which many people said are the best speeches since ronald reagan you look at what he did in hamburg i mean other than our small disagreement on trade and the paris agreement we have unification with our allies wallace all right well i want to get to that with you but let aposs talk about one more aspect of the trump putin meeting and that is progress in syria they did discuss it here is how secretary of state rex tillerson described it afterwards begin audio clip rex tillerson secretary of state i would tell you that by and large our objectives are exactly the same maybe they ve got the right approach and we got the wrong approach end audio clip wallace i want to ask about that the secretary of state says the u s and russia have exactly the same objectives and that maybe they have the right approach and we have the wrong approach russia putin are backing assad who has slaughtered hundreds of thousands of civilians and they may have the right approach priebus well look i think what he may have been referring to is that barack obama put a red line in the sand and didn apost actually follow through with the threat that he made in syria and we find ourselves from we find ourselves behind the eight ball in syria because nothing happened for many many years and now we are looking from the outside looking in that all being said we need to move forward and actually maybe work with russia on bringing peace to syria and i think that aposs what you aposre seeing the beginning stages of happening wallace but they want assad they want somebody who the butcher of baghdad who was slaughtering hundreds of thousands of people priebus maybe not long term i think it s yet to be seen what is going to be of assad i mean certainly he aposs a butcher and he s a bad person and you aposve seen president trump act decisively when it comes to syria it didn apost take him long to pull the trigger in regard to a response to the chemical attack that aposs a decisive leader and that aposs who the g 20 leaders saw in hamburg as someone who is decisive someone who is not afraid someone who doesn t kowtow and stands up for himself when it comes to issues of disagreement like trade and the paris agreement wallace let aposs talk about exactly that subject because generally at these g 20 summits the meetings of the world aposs leading economies east and west the u s sets the tone but there were a lot of times and you just referred to it a couple times sharp disagreement over climate change just completely disagree and they kind of papered over the disagreement on trade which still is there does the president have any trouble when he aposs one against 19 priebus no actually i think the american people should look at that as a massive positive about this president that you have a president that doesn apost just show up at the g 20 and sink into his chair and just suddenly agree with all of these european leaders across the table when it comes to issues that he disagrees on the president has made it very clear that he doesn apost believe the paris agreement is fair now you say it aposs a disagreement it aposs really not a disagreement on the environment it aposs a disagreement on the paris agreement itself and the fact that we don apost want to be hamstrung by an agreement that s going to hurt the american worker across the country that the president has pledged to support we don t we disagree in regard to trade a little bit and the fact that this president actually believes that trade should be fair that we shouldn apost be taken advantage of that s something the president is standing up for the american people it should be seen as a positive chris wallace let me ask you a specific question on trade because the president may decide in the next few days whether or not to impose tough restrictions on steel imports coming into this country talk about a possible 25 percent tariff the head of the european commission says we are prepared to take up arms if need be his reaction to the fact that the president may do this is president trump ready for an international trade more priebus well ok first of all the president does what he says he aposs going to do he aposs been talking about steel aluminum cars for 30 years my entire practically my entire life he is he believes in the things that he believes in there aposs also a national security peace to this and the american people need to understand if a country loses its ability to produce steel it loses something in regards to national security a country cannot find itself importing steel from china subjected to dumping of steel from other countries and decreasing productivity wallace i don apost mean to interrupt but priebus this is an important issue not just for trade not just for the american worker for national security wallace but you aposre making the argument that yes he s going to impose tough restrictions on steel imports priebus my guess is that he will because he promised that he would wallace but then the europeans are going to impose tough restrictions priebus of course maybe they will maybe they won apost wallace but they say they will priebus but they can t take advantage of the united states many of these countries have been taking advantage of the united states and part of the reason why president trump is in the white house is because he told the american people that the time is over for the rest of the world to take advantage of the united states now that all being said wallace what happens when they impose what happens when they impose tough restrictions on our exports to them and then americans lose jobs priebus other than maybe a few countries you can apost find a trade surplus going the opposite direction from the united states that all being said let me just because we might be running out of time i want to make it very clear wallace we are running out priebus this was a positive meeting the president set the stage in europe the leaders of the g 20 came to the president he was a star in hamburg and no one can take that away and the fact of the matter is i think he aposs placing america first but with that strategically aligning our allies and making sure that our objectives across the world and the objectives of western civilization are being met wallace one last question i got about one minute left we re over time senate coming back this week going to take up health care mitch mcconnell is acknowledging that you may not pass repeal and replace you may have to work with the democrats to prop up obamacare more republican senators coming out against it how much trouble is repeal and replace in priebus i don apost think it aposs in half as much trouble as the media wanted to be in just like it wasn apost the case when we went through the house bill the second time around everyone said that it was over and then a few days later it passed i think that aposs what you are seeing right now i think you are seeing members of the senate putting their wish list together you have a leader in mitch mcconnell that can get it done if anyone can get it done mitch mcconnell president trump working together with a senate can get it done wallace yes or no will they pass priebus yes wallace yes what priebus yes they will get a they will get a repeal and replace bill done ph i believe that wallace before the august recess priebus maybe before maybe a little bit into it but i know that this president expects them to get this done whether it d be before august recess or during august recess the president expects the senate to fulfill the promises it made to the american people wallace reince thank you thanks for your time priebus you bet wallace always good to talk with you priebus thank you chris wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss president trump aposs latest turn on the world stage meeting with vladimir putin and other leaders commercial break begin video clip angela merkel german chancellor through translator there is that position of the united states on the one hand but i m very happy that all other g 20 heads of state and governments have agreed that the paris agreement is irreversible end video clip wallace german chancellor angela merkel host of the g 20 summit acknowledging there were some sharp differences between the u s and other countries and it s time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and former speaker of the house newt gingrich author of the best selling book understanding trump well speaker gingrich g19 was trending on twitter this weekend because of the sharp differences between the president and all the other leaders especially on climate change but also as you heard my discussion with reince priebus on trade is that a good thing or a bad thing for the u s newt gingrich former speaker of the house i think it aposs a good thing look the president starts from a simple premise we have a whole series of agreements that are bad for america while they are good for the guys that got the deals so all these guys who got these good deals are going oh gosh you actually want to change the agreement well again same thing with nato we went out and said to nato pay your fair share including germany by the way all of a sudden they are shocked that we want to actually have them help defend themselves so if you aposre going to go in and you are serious about changing the trade deals the other side who have had a good free ride are going to be mad at you if you re serious about changing the paris accord on economic grounds which is what trump said if you read his speech it aposs very clear that he thinks this is a bad deal for america well if you re the germans and the chinese and the indians you think that aposs a great deal for you so i think he did exactly what he promised to do i think that aposs exactly what the campaign was about if they think they can get along without the u s in the paris accord let aposs talk about six months from now because the truth is angela merkel and germany ain apost that big those people don apost have they don t have that much clout and in the end remember he starts the week by going to warsaw so between theresa may in britain and the polish government in warsaw he s also reminding the europeans the europeans are split on a lot of issues we don apost happen to be with the chancellor on them wallace congresswoman edwards let me bring you in on this because while there certainly were differences and the european leaders aren apost happy about this and in many cases kind of said it aposs one against 19 i m sure there are a lot of trump voters who would say playing nice with the world hasn apost helped them particularly in the case of jobs that they ve lost fmr rep donna edwards d maryland well i don t think it s a question of playing nice it aposs a question of being a leader and i think that one of the perceptions coming out of the g 20 is that the united states doesn apost seem to be standing in its leadership position and so you know look i was not a big fan of many of those trade deals i think that it aposs really important for us to look at ways that we protect the american workers that we strengthen our manufacturing for us and so i think it aposs appropriate to look at those things but it doesn apost mean leaving the rest of the world behind brit hume fox news senior political analsyt it s an interesting formulation here and you aposre hearing it from congresswoman edwards and for many others as well which is that the president is out of step with the leaders in europe in other words if he refuses to follow them he is therefore not leading to me that just on logic grounds that doesn apost make any sense he is taking a different path there s much there are many nations who will be with him certainly the reception he got in warsaw indicated that as well and because he is out of step with a certain group of european leaders does not mean that he aposs given up a leadership role it may indeed mean he aposs embracing it wallace but let me ask you juan and you know it s a very interesting conversation i had with reince priebus on this question of steel imports he basically says he aposs going to impose limits on steel and you get the head of the european commission saying god we ll then impose limits on some of your exports juan williams fox news political analyst right so you get into a trade war situation you see that inside the white house you have people like steve bannon saying yes this will appeal to our base to people who feel like they aposve lost jobs because of these trade deals that are unfair to american workers but you get ten people on the national economic council gary cohn and others saying you know what we don apost want a trade war we don apost need that kind of static right now the economy seems to be going along pretty well we had good numbers this week why would you want to disrupt that and i think for a lot of people this question then extends to the leadership issue you are hearing discussed here this morning so my take on this is when you talk about american leadership you have to understand we have the biggest economy in the world we have the biggest military in the world we can set an example for other countries it may be that at some point you say hey we are taking more aggressive steps that are being imposed on other countries so that aposs not fair to us but guess what we are the big boy wallace i want to turn to perhaps the highlight of the whole summit and that was the meeting at least from the u s point of view the meeting between president trump and president putin here s the tone they set at the beginning of the meeting begin video clip trump we look forward to a lot of very positive things happening for russia for the united states and for everybody concerned and it aposs an honor to be with you vladimir putin russian president through translator i m delighted to be able to meet you personally mr president and i hope as you have said our meeting will yield positive results end video clip wallace speaker gingrich how much should we make of what the two men said about russian meddling now you ve got president trump in a tweet this morning saying i m going to move forward syria north korea all the issues are we overstating the importance of this meeting gingrich well i think we ll know in six or eight weeks i mean if they actually have a cease fire that actually works which also by the way involves israel and jordan that aposs the first time in the syrian civil war that we will have actually had a joint american russian agreement that survived but i would say that you will know more about that in six to eight weeks if they create a relationship where they can get a genuine cease fire in eastern ukraine that is an enormous step in the right direction if they can create a relationship with the russians understand that we would defend the three baltic states and that they cannot threaten them that s an enormous i mean wallace yes there are a lot of ifs there gingrich that aposs exactly right i don t given putin aposs track record i can t sit here today and tell you this is a breakthrough i can tell you that the tone is probably right the fact that it lasted over two hours is probably right and that putin is a very tough guy but i think you may have been surprised by tillerson and trump because they re very tough guys and so i think if you go back to some what i said if you end up with two sets of tough guys and one of them has the largest economy the largest military the greatest reach in the world probably that guy ends up winning if he is determined and i think ultimately putin is probably going to deal with trump wallace congresswoman edwards you know i want to ask about this controversy and a lot of democrats have been hitting trump a lot of your former colleagues in congress the idea of talking about moving forward i mean to some degree do we want to hold the entire relationship hostage just assume the worst that the russians meddled like crazy tried everything they could to interfere in the election don t we still have to do business with them edwards well i mean there aposs moving forward and then there is do we sanctions relief and so wallace just want to talk with them ph edwards so i want to well i want to hear what moving forward means because the fact is the trump administration actually has been engaged in the congress trying to loosen the sanctions and are not happy with the bill that came out of the senate and so i want to know what moving forward means does that mean that we do have to have a relationship at some level to try to deal with syria yes but our interests in syria are very different from the trump administration interest in syria we re not going to prop up the assad regime i think russia has that interest and so hume might i suggest that if the president had had a very tense meeting centered entirely on the alleged meddling in the election which appears clearly to have happened and the meeting broke up in disagreement with other issues on the backburner that the president aposs critics would not have liked that better than what happened this amounts to at least a renewal of diplomacy in an area where diplomacy has been at a chill for some time we ll see what comes of it it aposs way too early to judge as the speaker suggests but i can apost help and think that it aposs probably worth a try at least to see if diplomatically some things constructive things can be accomplished wallace all right we have to take a break here we ll see you all a little later up next the gop aposs health care agenda is in trouble but how much trouble we ll discuss the fate of repeal and replace with republican senator and doctor bill cassidy who has his own plan commercial break wallace coming up senators returned to washington to tackle health care after some hear from voters back home begin video clip unidentified male single payer unidentified crowd vote no vote no end video clip wallace can the senate pass repeal and replace republican senator and doctor bill cassidy joins us next commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at new orleans famed french quarter the senate returns from recess tomorrow with republicans still hoping to keep their promise to repeal and replace obamacare but how realistic is that goal joining me now is louisiana senator and dr bill cassidy who has his own health care plan senator welcome back sen bill cassidy r louisiana thank you you were one of the few republican senators or congressmen to hold an open town hall during this last recess and you got an ear full on health care let aposs take a look begin video clip unidentified male but i ll tell you what s rude taking 22 million people off their health care in this country who you know who cannot afford it you worked at the earl k long hospital for a long time and you know what people are like at their lowest so to step on their necks by kicking them off their health care at this point that s cruel sir end video clip wallace a strong message to follow as you went around the state of louisiana these last ten days how concerned are voters how concerned are folks when they read and obviously this fellow was aware of it the cbo report that that tens of millions of people could lose their health insurance under the plans republicans are putting forward cassidy they re very concerned you aposre hearing two different arguments you re hearing first folks saying listen i aposm paying 1 700 a month for insurance before obamacare i was paying 800 and i have 6 000 deductibles per family member and are ph you have folks who with disabilities who are concerned they will lose their coverage for the disability that shows that health care is like no other issue it touches people in their most personal being we ve got to get it right wallace and they re not happy with the current situation cassidy well people don apost like change even from worst to better and there s been a lot of kind of promulgation of things which are not true about the health care bills that are going up by the way i have reservations about the senate bill but nonetheless some of that which is of concern does not need to be a concern wallace well let aposs talk about the plan because you and senator collins republican senator collins of maine who has said at this point that she aposs against the bill the the senate bill with the your plan that you re putting forward here are some of the highlights keep most obamacare taxes to pay for a replacement allow states to keep most of obamacare if they want for states that want a new system auto enroll people in insurance so thy have to opt out not opt in senator it s an interesting plan but how many of your colleagues in the senate and particularly republicans have signed on to it cassidy we have six of us total more than any other plan out there and by the way i would say that is the only way we can go forward wallace but but you you need 50 plus the vice president cassidy oh we need i totally get that but once if if the president logs in that this is the plain he wishes or that the leadership says ok this is the plan we want then it will be the plan that goes forward some people were going to sign on they said let aposs see what president trump does let aposs first talk chris though about why they ve had such a problem passing any plan they aposre trying to combine tax reform with health care reform we take care of that we say let aposs do health care reform first and then address the tax situation when you do comprehensive tax reconciliation comprehensive tax reform don apost mix the two we don apost mix the two secondly are we serious about keeping donald trump s campaign pledges to cover all care for pre existing conditions eliminate the individual and employer mandate and lower premiums if we re serious about that cassidy collins is the only way to get there wallace but but here aposs the criticism that that you here and quite frankly i don apost mean to be negative but this is the reason it doesn apost seem like cassidy collins is going anywhere is that if new york what you re basically saying is it s a federal system each state can decide what fits them that is a good conservative federal argument but if new york and if california decide that they re going to retain obamacare with all of the benefits most of obamacare with federal taxes which is what your plan would do conservative senators say in their states what you re going to do away with obamacare then the folks in their states are playing so new yorkers can have bigger better richer health care coverage than they can cassidy that is a misunderstanding of our bill every state gets an equivalent amount of money based upon their population and a couple other factors cost of care et cetera so every state would get their fair share if you will new york and california would continue to get the share they want minus by the way the penalties on the individual and employer mandates we repeal those mandates so those states would have to re impose individual and employer mandates frankly i don t think they keep obamacare i think they go with our other option wallace all right the hot idea right now is ted cruz aposs plan that he is offering under which each exchange an insurer would could offer what are called skinny plans cheaper plans with fewer benefits that people could buy but as long as they offer one plan that has all the benefits under obamacare and the argument against that is that you re going to get healthy people they re going to buy the cheaper plan with less coverage because they re healthy and that means that the middle income people who aren apost covered by medicaid who have pre existing conditions or serious problems are going to have these expensive comprehensive plans they won t be able to afford you basically have a two class insurance system and for the people who really need it no insurance at all cassidy well first i m all for i m all for people being able to choose the insurance plan that best suits their needs we should absolutely do that but you re right if you inaudible off the older and sicker in their own plan with their own risk pool then you ve just re created the obamacare exchanges with federal taxpayers putting billions in to subsidize the expense of a few we need to have a common risk pool where everybody chips in a little bit for that young person who gets in a car wreck for example if we do it and in that case the cruz amendment s a good amendment wallace but as it now stands cruz is a nonstarter for you cassidy i don t know the amendment if it turns out it aposs two plans wallace well that aposs what he aposs described cassidy with no that aposs ok with two risk pools then that aposs bad because wallace that aposs what he s described cassidy no he has not yet designated whether or not you have a single risk pool or two risk pools if it is a single risk pool that actually works if it is two risk pools that s just obamacare recreated and we need to do something different than obamacare wallace at least 10 republican senators have now said have come out formally you have not although you ve expressed doubts about it have expressed doubts about the mcconnell plan as it was offered the last week in june is that plan now dead cassidy we don apost know what the plan is wallace well wait a minute it was it was submitted cassidy well the draft plan has now been serious rewrite and so we don apost know what the serious rewrite clearly the draft plan is dead is the serious rewrite plan dead i don apost know i ve not seen the serious rewrite plan wallace it s it it aposs a heck of a way to do business cassidy it is a heck of a way to do business by the way i go back to cassidy collins the nice thing about cassidy collins wallace inaudible cassidy the nice thing about cassidy collins as you said it s a conservative federalist approach which actually gives the state guidelines gives every state their fair share and allows them to come up with the answer for their state it actually takes that decision making away from us returning it to the patients and the state that aposs where we should be wallace and then there is the idea that president trump offered in a tweet a few days ago and let aposs put this up on the screen if republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately repeal and then replace at a later date what you think of that cassidy a nonstarter i ll tell you there will be uncertainty in the insurance markets premiums will rise for middle class families it gives all the power to people who actually don apost believe in president trump s campaign pledges who actually don apost want to continue to cover and care for pre existing conditions and to lower premiums it gives them the stronger hand i think it aposs wrong i think it betrays president trump s campaign pledges wallace so i come away from this senator thinking that that repeal and replace is in real trouble cassidy in the current pathway it has been and i know i sound like a broken record we should go back to conservative principles where we devolve power to the states and to the patients allowing them to make the patients the best decision for them wallace but i guess what i aposm asking is if you look at a rewritten and i understand you haven apost seen it all but what you aposve heard about i mean there aposs nobody who s more clued in on this than you are in the senate if you look at what mcconnell is talking about you look at what cruz is talking about forget kennedy cassidy collins for a moment how much trouble is repeal and replace in cassidy if you aposre only talking about the draft plan clearly it s not going to pass ten senators have said they would not vote for it on the other hand every time they come up with an iteration that becomes more conservative in the sense of giving power back to states we move a little bit closer to passage so if we continue in that pathway i do think we come up with both a bill that passes and one that fulfills president trump s campaign pledges wallace does this get passed by the end of the month cassidy i don t know that wallace do you you want to put odds on it cassidy i would probably put that as 50 50 i do think we have to do something for market stabilization otherwise people who are paying premiums of 20 000 30 000 and 40 000 will pay even that much more so we have to do something to stabilize the market for those middle class families currently kind of groaning beneath obamacare but going forward obamacare just cannot our american people want more freedom to make the decision that matters to them and not have somebody in washington d c tell them what that decision should be obamacare tells them what that decision should be it may take a while but we will get to a point where that power goes back to the family and that aposs where it should be wallace but it might not happen on this legislative calendar cassidy it may not happen completely on this legislative calendar but the process will begin and as that process begins it will be inevitable that it will eventually completely occur wallace senator cassidy thank you thanks for coming in it aposs always good to talk with you sir cassidy thank you chris wallace up next we ll bring back our sunday group to handicap whether mitch mcconnell can put together the 50 votes he needs to pass a bill plus what would you like to ask the panel about gop chances for repeal and replace just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump obamacare is in a total death spiral and the problems will only get worse if congress fails to act obamacare is dead end video clip wallace president trump making his central argument that republicans have no choice but to repeal and replace a plan that is now falling apart and we re back now with the panel so brit mitch mcconnell didn apost want his gop colleagues to go home for this recess concerned that spending a lot of time with their voters at home would only weaken support not strengthen support for repeal and replace how much trouble are republicans in now in passing a bill hume well i think the bill s in trouble and it will have to be revised and whether it can be revised to the point where it can gather a majority in the senate is a question and what is really troubling about this chris is this that at the heart of these repeal and replace efforts is the is the reform of medicaid not to cut its spending but to reduce the spiraling rate of growth of that program if the republicans with control both houses and the white house cannot do this on this matter it signals that entitlement ph reform which for budgetary and physical reasons and for the national economy needs to happen cannot happen and that in my mind is alarming disturbing and very worrisome wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on this question of whether or not the senate is going to be able republicans in the senate to repeal and replace obamacare we got this on twitter from ron powell who writes why if they had eight years and multiple house votes to repeal did you not have an alternative ready when you took power it s clear they had zero speaker gingrich how do you answer ron gingrich well they they did have a plan and i think what they aposve learned painfully is that the kind of plan you have when everybody assumes it will get vetoed gets one level of scrutiny the kind of plan you have when everybody thinks it s going to become law the it skyrockets so they found it to be much harder than they thought it would be my personal bet would be that mcconnell will find the votes and i think it aposs possible if they get a package that can actually run from the most conservative member to the most moderate member in the senate that that will just be passed by the house without a conference i think people really want to get this done and i think mcconnell i think again you had a i think just now a senator who really understands this issue and who i think was able to outline as a medical doctor the right direction they re going to keep churning for another two weeks the deadline is good for them the senate tends to operate best when it aposs faced with a really big deadline and i think they ll get something done before the august break wallace but what about brit s question because that is one of the big concerns and that president obama and the democrats expanded medicaid covered people that weren apost previously covered millions of people got it under there this while it is true that that it doesn apost cut medicaid it slows the rate of growth of medicaid some people who now have coverage eventually would lose coverage and it states that didn apost expand medicaid there s a tremendous concern that they re going to be stuck in an inferior position how do you make them whole both both sides gingrich well first of all first of all i m underwhelmed by governors who love free money you have a lot of governors who say oh we want more of this money ninety percent of the cost to be picked up by the feds for the expanded part of medicaid which by the way actually discriminates against for example americans with disabilities because they only get 62 percent of federal funding and some states have actually re rigged the game to get more able bodied adults second i would say look at what mary mayhew ph did in maine where they passed reforms that said if you re an able bodied adult than you ought to be required to work if you have no children medicaid has expanded dramatically in the zones it was never designed for and i think the american people would support reforms that had work requirements attached to people who were able bodied adults wallace juan what do you think are the chances that republicans fail to pass anything on repeal and replace which i think there aposs a growing sentiment here in washington and if they fail to pass it after seven years of promising they would what aposs the backlash they ll face in 2018 williams well i think their by the way the premise of your question is right on target because at this point it looks to me like really what the republicans are up against his embarrassment with the republican base that they are not in position to pass repeal and replace after so many years so much rhetoric and votes to undo obamacare and you have conservative lobbying groups here in town who are pressing hard incising that they must repeal and replace or they will pay a price in 2018 in the midterms but the fact is that ultimately mitch mcconnell has expressed doubts about having it president trump the votes to pass it president trump has said the house bill is mean chris mean and so what you have is the question of how the base reacts and at this point i think the base and a polarized electorate is not going to abandon republicans if they fail to repeal and replace they re not going to go vote for the democrats the problem is a political one because at this point we re not talking about a good plan nobody on the even republicans when they re polled don apost think this is a good plan for them it aposs what you saw in the town hall meeting so you don apost have repeal and replace nobody s building a border wall no tax cuts no tax reform dreamers still here you ve got to think hey republicans did you buy a bill of goods or what wallace i think folks would just go home put the put the blanket over their head and go back to sleep congresswoman edwards president trump in that opening clip we played may be overstating it but you ve got to agree that obamacare as it currently stands is in trouble premiums are going up deductibles are going up and let me put this on the screen in 2016 85 percent of enrollees had a choice of three or more insurers this year only 58 percent of enrollees have a choice of three or more insurers and just to take away one of your arguments a lot of this started before president trump became president edwards well i also think that you know first of all the rate of increase is not the rate of increase that we would have seen had we done nothing at all that is really clear medical costs were skyrocketing and so i think that now you know the trump administration has done some things to really destabilize the system and i think insurers wallace but but in fairness this is the point i was trying to take away from you is edwards wait insurers i know but no no no but wallace a lot of it was already in trouble edwards but let me just say this i mean over this last year we have heard message after message about the need to repeal and replace and it has created total instability in the system and i think insurers rightly don apost know what aposs going on and so we know that there are things that can be done to strengthen the affordable care act that republicans and democrats can agree on things like removing the excise tax making sure that we provide greater incentives for young people to be in the system so that we have a greater pool and so there are any number of things that can be done on a bipartisan basis and that aposs where i d like to see this go making sure that people like me with pre existing conditions are able to get affordable health care the end of the day wallace you ve got 20 seconds hume republicans face the problem of of doing nothing and seeing this collapse make no mistake about it chris they will be blamed they control everything if it if it collapses and people are worse off that s as big a problem a bigger is at least as big a problem as as whatever they pass wallace and it was meaningful i thought that mitch mcconnell said if we can apost pass repeal and replace we re going to have to work with democrats to try and fix it thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week one of america s greatest dancers retires and brings her next act to washington commercial break wallace it happens to all of us that point in your career when it aposs time to move on as we told you last fall one of america s most celebrated dancers is now on to her next chapter and she aposs our power player of the week begin videotape julie kent the washington ballet leaving the stage was traumatic heartbreaking one of the most difficult wonderful things i ve experienced in my life wallace voice over julie kent is talking about the moment in 2015 when she decided to retire after 30 years as a star of the american ballet theater at age 45 she could feel her skills declining and there was another sign kent at the end of the day when derek jeter retired i guess i figured i had to go too and mariano ph wallace on camera yes it s true kent they were my guys so if they re not going to play i guess i can t either wallace voice over the question was what to do next the washington ballet asked her to become its artistic director kent as i said to some of the dancers the next best thing to creating beautiful art is watching it wallace and so kent now spends hours in the studios helping dancers realize their dreams just as she did kent its home it s just it s at home the bar the mirror the floors the smell the piano the ambiance to me it aposs just home wallace kent wants to expand the company and its repertoire of ballets kent my goals are to take this company to a place where it hasn apost been before wallace part of her job is also to oversee the washington school of ballet which has more than 1 000 students wallace on camera is that a concern of yours that being such a great dancer yourself you that may not translate into being a great teacher kent i always say to them i i i don apost want you to do what you think i would do because i d really rather do it myself i want to see what you are going to do i have no memories in life before dance wallace voice over kent started dancing as a child at age ten her first professional performance was alongside a master kent to be this close sharing a wing with baryshnikov it was incredible wallace she would go on to be one of the most celebrated dancers of her generation wallace on camera how is it to be a prima ballerina fun glamorous or just hard work kent it aposs the whole it s everything wallace voice over while she s now retired she doesn apost close the door entirely on a possible encore wallace on camera are you going to perform with the company kent that aposs not on the plan no if it made sense for me to perform then i m a very logical person as far as message and if it makes sense then it makes sense wallace voice over but julie kent understands a
