again thursday morning in hanoi mr trump tried to play down short term expectations i can t speak for today but over a little bit longer term we re going to have a fantastic success the president said speed is not that important to me i very much appreciate no missile testing i am not in a rush asked if he was confident of a deal mr kim replied through a translator it s too early to say i would not say i m pessimistic i have a feeling that good results will come see also trump inks trade pact with vietnam for purchase of boeing planes the heavy lifting of the two day summit to address the crisis on the divided korean peninsula was planned for thursday when the two delegations will try to hammer out a deal to curb pyongyang s nuclear and missile arsenals and ease more than six decades of hostility and suspicion between the u s and north korea mr kim thanked the president for his courageous decision to negotiate with him personally and said there have been some misunderstandings since their precedent shattering first meeting in singapore in june there have been all these eyes from the world who are misunderstanding the situation said mr kim referring to hostility lingering from the korean war however we have been able to overcome all the obstacles and here we are today after 261 days despite the questions surrounding the summit the white house official schedule for thursday has blocked out time for a joint agreement signing ceremony followed by a news conference by mr trump amid high intrigue and with much of washington transfixed by the daylong congressional testimony of former trump attorney and fixer michael cohen the two leaders arrived at dusk at the sofitel legend metropole hanoi hotel in separate motorcades and shook hands in front of a bank of u s and north korean flags they chatted briefly and smiled for news cameras i thought the first summit was a great success and i think this one hopefully will be equal or greater than the first mr trump told his counterpart whom he called a great leader then with only their two interpreters present the leaders huddled for 30 minutes in a conference room for a private initial discussion mr kim and mr trump later shared a 90 minute dinner of shrimp cocktail grilled sirloin and chocolate lava cake joined by a small group of aides secretary of state mike pompeo and acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney on the u s side and kim yong chol a former intelligence chief and mr kim s point man in negotiations and north korean foreign affairs minister ri yong ho outside the hotel thousands of spectators and journalists thronged the security perimeter to get glimpses of the leaders and their entourages mr kim said that since their initial meeting last summer he went through a time in which i agonized and have more patience than at any time i am confident that such a great outcome will come out this time which can be welcomed by everyone and i will do my best to this end he said the white house billed wednesday s meeting as mainly a casual event with the tougher talks to come thursday mr trump earlier in the day called mr kim my friend on twitter in 2017 mr trump taunted mr kim as little rocket man when north korea was launching test missiles and tensions over a possible shooting war soared across east asia cohen distraction even as mr trump was negotiating over one of the world s most urgent security threats the president also was paying attention to developments in washington he fired back on twitter after mr cohen told a house committee that his former employer was a con man a cheater and a racist michael cohen was one of many lawyers who represented me unfortunately mr trump tweeted just hours before his first meeting with mr kim he had other clients also he was just disbarred by the state supreme court for lying fraud he did bad things unrelated to trump he is lying in order to reduce his prison time as the president and mr kim headed into the crucial part of the summit democrats and some private analysts expressed fears that mr trump in his eagerness to strike a deal will ease sanctions or give other concessions to mr kim without getting anything concrete in return the fact that trump wants a deal so bad and is such a terrible negotiator should scare us all heading into the summit with kim tweeted sen christopher murphy connecticut democrat and a member of the senate foreign relations committee the president said ahead of the meeting that his critics and the media were in the dark he criticized false reporting guessing on my intentions kim jong un and i will try very hard to work something out on denuclearization then making north korea an economic powerhouse mr trump tweeted i believe that china russia japan south korea will be very helpful sources close to the negotiations have told the washington times that success would be reached if any joint statement from the summit includes an indication that north korea will allow international inspectors into the country to examine nuclear sites if the joint statement does not include that word then the next best thing would be for mr kim to say inspectors during a likely post summit press conference on thursday the sources said while u s officials have praised their vietnamese hosts for the organization of the summit there have been some hiccups some u s reporters covering the event as part of mr trump s media pool were excluded from the meeting with mr kim apparently over annoyance with reporters shouted questions concerning mr cohen only one newspaper reporter was allowed to cover the leaders final comments of the evening tv radio and wire service reporters were barred and white house correspondents association president olivier knox said the press corps strenuously objects to this capricious decision white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders defended the move citing the sensitive nature of the meetings we are continuing to negotiate aspects of this historic summit and will always work to make sure the u s media has as much access as possible she said objects of curiosity outside the meeting site there was an atmosphere of fascination and excitement among the crowd of people who waited for the two leaders the two most talked about men in the world are coming said davin reid a 29 year old canadian who was among thousands packing around an intersection near the hotel s entrance i want to see kim jong un said mr reid s girlfriend kailyn leckie 23 he s just a fascinating human we re not fans mr reid added quickly it s just a morbid curiosity i ve never seen anything like this clark university professor srinivasan sitaraman a specialist on u s foreign policy said the summit s first day left key questions unanswered about what mr trump hopes to achieve in hanoi to build on the vague promises the two men made in singapore we re still left without knowing if there is an accepted definition of denuclearization between the two parties going into the summit he said wednesday it is critical that the united states and north korea at least arrive at an accepted definition of denuclearization at this summit to establish that the two parties are not talking past each other questions of verification and timing on ending the north s nuclear problem also hang over the talks early indications from the summit suggest that it would probably be a little premature to expect such developments mr sitaraman said some observers also worried that mr trump could agree to a peace declaration on the korean war which ended in 1953 in a legal stalemate without gaining anything in return bruce klingner former cia korea deputy division chief and an analyst with the heritage foundation said such a concession could end up reducing u s deterrence and defense capabilities and abrogating the mutual defense treaty before reducing the north korean threat north korea argues that the u s must prove an end to its hostile policy but it is north korea that has habitually threatened attacked and killed u s and south korean personnel mr klingner said the u s has already repeatedly provided non hostility declarations and promises not to attack north korea mr trump emphasized again wednesday his belief that the largely isolated north korea stands to enjoy unprecedented prosperity if mr kim commits to clear steps toward dismantling his uranium and plutonium processing plants and destroy his arsenal of missiles earlier wednesday mr trump praised vietnam for its thriving economy as he signed a trade deal with vietnamese leaders and sought to persuade mr kim to follow hanoi s example meeting with vietnamese prime minister nguyen xuan phuc mr trump signed agreements calling for vietnam to purchase more than 100 passenger airliners from seattle based boeing inc a deal worth about 21 billion you really are an example of what can happen with good thinking mr trump told vietnamese president nguyen phu trong and other officials mr trump also said approvingly that vietnam is interested in purchasing u s made military equipment at a luncheon with vietnamese officials mr trump said greater cooperation from mr kim would make north korea
