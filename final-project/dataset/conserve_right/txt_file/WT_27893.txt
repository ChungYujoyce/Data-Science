tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn hanoi vietnam kim jong un s summit with president trump is the main event but insiders say the north korean leader has an ulterior motive smoothing ruffled feathers in hanoi after pyongyang in 2017 was accused of recruiting a vietnamese woman to assassinate mr kim s half brother in malaysia mr kim whose talks with mr trump are set for wednesday and thursday will hold separate meetings with vietnam president nguyen phu trong in a bid to put the assassination issue to rest according to a high level foreign diplomatic source who said the north korean leader s hopes to kill two birds with one stone on a rare international foray while the time of the meeting is uncertain analysts say mr kim yearns to revive ties with a potentially useful ally ties that were strained two years ago when his order to assassinate his older half brother kim jong nam resulted in a now notorious vx nerve agent attack at kuala lumpur international

withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director that north korea relied on two foreign women one vietnamese and one indonesian to apply the killer chemical compound and that the assassination took place in a major southeast asian public space cast a huge pall over north korea s relations with southeast asian states said patrick cronin a senior fellow and asia expert at the hudson institute in washington there was global exposure of the video showing kim jong nam collapsing after a young woman approached and touched his face with a piece of cloth at the airport terminal his death came amid other purges in the kim regime and was laced with intrigue over reports he was a favorite of china to replace his untested younger half brother two women in their late 20s doan thi huong of vietnam and siti aisyah of indonesia are accused of carrying out the killing both are still in custody in malaysia where they re now charged with murder their trial has been complicated by malaysian investigator claims that several north korean operatives were at the airport on the day of the attack and remain at large the assassination triggered outrage across asia with malaysia responding by expelling north korea s ambassador the trong government in vietnam was more restrained but diplomatic sources say the incident sparked deep mistrust in hanoi over the idea that north korean intelligence had exploited a young vietnamese woman to commit murder there is no doubt chairman kim harbors alternative agendas in seeking vietnam as the meeting spot for his second summit with mr trump said mr cronin who said a kim trong understanding would be a significant development no matter how the trump meetings go u s officials have not been shy in holding up vietnam a one party communist state as a possible role model for the kim regime as it tries to break out of its economic isolation without surrendering political control secretary of state mike pompeo went to lengths during a visit to vietnam last year to play up the nation s emergence as a fast growing southeast asian tiger if pyongyang abandons its nuclear weapons it too can reproduce this path north korea and vietnam were allied closely during the vietnam war with pyongyang sending millions of dollars in economic and military aid to support north vietnam but relations have been touchy during the decades
