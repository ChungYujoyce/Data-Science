document intended for an audience of one ignores voluminous evidence that the president used the power of his office to pressure ukraine into investigating his political rival by withholding military aid and a white house meeting the president of ukraine desperately sought in so doing the president undermined our national security and the integrity of our elections mr schiff said in a statement tellingly the minority dismisses this as just part of the president s outside the beltway thinking it is more accurately outside the law and constitution and a violation of his oath of office he said democrats have been building momentum for impeachment by circulating a report by the house intelligence committee on mr trump s dealings with ukraine ahead of a scheduled vote to approve it tuesday they then plan to forward the report to the judiciary committee for consideration of articles of impeachment mr trump said the timing of the judiciary committee s first hearing on the standards for impeachment is a deliberate attempt to humiliate him on the world stage the president said democrats partisan motives validate his decision not to participate in the hearing the democrats the radical leftist democrats the do nothing democrats decided when i m going to nato this was set up a year ago that when i m going to nato that was the exact time mr trump told reporters this is one of the most important journeys that we make as president and for them to be doing this and saying this and putting impeachment on the table which is a hoax to begin with asked why he isn t sending his attorneys to the hearing the president replied because the whole thing is a hoax everybody knows it the republicans report isn t likely to stop the democrats rush to impeachment but it could bolster rising doubts about the inquiry that have surfaced in a series of polls especially among independent voters the report described the impeachment effort as part of a deep state that has resisted mr trump since he took office they are trying to impeach president trump because some unelected bureaucrats were discomforted by an elected president s telephone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky they are trying to impeach president trump because some unelected bureaucrats chafed at an elected president s outside the beltway approach to diplomacy it said the impeachment inquiry stems from a july 25 phone call in which mr trump asked mr zelensky for a favor in investigating mr biden and a missing democratic national committee server from the 2016 presidential race which the trump administration believes is in ukraine a whistleblower who is believed to be a cia official assigned to the white house accused the president of abusing his power for personal gain on the call including withholding nearly 400 million of u s military aid from ukraine as leverage house democrats allege that ukraine felt pressure to bend to the president s political will but the evidence shows a different reality the republican report stated ukraine felt good about its relationship with the united states in the early months of the zelensky administration having had several high level meetings with senior u s officials between july and september although u s security assistance was temporarily paused the u s government did not convey the pause to the ukrainians because u s officials believed the pause would get worked out and if publicized may be mischaracterized as a shift in u s policy towards ukraine the report was signed by rep devin nunes of california the top republican on the intelligence committee rep jim jordan of ohio the top republican on the oversight and reform committee and rep michael t mccaul of texas the ranking member of the foreign affairs

articles of impeachment democrats are pursuing a house impeachment vote before christmas judiciary committee chairman jerrod nadler new york democrat called the white house s refusal to participate in the wednesday hearing unfortunate he said it was a priority to have the administration participate in the inquiry and that the president should take the opportunity to show that his phone call with the ukrainian president wasn t an abuse of power the american people deserve transparency mr nadler said if the president thinks the call was perfect and there is nothing to hide then he would turn over the thousands of pages of documents requested by congress and allow witnesses to testify instead of blocking testimony with baseless privilege claims and provide exculpatory information that refutes his overwhelming abuse of power mr zelensky reiterated in an interview published monday that he never discussed a quid pro quo with mr trump but he also questioned the wisdom of blocking the congressionally approved security assistance for his country in the midst of its war with russia we re at war if you re our strategic partner then you can t go blocking anything for us mr zelensky said i think that s just about fairness it s not about a quid pro quo it just goes without saying look i never talked to mr trump from the position of a quid pro quo that s not my thing i don t want us to look like beggars mr trump seized on mr zelensky s comments as more proof that the house democrats impeachment case is baseless the ukrainian president came out and said very strongly that president trump did absolutely nothing wrong the president said that should be case over but it will never end it because democrats want to do what they want to do white house senior counselor kellyanne conway defended the decision for mr trump and his attorneys to sit out the judiciary committee s hearing which will feature four constitutional scholars three picked by democrats she and white house counsel pat cipollone said the process is unfair to the president why would we participate in an exercise where they re going to have three witnesses and we re going to have one she said rep andy biggs arizona republican called mr nadler s handling of the proceedings which haven t begun an outrage and damaging to the institution the head of the house freedom caucus mr biggs said republicans are essentially flying blind just two days before the next phase of the impeachment proceedings begin republicans on the house judiciary committee won t have much time to prepare for wednesday s hearing with the names of the four witnesses announced late monday they also will need to review the house intelligence committee s report which is set to be voted on tuesday night we re going to have all this information mr biggs told the washington times by the time it filters through to the judiciary members we re going to have 12 to 18 hours to review that information from the schiff intelligence committee report and information on the witnesses professions and we ll be sitting there with a distinct disadvantage the top republican on the judiciary committee blasted democrats for rushing into impeachment hearings without providing the evidence or details about the proceedings for the first time in history this committee will weigh impeachment without any evidence for us to review rep doug collins georgia republican wrote to mr nadler as the democrats process picked up steam impeachment was clearly on the president s mind during his flight to london the republican party has never been so united mr trump tweeted while aboard air force one this impeachment scam is just a continuation of the 3 year witch hunt but it is only bringing us even closer together the nato meeting to mark the alliance s 70th anniversary will be more ceremonial than business mr trump and his counterparts are scheduled to attend a reception with queen elizabeth ii on tuesday and will hold a short working session wednesday ending without the traditional joint communique of a formal summit the president said he intends to fight hard for the american people in europe continuing his push to get more nato members to pay the required 2 of gross domestic product for defense he has said the threshold unmet by major powers such as germany and france was a prime motivation for holding up u s military aid to ukraine secretary of state mike pompeo said the president s efforts have persuaded nato members to spend 130 billion more per year on security this is a direct result of president trump making it clear our expectations that these europeans would step up to help secure their own people mr pompeo said on fox friends he also criticized democrats for ignoring a long tradition that we support presidents when they travel overseas to do their work he said the house was trying to distract america s president from his important mission overseas i regret that they ve chosen to hold these hearings at the same time that the president and our entire national security team will be traveling to europe to london to work on these important matters mr pompeo said mr pompeo noted that the administration has provided ukraine three times with the weapons the defensive systems that the ukrainian military needed to defend themselves against the russian activities we ve been relentless in pursuing this strategic objective he said we ve supported the ukrainian people and their capacity to defend themselves jeff mordoc
