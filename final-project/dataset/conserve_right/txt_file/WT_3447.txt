attorney general in september 2013 the nonprofit donald j trump foundation gave 25 000 to a florida political committee supporting bondi s reelection campaign for attorney general the donation came at the same time that bondi s office was considering whether to join other state prosecutors in suing trump university which ran a for profit real estate seminar after numerous consumer complaints a month later bondi announced that she would not be joining in the lawsuits against trump university both the university and the foundation were later closed in response to state government legal actions against them the ethics advocacy group citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington charged that the trump nonprofit s donation was illegal because the charity failed to report it

revenue service for violating federal tax rules in its donation backing the pro bondi political organization a judge on thursday ordered trump to pay 2 million to an array of charities as a fine for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests associated pre
