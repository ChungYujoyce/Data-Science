who lives in northern maine said she and her husband enjoy a good homemade apple pie every now and then but if i couldn t find apples that were grown in the usa i would not be making apple pie at all mrs rayner said i want to support our country and i am opposed to everything that is coming in from china i would much rather buy homegrown apples i think buying local is very important for our economy favoring buying local this sentiment of buying local is growing popular across the country the proprietors of dangerously delicious pies say apple pie is one of the shop s most popular pies
