apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump had a reason to be angry at the prevailing narrative that he colluded with russia and with the subsequent 22 month special counsel s investigation attorney general william barr said thursday the narrative was untrue and mr trump repeatedly said that yet a continued focus by the press and congressional democrats left the president frustrated and angered mr barr said as he entered into office and sought to perform his responsibilities as president federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office and the conduct of some of his associates at the same time there was relentless speculation in the news media about the president s personal culpability yet as he said from the beginning there was in fact no collusion the attorney general said summarizing special counsel robert mueller s work see also barr mueller found no russia conspiracy mr trump was merciless in attacking mr mueller calling his work a witch hunt saying mr mueller s team was stacked with anti trump democrats and questioning the legal tactics used to force his former associates to testify that fueled democratic complaints that the president was obstructing justice yet mr barr said there too they were wrong the white house gave unfettered access to both campaign and white house documents ordered top officials to cooperate and testify and never used executive privilege to shield mr trump and mr trump himself never actually prevented the investigation from seeing any information or talking to any witness apart from whether the acts were obstructive this evidence of non corrupt motives weighs heavily against any allegation that the president had a corrupt intent to obstruct the investigation mr barr said mr barr said mr mueller looked at 10 episodes involving the president that might have raised obstruction questions the special counsel did not reach a conclusion instead laying out the evidence mr barr did not delve into those episodes in his press conference thursday morning leaving the details for the report s public release later most democrats have grudgingly accepted mr mueller s finding that there was no conspiracy with russia but they have said the president s other actions including firing former fbi director james comey berating of mr mueller and threatening to have him fired and ousting former attorney general jeff sessions all are evidence that he tried to obstruct the probe that they say amounts to a crime some democrats said mr barr was hiding behind longstanding justice department guidance that a sitting president can t be prosecuted mr barr though said even without that restriction there wouldn t have been a prosecution he said there just wasn t enough evidence of a corrupt motive to hide illegal russian activities to make an obstruction case democrats counter that some of mr trump s former close associates including his onetime personal lawyer campaign chairman and national security adviser have all admitted to crimes based on information originally developed by the special counsel in several cases those crimes involved contacts with russian
