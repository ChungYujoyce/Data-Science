apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap in the highly formalized world of china north korea relations xi jinping s trip to pyongyang carries enormous symbolic significance although less certain it may also yield outcomes that could influence both countries relations with the u s with tensions over trade taiwan and hong kong dominating xi s diplomatic agenda the trip also offers some welcome breathing space as the traditional allies work to strengthen ties that have been rocky at times usually in relation to north korea s nuclear weapons program though relations between xi and the north s leader kim jong un got off to a bumpy start kim has now made four visits to china since march 2018 each time taking care to show the proper deference to his country s most important
