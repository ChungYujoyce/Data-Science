player of the week howard buffett is the son of billionaire investor warren buffett this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday may 12 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace anchor i aposm chris wallace the u s and china walk away with no deal what aposs next for the world aposs two largest economies begin videotape donald trump president i happen to think the tariffs for the country are very powerful where the piggy bank that everybody steals from including china wallace president trump raising tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of chinese goods and threatening more as china vows to retaliate we will discuss how the moves will affect much of what we buy with larry kudlow the chief white house economic advisor then the showdown between the president and congress escalates house democrats demand to see the full mueller report and the president aposs taxes and talk to some key trump advisors rep nancy pelosi d calif there may be some other contempt of congress that we might want to deal with at the same time wallace we aposll sit with congressman and 2020 presidential candidate seth moulton plus joe biden widens his lead over the democratic field we aposll ask our sunday panel if he has the staying power to win the nomination and our power player of the week the son of a famed investor on being a farmer a sheriff and crusader at the border howard warren buffett farmer i just like doing things that are different and of interest wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace hello again and happy mother aposs day from fox news in washington president trump shows no signs of backing off his trade war with china after negotiators failed to strike a deal on friday he more than doubled tariffs on some 5 000 categories of chinese products including furniture electronics and other consumer goods the president is threatening to impose tariffs on essentially all remaining imports from china that aposs another 300 billion of products joining us now for an exclusive interview to discuss what happens next president trump aposs top white house economic advisor larry kudlow larry welcome back to fox news sunday larry kudlow white house economic adviser thank you chris appreciate it happy mother aposs day wallace thank you well i aposm not sure we should be saying happy mother aposs day to each other but i will take it i want to start with something that you set a couple of weeks ago when you were pretty optimistic about a trade deal with china here you are begin video clip kudlow i think we are on about the 7 yard line ok maybe even the 5 yard line looking into the end zone end video clip wallace what yard line are we on now and what set us back kudlow well we may still be on the five or the seven but as i said in that clip that aposs the those are the toughest yards to get so look the situation for us from our standpoint we were moving well constructive talks and i still think that aposs the case we are going to continue the talks as the president suggested in his tweet on friday but the problem is two weeks ago in china there was backtracking by the chinese and we covered the same ground with liu he this past week ambassador lighthizer and secretary steven mnuchin we can apost forget this this is a huge deal broadest scope and scale of anything the two countries have ever had before but we have to get through a lot of issues for many years china trade it was unfair nonreciprocal unbalanced in many cases unlawful and so we have to correct those and one of the sticking points right now as we would like to see these corrections in an agreement which is codified by law in china not just the state council announcement we need to see something much clearer and until we do we have to keep our tariffs on that aposs part of the enforcement process as far as we are concerned and as the president said things seem to be taking too long and we can apost accept any backtracking we are representing the united states the economy farmers autoworkers manufacturers these are crucial parts of this discussion so we want to be as sure as we can be we don apost think the chinese have come far enough we will wait and see the talks will continue and i will say this the g20 meeting in japan toward the end of june next month the chances that president trump and president xi will get together at that meeting are probably pretty good wallace so you pointed out the president aposs tweet on friday where he seemed pretty conciliatory in fact the stock market which i dropped dramatically on friday with news that the talks the negotiations had ended without any deal rose on the kind of conciliatory optimistic tone from the president and from treasury secretary mnuchin the president was much more combative in a tweet yesterday late yesterday i want to put this up on the screen i think that china felt that they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiations that they may as well wait around for the next election 2020 to see if they could get lucky and have a democrat win the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term that aposs a lot tougher than the president was talking on friday how come kudlow well look that aposs his view we think sometimes china may be misinterpreting the u s politics i don apost want to go deep into that but i think there aposs always an issue there he aposs the fundamental things and we aposve said this many times intellectual property theft has to be fixed forced technology transfer and ownership of american companies has to be fixed cyber interventions have to be fixed tariff and nontariff barriers have to be fixed cyber interventions have to be fixed and there have to be very very strong enforcement provisions some of the chinese officials have said both in beijing and here with mr liu he that this is the agreement was too unbalanced ok had to be no the relationship has been to unbalanced and because of these problems of unfair and sometimes unlawful trading practice we have to have a very strong agreement to correct to right these wrongs before we would be satisfied wallace all right i want to go through a quick checklist and i want you quick answers here like a lightning round on where we stand right now do you expect china to retaliate for our increase in tariffs and how soon kudlow i think i do but it aposs interesting the expected countermeasures have not yet materialized we may know more today or even this evening or tomorrow yes i reckon they will we will see what they come up with so far we haven apost heard on that basis wallace are no talks at this point you say well talks will continue are new talks scheduled with china kudlow not yet but the chinese have invited the ambassador lighthizer to come over to beijing secretary mnuchin also no concrete definite plans yet i do expect that and by the by let me repeat the strong possibility that the two presidents will meet in japan at the g20 meeting wallace how long before president trump makes good on his threat to impose 25 percent tariffs on all the rest of chinese imports into this country basically the final 300 billion in chinese goods kudlow we aposve already launched that process up on the ustr website what happens in this if i get this right we will have announcements we will have hearings we will have public comments how long does it take i don apost know it could be a couple of months thereabouts wallace a couple of months because there have been talk three or four weeks you aposre saying it could take longer kudlow yes among other things there has to be as i understand it a 60 day public commentary or something like that so you know call it a couple months call it three months i don apost know ambassador lighthizer can detail that but that will take some time and then of course the president is going to have to make the final decision on that wallace let aposs talk about who pays who pays for the higher tariffs on chinese imports here aposs what president trump had to say this week begin video clip donald trump president our country can take and 120 billion a year in tariffs paid for mostly by china by the way not by us a lot of people try to steer it in a different direction it aposs really paid ultimately it aposs paid for by largely by china end video clip wallace but larry that isn apost true it aposs not china that pays tariffs it aposs the american importers the american companies that pay what in effect is a tax increase and oftentimes passes it on to u s consumers kudlow fair enough in fact both sides will pay both sides will pay in these things and of course wallace but the tariff on goods coming into the country the chinese aren apost paying kudlow no but the chinese will suffer gdp losses and so forth with respect to a diminishing export market and goods that they may need for their own crosstalk wallace i understand that but the president says that doesn apost that china it pays the tariffs they may suffer consequences but it aposs u s businesses and u s consumers who pay correct kudlow yes to some extent yes i don apost disagree with that again both sides will suffer on this look wallace i want to pick up on both sides because let aposs look at one study that projects with the costs are of all u s tariffs look at the screen this study found that current tariffs all current tariffs cost an average family of 767 a year and cut u s employment by more than 900 000 jobs and the study found if the president were to impose that 25 percent tariffs extended on all chinese imports including the 300 billion plus the cost of chinese retaliation it will cost an american family of 42 200 a year cut the american employment by over 2 million jobs and cut gdp growth by more than 1 percent kudlow our work on cea and nec think those are pretty wildly exaggerated numbers i would suggest that if you go the whole boat 200 billion increase from 10 to 25 plus the other 300 billion we reckon it would be about two tenths of 1 percent of gdp so it aposs a very modest number we have a 20 trillion gdp in terms of possible job losses we are way way below that number and i want to note here the united states economy is in a boom the numbers are coming in terrific better than anybody expected on growth on jobs on unemployment on wages on productivity we are in terrific shape in order to correct 20 years plus of unfair trading practices with china as i said unlawful trading practices i think this is a risk we should and can take without damaging our economy in any appreciable way i will note as others have maybe this is part of your lightning round bullets maybe the toughest burdens on farmers the agriculture sector we get there we help to them before on loss exports i think we had an authorization of 12 billion we will do it again if we have to and if the numbers show that out crosstalk wallace question are you reading upside down laughter kudlow no i aposm very good i aposve had some experience but yes we will do that but again in a rising economy we are in a terrific prosperity cycle because of our policies of lower taxes and deregulation and i might add trade reforms we will be in very good shape and by the way something else the president has said let me add this on the tariffs themselves are producing a big increase in customs duties big increase perhaps something of a magnitude this past 12 months of maybe 25 billion that will help finance farmers that will help the transition you aposve got to do what you got to do we have had unfair trading practices all these years and so in my judgment the economic consequences are so small that the possible improvement in trade and exports and open markets for the united states this is worthwhile doing wallace ok i want to the last thing i aposm going to talk about i aposm in no way questioning the wisdom of deciding to take on there aposs no question that this has been an unequal unfair relationship in trade between u s and china the last thing i want to get to is the question of how determined president trump is to see this through because he clearly had an expectation if you got tough with china on tariffs that basically they were going to cave and there was going to be a deal and everything was going to be great and he as opposed to every other president was going to reset the relationship that is no longer so clear and i guess my question is how long has president trump prepared to wage this trade war with china which clearly has costs to the american economy and consumers and businesses kudlow well i don apost know i mean can i substitute trade negotiation for trade war i mean after all we are talking we will talk some more crosstalk wallace i understand but we have tariffs on them they have tariffs on us we aposre threatening to vastly increase it aposs not a negotiation we aposre taking action kudlow it is a negotiation and part of the negotiation is taking action i mean wallace ok but here but answer my question which is how far crosstalk kudlow one of the things i aposve learned in fairness one of the things i aposve learned on the president trump is that tariffs are part of negotiations and they show that we do mean business and we will take action chris again we have been on the wrong side crosstalk wallace are you or how long is he prepared to continue this effort and keep these tariffs on kudlow i wouldn apost want to put a timetable on it i would just say as he has tweeted and has said to us and said to the chinese we are continuing our discussions that aposs a very good thing negotiations you know over time stop go stop go the speed may be passed to my fast with the speed may be slow this is not at all unusual wallace are you suggesting though that there might be a certain point where he goes this just isn apost worth the economic cost and political cost and pulls back kudlow i don apost want to second guess that i don apost want to put timetables that aposs completely up to the president wallace but you aposre not ruling it out kudlow i think the economic costs are de minimis the potential economic gains of a good deal that opens up china and makes them legal trade partners those gains are huge so that aposs a cost benefit analysis that i really like politically i think the country is completely behind the president and his tough approach on china and in fact as you know leading democrats such as senator schumer and others have supported the president in this battle so i don apost i think sometimes you can do the right thing and in a sense this is a bipartisan policy and it aposs long overdue so let me repeat my point wallace we don apost have time for you to repeat kudlow it aposs worth doing we have to change the trading relationship between two countries for the benefit of the united states and its workforce and its ranchers and farmers and so forth we have to do this the president is spot on wallace larry thank you thanks for your time kudlow thank you wallace i must say i hope you enjoy our conversations as much as i do i find it a delight kudlow that aposs why i aposm here thank you appreciate it wallace and we will be tracking the next steps in negotiation thank you for coming in kudlow i appreciate it wallace coming up we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what this all means for american business investors and consumers plus what would you like to ask the panel about the escalating trade war with china just go to facebook inaudible trade negotiations with china he doesn apost like that just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump i aposm different than a lot of people i happen to think that tariffs for our country are very powerful you know we are the piggybank that everybody steals from including china end video clip wallace president trump standing firm defending his decision to escalate the trade war with china by increasing tariffs on many imports to 25 percent and it aposs time now for our sunday group josh holmes senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff columnist for the hill juan williams jonathan swan who covers the white house for axios and kristen soltis anderson of the washington examiner well josh what aposs the reaction congress the president aposs trade policies and what seems to be an escalation in the trade war with china how worried are republicans about the fact that this could have a real impact maybe not an exaggerated impact but you know a real impact on the american economy and american consumers and businesses especially as larry pointed out american farmers josh holmes founder cavalry well look i think this is quickly becoming the top issue of concern amongst republicans there aposs an awful lot to talk about mueller report and everything else but really where the focus has mostly been is here on this trade talks and what this extended debate might look like there aposs been a ton of patients on the republican side to give the president time and resources in everything he needs to try to negotiate what they do see is a critical critical problem the question is where is the off ramp and i think if we get deeper and deeper into this you aposre going to see more and more concerned because remember the high card that this president is holding and all republicans are holding is the economy the economy is doing great but i think if you speak to most analysts and you got an awful lot of employers in a lot of these states around the country were beginning to be concerned about the impact that this debate may have on that and if that grows and that concern grows without identifying an off ramp here i think you aposre going to see some problems wallace jonathan what aposs your sense of the president aposs mood he clearly thought that if he got tough on tariffs that at some point the chinese were going to back down and make a deal and now one they haven apost made a deal and there really is no sense one of the things that larry kudlow talked about was the u s wants many of these changes in trade practices to be enshrined in chinese law the chinese say that aposs humiliating they wanted to be decrease from the state council i mean this could go on for a while what aposs do you think the president is frustrated that this thing hasn apost gone as smoothly as he thought it was jonathan swan national political reporter axios i do think that and you have to put it in the context of what he was being told so late last year the president was being told and it was accurate the chinese economy was in real trouble that his tariffs had not only actual effect but also a psychological effect on chinese consumer confidence the chinese stock market was going down the economy was going down the president felt like he had an enormous amount of leverage and then he gets old pretty recently by some of his top advisors that we are on the 5 yard line and that we are you know inches away in the end zone and it turns out we are actually not in the end zone because you know i spoke to secretary steven mnuchin earlier this week i also spoke to robert lighthizer the ustr both of them made very clear that these are not minor disagreements what the chinese are trying to renegotiate are massive major parts of this deal and this could go on for a very long time perhaps beyond the 2020 election wallace which could have a real impact on the 2020 election swan of course of course wallace that aposs what i want to talk to you about kristen we asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of trade relations in negotiations with the chinese we got this on facebook from karen margrave tariffs come back to us in higher prices which means the end price to buyers of homes cars et cetera are all higher how is that a win kristen how do you answer karen especially in terms of the possible risk of all of this of president trump and other republicans on the ballot in 2020 kristen soltis anderson echelon insights well josh was right when he said the president has this trump card which is the strong economy you saw the weak markets not responding very well to the idea that this could become a more protracted more significant trade war but more importantly than what the markets may say what are individual households feeling when it comes to this if the president comes out and says this won apost actually hurt individual households but people are feeling it in their pocketbooks the president aposs advantage on do you think you aposre better off now than you were four years ago do you think that the president has done a good job on the economy that aposs his biggest political strength right now and if that aposs threatened that could be a big problem for him in 2020 wallace i want to turn to another big foreign policy issue this week and that was north korea which had two separate tests of short range missiles i think a total of five short range missiles fired within five days here was the reaction from the president begin video clip trump we aposre looking at it very seriously right now they were smaller missiles short range missiles nobody aposs happy about it but we are taking a good look and we aposll see end video clip wallace juan what you think this says about the state of president trump aposs diplomatic efforts to get kim jong un to denuclearize juan williams political analyst well keeping with the conversation we aposre having this morning think about the china trade talks but let aposs also consider iran venezuela i think the president aposs foreign policy strategy is always i inherited a difficult situation but i aposm a great disrupter i aposm going to come in here i aposm going to undercut the pillars of existing policies blow it up create some drama and then make demands and i aposm going to get a deal i aposm a great dealmaker well when we come to north korea we had fire and fury little rocket man we fell in love at the june summit all the drama of the june summit and i think north korea is closer to having a nuclear weapon is a threat to japan and south korea today than we were two and half years ago when the president came to office so in all these situations it looks like ignoring precedent and saying i aposm coming in here i aposm going to establish a new american sort of an america first policy has not played out to the president aposs advantage and certainly not to the advantage of american national interests wallace i want to pick up on that with you jonathan because there aposs no question donald trump spent a lot of political capital on kim jong un he traveled this is the president of the united states traveled halfway around the world twice to negotiate with kim that was a big concession on his part and a big boost to the prestige of kim what is the feeling in the white house right now you think about continuing to do business with kim swan well there was always a lot of skepticism and it wasn apost just inside the white house it was inside the state department inside the pentagon there was always a lot of skepticism that this would work i spoke to someone who has spent a lot of time with the president and has discussed this issue with the president and they said to me and they are not even in the administration anymore had no dog in this fight to speak and not spinning for it they said to me they would be if they were north korea they aposd be very concerned the president does not like to be humiliated and if kim jong un does escalate to break his promise with the president icbms you could go from love letters to conflict in a very short space of time this is not a normal president who does things in small increments he goes as juan said from fire and fury to literally saying that we fell in love i think we could go right back to where we were in the summer of 2017 and people should be prepared for that williams and china remember as we talk about the china trade deal they have the most leverage over north korea and at the moment they are not exactly open to helping us wallace you know it is so interesting this possibility of miscalculations i mean one of the things that we are i don apost know how true it is but there aposs a lot of reporting that when the chinese saw the president constantly hectoring the fed reserve chairman powell to lower interest rates that the chinese viewed that as an indication of weakness on the part of the president that he was worried about the strength of the u s economy and therefore that they had a stronger negotiating position swan yes and they also every tweet he does you know they sort of blur through our new cycle we don apost pay an america that much attention they are reading every tweet sort of gnostic wisdom and i think actually they are reading too much into a lot of his comments crosstalk holmes larry kudlow actually addressed this he said he believes that they are misinterpreting an awful lot of american politics right now and i think this is the perfect example of it i aposll just add on north korea i think what we aposre seeing out of north korea is the frustration that they have a worthy negotiating partner here in mike pompeo and i think they thought they were going to get anything for free and they don apost get it all of a sudden here comes some frustration wallace all right panel we have to take a break here we aposll see you a little later in the program when we come back the president aposs showdown with house democrats is testing the nations system of checks and balances is it a constitutional crisis we aposll ask democratic congressman seth moulton about that and his run for president in 2020 all that next commercial break wallace coming up democrats accuse the president of stonewalling congress begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif he is every day demonstrating more obstruction of justice and disrespect for congress apos legitimate role end video clip wallace we aposll ask a top democrat what they can do about it next commercial break wallace when democrats took control of the house in the 2018 midterms they gained subpoena power and they aposre trying to use that power to look into the president aposs conduct and business dealings moves the president aposs lawyers have called an all out political war joining me now massachusetts congressman and 2020 democratic presidential candidate seth moulton congressman welcome to fox news sunday rep seth moulton d mass presidential candidate it aposs great to be here chris and i aposm not going to start but wishing you a happy mother aposs day but i am going to wish my mother a happy mother aposs day and my wife liz it aposs her first mother aposs day ever so to my mom to liz and to my daughter emmy i love you wallace do you want to do a sethmoulton com to fundraising for no i aposm teasing that aposs very lovely moulton it aposs mother aposs day this is important wallace no i agree i agree and lorraine i wish you a very happy mother aposs day because thanks for showing me up congressman all right before we get to all the questions about the house on the white house after president trump raised tariffs on chinese goods on friday morning you tweeted this i want to put it on the screen whether it aposs farmers or federal workers americans and their paycheck should never be used as pawns in a negotiation but congressman don apost we need to get tough with china they aposve been taking advantage of us with unfair trading practices for decades moulton we absolutely need to get tough with china and it aposs not just on trade it aposs the rising threat that china is to our national security i mean they are steeling american ideas and american military secrets through the internet every single day but we need a strategy and i mean i listened to mr kudlow aposs interview i don apost think this administration has a strategy they don apost have any sense of urgency and they clearly don apost know what this means to american families two thousand seven hundred you put the number on the board dollars a year that matters to american families i mean ask how much that matters to american soybean farmers when they can apost sell their soybeans wallace so how do you how do you get tough with them if you aposre not going to use tariffs moulton you have to have a comprehensive strategy and i aposm not saying that tariffs shouldn apost be an option on the table but that means that we actually build our alliances in the pacific i aposm calling for using the nato model in the pacific to help contain china and north korea the president aposs been doing the exact opposite he aposs been undermining our allies across the globe it means using institutions like the world trade organization now that aposs not perfect it aposs not going to solve every problem but every case that the obama administration has brought before the wto against china every single one that aposs been decided has been in our favor so the president aposs simply lying when he says that wto doesn apost work we need to have a comprehensive strategy for china because they are a massive threat but just wielding tariffs like a cajole because it makes the president look tough that only hurts american families wallace all right let aposs turn to the to the battle now the escalating battle between the house and the white house over the russian investigation and where it goes from from here the president is fighting all subpoenas for documents and current and former advisors to testify before congress and the house democrats are fighting back either in one case voting in a community for contempt of congress and others threatening to vote here was the president aposs reaction to that begin video clip trump with all of this transparency we finish no collusion no obstruction right then i get out the first day they aposre saying let aposs do it again and i said that aposs enough we aposve got to we have to run a country end video clip wallace does president trump have a point i mean the mueller investigation went on for 22 months it cast a cloud over his presidency and this country for almost two years it aposs you know look nobody on the on your side is ever going to be satisfied with the mueller investigation but why not go on and deal with pocketbook issues that really affect people aposs lives voters are going to decide in a little over a year in the 2020 election whether they want to keep president trump or not moulton well first of all don apost think that we can apost do both i mean the house the democratic house has been passing a lot of legislation that aposs important to american families but it aposs also our constitutional responsibility to hold the administrations accountable that aposs written into the constitution and the fact of the matter is that this investigation is exactly what you termed it first chris it aposs an investigation about russia and whether you aposre a democrat in the house or you aposre the biggest trump supporter in america every american should want to know why vladimir putin wanted trump elected president wallace but you aposre not investigating moulton that aposs the most important conclusion wallace but but but the the house democratic investigations are not about russia they aposre about trump you aposre subpoenaing him not him but you know some of his top people barr mcgahn this is not about about russia it aposs about trump moulton well we need to hold the trump administration accountable because that aposs our constitutional duty but you aposre right in criticizing us for not focusing enough on russia i mean that aposs why i aposm in this race to talk about national security because democrats should be leading on national security when we have a president who is literally cozying up to some of the worst dictators in the world some of our biggest enemies i do think chris that you aposre right that that should be the focus because that is the unmistakable conclusion of this report obstruction and everything else aside those are really important but russia meddled in this election and don apost get me wrong they aposre going to meddle in 2020 as well because this administration has done nothing to stop them or deter them wallace i just want to ask you one more question on this and then we aposre going to move on to something i think you probably want to talk about which is your campaign for president we saw two very different approaches this week to the russia investigation from the two top leaders of the house and the senate let aposs take a look begin video clip pelosi every single day the president is making a case he aposs make he aposs becoming self impeachable sen mitch mcconnell r ky the special counsel aposs finding is clear case closed end video clip wallace now there is an argument that democrats would be in a stronger legal position to get access to documents to get access to current and former advisors of the president if you were to open a formal impeachment proceeding not say you necessarily are even going to impeach the president but open it and seek all of that under the impeachment which as you talked about in the constitution it aposs in the constitution impeachment moulton right wallace do you support that moulton i do in fact i supported it last year i think we made a mistake as a part by waiting until the mueller report came out the fact of the matter is that this is our constitutional duty and a lot of people make the argument that it aposs not a politically opportune time for us to proceed with this to have this debate don apost forget congress does two things we debate things and then we vote on them i aposm not saying we should vote on impeachment yet we don apost even have the full mueller report but let aposs have that debate i called that for for that a year ago and we should be discussing it because it aposs our constitutional duty so politics aside chris how about just doing the right thing by the constitution wallace ok you got into this democratic presidential race pretty late april 22nd you aposre a third term congressman forgive me sir with almost no national profile what makes you think although it will obviously explode after your appearance here today what makes you think that you have a realistic chance of winning the democratic presidential nomination moulton because the most important thing to democrats is beating donald trump and bringing this country together and the hardest job i aposve ever had in my life is leading american troops in combat it aposs bringing together a remarkably diverse group of americans with different religious backgrounds different political backgrounds different political beliefs and getting them united behind a common mission to serve our country and that i think is exactly the kind of leadership that we need from the next president of the united states inaudible terribly divisive time wallace i understand i aposm going to get into your foreign policy but what makes you think you have a i mean politics is practical politics is tough what makes you think you aposre one of what 22 in the field now what makes you think you have a chance there are a lot of people who are a lot better known than you are moulton because i aposm the only one with that experience i aposm the only one with that expense of uniting americans in the most difficult circumstances imaginable and i aposm also the only one in this race that is taking on donald trump on issues of security on strength on what we need to do to make america stronger on what it truly means to be a patriot i don apost believe that we can win this race if we don apost challenge donald trump not just on his job as president but in his job as commander in chief and we have to challenge them there if we aposre going to win wallace and and briefly because we aposre running out of time here what is because you say you keep talking about it aposs national security defense foreign policy what is the moulton foreign policy moulton we need a totally new generation of arms we need to be challenging china on developing artificial intelligence on building a cyber wall to protect america not building you know a fifth century border wall china had that debate 2 000 years ago about building a wall we need that new generation of alliances because we have to make nato relevant for today because russia is attacking us through the internet not by sending tanks into western europe and we need to make sure that we have a new generation of leaders to lead this charge i think it aposs time for the generation that went to iraq and afghanistan to take over for the generation that sent us there wallace i have about a minute left the dnc has set a june 12th deadline which is a month from today for deciding who is going to be in that first set of two debates at the end of june democratic presidential debates here are the criteria candidates must either raise money from at least 65 000 donors or have at least 1 percent support in three poles if you don apost qualify and you don apost end up getting on that debate stage for the first debates in june doesn apost that kill your candidacy before it aposs even really begun moulton no it doesn apost but we aposre on track to meet those goals you asked earlier you said earlier that i got into this late and i did and the reason i got in this race late is simple i have a seven month old daughter at home and leaving her at home to hit the campaign trail was not an easy decision i had never even been a father before but if there aposs a personal reason why i aposm doing this aside from trump and the policies and everything else it aposs that i want my daughter emmy to grow up and know that i did everything i could to serve this country wallace congressman thank you thanks for coming in we aposll be watching how the campaign goes safe travels on the campaign trail sir moulton thank you chris wallace president trump says joe biden aposs early surge in the polls reminds him of his own campaign back in 2016 we aposll ask our sunday panel about the democratic front runner aposs first weeks on the trail next commercial break begin video clip rep jerrold nadler d n y we aposve talked for a long time about approaching a constitutional crisis we are now in it we are now in a constitutional crisis trump he was a manhattan congressman at beat them all the time and i come to washington and now i have to beat them again over nothing over nothing over a hoax end video clip wallace well president trump and house judiciary committee chair jerry nadler two longtime adversaries now battling over house democrats demands for more information from robert mueller aposs russia investigation and we aposre back now with the panel josh your former boss senator mcconnell made pretty clear what the republican strategy is now on this whole investigation which is case closed one can he make that stick and two how angry are he and some of his republican other fellow republican senators at the fact that their colleague richard burr the chair of the senate intelligence committee has called subpoenaed don junior to come back and testify josh holmes former mcconnell chief of staff well on substance here there aposs just no question that it is case closed i mean the idea that chairman nadler in 15 house staffers that are sort of shuffling around the cannon building can come up with a more substantive case than bob mueller could over two years and 35 million is ridiculous i think where we find ourselves now and you hear chairman nadler talking about a constitutional crisis i mean what melodramatic nonsense that where we aposre at right now is that the chairman literally last week said that he hadn apost taken time himself to go down and read an un redacted report that is totally available to him because he couldn apost share it amongst his colleagues he couldn apost share it amongst his colleagues well it aposs a good thing that he aposs not running the intelligence committee i mean this is absolutely about the politics it aposs not about fact finding wallace all right really quick on don junior holmes yes so look the senate intelligence committee as best i understand it has a very different charter here what they aposre looking at is how and why the russians decided to infiltrate our election in order to determine how we can never ever ever experience that again so look in terms of the president aposs family i think we can all agree that they have been harassed far beyond where they needed to be harassed here over the last two years my hope is that they can figure out a way to take care of this very quickly and stop calling people up to the hill don junior and everybody else wallace real quickly jonathan swan national political reporter axios with respect to donald trump junior what i aposm hearing is that short of some sort of compromise the most likely scenario is that he will not exercise his fifth amendment rights that he will force congress the republican led senate to hold him in contempt and the idea being to inflict as much political pain as possible on the republicans who put him through this wallace and but and do you think that the republicans would do that i mean burr seems to be out by himself you think that the republican majority would vote don junior in contempt of congress holmes i don apost and i think that we aposre what we aposre looking for his information to sew this whole thing up i think you saw senator mcconnell this week on fox talk about how this is at the end stage of the game and they basically want to issue this report wallace juan how do you think you heard the case for the prosecution here how do you think house democrats are doing in keeping this whole issue alive juan williams political analyst well nancy pelosi actually i think was trying to restrain the leftist base instinct which is impeach i mean the number say democrats still would impeach the president pelosi was holding that back now i think we aposre in a situation over the last week or so chris where i think it aposs the president who seems to with his blanket refusal to cooperate with congress saying it aposs just a political operation not a legitimate inquiry not a matter of congressional oversight he is creating a crisis and i think he aposs forcing it towards the courts i think he sees political advantage in saying this is grievance this is harassment of my family as you just heard don junior never testified to bob mueller when he went up to the hill apparently he said things that were clearly not true about knowing about the construction of a trump tower in moscow so there aposs every reason to invite him back from richard burr and burr aposs no member of the house not a democrat a legitimate request but you hear case closed well if case is closed according to mitch mcconnell why then not just give these democrats what they want give them the report let don junior testify wallace because they don apost want to give them inaudible williams let don mcgahn testify wallace all right let me let me let me move williams why put pressure on don mcgahn and tell him make a statement say we never obstructed justice wallace ok we aposve got three minutes i want to talk about one more subject and that is joe biden who clearly has opened up a sizable lead in the democratic presidential race take a look at these polls in the latest realclearpolitics average of polls biden leads by almost 3 to 1 over bernie sanders in national polls almost 2 to 1 in new hampshire and as you can see narrowly in iowa kristen how real is biden aposs lead at this point and how do you explain it kristen soltis anderson washington examiner so he aposs a formidable front runner there aposs no question there aposs a long way to go until this primary is over but being out front by this kind of a margin is is very valuable and it aposs notable who he took vote share from which was bernie sanders in many polls early in this process you would see joe biden voters saying that bernie sanders was their second choice and bernie sanders voters saying joe biden was their second choice and some folks would say well that kind of seems strange right joe biden aposs a more establishment guy bernie sanders is way out on the left but really both of them have appeal to that kind of scranton joe union type worker someone who the type of voter you find a lot of in those blue wall states and so it makes sense that joe biden would sort of be able to draw some of that share from bernie sanders the question headed into 2020 is can he actually rebuild the blue wall for the democrats and do so while maintaining excitement and enthusiasm among the democrats wallace considered the blue ph wall ph of pennsylvania michigan wisconsin the upper upper rustbelt anderson that aposs right the states that were critical that president trump was able to flip wallace all right president trump is clearly taking joe biden seriously he continues to hammer him and the former vice president fires back take a look begin video clip trump one of the democrats today said that he it aposs a he a sleepy person said that he heard from a lot of foreign leaders and they want him to be president of course they do so they can continue to rip off the united states joe biden d presidential candidate folks above all else we must defeat donald trump end video clip wallace jonathan how preoccupied is the president with joe biden at this point how seriously does he and his political advisor how seriously do they take him swan they take him very seriously and i the sense i have from some of the them some of these advisers is they aposre actually surprised at how much of a lead he aposs opened up they were always worried about biden in a general election but the consensus a few months ago is he can never has no prayer of getting through this far left democratic primary so there aposs a little bit of uneasiness that wow maybe he could get through this democratic primary holmes let me just say i think an awful lot of this is at this stage is a function of name id and the two candidates with the highest name id are bernie sanders and joe biden wallace but but and i agree with that and that that explained it before he got in but now that he aposs gotten in his lead has has seems to have inaudible particularly because he aposs casting the race as him against trump holmes sure i i think he aposs at a high watermark right now and the whole goal of the biden campaign is to try to hold on for dear life the you saw this week with the climate change discussion wallace biden came hold on for dear ph life holmes yes wallace ok that aposs that aposs a talking point holmes i aposm very bearish on this wallace all right we aposve got to thanks panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week

policy buffett you can put a wall out in the middle of nowhere where people aren apost crossing and it aposs not going to do any good you can put a wall so far away from areas where where border patrol agents are stationed that you can apost apprehend anyone so it aposs it aposs it aposs not a simple solution wallace voice over back in 2006 warren buffett said he would give away 85 percent of
