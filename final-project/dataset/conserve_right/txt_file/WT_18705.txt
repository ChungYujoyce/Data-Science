apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president obama has dialed back his earlier optimistic assessment of global efforts to defeat al qaeda instead of nearing defeat the terrorist group is planting new roots in north africa and the middle east while running for re election two years ago mr obama suggested the war against al qaeda was nearly won u s counterterrorism efforts against the group led by osama bin laden had produced results he said during his nomination speech on sept 6 2012 a new tower rises above the new york skyline al qaeda is on the path to defeat and osama bin laden is dead the president told cheering democrats top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds in his fifth state of the union address to congress on tuesday mr obama offered a pessimistic analysis in a five sentence mention of al qaeda today the al qaeda danger remains he said while we ve put al qaeda s core leadership on a path to defeat the threat has evolved as al qaeda affiliates and other extremists take root in different parts of the world in yemen somalia iraq mali we have to keep working with partners to disrupt and disable these networks in syria we ll support the opposition that rejects the agenda of terrorist networks counterterrorism officials tell inside the ring that the president s policies have increased the danger of al qaeda terrorism against the u s and its allies libya and other parts of north africa have become an al qaeda safe haven said one official and al qaeda in the arabian peninsula continues to pose a serious threat to the yemeni government despite u s covert and overt support including drone strikes additionally the obama administration fearing backlash from muslims has no ideological programs against islamist extremism like those used during the cold war to defeat the soviet union director of national intelligence james r clapper told a senate hearing wednesday that the al qaeda threat is serious there are some five different franchises at least and 12 countries that this movement has morphed into and we see sort of chapters of it of course in yemen somalia north africa in syria etc crowdsourcing analysis the pentagon s defense science board has complimented a georgetown university arms control project for crowdsourcing commercial imagery and other open source data to reveal secrets about china s expanding nuclear arms program in a report made public last week on monitoring nuclear arms proliferation the board stated that commercial imagery analysis by nongovernmental experts should be used for identifying nuclear programs and the threat of proliferation the report urged using the method despite concerns that crowdsourcing often produces lower quality data and analysis one example of a crowdsourcing success was the georgetown university arms control project headed by phillip karber who with the help of students exposed for the first time new details of china s 3 000 mile long network of tunnels for nuclear weapons the project began in 2008 and by late 2009 china for the first time went public with some details about what has come to be known as the great underground wall of nuclear facilities using open source information for the past several years the internet local chinese news reports google earth and online photos posted by chinese citizens the students have published a far reaching paper that challenges assumptions made by the intelligence community on china s nuclear weapons capability the report said the board also noted that the crowdsourcing project triggered an extensive debate on the accuracy of the report which was completed without access to classified data and warned it could have serious political and military implications some analysts challenged the georgetown study because one of its sources was a fictional chinese television program about the second artillery corps which runs china s strategic nuclear forces whether the report is completely accurate or not this event provides a proof of concept on how crowdsourcing can be used to augment limited analytical capacity the defense science board said adding that u s intelligence should set up a process to support crowdsourcing that would ensure that a non prejudicial process is established whereby open source and mainstream intelligence assessments can be reconciled the georgetown study caught u s intelligence agencies off guard and triggered a debate over the number of warheads in china s nuclear arsenal official intelligence estimates put the number at some 200 to 300 warheads other analysts have challenged that estimate based on china s fissile material production capability and increasing number of nuclear missile and other forces economic warfare threats the u s remains vulnerable to cyberattacks on its economy by al qaeda and other terrorist groups as well as by nation states like china that s the conclusion of a new book by financial analyst kevin freeman game plan how to protect yourself from the coming cyber economic attack mr freeman who initially exposed in a pentagon report the possible sabotage leading to the 2008 financial collapse reports that al qaeda leader ayman al zawahri threatened last year to bleed america economically al qaeda is not alone in recognizing america s economic vulnerabilities mr freeman writes russia china iran north korea venezuela and a host of other regimes have at one time or another suggested that america could be taken down by economic warfare mr freeman recounts another major indicator of strategic vulnerability to economic warfare namely the syrian electronic army s cyberattack on the associated press twitter account that caused a temporary 1 percent drop in the stock market army gen keith b alexander outgoing head of the national security agency and u s cyber command recently bolstered mr freeman s warning during a 60 minutes interview i believe that a foreign nation could impact and destroy major portions of our financial system gen alexander said noting that right now it would be difficult to stop such a cyber attack because our ability to see it is limited mr freeman s book explores the variety of malicious economic and cyber warfare threats the economy faces including hyperinflation dollar failure banking collapse and electromagnetic pulse strikes you haven t seen anything yet mr freeman told inside the ring the next attack is coming and will be worse than 9 11 and the 2008 financial collapse combined china s space weapons congressional testimony this week reveals that china is expanding its space warfare capabilities that are designed to kill u s satellites in a future conflict ashley j tellis a former state department and national security council official told a house armed services subcommittee hearing that china has an array of new weapons for attacking u s military and other satellites the arsenal includes soft kill weapons which disrupt satellite operations and hard kill missiles which ram into satellites and create massive debris fields china used the latter in january 2007 when it conducted a hard kill test on a weather satellite thousands of shards continue to race about in orbit threatening manned and unmanned satellites mr tellis now with the carnegie endowment for international peace listed the chinese space arsenal in prepared testimony made public tuesday the weapons include a space object surveillance and identification system using advanced optical and radar systems ground based and orbiting anti satellite systems including missiles and robots with extender arms that can grab or disrupt satellites high and low power lasers and high powered microwave weapons that disrupt satellite electronics electronic jammers that can paralyze u s satellite communications on military and civilian wavelengths computer network attack capabilities that can disrupt cyber systems of space based and ground networks military capabilities including precision strike missiles and special forces commandos that would attack ground stations and other control systems additionally mr tellis said china s military can conduct the samson option nuclear explosions in space to destroy satellites or disrupt their electronics via the blasts and accompanying electromagnetic pulses mr tellis offered a dire assessment of the space warfare threat during a joint hearing of the house s strategic forces and seapower subcommittees the dangers emanating from china s counter space investments are real and growing and the diversity of chinese counter space activities ensures that almost every u s space component the space systems in orbit the links that control them and channel their data and their associated ground facilities will face grave perils as current chinese counter space programs mature and their technologies are integrated into the people s liberation army s warfighting arsenal former special operations forces commando bill cowan tells inside the ring that the u s military today depends heavily on global positioning system satellites and that disrupting the network would devastate global military operations our military today is totally reliant on the gps system for targeting navigating maneuvering positioning battlefield and situational awareness etc mr cowan said there is no backup if the chinese only knock out our gps system we become totally ineffective con
