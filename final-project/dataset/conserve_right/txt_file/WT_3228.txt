investigation of himself but escaped prosecution because of the intercession of an attorney general more loyal to him than to the u s constitution at the outset of his presidency mr trump took the presidential oath of office promising that he would faithfully execute his obligation to preserve protect and defend the constitution james madison the scrivener of the constitution insisted that the word faithfully be in the presidential oath and that the oath itself be in the constitution to remind presidents to enforce laws and comply with constitutional provisions whether or not they agree with them and to immunize the oath from congressional alteration top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots earlier this week mr trump referred to a clause in the constitution as phony and he thereby implied that he need not abide it nor enforce it notwithstanding his oath here is the backstory the constitution was written in philadelphia during the summer of 1787 the framers the 55 state delegates to the constitutional convention who authored the constitution had just completed fighting the revolutionary war which had ended six years earlier while americans universally revere the american revolution today that was not the case at the time it was fought professor bernard bailyn of harvard whose 75 years of professional study of the colonial mindset is without peer has argued that in the 1780s about one third of the colonists supported the revolution while around the same number favored staying in the british empire and about the same number were indifferent by 1787 according to mr bailyn there were substantial groups of wealthy persons in america who retained their loyalty to the british king and there were government officials here who had originally obtained their jobs by royal appointment mr bailyn has documented fatal violence occurring on american soil between americans loyal to the king and americans loyal to the principles of the declaration of independence after the british surrender in 1781 and even after the signing of the treaty of paris in 1783 all of this was known to the framers who feared the resurgence of british influence in the american government their fears centered around the corruption induced by titles of nobility which in those days were often accompanied by lands and income and gifts of money or real estate in order to allay those fears and assure americans that officials in the new federal government would be immune from foreign seduction the framers included the emoluments clause in the constitution that clause prohibits all federal officials from receiving titles of nobility and any gift income or fee of any kind whatever from a foreign government the constitution is known for phrases of generality and elasticity the meanings of which are often capable of reinterpretation by modern standards this is not so for the emoluments clause it originally presented and continues to present an absolute prohibition of the receipt of anything of value by a federal government officeholder from a foreign government last week mick mulvaney the president s acting chief of staff announced a novel interpretation of this clause contending that it only prohibited profits to federal officeholders from foreign governments by that interpretation mr mulvaney announced mr trump was able to offer a resort in south f orida owned substantially by a family corporation he controls as the host of his next meeting of g 7 a group that includes heads of government from six foreign countries so long as the resort did not earn a profit from the gathering after a weekend of torrential criticism mr trump announced that he had changed his mind and said he would not host the g 7 meeting at the miami area resort yet in the process of doing so he characterized the emoluments clause as phony who knows what he meant by phony the clause is in the constitution and it means what it says yet whatever mr trump meant by phony it constituted at least a disparagement of the constitution he has sworn to uphold and at worst a threat to ignore clauses he can disparage this is most unusual and potentially dangerous and it raises the question can the president lawfully enforce only the clauses of the constitution with which he agrees and ignore those with which he disagrees in a word no the doctrine of the separation of powers which is the backbone of the constitution states that congress writes the laws the president enforces them and the courts interpret them it also offers that the governmental roles of the three branches cannot be intermingled or traded without doing violence to the personal liberties that the separation was intended to secure if the president could pick and choose which laws to enforce and which parts of the constitution to ignore he effectively would be deciding what the laws mean a judicial function and which laws have vitality and which do not a congressional function mr trump has become known for forceful and often tasteless banter he publicly calls people crude names uses foul language and sends dog whistles of lawless behavior to much of his base all that is a question of free speech personal taste and political risk but threats to ignore parts of the u s constitution are not matters of speech taste or risk they reveal character traits that
