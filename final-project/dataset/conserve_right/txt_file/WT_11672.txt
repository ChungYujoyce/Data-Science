apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic bangkok as its prime minister prepares to meet with president obama at a high profile summit of southeast asian leaders thailand s coup installed government is writing a new constitution that opposition parties and human rights groups fear will extend its domination backed by a new legislature stacked with pro junta appointees critics say the draft constitution will cement the power of prime minister prayuth chan ocha the former general who took power in a military coup nearly two years ago and shows no signs of preparing to step aside mr prayuth s untimely push for a new constitution points up the balancing act the obama administration has faced dealing with the new government bangkok has long been a key u s ally in the region but the government s anti democratic tendencies and persistent courting by china have put heavy strains on the bilateral relationship the political instability also has contributed to three straight years of falling exports top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the release of a proposed constitution with parliamentary elections put off until 2017 when the current government s hold on power is expected to increase has sparked a sharp response the draft charter has already been branded by opponents of the military government as a dictator s charter or the constitution that cheats and steals the power of the people the bangkok post said in an editorial friday the revamped constitution may allow a planned national strategic reform and reconciliation committee nicknamed the crisis panel to seize all executive and legislative power from the government and parliament in an emergency the committee will get involved only after the country is at a dead end defense minister prawit wongsuwon said last year we don t want a coup to take place again said mr prawit who participated in a 2014 putsch that brought mr prayuth a former top general to power meechai ruchupan the 77 year old chairman of the committee drafting the constitution told reporters last month that it was meant to address long standing weaknesses in thai democracy and lawmaker misbehavior and acknowledged that some of the solutions may be too tough for the system if we are to reform the country we have to use strong medicine even if political parties do not agree mr meechai told the reuters news agency in a recent interview i can t promise it will be thailand s last constitution the committee may be reconfigured because critics described it as a sinister virtual state within a state including top figures in the army air force and navy the government is dictating the drafting of what would be this buddhist majority country s 20th constitution previous charters were trashed every time the military seized power or other problems arose each constitution survived an average of four years after the first one was written when a coup abolished the absolute monarchy in 1932 many people are afraid to directly criticize the draft constitution because of the regime s frequently shifting punishments against free speech enforced by threats to seize assets and military trials for civilian dissidents who express themselves i confirm that we will have an election in the year 2017 that s for sure mr prawit recently told reporters indicating that even if the constitution is unpopular elections will be held a previous draft was rejected in september squabbling has emerged over the newest draft raising fears that elections may be delayed until 2018 or indefinitely perhaps as part of a plot by the junta according to some critics when mr prayuth chan ocha organized the may 2014 coup he repeatedly promised elections in 2015 and 2016 those promises appear to be falling by the wayside do you want to have elections tomorrow what will you do if bad people are elected he said to journalists feb 2 go ahead and criticize me as if i care you just wait and see if the country ends up in ruins don t blame me the prime minister grumbled at stupid reporters who asked about the constitution and other issues if you don t want changes we all should prepare to die we will have to depart from this world from the international community no one would want to have a relationship with thailand if we continue to be mired in conflict he said as he repeatedly slammed his hand on his lectern don t you know we are in for starvation in another worrisome sign according to democracy activists the chairman of the constitution drafting committee also authored a 1991 constitution enabling an unelected general to become prime minister outsiders and emergencies under the new constitution an unelected outsider could become prime minister endorsed by parliament if a crisis arises critics fear a pro junta outsider will be boosted to become premier perhaps mr prayuth himself though he denied wanting to stay on parliament would have two houses but its senate may include a majority of government appointees the junta is quite clear its powers will end more or less not with the next elected government but only four years perhaps more after the latter had started its work michael h nelson a faculty of law research fellow at bangkok s thammasat university said in an analysis of the draft the military s current direct rule of three years plus will thereby be complemented by at least four years of indirect military rule additionally the constitutional court will continue to decide the fates of politicians who fall afoul of the charter s laws or if a crisis remains unresolved during the past decade that constitutional court ruled against several elected politicians effectively ending their careers similarly the national anti corruption commission will continue its ability to ban candidates deemed unworthy or dishonest from office the government is already campaigning for a yes vote for the constitution in a nationwide referendum tentatively scheduled for the end of july or early august after the referendum the government appointed national legislative assembly will weigh 10 organic laws on how to stage an election and procedures for the constitutional court and national anti corruption commission the draft charter meets international standards with a thai identity that can be used appropriately to solve past problems said government spokesman col piyapong klinphan the constitution s supporters insist that it will stop corrupt politicians from reviving the previous elected government s dictatorship of the majority which is accused of looting this southeast asian nation s investments and resources and leading to an extended period of factionalism and infighting supporters of mr prayuth s coup point to the wealthy populist shinawatra clan which has produced three prime ministers thaksin shinawatra his younger sister yingluck and their brother in law somchai wongsawat thaksin shinawatra is now an international fugitive dodging a two year prison sentence for corruption during his 2001 2006 tenure yingluck shinawatra currently barred from running for office is free on 860 000 bail and is forbidden to leave thailand during her trial at the supreme court s criminal division for political office holders on charges of negligence while overseeing her administration s rice crop subsidies on friday she held her first news conference since the 2014 coup and reiterated her innocence the constitution s lengthy list of 270 sections is to prevent the shinawatra family and their allies from being elected again and limit the power of big political parties contrary to a popular 1997 constitution that the junta canceled after a 2006 coup the drafting process has been overshadowed throughout by the compelling concern to take this opportunity to finally thwart the decade plus influence of the shinawatra family said titipol phakdeewanich dean of the faculty of political science at ubon ratchathani university it is more than likely that prime minister prayuth chan ocha s military junta will remain essentially in power even if we have elections in 2017 albeit with a new prime minister mr titipol said sunday in an email interview if a widespread no vote damages the public referendum the draft may be tweaked some kind of settlement is needed between the conservatives and the rural and urban working class and lower middle class voters whom thaksin really brought into the political system said a scholar of southeast asia who asked not to be identified because of his research my sense is that even the conservatives realize that elections are needed soon because the military is too backward hopeless at government and an embarrassment the scholar said in an email interview friday mr prayuth staged his 2014 coup after weeks of political street clashes killed dozens of people society was so polarized that families often bickered at dinner tables because relatives supported opposing sides after his coup mr prayuth became prime minister and granted his ruling allies blanket amnesty from prosecution weary of the spiraling political chaos and worried about thailand s dreary economy many thais are biding their time hoping to fast forward to the next election amid hopes that this country can eventually restore its democracy and repair its international image i fear we are headed towards the political system of the people s republic of china former academic burin kantabutra said sunday in an email interview i think that post charter postelection thai politics will be a train wreck mr burin said thaksin shinawatra s still considerable number of supporters known as red shirts are expected to oppose the constitution the red shirts will vote to reject this charter in the referendum red shirt chairman jatuporn prompan told reporters thursday yingluck shinawatra pressed the prayuth government to expedite the constitutional process and hold elections saying they were needed to boost growth and ease investor concerns about thailand s stability you have to live with this constitution so please make sure it fits with thailand it fits with the whole country she told bloomberg
