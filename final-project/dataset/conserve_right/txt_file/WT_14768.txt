refugees human rights groups have long accused china of oppressing its roughly 10 million uighurs with severe restrictions on language culture and religion and inflaming a cycle of resentment and

expanded its presence in the middle east and offered itself as a mediator in the region s conflicts but it has not shied from calling for help either at beijing s request egyptian police in recent
