apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a senior navy intelligence official issued a blunt warning last week that china s growing hegemonistic threat to security is destabilizing the asia pacific region make no mistake the chinese navy is focused on war at sea and about sinking an opposing fleet said capt james fanell deputy chief of staff for intelligence and information operations at the u s pacific fleet at a defense conference in san diego on jan 31 the comments come amid growing tensions between japan and china over chinese claims to the senkaku islands near okinawa and taiwan as well as increasing chinese military assertiveness in the south china sea top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches china s navy is escalating efforts to gain control of what beijing calls near seas by using civil proxy maritime security ships capt fanell said they now regularly challenge exclusive economic zone resource rights that south korea japan the philippines malaysia brunei indonesia and vietnam once thought were guaranteed to them by the united nations convention on the law of the sea he said the chinese naval harassment expanded outward over time to cover most of the south china sea and east china sea china is challenging other nations rights he said under the rubric of what s mine is mine and we ll negotiate what s yours china now has eight military installations on seven reefs in the spratly islands claimed by the philippines chinese surveillance ships in the region have no other mission but to harass other nations into submitting to china s claims capt fanell said noting that for beijing the sea surveillance agency is a full time maritime sovereignty harassment organization with no other mission capt fanell said his use of terms expansion and expand to describe chinese activities might be considered controversial and could be used by critics to promote the caricature of a pentagon that is promoting what china calls the china threat theory but for those of us who have watched this on a daily basis over the last decade there is no better description for what china has been doing he said china s seizure last year of scarborough shoal a reef claimed by the philippines is a clear example of chinese aggression he said adding that in carrying out the aggression china bullies its adversary as part of a careful series of actions and statements predictably china s conduct is destabilizing the east asia maritime environment he said chinese aggressiveness has increased the welcome for the u s navy by all states in the region concerned about a hegemonic china he said we now have more places to send ships than we have ships to send them he added china should become a non threatening power not the mistrusted principal threat it s become capt fanell said china s rapidly modernizing naval forces have expanded sea zones of control in the past five years the result is that chinese navy ships moved from operating in near seas areas close to china s coasts into distant seas that include international waters capt fanell said at the u s naval institute conference the expansion into blue waters are largely about countering the u s pacific fleet he said noting that the chinese navy has become a very capable fighting force in 2012 china sent seven surface action groups and the largest number of submarines into the philippine sea in china s history capt fanell said a defense official compared capt fanell to maj gen h r mcmaster an iconoclastic army officer who in 1997 criticized senior military brass in a book on the vietnam war that many thought ended his career however gen mcmaster was protected from cautious military bureaucrats by other out of the box thinkers such as gen david h petraeus showing such intellectual courage should count the defense official said of capt fanell and his career should be protected by senior officers real time cybersecurity amid growing reports that chinese hackers attacked u s newspapers and the energy department a security startup company recently announced it is offering new technology that its founders say can detect cyberattacks and counter them in real time the cupertino calif based company taasera inc last week launched the new cyberattack detection software that can identify normally unseen cyberstrikes as they take place a key advantage that could allow stopping electronic attacks before information is stolen or networks compromised they key difference for the new software is that it operates inside networks not on the perimeter and has shown unique capabilities for spotting attacks the company also is providing a threat intelligence data system that allows the identification of suspicious network behavior to be reported faster than current security systems company executives disclosed details of the new software during a recent interview with inside the ring attack points are increasing and trying to stop them with firewall or anti virus software is really not an effective defense any more said srinivas kumar the company s chief technology officer cyberattackers know how to hide their identities and gain the trust of anti virus software real time monitoring allows attacks to be thwarted rapidly mr kumar added david c nevin a senior taasera executive said the company s threat reporting system mines data and identifies who is attacking and where their attacks originate the most prevalent country attacking government institutions is china mr nevin said but it s different if you start looking at the financial sector he said there it s russia and frankly it s the united states as well and in particular long island seems to have a very high prevalence of attackers hitting the financial sector ceo c scott hartz said the software is being sold to government customers the financial services industry public utilities and other critical infrastructure as well as the health care industry and retail businesses that use credit cards we have a stream of threat intelligence that identifies the bad things that are out there in the world mr hartz said the software was developed over the past five years and licensed from sri international it is currently in use at a number of government agencies that use the real time anti cyberattack monitoring system air force adds gay lawyers political correctness in the air force reached new heights this month when the air force judge advocate general corps announced plans to hire gay lawyers as part of its diversity program the corps values diversity as one of the great strengths and to that end aggressively takes part in all manner of outreach and recruiting at national diversity related events air force maj sean m elameto chief of the service s legal recruiting efforts stated in an air force newsletter past locations for lawyer recruiting took place at meetings of the national bar association hispanic national bar association the asian pacific american bar association and other law student groups he said this year we hit a historic milestone by recruiting at the lavender law convention an annual career fair for lesbian gay and bisexual attorneys maj elameto stated the air force receives 20 applications many from graduates of top law schools for each jag entry position said one military critic of the policy instead of seeking the best qualified applicants the politically correct service is now spending money to recruit at the lavender law convention rather than simply consider best qualified applicants without preference or prejudice as to gender religious beliefs or sexual preference looks like fraud waste abuse and discrimination to me the official said dissolving military electronics the pentagon s defense advanced research projects agency is looking for ways to make sensitive electronic equipment disappear like the covert self destructing audiotape in mission impossible the agency stated in a notice posted on is website jan 28 that sophisticated electronics used on the battlefield from radios to sensors and phones are needed for war fighting but are impossible to track and recover if lost so the agency revealed its vanishing programmable resources program that it hopes will result in electronics capable of dissolving into the environment around them the electronic devices would keep functionality and ruggedness but when triggered would be able to degrade partially or completely into their surroundings the agency said once triggered to dissolve these electronics would be useless to any enemy who might come across them the agency is looking for a way to make electronics that last precisely as long as they are needed program manager alicia jackson said the breakdown of such devices could be triggered by a signal sent from command or any number of possible environmental conditions such as temperature the agency is looking for contractors to work on materials devices manufacturing and integration
