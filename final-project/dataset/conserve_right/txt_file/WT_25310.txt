tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion there s hate and then there s robert de niro level of hate on sunday morning on live cnn tv on an interview with host brian stelter on reliable sources hollywood s de niro dropped a couple of f bombs about president donald trump and fox news on a channel that even little children could regularly watch top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches there s no way around it de niro said in answer to stelter s question about possible impeachment this guy has done everything possible much worse than i ever thought ever the day after he was elected i said well i ll give him a chance you never know he is worse than i ever could have imagined this guy should not be president period de niro then went on to talk about the crazy world in which we all live and that if it weren t for cnn msnbc and some other outlets the new york times the washington post america would be in deep trouble on the true news front in some ways i think trump is putting on a performance as i think some of these other pundits on fox are too because i can t believe that they would actually buy into this craziness de niro said and then stelter said this when you say that folks on fox come after you and then de niro said this f em f em and then stelter helpfully added this this is cable so it s not an fcc violation but it s still a sunday morning right it s still live tv it s still a supposed television news segment de niro s been equally vulgar in the past in 2018 at the tony awards he made national headlines by calling out f trump while on stage with the cameras rolling censors managed to bleep him then but cnn viewers on sunday weren t so lucky sorry de niro said but let me say something we are at a moment in our lives in this country this guy is like a gangster he s come along and he s said things and we ve said over and over again this is terrible this is a terrible situation and this guy just keeps going on and on and on without being stopped well then there you have it leftist logic trump is like a gangster who can t be stopped so dropping f bombs during live national news broadcasts is justified that s not just poor manners that s deranged that s a sign of a mental meltdown notably the very same thing of which de niro is accusing trump cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
