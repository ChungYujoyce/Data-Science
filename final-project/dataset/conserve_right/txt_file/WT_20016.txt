apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap asserting congressional authority over war making powers the house passed a resolution wednesday that would force the administration to withdraw u s troops from involvement in yemen in a rebuke of president donald trump s alliance with the saudi led coalition behind the military intervention lawmakers in both parties are increasingly uneasy over the humanitarian crisis in yemen and skeptical of the u s partnership with that coalition especially in light of saudi arabia s role in the killing of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi a critic of the royal family passage would mark the first time congress has relied on the decades old war powers resolution to halt military intervention it also would set up a potential confrontation with the white house which has threatened a veto the house voted 248 177 to approve the measure sending it to the senate where a similar resolution passed last year top stories sex at

elections ballots we have helped create and worsen the world s largest humanitarian crisis said rep barbara lee d calif during the debate our involvement in this war quite frankly is shameful the chairman of the house foreign relations committee rep eliot engel d n y said the vote represents congress reclaiming its role in foreign policy senate approval would set up a showdown with the administration a veto would be trump s first over the president s shifting approach on foreign policy lawmakers are quick to point out that trump wants to withdraw troops from the wars in syria and afghanistan as part of his america first approach but he has shown less interest in limiting the u s role in yemen the white house says the house resolution is flawed because u s troops are not directly involved in military action in yemen where the coalition is fighting the iranian backed houthi rebels in a conflict largely seen as a proxy war involving the mideast s dominant regional players since 2015 the administration says the u s has provided support to the coalition including intelligence and until recently aerial refueling but it has not had forces involved in hostilities congress has not invoked the war power resolution which requires approval of military actions since it was enacted in 1973 lawmakers approved more sweeping authorizations for the wars in iraq and afghanistan that some argue are being used too broadly for other military actions newly emboldened democrats in the house eager to confront trump on foreign policy and republicans in both chambers have shown a willingness to put a legislative check on the president s agenda in the house 18 republicans including members of the gop s libertarian leaning wing and trump allies in the conservative freedom caucus joined democrats in passing the yemen measure rep ro khanna d calif who drafted the legislation said there s an emerging bipartisan alliance that s skeptical of military intervention without congressional oversight it s not just about yemen it s about the congress taking a stand and every future president having to think twice about whether to authorize a military intervention without congressional approval khanna said in an interview the senate version is from independent sen bernie sanders of vermont and backed by utah republican sen mike lee before wednesday s vote the house overwhelmingly agreed to add an amendment offered by republicans who are seeking to expose emerging democratic divisions over support for israel the amendment reaffirms the u s commitment to

support of some lawmakers first term rep ilhan omar d minn one of the muslim american women elected to congress came under criticism this week for her comments against the israel lobbying organization aipac that raised anti semitic stereotypes she later apologized the house added another gop amendment that would allow continued intelligence sharing which drew fire from the american civil liberties union the aclu warned it gives the president broad authority to provide the saudis and others with u s intelligence information about yemen and the group said the package overall is now weaker than originally proposed now the yemen measure goes to the senate where a similar resolution on removing u s involvement in the war was approved with republican support late last year at the time congress was eager to send a message to both the president and the saudis after the october murder of the u s based journalist khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul the u s has sanctioned 17 saudi individuals for their involvement in the killing and u s intelligence officials have concluded that the saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman must have at least known of the plot trump so far has
