people famous for the terracotta army statues for cowboys and indians balance when he was planning the cody side trip zheng said i did consider staying in a teepee buses carrying perhaps 50 tourists making one night stopovers or lunch time pauses make up the majority of chinese tourists to cody but more families are flying to large regional cities such as salt lake city or denver renting cars and touring on their own we are seeing more multi generational families taking trips that are more experientially based said cody country chamber of commerce executive director tina hoebelheinrich that means the tourists might fire guns instead of merely gazing out windows at sagebrush those on their own pick up brochures and see what they can see in cody that s in addition to yellowstone the main destination for the region its status secure as the jewel enticing travelers to the gateway communities increase in visitors the triggering event for the influx of more chinese tourists to the united states and wyoming was the november 2014 agreement between president barack obama and chinese leadership at the asia pacific economic cooperation summit in beijing there the u s and china adopted a 10 year reciprocal visa program for tourists and businesspeople that elevated china to the first rank of tourism partners alongside european nations replacing a previous one year visa travel limitation now they are getting more visas easily said chris lam operator of the hong kong restaurant in cody for 30 years in the three years since the agreement he has seen huge growth in chinese visitors to cody now we get more and more individuals lam said every year it is more and more that is the case all over the u s in 2005 there were 270 000 chinese visitors in 2013 it was 1 8 million this year the

revolution was deng xiaoping who consolidated power in 1978 the economic juggernaut china is today stems from his market reforms american writer orville schell 77 who has reported on china since 1970 neatly encapsulated china s shift from communism to a more capitalistic society in an aptly named 1984 book called to get rich is glorious and glorious it has been for many of china s 1 4 billion people the country that makes up 18 5 percent of the world s population was projected on business insider s website last year to be endowed with a middle class of 550 million people by 2022 dwarfing the entire current u s population of 326 million millions of people formerly trapped in a rural existence with no freedom to travel only a generation ago now have money to wander and spend lavishly on souvenirs older chinese with the means sign up for a bus tour and seek the comforting aid of a guide a tour guide named ray 33 who wrote his last name in a chinese character is based in los angeles after growing up in china he was passing through cody leading a group of 40 chinese men and women on a tour of los angeles arizona las vegas utah and wyoming that included national park stops in

wyoming after two weeks in china eldredge declared china is an opening market in the three years since the boom in chinese travel eldredge foresaw by reading the characters on the great wall has come true buffalo bill cody traveled more miles than marco polo but he did not bring his wild west show to china somehow cody transported a cast of hundreds of people and hundreds of livestock to far off lands but china was too preoccupied with its own affairs to become much enamored of the old west cody spread the word about cowboys and indians battle of the little bighorn and the deadwood stage throughout europe but it is only much more recently chinese people accustomed to hoeing land from dawn to dusk and riding bicycles acquired free time automobiles and television sets independent television is showing 1950s and 1960s westerns eldredge said that s how zheng s parents know who john wayne is even if the chinese weren t on the buffalo bill bandwagon now the center is trying to woo them marketing director bruce sauers said he learned on that china journey of 2014 everyone knew where yellowstone was eldredge and sauers recognized with that bridge crossed the rest was up to them a glossy chinese travel magazine escape includes a full page center ad duplicating an old buffalo bill wild west poster the museum has maps and brochures in chinese and the gift shop can ship anywhere in the world sauers said for many years a goods deprived society now the chinese are the no 1 spenders in international travel he said sauers estimated the center gets 1 000 chinese tourists annually 75 percent arriving by motor coach representing a slight increase each year recently it s just trending up as attendance grows the center may hire a chinese speaker as a summer employee he said the cowboy and buffalo bill element is not yet a driving force bringing chinese to cody they re interested in the west the wide open spaces eldredge said we sure do have a lot of that here true the population density of wyoming is six people per square mile even though china is the largest country in the world with 3 7 million square miles its population density is 383 and rapid growth in chinese cities led to industrial pollution kenneth zheng s relatives remarked upon those things for them to come here and see blue sky they were impressed he said they also thought why are there so few people wyoming has 500 000 people that s like a township in china regional shift cody is not the only place on the outskirts of yellowstone experiencing this changing tourist demographic many buses to yellowstone approach the park from jackson hole especially if they stop in grand teton first part of the wealthiest county in america jackson hole has more high end shopping jewelry stores and art galleries than cody west yellowstone montana currently has seven chinese restaurants a number that has expanded rapidly there are a lot said marysue costello executive director of west yellowstone s chamber of commerce her chamber has a website in mandarin chinese signs posted in shop windows around town are in chinese and business is good it has meant hotels and vacation rentals fairly strong retail and good business for restaurants she said west yellowstone long known as a snowmobiling hub has recently fielded inquiries about its snowy season costello added we are starting to hear from winter tour groups she said people are looking for less crowded times cody competes for hotel stays with jackson hole and west yellowstone and chinese tour buses generally spend more time often two nights in those other communities in cody it is basically one and done with a bus load of perhaps 50 chinese tourists arriving in early evening chowing down sleeping and being on the highway

the change on the visa policy and jumped into the china market three years ago chinese visitors represented 2 percent of our business blair said two years ago it was 5 percent now it is 8 percent we will probably cap it at 12 to 15 percent lam whose hong kong restaurant hours are 3 p m midnight gets customers walking over from the nearby holiday inn he recommends tour guides extend their visits in cody to see the museum and attend a rodeo in the rodeo capital of the world people want to stay longer in the park lam said but when it s dark you go nowhere i always push them to do other things there is no obvious outpouring of chinese tourists at the rodeo however one night in june half dozen chinese men showed up decked out in new cowboys hats and boots and climbed on mongo the bull for 10 photo ops john zhang operator of china town restaurant with wife lu yi said customers are showing increased interest in the cowboy way they want to know where they can buy cowboy boots he said they
