impeachment hearing blitz after two weeks and 12 witnesses what more do we know gordon sondland u s ambassador to the european union everyone was in the loop it was no secret dr fiona hill former white house advisor on russia i did say to him ambassador sondland gordon i think this is all going to blow up wallace as the investigation moves to the house judiciary committee new questions about how the process will play out rep nancy pelosi d ca speaker of the house we aposll go where the facts take us rep adam schiff d ca there is nothing more dangerous than an unethical president who believes they are above the law rep jim jordan r oh putting the country through this is not healthy particularly 11 months before the next election wallace we aposll discuss a potential senate trial with republican senator john kennedy and asked congressman eric swalwell are democrats and too much of a hurry then ten candidates take the stage in the fifth democratic debate we aposll ask our sunday panel about the state of the race as we look ahead to the first in the nation contest and our power player of the week going viral by giving away cash on twitter all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington well after 30 hours of public hearings house democrats are entering what may be the final phase of their impeachment investigation the house intel committee is writing a report to send to the judiciary committee which would write articles of impeachment a full house vote could come by christmas a senate trial would follow in 2020 a move president trump says he aposd welcome meanwhile we aposre learning some of the main conclusion of that inspector general aposs report on how the fbi conducted its investigation into possible links between the trump campaign and russia in a moment we aposll talk with republican senator john kennedy but first let aposs bring in kevin corke with the latest from the white house kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent legally justified with no political bias that aposs expected to be the findings of a soon to be released inspector general aposs report on the fbi aposs opening at the trump russia probe into the trump campaign leading up to the 2016 campaign however there aposs also some criticism about surveillance of onetime aide carter page leading up to the campaign begin videotape corke however those familiar with the report aposs findings also say its author michael horowitz will cite serious missteps by officials including the alleged alteration of an email by an fbi lawyer the report which reportedly has launched criminal referrals is expected to be revealed december then followed two days later by horowitz aposs testimony on capitol hill where over a two week span a dozen witnesses testified arming democrats with material to consider writing articles of impeachment and republicans plotting ph a senate trial that the president says he wants this while one of the key figures at the center of the ukraine controversy the president aposs private attorney rudy giuliani insists he aposs done nothing wrong ed henry fox news chief national correspondent are you afraid mr mayor that you could be indicted rudy giuliani president trump aposs personal attorney do you think i aposm afraid henry i don apost know giuliani do you think i get afraid henry well giuliani i did the right thing i represented my clients in a very very effective way i was so effective that i discovered a pattern of corruption that the washington press has been covering up for three or four years end videotape corke so while the public phase of the impeachment inquiry appears to be over the house intelligence committee could still interview more witnesses in that inquiry of course send that report over to judiciary where they will ultimately make the decision whether or not to move forward with articles of impeachment chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thanks joining us now louisiana senator john kennedy a republican on the senate judiciary committee and senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen john kennedy r la thank you chris wallace president trump has been pushing a narrative for years that the fbi and other agencies of the government engaged in a conspiracy first to spy on his campaign and then to try to end or oust him from the presidency here he is just a couple of days ago begin video clip trump this was spying on my campaign something that has never been done in the history of country this was an overthrow attempt at the presidency end video clip wallace but as we aposve reported the inspector general is expected to find that yes there was some misconduct a low level fbi lawyer may have actually doctored a document which would be very troubling but on the other hand that there was a proper basis for opening the trump russia investigation not political bias does that blow a hole in what the president has been saying kennedy i haven apost read the report here aposs what i think right now i think the fbi is the premier law enforcement agency in all of human history i also think that there were a handful of men and women at the fbi and possibly in other agencies who in 2016 acted on their political beliefs both against president trump and against secretary clinton now whether whether that activity rose to some inappropriate level i aposm going to wait and read the report mr horowitz is a serious intelligent man and i will read his report with interest wallace yes we should point out michael horowitz of course is the inspector general for the justice department again i just want to press a little bit on this with you senator the i g report is expected to say that yes there was this low level lawyer at the fbi who doctored a document that aposs alarming it could be critical but here are his main conclusions i g aposs the opening of the trump russia investigation was legitimate and reportedly there is no finding that james comey or andrew mccabe or peter strzok took actions based on political bias if that aposs we have newspaper reports we haven apost read the report directly but if that aposs what the inspector general finds will you accept that sir kennedy well there aposs this person running around washington d c chris by the name of anonymous source and he keeps repeatedly getting quoted in articles i aposm not saying you do that but others do and until i read the report i aposm not going to draw conclusions based on allegations by the anonymous source i will read mr horowitz aposs report carefully i aposll draw my own conclusions after reading mr strzok aposs emails and ms page aposs emails and watching mr comey aposs behavior particularly with respect to secretary clinton i think any fair minded american would look at those actions and say there aposs a real possibility those people acted on their political beliefs now if mr horowitz says otherwise i aposll consider it carefully but i aposm going to read the report wallace all right let aposs turn to the impeachment hearings and let aposs look at some of the highlights over the last two weeks here they are begin video clip bill taylor u s envoy to ukraine the meeting president zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of burisma and alleged ukrainian interference in the 2016 u s elections lt col alexander vindman white house nsc ukraine expert it is improper to demand a foreign government investigate a u s citizen and a political opponent gordon sondland u s ambasador to the european union mr giuliani aposs requests were a quid pro quo for arranging a white house visit for president zelensky end video clip wallace now senator you aposve drawn an interesting distinction you aposve said in asking a foreign country to investigate corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival is ok but asking foreign government to investigate a political rival is over the line so what do you see here do you see president trump pushing on investigation or looking for dirt on joe biden kennedy here aposs what i see i think that speaker pelosi is acting in a manner that aposs insincere even by the standards of congress i think she aposs turning impeachment into a routine political weapon i think nobody is above the law but nobody is beneath it and i find it unconscionable that they have not allowed the president to defend himself on the house side can apost call witnesses can apost offer rebuttal evidence in terms of the substance i think the quid pro quo is a red herring i think there are only two issues in this case number one according to speaker pelosi president trump asked for the investigation of a political rival there is another scenario and that is that president trump asked for an investigation of possible corruption by someone who happens to be a political rival the latter would be if proven would be in the national interest the former would be in his parochial personal interests when i aposve raised this point of view about the analysis many of my friends in the media say well there aposs no evidence of any impropriety by hunter biden and my response to that is that the absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence or the absence of evidence is not necessarily the evidence of absence if you don apost look and crosstalk wallace but if i may kennedy i was just going to say speak wallace go ahead sir kennedy i was going to say speaker pelosi has not allowed the defense to offer rebuttal evidence in terms of the possible corruption that the president was looking into wallace well obviously if there aposs a senate trial he will get the opportunity not to say kennedy yes wallace you know he should before but i just want to focus on this phone call because on july 25th the president is talking to ukrainian president zelinsky he doesn apost talk about corruption he just he doesn apost talk about burisma for that matter he just talks about two americans joe biden and hunter biden doesn apost it seem like he was really trying to get dirt on a political rival and if so do you think that aposs a serious act on his part is that is that a crime kennedy in my opinion and if i were back teaching in law school this is the way i would teach this case it doesn apost mean i aposm right but this is the way i see it there are only two questions that have to be answered here why did the president ask for an investigation and number two this is inextricably linked to the first question what did hunter biden do for the money now you answer both of those questions and you can resolve this case fairly and that aposs the way that aposs the way i view it the quid pro quo i think is a red herring the quid pro quo tells you nothing chris what matters is whether it was an illegal quid pro quo which leads you right into what i think is the correct analysis which is what i just gave you but that aposs just one person aposs opinion wallace so if the house and it aposs not a done deal if the house votes to impeach there would be a senate trial a couple of questions quickly do you think that the motion to dismiss and there would be no trial at all do you think it would be a two week trial or a serious trial that goes on for six or eight weeks and would you favor allowing both sides democrats and republicans to call witnesses kennedy i think there will be articles impeachment issued i think that speaker pelosi aposs judicial philosophy from the beginning has been guilty when it comes to the senate i do not think that the allegations will be summarily dismissed i think there will be a trial and i aposm in favor of doing it in accordance with the due process and let everybody offer whatever they want to in terms of evidence and bring whatever witnesses they want to if it takes a long time you know i was sent to the senate to be a senator i don apost i don apost mind sitting there as long as it takes wallace finally the president and his supporters have said that ukraine was behind the hacking of the dnc computers and that it wasn apost russia that was a big issue this week because former nsc official fiona hill said that that is russian disinformation she debunked that but on the other hand president trump doubled down on that the very next day take a look sir begin video clip fiona hill former white house nsc aide this is a fictional narrative that has been perpetrated and propagated by the russian security services themselves trump they gave the server to crowdstrike or whatever it aposs called which is a company owned by a very wealthy ukrainian and i still want to see that server you know the fbi has never gotten that server that aposs a big part of this whole thing end video clip wallace senator kennedy who do you believe was responsible for hacking the dnc and clinton campaign computers their emails was it russia or ukraine kennedy i don apost know nor do you nor do any others ms hill is entitled to her crosstalk wallace well let me interrupt to say the entire intelligence community says it was russia kennedy right but it could also be ukraine i aposm not saying that i know one way or the other i aposm saying that ms hill is entitled to her opinion but no rebuttal evidence was allowed to be offered we know at least the republicans in the house wanted to call a witness a dnc political operative who lobbied the ukrainian embassy to be involved get involved in 2016 election we don apost know if ukraine did that we don apost know what extent because they won apost let the president offer his evidence and that aposs why i aposll say once again the absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence if you aposre not allowed to call your own witnesses wallace senator kennedy it aposs always interesting to talk to you and even more interesting to listen to you thank you thanks for joining us today and have a good thanksgiving holiday sir kennedy you too chris wallace up next democrats push their investigation despite the white house blocking key witnesses could that backfire leaving big gaps in their case against president trump democratic congressman eric swalwell a top member of both house intel and judiciary joins us next commercial break wallace democrats may vote on articles of impeachment as soon next month to capitalize on momentum from their public hearings but they still face big hurdles when it comes to drumming up public support for impeachment joining us here in washington congressman eric swalwell a top democrat on both the house intel and judiciary committees and congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep eric swalwell d calif thanks chris wallace so as i discussed with senator kennedy the inspector general is expected to say when he releases his report in a couple of weeks that the original trump russia investigation was legitimate was not based on political bias but he aposs also going to find that there was some serious misconduct a low level fbi lawyer apparently doctored some documents new questions about the steele dossier isn apost that alarming swalwell no and i reviewed most of this evidence on the intelligence committee and you know we had concluded they had all the reason in the world to open this investigation and this report shows that we want fbi agents if they are told that any campaign is being reached out to by a former government or agents of that government we want them to investigate this now if a lawyer at the fbi acted improperly that person should be held accountable wallace and what do you think this says about the president still saying that this was an attempt to stop him and then to overthrow his presidency swalwell well it looks like the evidence is going to show otherwise it aposs time for us to move on but you know to just respond to senator kennedy aposs remark earlier that maybe it was russia maybe it was ukraine no not at all it was russia and as a country we have to make sure that we absolutely acknowledge it was russia condemn russia for it and it actually plays into russia aposs hands if they have this equivalence with ukraine where we aposre saying well maybe we don apost know which one it was wallace you aposre as i pointed out i mean you don apost end your role now because you aposre a member both house intel and house judiciary so what happens now when does the intelligence committee issue its report when will judiciary start hearings and do you expect judiciary to hold open hearings and hear from fact witnesses or just for instance talk to constitutional scholars on what impeachment means swalwell so thursday was the last publicly scheduled hearing we aposre still reviewing the evidence you know to determine what if anything should be done for this misconduct but i don apost want to speak for the chairman chris but it would go to judiciary if we decided there needed to be a remedy and of course the president as we voted on would have rights and the judiciary committee to be a part of that process wallace ok let aposs talk about his rights in the judiciary committee because under the house resolution that was passed that authorizes this inquiry the president does get to have a lawyer in the judiciary committee and it even talks about him being able to cross examine being able to call his own witnesses but there is an interesting article in that and it says that if the white house continues to block witnesses from testifying then the chairman jerry nadler in this case is well within his rights to shut down the white house lawyer even in the clinton impeachment hearing the president aposs lawyer president clinton aposs lawyer got to question ken starr are you really saying that you may shut down the white house lawyer swalwell well the amount of obstruction here is unprecedented and i think it was frustrating to watch the last two weeks of hearings and hear the president and his defenders say well you don apost have direct evidence or all you have is hearsay evidence you need to hear from xyz person when the president is telling mick mulvaney john bolton secretaries pompeo and perry not to come in i think that can go to his consciousness of guilt but i also don apost think you should be rewarded and be able to play such a large part of the proceedings in the judiciary committee if they aposre not going to give us any of the documents but that aposs chairman nadler aposs call wallace but i mean you just heard senator kennedy and you heard the republicans were the last two weeks thing this unfair you haven apost allowed us in that case the republicans to call their own witnesses some yes but some no and now here aposs a chance finally for the president aposs lawyer to participate and you aposre saying you may not allow that either swalwell well i aposm saying it aposs unfair to prevent witnesses who are key witnesses from coming forward that is monumentally unfair wallace wouldn apost it be worse to shut down the president aposs the white house lawyer swalwell i don apost know that that decision has been made yet i aposm just saying that we see that for this process to be productive for the american people we need to have all of the documents if the president is going to say i aposm not giving you any documents i aposm not letting any relevant witnesses come in however i want to throw pot shots you know from the gallery and try to fog up this investigation i don apost know you know if that aposs productive either wallace democrats say that you have enough evidence to proceed and arguably write articles of impeachment vote on articles of impeachment but you haven apost heard you could say it aposs not your fault it aposs the white house but you haven apost heard from a number of top witnesses including national former national security advisor john bolton who is asking a court on december 10th tell me i got an order from the white house not to testify the house wants me to testify you tell me what to do the new york times had an editorial this week and i want to put it up on the screen the new york times editorial argued no matter is more urgent than impeachment but it should not be rushed for the production of the nation aposs security and for the integrity of the presidency and for the future of the republic so why not slow down why not wait to see what the judge decides on december 10th why not take some of these cases to court why are you in such a rush when you apos going to be missing some of the most important evidence you could conceivably get swalwell most importantly the president invoked an upcoming election and voters you know in just a few months are going to be voting in the upcoming caucuses so there aposs an urgency to make sure the election and the ballot boxes have integrity and if he aposs asking a foreign government to interfere in an election you know we are on the clock to make sure that that election is protected wallace wait the election isn apost until next november swalwell we know that the iowa caucuses are in february wallace but the president isn apost going to be i mean the democrats are running against each other they aposre not running against donald trump swalwell well one of the presidents is who the president has asked a foreign government to create misinformation on so you know we have to protect the integrity of those elections but your question is a fair one what we have seen though is the president every time we aposve asked for documents or witnesses blocks those documents and those witnesses and this court process is a nine to 12 month process so we could lose everything that we value in our democracy waiting on the courts when we already have powerful first hand accounts from the witnesses who have come forward and chris as a former prosecutor what i think is most remarkable here i don apost think in modern day history you aposve seen a bigger investigation that relies entirely on first hand accounts most prosecutors today to prove their cases they put emails text messages financial documents crosstalk wallace wait a minute you talk about watergate you know you had john dean swalwell documents ph wallace no but you had first hand witnesses in the oval office john dean haldeman ehrlichman john mitchell you don apost have any of that swalwell we don apost have courageous as many courageous men in the white house like them right now but we do have a lot of the president aposs appointees who have come forward you know people like fiona hill people like ambassador sondland you know mr holmes marie yovanovitch wallace most of them never talk to the president i aposm just saying why not here aposs the argument you guys say that the president used his political powers used his office for his political benefit and what he is asking ukraine to do aren apost you in a sense doing the same thing using your power on one of the most important impeachment for your political benefit which is well we can apost wait we got to get this before iowa swalwell we have powerful evidence already if the president thought these witnesses could clear him he would allow them to come in i think what aposs more relevant than how long we should wait in the courts is the fact that the president won apost let them come in innocent people would say go cooperate with congress i did nothing wrong only a guilty person would block people like john bolton and mick mulvaney from coming to congress wallace while you aposve been holding hours of hearing public opinion has begun to actually move against you and i want to put a poll back in early october people favored impeachment and removing the president by 52 percent to 46 percent or plus six now that aposs turned to 48 percent for removal and 50 percent against or minus that aposs an eight point swing against removing the president while you aposve been making your best case swalwell well i saw an abc news poll last week that said 70 percent of americans thought what the president did was wrong wallace but they didn apost say impeach and remove swalwell a majority of people in that poll actually did favor removing the president so i aposm not focused on the polls i know my colleagues aren apost either this president leveraged his power his great vast power to ask a foreign government to help him cheat an election and i don apost think we should be looking at the polls to decide what we should do i think most americans recognize that is wrong and there have to be consequences wallace all right i want to play something that you said this week here you are begin video cliup swalwell this is a crime spree in progress we have what the president did with the ukrainians in his shakedown scheme of asking them to investigate his opponent end video clip wallace congressman the hardest evidence crosstalk swalwell play that part of the hardball interview wallace yes that aposs true people will have to go to the internet to find out what we aposre talking about the hardest evidence that you aposve got is that the president conditioned a white house meeting not military a white house meeting on investigating the bidens when it comes to actually holding up military aid all you aposve got are presumptions you have nobody who directly says that aposs what happened does not rise to the level of what you called a crime spree and more important does it rise to the level of ousting removing a duly elected president of the united states swalwell i aposm not going to decide you know ultimately on impeachment yet we aposre still weighing the evidence but it aposs worthy of our time and actually there aposs three different conditions one you just get the july 25 call we learned in this last week aposs hearing that there was condition that to get the call the investigations had to happen ambassador sondland said that wallace right swalwell then to get the white house meeting investigations had to happen we have direct evidence of people saying we talked to the president we learned that circumstantially we can prove the fact that the aid was withdrawn after the department of defense certified it on may 23rd the aid was withdrawn for the ukrainians and everything we knew about the president when it related to ukraine was conditioned so the july 25 call white house meeting so the fact that the aid was withdrawn circumstantially crosstalk wallace and that rises to the level of potentially removing the president of the united states swalwell and also i should say mick mulvaney in his press conference wallace ok i aposm not asking you to review the evidence i aposm asking you does that rise to the level swalwell yes if it aposs proven and i think we aposre at we aposre getting pretty close to making a conclusion here if proven i don apost think any president republican or democrat should be able to leverage their office to have another government cheat our elections wallace congressman swalwell thank you swalwell my pleasure wallace thanks for coming in today and we aposll obviously be following swalwell thank you wallace you aposre a busy guy between your two committees thank you sir swalwell my pleasure wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what aposs in that inspector general aposs report on the fbi aposs trump russia investigation plus what you would like to ask the panel about whether democrats should look at those polls when deciding whether to go ahead with impeachment just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your questions on the air commercial break wallace coming up pete buttigieg surges to the top of the polls in the first two voting states but still struggles with a key constituency begin video clip mayor pete buttigieg democratic presidential candidate this was another opportunity to reach out and connect with black voters who i can tell are still getting to know me and sizing me up end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel how big a problem in winning the democratic nomination commercial break begin video clip trump they tried to overthrow the presidency this is a disgrace but i aposm not surprised to see it end video clip wallace president trump standing by his claim the fbi was trying to bring him down when it opened its trump russia investigation in 2016 now we aposre starting to learn what aposs in that inspector general aposs report that will be released on december 9th and it aposs time now for our sunday group co founder of the federalist ben domenech charles lane from the washington post fox new contributor jessica tarlov and pollster kristen soltis anderson who aposs now a fox news contributor ben as we aposve been saying the president and his supporters have been pushing this narrative for years now that he was the victim of a deep state conspiracy by the fbi other intel agencies but we aposve now gotten the initial reports about inspector general michael horowitz everybody agrees he aposs a straight shooter his report which says yes some lower level fbi officials may have done some things wrong an fbi lawyer may have doctored a document obviously unacceptable but that the origins of the investigation was not politically motivated ben domenech the federalist well first off we should be clear we aposre discussing a report we haven apost read yet we are getting these early reports about what aposs inside of it i think we should all keep our judgment a little bit waited until we can go through this and and see everything that aposs in it but i do think that there aposs a lot of different concerns here about the process that went on people that might have done things at various points within it to grease the skids for an investigation that might not of gotten started the real question that i have stepping back from all of this is what do we think needs to change about that process going forward how can we prevent any kind of questions about what the fbi does in future elections because we know that there is going to be attempts by foreign agents in a lot of different ways to interfere with our process going forward that aposs not going away so we need to make sure that those processes are really kept away from any kind of political biases within the system wallace jessica your reaction to the reports quite rightly the reports about the ig report jessica tarlov fox news contributor right wallace although i will say they were widely circulated over the weekend and how do you expect the president and his supporters to respond if it turns out that there narrative about this conspiracy turns out not to be true tarlov well i think that they aposll respond as they do always when their narrative is taken down a notch like it was last week by fiona hill in the impeachment hearings they aposre going to turn around and say exactly the same thing they did this consistently with bob mueller continued with this is a witch hunt there aposs no legal factual basis for anything that they aposre claiming so democrats are going to have to figure out a way to effectively message this and probably not make it a linchpin of any 2020 campaign but get the information out there for those that care that there was no political bias at the top level of the fbi that the carter page fisa warrant was proper and legal and that the operation hurricane crossfire ph wallace although apparently there was a doctoring of a document in the renewal tarlov right but horowitz still found that it was proper and legal to be surveilling carter page who has personally bragged about being a kremlin informant anyway so democrats have to walk that line and i believe the president and his supporters will continue to do just as they have and maybe even throw horowitz into the deep state pool and say that there was something wrong with the investigation wallace and of course we also have john durham the u s attorney in connecticut tarlov yes coming in a few days wallace and he aposs doing conducting a criminal investigation so that aposs still out there let aposs turn to impeachments and to i guess the democrats apos star witness gordon sondland here he is begin video clip sondland was there a quid pro quo the answer is yes unidentified male you really have no testimony today that ties president trump to a scheme to withhold aid from ukraine in exchange for these investigations sondland other than my own presumption unidentified male which is nothing end video clip wallace we asked you for questions for the panel this week about polls that are beginning to show that rather than building up for support for impeachment and removal support seems actually to be draining away we got this on twitter from brian foster how can democrats look at the poll now with regard to impeachment aren apost they all in at this point kristin how do you answer brian and what do you make up the polls which show not some dramatic dropping away but the certainly is not an increase in support as as the democrats have been making their case over the last couple of weeks kristen soltis anderson fox news contributor impeachment is our constitution aposs in case of emergency break glass provision for the overturning of an election result in the face of enormous malfeasance on the part of the president and what democrats have shown through a fairly compressed timeline of just a couple of weeks of open testimony has been in some cases a game of telephone quite literally so and so overheard so and so some evidence that looks quite damning but is also a bit of an ink blot test whether you aposre inclined to believe the president is a good or a bad guy will affect how you view things and so in the absence of something that dramatically changes what we already knew from the transcript which is that the president did want to see an investigation into burisma and named the bidens there hasn apost been anything more dramatic than that that i think would really dislodge the polls one way or the other on this issue hence that that slight atrophy you aposre seeing in support for impeachment overall wallace i mean as a political matter not as a matter of justice when you see these polls and you don apost see this tremendous bipartisan buy in is it dangerous is it risky for democrats to go ahead and impeach the president anderson i think potentially of course this is going to go to the senate and i think it would be have be very different if we actually wound up with the removal of a president the ultimate dramatic conclusion i think the act though of impeaching and saying look we aposve put this down in the history books i think there are many voters who say look issues like health care issues like the economy are top for me i don apost understand why congress is spending so much effort on this i wish we could get back to the things that matter to me i think that aposs the big risk for democrats right now wallace so chuck let aposs let aposs play this out and the conventional wisdom for whatever it aposs worth if we assume well first of all any doubt in your mind the house is going to impeach charles lane the washington post i don apost see how they could not after everything they aposve put in and indeed after all the evidence they aposve put together so yes wallace all right any doubt in your mind i aposll do this like a like denny goldman in a hearing he was a pretty good lawyer any doubt in your mind that if it does go to the senate that they will not vote to remove lane that aposs a double negative he will be acquitted is wallace he will be acquitted lane is the way i look at it and for many of the reasons kristen just outlined which is that there was no movement no drama that would dislodge republicans from wallace ok so let aposs let aposs let aposs take what you aposve now posited impeachment acquittal what does that leave the president what does that leave the democrats lane i believe that in a way for the president and the republicans this has been just the latest in a long series of loyalty tests things that you have to go through with donald trump as a republican to kind of prove you are in the party and the results show that he aposs cemented the party behind him even a person like will hurd who wallace i should point out a relatively moderate republican from from texas who aposs not running for re election so he doesn apost face that threat lane the democrats had high hopes of peeling him off he said no there was some wrongdoing here but it aposs not impeachable and i think the president comes through actually with his base fortified from this on the other hand i think the democrats come through with their base fortified i think in that sense it wasn apost that risky for them i actually never thought impeachment was politically risky for the democrats it might have some upside just in re cementing their base and so i think that aposs where we come out wallace well what about the argument that kristen makes which is it allows republicans it will allow let aposs say let aposs say this all goes out plays out we aposre in february he aposs acquitted republicans can then say and you wasted all of our time on this lane they can say that but don apost forget there aposs a lot of democrats who if they had not gone forward with this would have faced internal challenges and internal criticism from their own people maybe even primaries for not going through with it so i think that kind of cuts both ways and frankly i don apost think voters had a whole lot of expectations for legislation in this term to begin with wallace without without wasting any time lane right so i aposm sure wallace well we do have usmca which is important all right lane and that is that for the moderate democrats that is as significant inaudible wallace all right we have to take a break here panel when we come back joe biden remains a big target in the latest democratic debate as he maintains his lead nationally but what kind of threat does he face from mayor pete buttigieg who aposs at the top in iowa and close to the top in new hampshire commercial break begin video clip buttigieg while i do not have the experience of ever having been discriminated against because of the color of my skin i do have the experience of sometimes feeling like a stranger in my own country end video clip wallace rising democratic candidate mayor pete buttigieg arguing at this week aposs debate he can identify with african americans because of what he aposs had to deal with as a gay man a comparison senator kamala harris later said was neither productive nor smart and we aposre back now with the panel well let aposs start with the latest real clear politics average of the race among democrats at least the top four joe biden as you can see there on the left still has a ten point lead nationally but pete buttigieg now has a solid lead in iowa and is basically tied with elizabeth warren and biden in new hampshire kristen how serious a contender is buttigieg with on the one hand his strong support in the early states but is continuing almost complete absence of any support from african americans who down the road are an immensely important democratic voting bloc anderson i think he aposs going to have to come in first or second in both iowa and new hampshire in order to gain the type of momentum he aposd need to build his support with those key pieces of the democratic coalition who have not really given him much of a second look at this point don apost really think he aposs the guy for them now he is in quite formidable shape in iowa and you have to go back to essentially be early apos90s or even 1988 really if you don apost count the apos92 campaign because there was an iowa politician running for president democrats choose whoever wins iowa to be their nominee and have done so for many many years so iowa aposs a huge deal i think for mayor pete to build that he aposs going to need momentum coming out of those two early states because nationally he aposs still not in that top three wallace you know i didn apost know that stat that they always pick the iowa winter i did know that no democrat has ever won and sometimes they aposve lost both and still won like bill clinton but no democrat has ever won iowa and new hampshire and then not gone on to win the nomination so where does that put buttigieg if obviously all this can change but if he were to go ahead and win iowa and either finish first or second in new hampshire lane he aposd be in super strong shape and wallace even if he goes into south carolina and he aposs at zero percent support lane that that is where he would kind of hit a wall and and what aposs interesting about that is what the effect on a biden candidacy would be of a buttigieg sweep of iowa and new hampshire because at the same time it would be raising buttigieg it would be lowering biden and biden would sort of be in the same position i think jeb bush was in and the republicans side last time of having to make a last stand in south carolina i have a feeling that aposs a little bit of the theory of the deval patrick candidacy here is that he aposs the guy who would say look joe biden has kind of fallen flat in this thing turn to me because i aposm more electable in the fall i aposm more experienced so on and so forth i can appeal better to african american voters than pete buttigieg can i think there aposs just this one asterisk next to buttigieg for whatever reason he doesn apost appeal to black voters and that aposs not only an issue for him in the primary could be an issue for the party as a whole if he were the standard bearer in the general wallace and then there is the aforementioned joe biden who in this last debate this week had some more bumps this maybe has been the bumpiest begin video clip joe biden democratic presidential candidate i know who i am three former chairs of the black caucus the only african american woman that had ever been elected to the united states senate a whole range of people my point is sen kamala harris democratic presidential candidate no that aposs not true sen cory booker democratic presidential candidate no that aposs not truth unidentified male thank thank you biden i said the first african american elected the first african so my end video clip wallace well so he said he had the support of the only woman and then of course another woman the second woman kamala harris is right there on the stage with him jessica can can biden stumble his way all the way to the nomination because that is sort of what he aposs doing so far i think and how seriously do you take late entrants deval patrick former governor of massachusetts formally in the race and apparently in a 30 million ad buy that starts today former mayor mike bloomberg of new york city ends it bloomberg for president now he hasn apost made a former announcement but when you aposre spending 30 million and saying bloomberg for presidents it it sounds like you aposre in tarlov you aposre intending to say bloomberg for president and for full disclosure i used to work for doug schon ph who is mike bloomberg aposs pollster just to put that out there as far as joe biden it does look like he can continue to at least quasi stumble to the nomination a lot of that is rooted in this african american report i mean we aposre talking about pete buttigieg having zero percent in south carolina but there are two other people in the race elizabeth warren and bernie sanders who have shown an ability to get over 10 percent so you could make more of an argument that warren would be a more palatable candidate for instance to white college educated liberals and african american voters than pete buttigieg i do think his surge is largely overrated i think something is going on at this moment but we know that polls are just a snapshot in time and he aposs having his moment like warren did a month ago when we were all saying she aposs going to be the nominee this is it but joe biden continues to hang on in the mid 20s there and the debates his supporters at least his campaign would say this are not paying attention to that because of the crux of his argument which is you know me and you aposve known me for decades you know what i stand for and what i aposm going to be delivering to you as far as the late entrants i aposm not sure it makes more of a much of a different and i see deval patrick actually as getting in as more of a vp consideration to introduce himself to the national audience and then potentially be considered by a biden or a warren down the road wallace and real quickly because i want to bring in ben and bloomberg with unlimited amounts of money tarlov unlimited amounts of money yes but that doesn apost mean that money is going to make people like you or support your cause he aposs going to also continue to give to issues that matter for him like climate change and wallace gun control tarlov and gun violence wallace right ben how much as somebody on the other side of the political debate are you enjoying watching the democratic field domenech well i think that there aposs going to be a whole wrench thrown into this conversation by what aposs going to happen with impeachment if we have a situation where all of the senators in this race have to come back to washington have to sit through a trial a trial in which joe biden is going to be brought in in a number of different ways in all likelihood we saw it just this past week lindsey graham and others on capitol hill saying that they aposre going to try to bring in hunter biden to wallace you heard john kennedy say that today let aposs bring him in domenech john kennedy saying that yes exactly that aposs something that aposs going to help mayor pete and mayor pete gets to be out there still campaigning still on the trail still talking to people i actually think he could ride this momentum further than some of the other folks at this table necessarily think i think that he has a lot going for him especially for people who have taken heed of what president obama was saying just this past week warning a lot of democrats let aposs not get too extreme let aposs not go too far let aposs not go to the revolution let aposs try to be more gradual in our approach to understand where the country is wallace and jessica you aposve got 30 seconds it aposs every political reporter aposs fever dream that we would have a contested convention multiple ballots like in the 1950s smoke filled rooms i know that aposs not politically correct is there tarlov vape filled rooms wallace what vape filled well that aposs not that aposs unhealthy tarlov yes domenech hopefully inaudible but hopefully inaudible wallace what where what you think tarlov i think it aposs still a possibility i mean you could feasibly see four different people taking the first four primary states i think biden will get south carolina and nevada i think it aposs fishable because of the rule changes with the dnc delegate system and the schedule but still i think right now low likelihood wallace just once in my in my reporting career a contested convention ballot 34 tarlov well i hope for it for you then wallace all right good do it for me thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the man giving away some of his fortune one tweet at a time commercial break wallace it aposs a familiar story a wealthy person giving big bucks to charities or foundations but social media
