coronavirus limits on churches but woven through thousands of court papers the special counsel has made his public report these are the key findings russia tried to help trump the kremlin directed a large scale effort to help trump during the 2016 election according to u s intelligence agencies and lengthy indictments brought by mueller s team russian president vladimir putin ordered a multipart influence campaign aimed at hurting democrat hillary clinton s candidacy undermining american democracy and helping trump get elected that effort included the hacking of the democratic national committee clinton s campaign and other democratic groups russian intelligence officers then coordinated the release of stolen emails and internal documents using the false online personas guccifer 2 0 and dcleaks and later the anti secrecy group wikileaks while the hacking was being carried out mueller has also accused a russian troll farm known as the internet research agency of using fake social media accounts to flood the american public with disinformation that social media effort began in 2014 with a goal of sowing discord by trumpeting extreme positions on divisive political issues but as the presidential campaign progressed mueller team says the effort began supporting trump and disparaging clinton wikileaks has denied that russian was the direct source of the material it released one defendant in the troll farm case has denied the allegations people around trump were receptive to the help donald trump jr donald trump confidant roger stone and trump himself all sought to benefit politically from russian election interference in the middle of the campaign trump jr took a meeting at trump tower with a russian lawyer thinking he would be getting dirt on clinton trump jr agreed to the meeting which included trump son in law jared kushner and trump campaign chairman paul manafort despite it being described as part of a russian government effort to help his father s campaign stone sought to help the trump campaign benefit from damaging material released by wikileaks after the dnc pointed the finger at russia in its hacking stone pitched himself as a wikileaks insider in discussions with the trump campaign according to mueller trump s campaign kept in contact with stone about the timing and content of any releases of clinton documents that could be damaging to her campaign trump himself also publicly welcomed russia s help during a political rally trump called on russia s hackers to help find emails scrubbed from clinton s private server saying russia if you re listening i hope you re able to find the 30 000 emails that are missing court documents show that on that same day russian intelligence officers tried to hack into email accounts hosted at a domain used by clinton s personal office as well as email addresses used by her campaign trump was trying to do business in russia during the campaign in fact he wanted to build a trump tower in moscow court documents in the case of trump s longtime lawyer michael cohen show the trump organization pursued the project even after trump had secured the republican presidential nomination as part of that effort cohen spoke with an assistant to the kremlin s spokesman about finding the land and financing for the building s construction he also pitched trump on visiting russia during the campaign as part of the business proposal the potential deal ultimately fell through but cohen discussed the project with trump and his family even as the gop candidate was publicly claiming that he had nothing to do with russia his close advisers sought russian back channels during the transition the moves violated a long standing norm in american democracy of one president at a time former national security adviser michael flynn in particular was the main conduit according to court documents in the waning weeks of the obama administration flynn had several conversations with sergey kislyak russia s ambassador to the u s involving two issues important to mueller on dec 22 2016 at kushner s direction flynn asked kislyak to delay or vote against a u n security council resolution condemning israeli settlements a request russia rebuffed a couple days later president barack obama imposed sanctions on russia in response to its election interference efforts but in discussions with kislyak flynn asked that russia not escalate the situation and only respond in a reciprocal manner putin ultimately decided not to respond in kind which kislyak said was the result of flynn s request lots of people around trump lied to investigators his national security adviser campaign chairman personal lawyer and three other aides or advisers all of them have been accused of lying to federal agents or congress many of the lies cut to the heart of the investigation flynn lied about his contacts with kislyak cohen lied about the trump tower moscow deal former trump campaign foreign policy adviser george papadopoulos lied about his contacts with russian intermediaries who appeared to know ahead of time about russia s stealing of clinton s emails mueller has also accused stone of lying to congress about his discussions regarding wikileaks though stone has denied any wrongdoing still no direct evidence of criminal conspiracy with russia mueller s brought charges against more than 30 defendants but he hasn t charged any americans let alone trump associates with actively conspiring with the russia government during the 2016 campaign that includes stone who has dismissed the charges against him as process crimes trump has used the lack of conspiracy charges to claim vindication using his favorite phrase no collusion read ap s cov
