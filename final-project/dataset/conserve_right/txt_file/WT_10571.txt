pressed china and russia to strictly enforce u n sanctions to get pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons u s secretary of state mike pompeo accused north korea of violating an array of tough sanctions imposed by the council he warned that when sanctions are not enforced the prospects for the successful denuclearization of north korea are diminished nonetheless pompeo told reporters after

leader kim jong un so do i as progress is happening he added without elaborating top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 the trump administration hopes that one day north korea will be at the united nations not as a pariah but as a friend pompeo said but it will take full enforcement of sanctions for us to get there as well as kim following through on his personal commitments to trump at the summit trump and kim agreed to work toward denuclearization of the korean peninsula without describing when and how it would occur follow up talks this month between pompeo and north korean senior officials in pyongyang had a rocky start with north korea accusing the united states of making unilateral and gangster like demands pompeo stressed friday that the 15 security council nations are united on the need for final fully verified denuclearization of north korea pyongyang for decades has been pushing a concept of denuclearization that bears no resemblance to the american definition vowing to pursue nuclear development unless washington removes its 28 500 troops from south korea and the nuclear umbrella defending south korea and japan china which is north korea s closest ally and responsible for more than 90 percent of the isolated country s trade backs north korea s call for a phased and synchronous approach to denuclearization last month beijing suggested the security council consider suspending or lifting sanctions on north korea if it is in compliance with u n resolutions and making progress in negotiations russia said friday it also backs this approach russia s deputy u n ambassador dmitry polyansky said that pompeo confirmed the u s will seek the full denuclearization of north korea it is necessary that the denuclearization go step by step with parallel actions by the international community polyansky said we are talking about easing sanctions pressure through the u n security council as well as the removal of unilateral u s sanctions some exemptions have already taken place this week south korea received exemptions from the security council committee monitoring north korea sanctions for communications lines between the north and south and for some goods for the north including furniture transport vehicles and a bus the u s has pushed for rapid moves toward ridding north korea of its nuclear weapons and says sanctions will remain until pyongyang follows through on kim s pledge but trump has recently been playing down expectations of quick results saying this week there was no time limit on getting north korea to denuclearize u s ambassador nikki haley standing beside pompeo made clear that kim jong un must take action first we continue to reiterate we can t do one thing until we see north korea respond to their promise to denuclearize haley said we have to see some sort of action and so until that action happens the security council is going to hold tight as for the broader international community she said we ask you to hold tight as we go forward pompeo said the scope and scale of denuclearization is agreed to and the north koreans understand what that means though he didn t elaborate and sidestepped a question on what the first step should be we need to see chairman kim do what he promised the world he would do pompeo said chinese ambassador ma zhaoxu said that china is committed to denuclearization and to peace and stability on the peninsula he added that china will fully implement u n sanctions resolutions adding that everyone else should as well but pompeo said north korea is illegally smuggling in refined petroleum products beyond the quota of 500 000 barrels per year allowed under u n sanctions mainly by ship to ship transfers u s documents sent to the committee and obtained by the associated press cite 89 instances between jan 1 and may 30 in which north korean tankers likely delivered refined products illicitly procured via such transfers the u s says russia and china both informed the sanctions committee that they were supplying refined products to north korea pompeo said north korea is also evading sanctions by smuggling coal by sea and across borders through cyber thefts and other criminal activities and by keeping workers in some countries that he didn t name these actions are all generating significant revenues for the regime and they must be stopped he said haley criticized some friends who want to go around the rules and especially russia and china for blocking the sanctions committee from demanding that all countries halt shipments of petroleum products to north korea immediately moscow and beijing said they need additional time to investigate the u s allegations and put a six month hold on the u s request are they telling us that they want to continue supplying this oil haley asked they claim they need more information we don t need any more information the sanctions committee has what it needs we all know it s going forward dutch ambassador karel van oosterom said the security council made clear to pompeo that it wants to see concrete actions and deeds from north korea to denuclearize van oosterom who chairs the north korea sanctions committee told reporters i think for all of us it s clear that the progress is in the talks so far that the engagement is there and the discussions are taking place south korean foreign minister kang kyung wha said north korea made a clear commitment on complete denuclearization repeatedly and of course very forcefully at the singapore summit with president trump and we will hold them up to that commitment
