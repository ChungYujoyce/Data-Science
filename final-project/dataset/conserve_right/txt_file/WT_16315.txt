is already the world s largest armed forces with 2 2 million personnel now the military is rigorously recruiting college students to join the increasingly high tech army that remains controlled tightly by the communist party on june 17 the military s recruitment campaign among college students began with a grand ceremony in beijing where more than 1 000 representatives from more than 30 chinese universities were joined by military leaders and recruiters who demonstrated various policies incentives and requirements for joining the army pressure to lure more educated young people into the army is growing stronger this year for decades china s recruitment season did not start until october but that tradition was changed this year recruitment efforts begin aug 1 with the goal of specifically attracting more college students to join as china s academic year ends in july china did not start recruiting college graduates for the military until 2001 party reiterates stand on religion the chinese communist party must resolutely maintain its cardinal principle that members are not allowed to practice any form of religion declared zhu weiqun director of the national ethnic and religion commission of the chinese people s political consultative conference mr zhu has been china s point man in dealing with representatives of the exiled dalai lama for nearly two decades he has been particularly hostile to tibetan buddhism and especially bellicose toward the dalai lama the spiritual leader of the tibetan buddhists the communist party s charter asserts that communist ideology demands its members adhere to atheism which is said to be based upon the writings of karl marx in marxist orthodoxy this theory is considered science and the fundamental political philosophy of the communist state is known as scientific socialism in contrast religions of all kinds are idealist superstition popularly characterized by marx as the opiate of the masses the current supreme leader of china party general secretary xi jinping has a doctoral degree in scientific socialism from tsinghua university in beijing if we allow two world views within our party mr zhu stated referring to communism and any one of the religions it will necessarily lead to the wavering disappearance of the dominant position of marxism to the schism and collapse of the unity of thoughts and theoretical foundation of our party and if we allow our party members to practice religion it is tantamount to letting our members be under the command of the party as well as various religious leaders mr zhu explained and that means in tibet for example to allow our communist party members to accept the religious influence of the dalai lama thus rendering legitimacy to the dalai s status as supreme master of buddhism china has 23 million muslims 6 5 million catholics and 23 million protestants according to official statistics real numbers of christians in china are certain to be much higher as many churches are underground and unreported because of government persecution buddhist and daoist adherents are difficult to calculate but generally they number close to 100 million mr zhu s main concern also is related to what he regards as an international conspiracy to overthrow the chinese government through religious infiltration some major international forces are using the christian religion to infiltrate china they illegally proselytize even try to make christianity a political force against china s socialist system and to divide the nation mr zhu declared miles yu s
