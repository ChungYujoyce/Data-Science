fundraising threshold to participate in this summer s presidential debates the south bend indiana mayor said says he s received contributions from 65 000 plus individual donors that s key because the democratic national committee said last month up to 20 candidates can qualify for debates in june and july by collecting donations from at least 65 000 individuals with at least 200 unique donors in at least 20 states in an email to supporters buttigieg said we weren t even close to 65 000 donors when the dnc originally announced the requirement the 37 year old veteran says more than 76 000 people have now donated he also told fox news sunday that all of the signs are pointing in the right direction to shift from just exploring a 2020 run to becoming an official candidate as gillibrand did sunday bill de blasio new york mayor bill de blasio criticized former president barack obama during a small gathering in new hampshire as he mulls a run for president saying that obama s early days in office were a lost window minutes later in front of a larger audience de blasio praised the affordable care act obama s signature legislative achievement calling it progress obama pursued the health care legislation during his first two years in office and has been criticized at times for focusing on health care instead of the struggling economy a handful of people were present in a second floor private room of a concord restaurant when de blasio compared obama to president franklin d roosevelt who took office in 1933 amid the depression and immediately began a series of actions that came to define the modern presidency s focus on a 100 day agenda the mayor said roosevelt was the only person who had a greater head of steam and political momentum and capital coming into office he to his great credit did the 100 days and the reckless abandon and understood that you had to achieve for people to build the next stage of capital to use for the next thing de blasio said obama i think nobly went at health care but it played out over such a long time and it got treated politically as such a narrow instead of universal item tragically that it was a lost window and i m not saying anything i don t think a lot of people feel cory booker democratic white house hopeful cory booker said sunday night he would reverse president donald trump s ban on transgender individuals
