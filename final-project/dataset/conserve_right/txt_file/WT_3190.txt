l flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion peggy noonan who wrote brilliant speeches for ronald reagan and now writes gifted columns for the wall street journal and whose friendship i have enjoyed for many years recently put forth a hypothetical historical analogy that stopped me in my tracks let s look at some background before getting to it late last week the house of representatives adopted a resolution authorizing formal investigations into whether president donald trump has committed impeachable offenses while in office the resolution directed five house standing committees to investigate the president s behavior and to report the results of those investigations to the house judiciary committee top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state under house rules enacted in january 2015 when republicans had the majority the judiciary committee has jurisdiction over impeachment and it must air publicly the evidence it contends supports any articles of impeachment it may recommend to the full house the u s constitution defines and limits the basis for impeachment as treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors in mr trump s case it is bribery or other high crimes that have formed the basis of the impeachment inquiry thus far the house permanent select committee on intelligence has been holding closed door hearings gathering evidence on these two points of constitutional inquiry why closed door no prosecutor or defense counsel would or ethically could offer a witness to testify publicly in a case without first having interviewed that witness in private these interviews are often open ended and the lawyer or investigator conducting the interview does not know in advance the full extent of what the witness can provide secrecy at this point enhances candor and permits an honest evaluation of the witness credibility and usefulness to the case how did congress acquire impeachment evidence in the past in the cases of presidents richard nixon and bill clinton special prosecutors gathered evidence of presidential wrongdoing in secret and then presented that evidence to the house judiciary committee which aired it publicly today even though the initial interviews of witnesses are taking place in secret the intelligence committee is releasing transcripts of those interviews for the public to examine well before it reports to the house judiciary committee we know from those transcripts that mr trump s threat to hold up 391 million in military hardware and financial aid to our ally ukraine which is fighting a bloody war with russia until the ukraine government gave him a favor by commencing an investigation of former vice president joe biden and his son hunter was not a one off we know from the testimony of these witnesses that the demand for the favor was the end part of a months long concerted effort run by the president s personal lawyer rudy giuliani himself now the subject of two federal criminal investigations to use the government of ukraine to deliver dirt on mr biden for mr trump s re election campaign mr trump has argued that this was not a quid pro quo e g give me the dirt on mr biden and you will get your american aid he makes that argument solely on an incomplete transcript of his now infamous july 25 2019 telephone conversation with his ukrainian counterpart who when he asked for the aid was met with the request for the favor now back to peggy noonan in her piece in last saturday s wall street journal she asked how history would view president franklin delano roosevelt if when asked by british prime minister winston churchill for help fighting the nazis in 1940 he had conditioned that aid on the provision of dirt on wendell willkie roosevelt s eventual republican opponent in the 1940 presidential election we would be repulsed to learn this of course roosevelt never made such a trumpian demand he understood how vital the defense of great britain from the nazi invasion was for humanity for our ally and ultimately for american national security mr trump s demand manifested no such rooseveltian understanding in fact mr trump should have known that the act of soliciting assistance for his campaign from a foreign government whether directly by him or indirectly by mr giuliani is defined as criminal under federal law a high crime as the constitution puts it he also should have known that refusing to perform a lawful duty releasing the 391 million that congress had authorized until a personal favor comes his way is also defined in federal law as criminal bribery as the constitution puts it all of this has been laid out in the transcripts of witness interviews that will soon become public testimony all of this has given the president s congressional supporters heartburn they have seen the transcripts and have dropped their no quid pro quo argument and now make the legally absurd contention that all evidence derived from witness interviews conducted in secret with republican house members present and participating is somehow tainted and should be thrown out even richard nixon and bill clinton made no such arguments then in another pivot congressional republicans have argued that witnesses against mr trump are secret or overt democrats and cannot be trusted oy that s why we have cross examination some congressional republicans have even threatened to out two federal employees among the witnesses whose identities are protected under the federal whistleblower statutes statutes that these members of congress have sworn to uphold oh how the times have changed roosevelt jumped at the chance to help an ally fight a tyrant the noonan analogy is brilliant and telling and the president s congressional supporters know it that s why their defense is to attack the witnesses these congressional republicans and mr trump are strange but tenacious bedfellows three years ago they were shouting about law and order over hillary clinton s emails today they are shouting to let trump be trump that s what happens when the facts and the law are against them andrew p napolitano a former judge of the superior
