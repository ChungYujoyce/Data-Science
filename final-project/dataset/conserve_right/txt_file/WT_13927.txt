apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic shanghai ap china followed through monday on its pledge to allow greater flexibility in exchange rates but said an appreciation in its currency alone could not rebalance world growth as it urged world leaders to carry out more fundamental reforms by late monday the yuan was trading at about 6 8012 to the u s dollar in the spot market strengthening from 6 8272 on friday as the central bank delivered on its weekend promise to give up the dollar peg imposed two years ago to help chinese exporters cope with the global downturn for the past two years

deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey but analysts said the move was mainly aimed at countering criticism of beijing s currency policies ahead of this weekend s summit of the group of 20 leading economies and would not result in any significant shifts in exchange rates the yuan is still subject to a 0 5 percent daily trading range limiting potential volatility the yuan will gain very soon but definitely not much it was more of a strategic maneuver to silence outside criticism said qian qimin a market analyst at shenyin wanguo securities in shanghai the central bank said plans to allow greater currency flexibility were in line with china s own needs and would help beijing fight inflation encourage manufacturers to improve efficiency and reduce the country s reliance on exports as a key driver for growth china s economy surged 11 9 percent in the first quarter of this year and exports jumped by nearly 50 percent over a year earlier in may despite expectations that europe s debt crisis would hit demand in the 27 nation european union china s biggest trading partner the large trade surplus gives the government confidence and room to loosen controls over the exchange rate qian said since a stronger yuan would make chinese exports more expensive the announcement by the people s bank of china that it would revert to relying on a basket of currencies that includes the u s dollar to determine the exchange rate rather than the dollar alone reflects a return to policies in force before the global financial crisis walloped chinese manufacturers in 2008 putting millions of workers out of their jobs but while it has pledged to keep moving gradually toward more market based exchange rates beijing still insists that its policy of keeping the currency stable is crucial for economic recovery ruling out any significant one off revaluations the official announcement should be interpreted first and foremost as an important signal towards a more flexible exchange rate rather than a significant revaluation of the chinese yuan ubs economist wang tao said in a report on the change china let the yuan to rise by about 20 percent beginning in 2005 but halted its rise in 2008 the government sets the rate each day before the start of trading and retains powerful tools to control its movement many countries have slammed beijing for this policy complaining that an undervalued yuan unfairly drives down the price of chinese products and makes them impossible to compete with china has sought to deflect this criticism noting that the causes of the global crisis lay well beyond its door and a commentary monday by the official xinhua news agency said the g 20 leaders must focus on more urgent global reforms if they cannot make good use of the coming g20 summit to press ahead with the much needed overhaul of the global financial system the
