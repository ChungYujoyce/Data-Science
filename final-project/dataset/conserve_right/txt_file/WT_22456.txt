apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic special counsel robert mueller has been pursuing several russia collusion leads even as a number of media outlets say his final report is due soon according to court filings and sources former acting attorney general matthew g whitaker said in january that he had been read in on the nearly two year probe and concluded it was close to being completed but there are signs that russia issues remain top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore court filings in the prosecution of former trump campaign manager paul manafort show that mr mueller is still investigating a fall 2016 meeting at a manhattan cigar bar where the lifting of u s sanctions on russia was discussed mr mueller still has questions about the ukraine amendment to the 2016 republican party platform the indictment of trump political adviser roger stone for allegedly lying to congress sets up the possibility of a plea bargain mr stone has denied wrongdoing and has said he will never betray president trump but he has added that he is willing to cooperate on manafort a closed hearing for which a sanitized transcript was released showed mueller senior prosecutor andrew weissmann is still probing the august 2016 meeting between manafort his ex business partner rick gates and ukraine born constantine kilimnik mr kilimnik a former low ranking translator for russian military intelligence was a manafort translator and office manager in ukraine for a decade gates has turned state s evidence the transcript indicates he has made a new allegation against manafort dealing with sanctions relief that could in some way be tied to a conspiracy this goes i think very much to the heart of what the special counsel s office is investigating mr weissmann told u s district judge amy berman jackson judge jackson agreed with mr weissmann s allegation that manafort lied about the meeting during his government cooperation phase defense attorney kevin downing called mr weissmann s theory nonsense because no matter who gets elected that the sanctions were going to continue against russia i think you need to consider this rank speculation a manafort supporter told the washington times there is no evidence of collusion manafort was sentenced on march 8 to just shy of four years in prison for tax and bank by fraud by u s district judge t s ellis iii in virginia judge jackson tacked on an additional 43 months at a march 13 hearing in washington d c for lobbying violations and witness tampering judge jackson an obama appointee scolded mr downing for saying there is no evidence of manafort russia collusion she said the mueller investigation continues in a court filing mr downing said the special counsel s strategy in bringing charges against mr manafort had nothing to do with the special counsel s core mandate russian collusion but was instead designed to tighten the screws in an effort to compel mr manafort to cooperate and provide incriminating information about others on the ukraine question mr mueller still hasn t closed his inquiry even though republicans believe they have debunked the tale the charge is that while the republican platform was being written at the cleveland convention trump operatives took out language that would have encouraged lethal aid to ukrainian forces fighting russia backed separatists in reality a single delegate offered the lethal aid amendment for inclusion it was never in the platform trump people not wanting to commit a new administration to arming ukraine reached a compromise the new language pledged support to the ukrainian military the republican majority of the house permanent select committee on intelligence reviewed the various platform drafts and concluded the final product was stronger not weaker on ukraine the issue is still alive among democrats in congress house judiciary committee chairman rep jerrold nadler of new york sent 81 document demand letters to various trump linked people and entities some letters asked for any information on the ukraine platform language on roger stone his friends told the times that it is obvious the mueller team wants to flip him to incriminate trump campaign personnel mr stone repeatedly has said he has no evidence against the president the deployment of nearly 30 fbi agents some equipped with rifles and bulletproof vests in a pre dawn raid to arrest him at his florida home is evidence of government intimidation mr stone s friends say the indictment said he lied to the house intelligence committee he denied owning any emails or text messages pertaining to his efforts to find out when wikileaks would release the next batch of russia stolen democratic party memos mr stone in fact did have such documents the indictment said he communicated with unnamed trump campaign people one of those campaign people was mr trump himself according to his former attorney michael cohen who has pleaded guilty to tax and campaign finance counts today he is mr trump s prime accuser touching off probes by state democratic officer holders in new york into the trump organization real estate empire cohen provided this trump tower scene to the house oversight and government reform committee in july 2016 days before the democratic convention i was in mr trump s office when his secretary announced that roger stone was on the phone mr trump put mr stone on the speakerphone and mr stone told mr trump that he had just gotten off the phone with julian assange and that mr assange told mr stone that within a couple of days there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage hillary clinton s campaign mr trump responded by stating to the effect wouldn t that be great mr stone text messaged the hill newspaper denying cohen s story mr stone says today that he never communicated with mr assange who in turn says he never communicated with mr stone or the trump organization mr stone says he remains unconvinced that russia hacked democratic party computers and provided emails to wikileaks as u s intelligence says the stone indictment doesn t charge him with conspiring with russia the times asked stephen a saltzburg a george washington university law professor and associate independent counsel in the iran contra probe if mr mueller can file a final report while some issues are pending it seems there will come a point where he might decide he can t get the final answer th
