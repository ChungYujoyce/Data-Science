impeachment inquiry into trump s efforts to press ukraine s leader to investigate democratic rival joe biden at the same time as military aid was being withheld from the country trump and his

warrant i believe to spy on myself as a way of getting into the trump campaign page said in an interview with maria bartiromo on fox s mornings with maria there has been a continued cover up to this day we still don t have the truth but hopefully we ll get that soon fbi director chris wray has told congress that he did not consider the fbi surveillance to be spying and that he has no evidence the fbi illegally monitored trump s campaign during the 2016 election wray said he would not describe the fbi s surveillance as spying if it s following investigative policies and procedures attorney general william barr has said he believed spying did occur but he also made clear at a senate hearing earlier this year that he had no specific evidence that any surveillance was illegal or improper barr has appointed u s attorney john durham to investigate how intelligence was collected and that probe has since become criminal in nature a person familiar with the matter has said but trump insists that members of the obama administration at the highest levels were spying on his 2016 campaign personally i think it goes all the way i think this goes to the highest level he said in the fox interview i hate to say it i think it s a disgrace they thought i was going to win and they said how can we stop him f
