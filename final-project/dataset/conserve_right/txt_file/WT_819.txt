apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a cadre of obama era heavy hitters led by john podesta fired up another effort wednesday to put global warming at the forefront of the presidential campaign this time by linking president trump s skepticism of a climate doomsday to the novel coronavirus outbreak mr podesta the former obama white house chief of staff who chaired hillary clinton s unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid unveiled climate power 2020 with a blast at mr trump s anti science policies which he said have fueled the pandemic president trump must be held accountable for his rejection of science facts and reality for both covid 19 and the climate crisis the anti science policies from this administration are pushing our nation into crisis mr podesta said in a written statement top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state in addition to mr podesta the advisory board features san francisco billionaire tom steyer the democratic party s largest individual donor and a candidate for the party s presidential nomination as well as obama administration figures including secretary of state john f kerry epa administrator gina mccarthy energy secretary ernest moniz and science adviser john holdren today it fueled a pandemic mr podesta said tomorrow we will see the consequences in a world destabilized by climate change climate power 2020 will change the politics of climate pushing all candidates to aggressively campaign on climate action and holding science denying campaigns accountable skeptics called the link between climate change and covid 19 a stretch given that the virus originated late last year in wuhan china a signatory to the 2015 paris climate agreement while noting that this isn t the first time democratic power brokers have sought to push climate to the electoral forefront junkscience com s steve milloy a member of the trump environmental protection agency transition team called it the umpteenth time the usual cast of climate leftovers have been reheated if at first you don t succeed try try again said climate depot s marc morano the climate activists led by podesta kerry holdren and steyer are desperate to keep climate change alive in the presidential campaign so they are trying to tie climate to covid and blame both on president trump they have their work cut out for them given that climate change has consistently ranked at or near the bottom of voters concerns a harris poll survey for inerjys ventures released tuesday found that 62 of u s adults surveyed said climate change wouldn t damage the u s economy if left unaddressed a reuters ipsos poll taken in june showed that most americans were unwilling to install solar panels carpool or take the bus reduce meat eating pay an additional 100 in taxes drive an electric car or spend 100 more on their annual electricity bill to fight climate change with the coronavirus outbreak however democrats and climate activists have sought to whip up outrage by morphing viral fears into climate fears said mr morano whose climate hustle 2 is expected to be released by early june they are jealous of the swift all encompassing virus induced lockdowns and they want in on the action he said in an email podesta has suspended science and common sense in claims to hold president trump accountable for both covid 19 and the climate crisis this is all nothing more than lowbrow election year politicking too deferential to scientists still with savvy strategists like mr podesta and deep pockets like mr steyer in the mix there is no doubt climate power 2020 has the political and financial juice to push its message an independent project of the leftist center for american progress action fund mr podesta founded the center in 2003 the campaign has partnered with the sierra club and league of conservation voters and is focusing on eight potential swing states arizona colorado florida georgia michigan north carolina pennsylvania and wisconsin the campaign s launch included a 90 minute online video that showed store shelves picked clean during the coronavirus crisis juxtaposed with shots of hurricanes and flooding americans are facing a future in crisis from coronavirus to climate change said the narrator president trump is failing to protect us he doesn t believe in science he ignores experts and he denies the facts h sterling burnett senior fellow at the free market heartland institute pointed out that scientists haven t said that climate change has caused the coronavirus if anything he said the president has been accused of relying too heavily on white house public health experts such as dr anthony fauci director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases as far as following the science in my opinion trump has been too deferential to scientists during this pandemic said mr burnett i mean fauci changes his mind every two weeks on what we should do and policy lurches back and forth and democrats in their states only latch onto fauci s statements that support their position that we should shut down the economy forever has climate change fueled an increase in disease a study released may 8 by the london based global warming policy foundation found the opposite it reported dramatic reductions in climate related mortality over the past 30 years even as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels rose the report by science and policy analyst indur m goklany a u s delegate to the u n intergovernmental panel on climate change found that cumulative annual rates of deaths and disease from climate sensitive disease and events are declining and declining faster than the corresponding all cause rates you see improvement across the board but most notably there has been a wholesale rolling back of the biggest killers like diarrhea and malaria said mr goklany who holds a doctoral degree in electrical engineering his report refutes the thrust of the 2019 lancet countdown on health and climate change which warned that a changing climate has profound implications for human health with more frequent heatwaves and extreme weather events changing patterns of infectious disease and the exacerbation of existing health challenges around the world mr goklany said that the u n affiliated researchers highlight comparatively rare conditions like dengue which have worsened while ignoring the wider picture which is almost all good news it s highly misleading the pandemic caused economic downturn may have hurt the prospects of climate policies such as the green new deal proposed by rep alexandria ocasio cortez new york democrat the proposal s price tag has been estimated in the tens of trillions of dollars said benny peiser director of the global warming policy foundation almost all u s politicians who have tried to make climate change an election issue in the past have fared miserably losing election after election mr peiser said repeating the same mistake and trying to sell the green new deal to voters in an unprecedented economic crisis and expecting different results borders on politi
