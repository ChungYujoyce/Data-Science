ptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden takes more swings at president trump peter doocy reports joe biden s presidential campaign says it will soon have 600 staffers in the key battleground states as it beefs up for a general election showdown with president trump s campaign juggernaut top campaign advisers to the former vice president in a zoom presentation and briefing friday with political reporters touted that our poll numbers continue to be ahead nationally and in battleground states and they forecast that they ll widen the map of states in play saying there will be battleground states that have never been battleground states before biden tears up campaign playbook by drifting left after the primaries the campaign also spotlighted that the presidential election will be a referendum on trump s performance in the white house amid the coronavirus pandemic but they didn t provide a timeline for when biden who s been campaigning virtually from his home in delaware as he follows his state s stay at home orders to prevent the spread of the virus would physically return to the campaign trail saying they ll do so when the time is right pointing to the most recent battleground polls campaign manager jen o malley dillon noted we are pulling ahead in florida in pennsylvania and michigan and wisconsin and in arizona and if we kept these numbers and we kept them through november that puts us at 318 electoral votes she tempered that with we do not take any of this for granted but the veteran campaign operative added we feel like we are uniquely positioned to do well in these states we are pulling ahead to take us to a much larger electoral college victory two hundred and seventy electoral votes are needed to win the white house biden campaign says trump had no role in surfacing sexual assault allegations o malley dillon said the campaign s strategy was to protect the swing states that 2016 democratic nominee hillary clinton captured in 2016 such as colorado minnesota nevada new hampshire and virginia and win back some the battleground states trump carried four years ago florida iowa michigan north carolina ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin but she also predicted there will be an expanded map in 2020 we believe that there will be battleground states that have never been battleground states before and arizona is at the top of the list and she noted that biden s within striking distance of trump in georgia and texas two other reliably red states that democrats have long eyed as the campaign expands o malley dillon said we will have over 600 organizing staff responsible for battleground states onboarded in june and explained that those staffers will be organizing virtually and in tandem with the work taking place in person wherever it might be safe and appropriate she also teased a number of significant announcements that are going to be coming over the next 10 days and said that the campaign will soon be rolling out a new website and that we have a new livestreaming platform which we are debuting this weekend the trump re election team fired back pointing to technical difficulties that plagued a biden campaign virtual rally with supporters in florida last week biden mocked for technical difficulties during virtual rally joe biden can t put on a simple webcast without catastrophic technical failures so it s hilarious that he thinks he can command an organized national campaign communications director tim murtaugh told fox news o malley dillon spotlighted biden s march and april fundraising figures and said she was comfortable regarding the campaign s resources heading into the general election but the biden campaign had 103 million in their coffers as of the end of april compared to a whopping 255 million cash on hand for the trump reelection campaign and the republican national committee top campaign adviser mike donilon a longtime biden political guru framed the race as a referendum on the job trump s done as president and especially his performance combating the coronavirus there aposs been forces at work in the country and they are what are anchoring this election and it begins with president trump and the perceptions of president trump donilon noted one of the most remarkable things about this campaign so far is that the trump campaign themselves would admit they could not win a referendum on his presidency here in this country today the country knows what aposs at stake we have a president who doesn apost want to talk about the central issue in this campaign right now donilon added he doesn apost want to talk about the coronavirus and his reaction to it he aposs desperate to try to get any form of distraction from it pandemic politics biden trump trade fire over coronavirus donilon also said the biden campaign s ready for the incoming fire from the trump campaign and their republican allies i understand that the president and his allies will undertake every effort to go after the vice president and try to change the subject and distract them donilon said this isn apost new it aposs not like trump started attacking the vice president today or yesterday he aposs been at him all year long and he said that biden s done a pretty good job of beating them back and raising serious questions about the kind of attacks that trump has raised the campaign didn t offer a timeline when asked when the former vice president would return to the campaign trail we aposre very conscious of what we aposre being told what the country is being told and we are going to ensure that we will travel physically to places when the time is right driven by the experts and the guidelines that come and not a day before o malley dillon stressed the latest from fox ne
