The one I was really afraid of': Trump trolls Democrats over Gillibrand 2020 withdrawal

President Trump joked about Kirsten Gillibrand’s departure from the crowded Democratic presidential field.

About an hour after the news broke Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter to mock the 52-year-old New York senator for bowing out.

“A sad day for the Democrats, Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. I’m glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!” Trump said.


Gillibrand launched her bid to unseat the president in March outside of the Trump Tower in Manhattan. She failed to gain much traction and continually polled near the bottom.

A RealClearPolitics national average of polls showed her garnering only 0.1% support at the time she left the race.
