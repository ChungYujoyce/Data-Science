apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new york ap chinese workers who often spend more than 60 hours per week assembling iphones and ipads will have their overtime hours curbed and their pay increased after a labor auditor hired by apple inc inspected their factories the fair labor association says hon hai precision industry co the taiwanese company also known as foxconn that runs the factories in china is committing to a reduction of weekly work time to 49 hours the legal chinese maximum that limit is routinely ignored in factories throughout china auret van heerden ceo of the fair labor association said foxconn is the first chinese company to commit to following the legal standard top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century apple s and fla s own guidelines call for work weeks of 60 hours or less foxconn s moves are likely to have an impact across the global technology industry the company employs 1 2 million workers in china to assemble products for apple microsoft corp hewlett packard co and other pillars of u s technology foxconn s factories are the last step in the process of manufacturing iphones and other apple devices most of which have hundreds of components research firm ihs isuppli estimates that apple pays 8 for the assembly of a 16 gigabyte iphone 4s and 188 for its components it sells the phone wholesale for about 600 to phone companies which then subsidize it to be able to sell it for 200 with a two year service contract ricardo ernst a professor at georgetown university s mcdonough school of business said companies play a risky game when they raise their manufacturing costs because they can be undercut by competitors but isuppli s figures suggest that if apple were to absorb a foxconn wage increase that keeps salaries level while cutting average working hours from 60 to 49 per week it would pay less than 2 extra to have an iphone made other electronics companies particularly pc makers such as dell and hp earn less profit on what they sell and could see a deeper impact thomas dinges an analyst at isuppli said apple s competitors will probably have to accept the price increase too since it s framed as a moral issue at this point it s politics it s not really economics he said adding that there are few alternatives to chinese factories for most of these products the fla auditors visited three foxconn complexes in february and march guanlan and longhua near the coastal manufacturing hub of shenzhen and chengdu in the inland province of sichuan they employ a total of 178 000 workers with an average age of 23 average monthly

mike daisey told of visiting china and talking to underage and injured foxconn workers public radio program this american life used daisey s monologue in a show about foxconn on jan 6 but retracted it two weeks ago saying that daisey had fabricated key parts of it including him meeting 13 year old workers the fla said it didn t find instances of child or forced labor apple has kept a close watch on its suppliers for years and in january took the further step of joining the fla the organization has audited overseas suppliers for clothing manufacturers but apple was the first electronics company to join it also commissioned the fla to produce a special audit of foxconn s factories our team has been working for years to educate workers improve conditions and make apple s supply chain a model for the industry which is why we asked the fla to conduct these audits apple said in a statement apple ceo tim cook visited a foxconn factory in zhengzhou china on wednesday the washington based fla has its roots in a 1996 meeting of multinational companies and nonprofits convened by president clinton who challenged corporate leaders to improve conditions for garment and shoe workers its 19 member board is composed of representatives from member companies universities and nonprofits like the global fairness initiative the organization is funded by participating companies labor unions have criticized apple s use of the fla insisting that audits are a top down approach foxconn s workers would be better served they believe by being able to organize the report will include new promises by apple that stand to be just as empty as the ones made over the past 5 years said sumofus org a coalition of trade unions and consumer groups ahead of the release of the report the fla

committing to recording and addressing all accidents that result in an injury heerden said his auditors found foxconn workers are the happiest with their jobs when they work 52 hours a week well below the amount they often put in reducing their hours to 49 hours should help foxconn retain workers in the long run he said the fla found that many workers at the foxconn factories want to work even more overtime so they can make more money foxconn told the fla that it will raise hourly salaries to compensate workers for the reduced hours heerden said that it s common to find workers in developing countries looking for more overtime rather than less they re often single they re young and there s not much to do so frankly they d just rather work and save he said the auditors examined one years worth of payroll and time records at each factory conducted interviews with some workers and had 35 000 of them fill out anonymous surveys apple has started tracking the working hours of half a million workers in its supply chain and said that 89 percent of them worked 60 hours or less in february even though the company was ramping up
