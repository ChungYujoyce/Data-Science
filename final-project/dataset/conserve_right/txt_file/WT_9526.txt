apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic white house advisers on sunday said the country isn t heading for a recession and played down the effects of president trump s trade war after a wobbly week on wall street arguing that pessimism is the only thing that could hold america back mr trump s chief economic adviser larry kudlow said mr trump has no intention of abandoning his supply side approach to tax cuts and deregulation after u s stocks plunged at midweek on fears of a recession and weak economic performances from germany and china more americans are working they re earning more and even saving a bit as they spend freely top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender i sure don t see a recession we had some blockbuster retail sales consumer numbers towards the back end of last week really blockbuster numbers and in fact despite a lot of worries with the volatile stock market most economists on wall street towards the end of the week had been marking up their forecasts for the third and fourth quarter mr kudlow told nbc s meet the press we re doing pretty darn well in my judgment he added let s not be afraid of optimism mr trump has alienated some voters with his strident rhetoric and unconventional policy moves leaving his approval rating stuck in neutral it also leaves an upbeat economy as his main selling point for reelection next year the president told new hampshire supporters last week that voters savings and other investments are tied to his own fortunes you have no choice but to vote for me the president told a crowd of 12 000 in manchester whether you love me or hate me you ve got to vote for me your 401 k s would be down the tubes if not he revved up the crowd a day after the dow jones industrial average plummeted 800 points or 3 05 the fourth largest drop on record the tech heavy nasdaq and the s p 500 indexes also fell though the markets regained their footing later in the week however the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note at midweek dropped to 1 623 below the two year bond rate which is typically an indication that investors are preparing for an economic slowdown it was the first time such an inversion has occurred since 2007 and the fifth time since 1978 each example was followed by a recession within two years like his advisers mr trump insisted sunday that everything is coming up roses we have the strongest economy by far in the world the tariffs have cost nothing in my opinion or certainly very little mr trump told reporters as he returned to washington from his new jersey vacation china is eating the tariffs at least so far he said i m prepared for everything i don t think we re having a recession despite its upbeat tone the administration has begun to acknowledge some of the economic turmoil mr trump and his advisers blamed the federal reserve for not cutting interest rates fast enough and they delayed some tariffs on chinese goods fearing ripple effects in the christmas shopping season mr kudlow said they will minimize any effects of the trade war on the american consumer though so far it s been virtually zero he said white house trade adviser peter navarro was even more adamant sunday saying the economists who think u s customers are taking it on the chin haven t read the data there s no evidence whatsoever that american consumers are bearing any of this mr navarro told cnn s state of the union democrats disagree though they re stuck in some ways they want to criticize mr trump ahead of the election even as they acknowledge the u s must take a stand against china by and large mr trump s opponents have settled on criticizing him for alienating potential allies and for ignoring the conventional wisdom that tariff costs are passed down to american consumers the american consumer understands that these tariffs are a tax on them one of the greatest tax increases on the middle class in the history of this country former rep beto o rourke of texas a democratic presidential contender told nbc yes we need to hold china accountable but when have we ever gone into a war a military war or a trade war without allies or friends and partners let s make sure that we bring our friends in the european union canada and mexico and others and bring a united front against china to make sure that they respect the rules of the road that they respect our economy our farmers and our workers mr o rourke and montana gov steve bullock another democratic presidential contender said the trade war is doing lasting damage to american farmers because china is a key market mr bullock said mr trump s decision to extend billions of dollars in bailout payments to farmers won t make them whole the payments won t matter if ultimately we do lose market share mr bullock said another democratic presidential hopeful pete buttigieg said mr trump has no strategy for keeping rural america afloat american farmers are getting killed said the 37 year old mayor of south bend indiana who is looking to become the youngest u s president in history mr buttigieg said many of the farmers he meets are republicans who supported mr trump but they are asking a key question how much longer are we suppo
