the global covid 19 crisis seems on track to eclipse 9 11 as the leading defining episode of the 21st century thus far the dystopian trajectory of the pandemic calls for clear accurate information to ensure efficient distribution and use of resources yet one recent example of misinformation related to the likely total number of necessary ventilators indispensable devices in treating the most serious cases of covid 19 not only appeared at major media outlets but even misled the highly respected new england journal of medicine the error conflates the total number of ventilators required with the number of patients who may need the use of a ventilator over the course of the pandemic how the error spread is a cautionary if convoluted tale on march 25 the new york times published anarticletitled amid desperate need for ventilators calls grow for federal intervention that same day former times reporter and author alex berensonpointed outa flaw in the article on twitter thearticleasserted that t he united states currently has between 160 000 and 200 000 ventilators but could need up to a million machines over the course of the outbreak according to the society of critical care medicine as berenson noted thestudyin question did not call for 1 million ventilators but rather that as many as one million people in the united states may need treatment with a ventilatorover the course of the pandemic emphasis added on the same day the times posted acorrectionof that article the times published anotherarticlethat made the same error about the study the secondarticle titled for dr deborah birx urging calm has come with heavy criticism used the identical inaccurate wording that appeared in the first article the united states currently has between 160 000 and 200 000 ventilators but could need up to a million over the course of the outbreak according to the society of critical care medicine despite the first correction thesecond correctiontook several days to appear and did not note the times s repetition of the error the times was not the only media organization to propagate the error while she did not specifically cite the times as her source on march 26 cnn sbrianna keilargrilledwhite house adviser peter navarro about ventilators repeatedly demanding of navarro are we able to get to a million ventilators and ultimately scolded him by saying peter you re wasting everyone s time you re wasting everyone s time with this it s 2020 the president was elected in 2016 can you get to a million ventilators navarro pushed back by parroting keilar s question oh we need a million ventilators we can t possibly get it that s like wildly over what we would need keilar responded peter that s from the society of critical care medicine they said i mean that s the ceiling but they say that s a possibility you have to know that just as the times did twice keilar misinterpreted the study s findings it is unclear if navarro was familiar with the study but he did not specifically correct keilar s error in real time nor have keilar or cnn subsequently issued a correction keilar s sparring with navarro waswidely reportedbyother media further spreading the error perhaps the most egregious use of the misinformation comes from the prestigious new england journal of medicine a march 31 new yorker articleon the potential use of 3 d printers to produce ventilators reported the new england journal of medicine nejm recently predicted that the united states may need as many as a million ventilators and estimates put the country s current stock at no more than a hundred and sixty thousand the article links to the nejm s website where indeed anarticletitled critical supply shortages the need for ventilators and personal protective equipment during the covid 19 pandemic states there is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for u s patients with covid 19 from several hundred thousand to as many as a million to support the claim the nejm ironically enough links to a new york times article but not to either of the articles that originally misstated the study results but rather an earlier march 13articlethat characterized the numbers correctly this march 13 times article referenced a private webinar convened by the american hospital association with dr james lawler an infectious diseases specialist and public health expert at the university of nebraska medical center dr lawler recently presented his own best guess projections to american hospital and health system executives at a private webinar convened by the american hospital association he estimated that some 96 million people in the u s would be infected five out of every 100 would need hospitalization which would mean close to 5 million hospital admissions nearly 2 million of those patients requiring intensive care and about half of those needing the support of ventilators as it turns out this webinar is the original source of the million ventilators misinformation but dr lawler was clearly saying that he believed that if an epidemic involved the eventual infection of 96 million people in the u s the end result of the most serious cases over time would see about half of the 2 million patients requiring intensive care ending up needing the support of ventilators in a final ironic note the society of critical care medicine study on which the times and cnn relied upon refers to lawler s statements in recent aha webinar on covid 19 and in a footnote cites the march 13th new york times article as its source in a fast moving crisis the public is demanding information public officials and health organizations are seeking answers and resources and competing print and tv media organizations are on tight deadlines in this case this perfect storm led to the promulgation of a significant error regarding ventilators a truly critical resource where clear regional shortages exist at this vulnerable time the country its leaders and its citizens need clear and accurate information to save lives and put the nation on the road to recovery this distinctly unfunnycomedy of errors should serve as a warning of where lack of rigor in vetting sources can lead photograph of a ventilator by misha friedman getty images we sent an email to with a link to finish logging in this is really insightful reporting and i m going to suggest a couple of opinions for the rapid propagation of mistaken information misinformation concerning covid 19 data and analysis first i think most broad based news organizations lack the data analytics chops to really dig into the numbers and to do independent analysis there s a lot of parroting this or that expert with no few internal analytic resources seemingly available to do a hard data analysis of expert claims second it is not possible to provide a contextual analysis of covid 19 data in a single graph and 256 characters i wish people would stop re tweeting eye popping graphs that often reflect flawed of amateurish analysis third when you google covid 19 data on testing systems ventilators etc inevitably the top results are news organizations and cable channels rather than technically detailed medical journals and original sources this imho is a huge flaw i would much prefer to see jama the new england journal of medicine and other technical sources listed first in search results as it is i fly past the news organizations to the third or fourth page of search results where the deep useful information sources are hidden jeryl this is a really nice article that clears up what s going on here i certainly took the initial reports at face value and i didn t know about the truth until i read your piece here when it comes to journalism criticism most of it centers on bias too little of it addresses mistakes like this bias is real but it overshadows conversations over these types of mistakes which from my experience seem to be a bit more common than they used to be makes me wonder as to whether journalism schools and the practice of journalism are prioritizing something else more than actual factual reporting i m an attorney and most legal reporting not from mr french is pretty terrible one of the issues here is that criticisms of bias is constant back and forth conservatives both real and those posing as such make allegations of bias in specific reporting some allegations have merit some don t journalists and the left but i repeat myself naturally push back this cycle just seems to overshadow actual factual mistakes like the one you ve discussed here it certainly doesn t help that president trump has essentially made a cartoon out of actual discussions of bias and errors with his constant fake news and hoax claims failed to load posts
