apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a recent threat by the al qaeda affiliated somali terrorist group al shabab to attack shopping malls in europe and the mall of america in minnesota was not credible according to an internal state department security report the threat was based on an al shabab video released friday through twitter that said the group would conduct shooting attacks at seven american or jewish owned shopping centers across the world the attacks would be similar to the slaughter in september 2013 at the westgate mall in nairobi kenya where 71 people were killed by 10 to 15 al shabab terrorists in addition to the mall of america the largest shopping center in the united states others said to be targeted included the west edmonton mall in alberta the oxford street westfield london and westfield stratford malls in london and two paris malls the les quatre temps and the forum des halles top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches the report said the video and threats appeared to be attempts by al shabab to recapture the spotlight from the islamic state spreading from syria and iraq to libya and afghanistan when it comes to influence abroad al shabab s success has been limited to the recruitment of foreign fighters from countries in the west however the group has never conducted an attack outside of east africa leaving the likelihood of a successful al shabab attack outside of the region questionable at best said the report by the overseas security advisory council a state department sponsored security group that supports u s businesses overseas the report contradicts statements by homeland security secretary jeh johnson who said sunday that he takes the al shabab threat seriously anytime a terrorist organization calls for an attack on a specific place we ve got to take that seriously mr johnson told cnn in an apparent bid to lobby for congressional funding for his agency so through our intelligence bulletins through working with state and local law enforcement through working with the fbi we take this kind of thing very seriously congress is holding up funding for the department of homeland security to oppose president obama s amnesty plan for illegal immigrants the state department report said u s drone strikes against al shabab leaders have resulted in significant weakening of the group ahmed abdi godane the group s leader was killed in a september drone strike and in late december abdishakur tahlil an al shabab intelligence chief was killed in a drone attack in early february the al shabab chief of external operations and planning yusef dheeq and other senior leaders were killed in a drone strike nuclear strength marginal the strength of america s strategic nuclear forces is marginal and weapons and infrastructure need greater funding and new policies for modernization according to a report on u s military capabilities the common theme across the services and the united states nuclear enterprise is one of force degradation resulting from many years of underinvestment poor execution of modernization programs and the negative effects of budget sequestration i e cuts in funding on readiness and capacity the report by the heritage foundation states the 330 page report released tuesday identifies major problems in u s nuclear forces which are needed to deter states like china and russia and extend deterrence to u s allies in asia and europe modernization testing and investment in the intellectual talent underpinnings of this sector are the chief elements plaguing the united states nuclear enterprise the report says its delivery platforms are good but the force depends on a very limited set of weapons in number of designs and models that are quite old in stark contrast to the aggressive programs of competitor states while u s nuclear forces are declining russia and china are building up their nuclear forces marine corps lt gen vincent stewart director of the defense intelligence agency told congress this month that russia has placed its highest priority on building up and maintaining strategic nuclear forces priorities for the strategic nuclear forces include the modernization of its road mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles and upgrades to strategic forces command and control facilities gen stewart said in a world threat briefing in the next year russia will field more road mobile ss 27 mod 2 icbms with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles other russian nuclear force improvements include development of the rs 26 ballistic missile which has been identified as a violation of the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty and the dolgorukiy ballistic missile submarine and its ss n 32 bulava submarine launched ballistic missile russia also is building advanced air and ground launched cruise missiles china is building up its nuclear forces with new road mobile missiles and nuclear missile submarines china is adding more survivable road mobile systems enhancing its silo based systems and developing a sea based nuclear deterrent gen stewart said the heritage report 2015 index of u s military strength assessing america s ability to provide for the common defense grades u s nuclear forces as marginal on a 5 point scale ranging from very week to very strong the report warns that the consensus in congress for funding nuclear weapons modernization has begun to unravel the administration promised to invest 85 billion for modernization prior to senate ratification in 2010 of the new strategic arms reduction treaty but because of defense cuts under the budget control act and increased costs for nuclear infrastructure and bomb life extension programs the obama administration s budget requests since 2010 have not reflected the commitment to fully fund key nuclear programs on the schedule that it specified to the senate in november 2010 the report states congress has gone along with the funding delays and some program cancellations the report quotes rose gottemoeller the state department s acting undersecretary for arms control and international security as saying we re not modernizing we re not modernizing that is one of the basic basic i would say principles and rules that have really been part of our nuclear posture view and part of the policy a policy of banning development of modern nuclear warheads also is weakening u s strategic forces these policies will also make it more difficult to preserve the agility within the united states knowledge and technology base that is necessary to adjust rapidly to surprise developments in other nations nuclear weapons programs the report says the u s will continue to face challenges presented by its aging stockpile a lack of funding for nuclear weapons modernization and infrastructure recapitalization and policy constraints on yield producing experiments china urged to curb asat china s development of anti satellite weapons is destabilizing and threatens strategic u s systems used in communication navigation and intelligence gathering according to a state department arms control official frank a rose assistant secretary of state for arms control verification and compliance said the united states would not cooperate with china on its space program until beijing halts its anti satellite weapons activities the continued development and testing of destructive asat systems is both destabilizing and threatens the long term security and sustainability of the outer space environment mr rose said noting that beijing s 2007 asat test created thousands of pieces of dangerous floating space debris space systems provide a wide range of services including communications navigation intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance and meteorology producing what mr rose said are vital national military civil scientific and economic benefits without mentioning china mr rose said other nations understand the strategic benefits of space systems and are seeking to counter the u s strategic advantage by pursuing capabilities to deny or destroy our access to space services the use of space arms could produce an escalation of conflict he warned the chinese asat weapons program is preventing closer space cooperation he added noting that a step by step approach to space cooperation is possible only if china changes its behavior with regard to asats he did not elaborate in the friday speech mr rose said china s recent test of a ballistic missile defense system was in fact an anti satellite weapons test china s missile defenses are among the more secret elements of china s military buildup mr rose said noting that a 2014 missile defense test was in fact an anti satellite missile test on july 23 2014 the chinese government conducted a nondestructive test of a missile designed to destroy satellites in low earth orbit he said however china publicly called this asat test a land based missile interception test mr rose said the chinese statement was a lie and that the u s government has confidence that the deceptive weapons experiment was indeed an asat test the united states wants a frank and open dialogue with china on nuclear issues mr rose said china has refused to engage the united states in talks on nuclear arms over concerns that such talks would reveal secrets that china believes could undermine its nuclear deterrent contact bill g
