tampa crowd on oct 25 2012 with women supporters filling up the risers behind him as both candidates appeal to female voters fnc a day after an interview aired in which president obama declared he still has the lead another national poll showed mitt romney slightly ahead while erasing obama apos s advantage among women the associated press gfk poll showed romney pulling 47 percent of likely voters to obama apos s 45 percent a split within the margin of error but which certainly challenges the president apos s claim of having the edge even in the battleground states which decide the election polls now reflect a series of tossups the president had claimed the advantage over romney during an interview with nbc news asked about the polls showing a virtually tied race obama appeared to challenge the premise well actually i think that you know we always knew this was going to be a close race from the start and what we have right now is a lead that we apos ve maintained throughout this campaign obama said and we are going to just continue to drive home the message that there are two fundamentally different choices in this election about where we take the country polls show obama is ahead in states like ohio and pennsylvania but romney has long since taken the lead in florida north carolina and elsewhere and nationally the republican nominee typically has a very slight edge the associated press gfk survey was no different but significantly the poll showed each candidate apos s gender advantage shrinking the poll showed romney erasing the president apos s 16 point lead among women pulling to a 47 47 percent tie also romney apos s 13 point advantage among men had shrunk to 5 points in the poll the erosion of obama apos s support among women though was more dramatic and this week the president was making a fresh attempt to appeal to that base trying to link romney to comments made by a republican senate candidate in indiana about rape richard mourdock said during a debate that pregnancy resulting from rape can be something god intended romney has since distanced himself from the remark with the campaign reiterating that romney while pro life condones abortion in cases of rape and incest but the obama campaign has nevertheless tried to link romney to mourdock noting that the republican nominee has not dropped his support for the senate candidate and appeared in a new ad on his behalf the obama campaign put out a web video thursday morning tying mourdock apos s position on abortion to republican running mate paul ryan apos s the ad reads mitt romney apos s apos solution apos to extremism against women promote the extremists it shows a split picture of ryan and mourdock the president also told late night host jay leno on wednesday that i don apos t know how these guys come up with these ideas let me make a very simple proposition rape is rape the comments and video pick up the war on women claims that democrats have been making about republicans for months however romney has made an effort to show his moderate side and direct his economic pitch to a female audience and the latest poll suggests it was having an effect a month ago women favored obama over romney on the economy 56 percent to 40 percent now the split has shifted to 49 percent for romney and 45 percent for obama the poll still showed obama with a hefty lead 55 percent to 41 percent among female likely voters on the question of which candidate would make the right decisions on women apos s issues overall people are significantly more
