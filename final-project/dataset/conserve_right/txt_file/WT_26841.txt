example of pyongyang using a summit of u s and japanese leaders to amplify its demands the threat came as president trump was flying to tokyo for talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe talks that will include what the next steps should be in the u s talks with north korea the north koreans have already carried out multiple weapons tests this month past meetings between mr trump and mr abe having been overshadowed by carefully timed north korean military provocations and analysts say pyongyang may be preparing a fresh round of launches to coincide with mr trump s arrival in tokyo for a three day visit saturday top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director we should not be shocked that as soon as this weekend more missiles will fly into the sky and tensions will climb with them even higher said harry j kazianis a korea specialist with the center for the national interest in washington north korea s state controlled media warned friday that nuclear negotiations will never resume unless the trump administration moves away from what pyongyang described as unilateral demands for disarmament this weekend s trump abe talks come as u s north korean direct talks have been largely on hold following the collapse of the second kim trump summit in hanoi in february mr trump has said he walked away because the north koreans demanded sweeping sanctions relief in exchange for only a limited commitment to destroy part of their nuclear arsenal north korean officials later challenged that characterization and subsequently gave the u s a deadline of the end of 2019 to offer an acceptable deal national security sources say the administration is wary of being tricked by the north koreans who have a history of defying u n security council resolutions and delaying past negotiations while clandestinely building up its nuclear arsenal the latest statement from pyongyang came through the state controlled korean central news agency a foreign ministry official told the news service washington deliberately undermined the hanoi summit by making unilateral and impossible demands we hereby make it clear once again that the united states would not be able to move us even an inch with the device it is now weighing in its mind and the further its mistrust and hostile acts toward north korea grow the fiercer our reaction will be the statement said unless the united states puts aside the current method of calculation and comes forward with a new method of calculation the north korea u s dialogue will never be resumed and by extension the prospect for resolving the nuclear issue will be much

policy toward the north mr kazianis said there was a real potential for more missile launches in the coming days in light of mr trump s trip to japan japan which hosts a large presence of u s military forces has watched mr trump s personal diplomacy with some unease as japan is already vulnerable to conventional ballistic missiles that may not be addressed in the u s north korea talks mr trump s meeting with mr abe in february 2017 at the president s mar a lago resort in florida is perhaps best remembered for how it was disrupted when north korea test launched an short range ballistic missile into the sea of japan as the two leaders were dining pyongyang sent several subsequent missiles into the sea of japan during the months that followed before launching an intermediate range ballistic missile in august of 2017 that traveled more than 1 600 miles and crossed over japan in mid flight that test took center stage when mr trump made his first visit japan as president in november 2017 at the time mr trump told reporters that north korea s missiles could be neutralized because mr abe will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the united states while the year and a half since saw a dramatic cooling of tensions and an almost unprecedented period of diplomacy with two denuclearization summits between mr trump and mr kim
