apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the white house on monday defended president obama s decision to enter into the paris climate accord without senate ratification but stopped short of confirming a chinese report that he will do so this week during his trip to china still it would surprise no one if mr obama and chinese president xi jinping were to announce the ratification of the sweeping climate change agreement before the sunday opening of the group of 20 summit in hangzhou zhejiang white house senior adviser brian deese said the president has the legal authority to ratify the accord without the two thirds senate vote required for treaties he said the pact negotiated by 195 countries in december is merely an executive agreement photos see obama s biggest white house fails the president will use his authority that has been used in dozens of executive agreements in the past to join and formally deposit our instrument of acceptance and therefore put our country as a party to the paris agreement mr deese said at a white house press conference he noted that both presidents announced in march that they would seek to formally join the paris agreement in 2016 that s a process that is quite well established in our existing legal system and in the context of international agreements and international arrangements mr deese said there is a category of them that are treaties that require advice and consent from the senate but there s a broad category of executive agreements where the executive can enter into those agreements without that advice and consent photos child stars who grew up to be stunning adults republicans have insisted that the accord requires senate ratification and warned the obama administration as well as international leaders that congress will not be bound by an agreement ratified by unilateral executive action myron ebell director of the competitive enterprise institute s center for energy and environment predicted monday that mr obama will pretend to ratify the treaty in china what could be more insulting to our constitution than ratifying it in the presence of the chinese president dictator asked mr ebell who opposes the deal and what could be more appropriate since like xi obama is unaccountable speculation about the ratification soared after the south china morning post reported that two leaders are set to jointly announce their ratification as early as friday the report cited sources who said that senior climate officials from both countries worked late into the night in beijing on tuesday to finalize details mr deese confirmed that he traveled to china last week to meet with officials on the paris agreement which calls for nations to adopt emissions limits with the aim of holding increases in global temperatures well below 2 degrees celsius from pre industrial levels i anticipate when the presidents meet they will discuss topics that will include this issue of trying to get the paris agreement to enter into force as quickly as possible mr deese said u n secretary general ban ki moon issued a plea last month for world leaders to accelerate the ratification process which lost steam after the agreement was announced in december to take effect the accord must be signed and ratified by 55 nations responsible for at least 55 percent of global emissions so far 23 nations emitting about 1 percent of greenhouse gases have completed the ratification process according to climate analytics ratification tracker together the u s and china represent just under 40 percent of global emissions said mr deese so the act of our two countries joining and when that happens will help move us closer to that goal climate change skeptics dismissed the anticipated executive ratification as a sham designed to prop up mr obama s legacy climate depot s marc morano predicted that obama will surely do his best play acting and pretend the ratification has actual meaning but as a former constitutional law professor even he knows better what they need right now is a game changer and if they can t get it then true to form they will manufacture the illusion of it australian science writer joanne nova said on her jonova blog sen james m inhofe oklahoma republican and senate environment and public works committee chairman has repeatedly said that the paris agreement will change nothing he issued a white paper in april that said the pact amounts to empty promises that will have no meaningful impact on the climate the problem with international climate change agreements is that they ignore basic economic and political realities and therefore are doomed to failure said mr inhofe when the hype over the signing fades the reality will set in that the policies president obama is promising will not last critics fear that the executive branch will use the paris agreement while not legally binding to enact sweeping climate policies without congress mr obama has argued that urgent action is needed no challenge poses a great threat to future generations than climate change he said last year mr deese credited the president with reaching out to china to reset the international malaise on climate change that followed the failed 1997 kyoto protocol and the 2009 copenhagen summit which resulted in a weak accord that was not adopted i think the second significant thing about president s approach to climate change is seen in his engagement with china mr deese said the president recognized early on in the administration that if we were going to have an effective global response to climate change we were going to have to write a new playbook that the old approaches had not succeeded the paris agreement was the result of a very consistent and steady diplomatic effort that the president prioritized year after year working to restore u s credibility on climate issues through our climate action plan demonstrating that we actually could make progress in reducing emissions he said mr obama is scheduled to embark wednesday on a pacific rim trip that includes a stop in honolulu for the world conservation congress the g 20 summit in china and a visit to
