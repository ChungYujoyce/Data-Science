national review the 82 day dictatorship the cummings standard dominic cummings fights the blob ending abortion of down syndrome children in the united kingdom it s time to mothball the imf the world health organization and other sensitive souls have instructed us to stop referring to the new strain of coronavirus as the wuhan or chinese flu because of the racist connotations i m disinclined to curb my speech to placate chinese propagandists and it seems to me the aversion to those terms is less about racism than about averting blame but in the spirit of comity and avoiding disparaging an entire nation i m happy to call it the chicom flu moving forward there are many traditional naming conventions that don t really make that much sense somewhat weirdly for example we often name diseases after the people who discover them hodgkin s disease after thomas hodgkin parkinson s disease after james parkinson and so on but naming viral diseases after places guinea worm west nile virus ebola rocky mountain spotted fever etc is probably just intuitive viruses come from someplace after all and thus people gravitate to those names i doubt we came up with lyme disease because of some deep enmity towards connecticut anyway covid 19 or h1n1 don t exactly roll off the tongue the latter was until very recently widely referred to as the spanish flu a virus that killed around 675 000 americans and tens of millions of others around the world in the early 1900s spanish flu has now retroactively fallen into disfavor as well and to be fair there is some historical evidence that the virus may actually have originated in china or france so if we must call it the french flu moving forward so be it jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist

the communist chinese have been far more effective in stopping the spread of information about the coronavirus than in stopping the spread of the coronavirus itself today for example china expelled most american journalist from the country early on the communists destroyed samples and suppressed vital information that could have helped mitigate the damage of this new strain of coronavirus the government also silenced doctors who warned about the disease some were censured for spreading rumors or sharing test results with colleagues and some were forced to write a self critical public letters a marxist mainstay admitting that the warning had a negative impact the chinese communists probably let five million people leave wuhan without screening according to the wall street journal the chinese communists like all communists hide their societal problems there is no crime disease or addiction in the collectivist state this kind of secrecy and dishonesty can be disastrous especially in a highly interconnected world though millions of chinese have been lifted out of extreme poverty through free trade with modernity comes some basic responsibilities like for instance not killing everyone in the world with preventable zoonotic diseases the chinese regime is perfectly capable of administering an array of authoritarian policies to suppress the rights of its own people but it s apparently unable to exert even mild cultural pressure warning them that their eating habits can be extraordinarily dangerous and hold the potential of creating massive socioeconomic problems if reports are correct it was in wuhan s popular wet markets that vendors were selling the bats and possibly snakes that may have caused the covid 19 outbreak wet because the meat sold in its unsanitary stalls was only recently slaughtered this kind of thing happens quite often and not always in china of course but the avian influenza was likely transmitted to humans from chickens in a wet market scientists have been warning for years that the eating of exotic animals in southern china is a time bomb acute respiratory syndrome sars also originated in china and probably jumped to humans through bats other coronavirus strains are also likely connected to bats i hate to thrust my western cultural values on anyone but maybe it s time to stop eating bats it s important to stress that it s not the chinese people who are the problem just look at their success in taiwan hong kong singapore or the united states the chicoms are the problem if the chinese government spent as much time working on educating its people and regulating dangerous markets as it does on secrecy and propaganda efforts maybe it wouldn t have to worry as much about diseases being named after it or about the catastrophic death and economic pain their negligence helps cause get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
