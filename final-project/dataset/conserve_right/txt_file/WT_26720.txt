chinese imports sept 1 because president xi jinping is not going fast enough on trade talks swiftly erasing a day of gains on wall street and rattling retailers that say it s u s consumers not beijing who will take it on the chin in a sudden announcement the president said mr xi failed to meet two u s preconditions for holding off on further tariffs that he block shipments of synthetic opioids to the u s and purchase more american farm products i think he wants to make a deal but frankly he s not going fast enough mr trump said of mr xi he said he was going to be buying from our farmers he didn t do that he said he was going to stop fentanyl from coming into our country it s all coming out of china he didn t do that we re losing thousands of people to fentanyl see also china threatens retaliation for trump s planned tariff hike mr trump said the tariffs will be on top of heftier levies affecting more than 250 billion in imports and will start at 10 but could slide up to 25 unless both sides strike a deal trade negotiations fell apart in may with mr trump accusing the chinese of reneging on earlier commitments talks appeared to get back on track in june during the group of 20 summit in japan where mr xi made the commitment to buy more american farm products mr trump has downplayed the chance of a deal since then he suggested that the chinese are trying to wait and see whether he loses his 2020 reelection bid so they can deal with someone else they re praying they re praying they would like to see a new president in a year and a half so they can continue to rip off the united states like they ve been doing for the last 25 years mr trump told supporters at a thursday evening rally in ohio the president said he would like to sign a deal but it would have to be on his terms otherwise he said he will continue with hefty tariffs we have rebuilt china now it s time that we change things around he told white house reporters earlier thursday making the case that trade flows are imbalanced if they don t want to trade with us anymore that would be fine by me it would save a lot of money mr trump insists that china is paying the tariffs directly into u s coffers

after the tariff announcement despite a rosier picture earlier in the day the dow jones industrial average closed 280 points down just over 1 retailers said mr trump was headed down the wrong path we

will only threaten u s jobs and raise costs for american families on everyday goods said david french senior vice president for government relations at the national retail federation the tariffs imposed over the past year haven t worked and there s no evidence another tax increase on american businesses and consumers will yield new results he said we urge the administration to bring our allies to the table and find new tools beyond tariffs to achieve better trade relations on capitol hill sen ron wyden of oregon said he is first in line for cracking down on china but mr trump appears to lack a winning strategy the tariffs announced today will raise costs on everything from computers to backpacks to clothes as kids go back to school without any reason to think that it will make china stop stealing our technology and undercutting american jobs mr wyden said trump said he d bring back americans jobs instead he s picking their pockets the u s chamber of commerce said the tariffs will only inflict greater pain on american businesses farmers workers and consumers and undermine an otherwise strong u s economy even as he slammed china mr trump held out hope for a trade deal after constructive talks between both sides in shanghai this week mr trump said his new levies will take effect as chinese negotiators travel in september to washington the site of failed talks
