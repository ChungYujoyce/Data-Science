the victory means for his campaign going forward and then there was one there is an expression on wall street for a stock that just keeps moving up and up while everybody is scratching their heads trying to figure out what s going on they put their hands up and say don t fight the tape it comes from back in the day when there actually was ticker tape and when wall street wasn t everyone s favorite punching bag but it helps explain what is going on right now in the mind bending age of donald trump you can t fight the tape and you can t fight a phenomenon donald trump is a phenomenon barack obama was a phenomenon a phenomenon is a happening or an experience it doesn t happen much folks but it s happening now so get ready for the ride of a lifetime the point is all the wise old men and naysayers and chart readers in the world can t stop a political phenomenon when it s pulling out of the trump train station all the wise old men and naysayers and chart readers in the world can t stop a political phenomenon when it s pulling out of the trump train station nobody was going to beat barack obama in 2008 that s a fact it was his moment it wasn t that john mccain ran a bad campaign or picked the wrong vp it was just that it didn t matter it was over when it started it has to do with understanding your moment reading the populace knowing that they want exactly the opposite of what they ve had in the white house they want a charismatic candidate to match what they are feeling and promise to give them exactly the big fat cheeseburger they ve been wanting ever since they went on that awful diet michelle obama told her husband it was iowa or bust for them she knew that if they couldn t win iowa they couldn t win america but if they could there would be no stopping them she told her husband it was now or never and that she would only do this thing once even though he was a new senator she correctly assessed this was their moment and they would not get a redo she was absolutely right on the country was war weary and the handsome young senator promised hope and change political pendulums swing hard and feed on stark contrast he was not a bush and not a clinton not at all in fact he was barack hussein obama he was kennedy esque with a young attractive family he was bobby kennedy s dream of how the civil rights movement crescendos he was the man who perfectly matched the mood and he grabbed it that s what it s all about just ask governor chris christie who missed his moment had he run against barack obama in 2012 he would have won the tough talking new jersey governor was getting a ton of attention in 2011 he d shockingly won a blue state governor s race when the odds were stacked against him he was telling it like it is to anybody who crossed him he shouted down teacher s unions for depriving kids of the education they deserved he told firefighters and policeman that the pensions they d been promised would never arrive if they weren t willing to give back a little to keep the programs solvent these youtube hits were going viral getting coverage the portly governor with his tie askew was the opposite of the snappily dressed lean and eloquent president who d lost his shine a bit four years in but while gop leaders begged christie to run he demurred he said he wasn t ready it wasn t his time but as it turns out it was and he never got it back so now we have had 8 years of obamacare and obamanomics eight years of promising to end the era of war still we are mired in rising costs stunted economic growth and an epic battle with an enemy that is a he who shall not be named except that everybody knows his name is radical islamist terrorist in fairness the president s approval numbers have risen of late to 51 percent many are satisfied however it may have something to do with the tenor of the sloppy primaries that have given him almost former president nostalgia points already still there is an undeniable restlessness in the country we see it in the crowds who turn out in droves for bernie and donald as long as it took for republicans to see donald trumpis the perfect storm of message make america great again genius simplicity and man this brash businessman anti obama sold his brand brilliantly with his huge success on the apprentice now reality tv meets politics i bet mark burnett wishes he d thought of it he was from the beginning the guy we all already knew love him or hate him he leapt over the name recognition hurdle like it was a parking curb and it didn t even cost him a dime but surely he would not abide the rigor and tedium of the campaign trail what would he do fly his jet all around the country yes stay at holiday inns in places that don t have trump hotels um yes surely this rich guy wouldn t have a way with voters he d rather be in his tower as his beautiful wife sips champagne he doesn t drink not out there in flyover state diners and arenas pressing the flesh wrong he would say scandalous things yes just think of all the tape and tabloid that already existed on this guy there would be no way he d get away with it wrong again besides the republicans had the deepest bench they d had in a long time superstars scott walker jeb bush ted cruz marco rubio carly fiorina the list went on and on actually it even spilled across two debate stages there were so many bright and talented options all they had to do was nominate the most conservative electable one as bill buckley had instructed see mitt romney john mccain bob dole and they must remember as ronald reagan warned no shooting inside the tent guys well without apologies to buckley or reagan the guy who beat them all was not your textbook conservative to be sure and he shot up the tent until it fell down on top of them as he slipped out the back flap and dusted off his suit here s the thing his message was right on for his audience he talked to them about what he felt was wrong with the country and how he wanted to fix it too many illegals stealing your jobs and committing crimes build a wall your company went under we will get you a better job sick of everything being so damned pc me too he said don t worry we are going to win again you ll be so tired of winning that sounds awesome they cried and then to top it all off he made them laugh he made them howl actually at the off color jokes and craps and hells he sprinkled in with his happy warrior rants the pundits scoffed it ll be over by summer make that fall the super bowl the conventions forget it guys trump s son don jr nailed it he said my dad is a blue collar billionaire a common sense conservative none of this highfalutin panel jibber jabber gimme trump the gop voters said the guy gets me donald has wanted this shot at the white house since the early 90 s when he took out full page ads and wrote letters railing against japan and how they were eating our lunch and it needed to stop now his handsome well educated and well liked kids are taking the weight off him at the office and he knows this is his time it s now or never and one other thing don t look for mr trump to get all presidential on you any time soon why would he as any good businessman knows if it ain t broke don t fix it and like he says it s too soon for that i haven t even started on hillary but can he seal the deal buckle your seat belts america it s going to be
