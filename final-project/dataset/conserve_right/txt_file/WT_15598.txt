apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the chinese people s liberation army air force is feeling the heat from higher command for failing to produce enough qualified pilots and for spending too much on pilot training last week a comprehensive combat pilot training program was announced to meet the challenges china is in overdrive to expand its air power the air force is under intense pressure to address some of its shortfalls now that gen xu qiliang a seasoned fighter pilot and one of the two vice chairmen of the all powerful central military commission was promoted to be the

qualified pilots for the rapidly expanding air force while their political and ideological correctness is overemphasized many pilot trainees lack basic knowledge of modern science or a broad understanding of aviation principles a requirement for operating sophisticated jet and weapons technologies in the meantime the cost of training pilots keeps skyrocketing as training cycles are

reform minded communist official in fujian province a stone s throw from taiwan across the 100 mile wide taiwan strait in addition to its geographic proximity to taiwan fujian shares close ancestral linguistic cultural economic and political ties with the taiwanese today there are more taiwanese businessmen and taiwanese investment in fujian than in any other region of china mr xi is said to have
