apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the mueller report made president trump an unencumbered incumbent for the first time while that may not seem like much in presidential re election politics it has been decisive democrats know that too it is why they have worked so hard to keep mr trump encumbered with russian collusion charges and why they will try to encumber him again going forward to understand the importance to mr trump of being no longer encumbered with russian collusion charges look at rasmussen s daily job performance tracking poll on march 25 the monday after the report was sent to the attorney general march 22 and the attorney general wrote to congress summarizing its conclusions march 24 mr trump s rating was 45 percent approve and 54 percent disapprove a week later on april 1 after the conclusions had been widely reported mr trump s rating was 51 49 percent a net 11 point shift from 9 to 2 if that seems insignificant consider rasmussen s tracking poll for barack obama at the same point in his presidency april 1 2011 was 44 54 percent mr obama had the same rating as mr trump s before the mueller report lifted the collusion cloud top stories cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning mr obama without being so encumbered was where the encumbered mr trump was mr obama went on to win re election handily where then could the now unencumbered mr trump be when he seeks re election next year certainly democrats are asking that question and it is equally certain they do not like the answer democrats are right to be concerned they have had a right to be since november 2016 the reason is simple winning the presidency the first time decidedly tilts the field toward the incumbent winning re election so long as they are not encumbered with negative baggage the biggest encumbrance an incumbent president can have is a negative economy since 1916 only three elected incumbents have lost re election hoover carter and bush i each one had negative real gdp growth within a year of their run only one bucked the trend truman in 1948 not only does mr trump not have a weak economy he has an extremely favorable one and an extremely favorable comparison here with mr obama he likely will also have other accomplishments in foreign policy trade defense and border security by next november with these tailwinds an unencumbered trump is likely to run well next november the early improvement in mr trump s rasmussen polling numbers may seem small but small changes can be really big in presidential politics first put into context the group among whom this small change is likely occurring these are unaligned voters the small nonpartisan segment of the electorate the partisan electorate has already made up their mind on the mueller report with each seeing it through their own political lens they are not moving however the movable nonpartisan portion of the electorate is critical in the last seven presidential elections no popular vote winner broke 53 percent mr obama fell just shy with 52 9 percent in 2008 absent that none hit even 51 percent during that span the average margin of victory has been just 4 3 percent that means just a 2 16 percent shift in the popular vote would have changed the popular vote winner by 4 10 rasmussen s tracking poll had mr trump s rating at 51 47 percent while 51 percent represents the barest of majorities it would be 5 percent above his 2016 total when he won handily won the electoral college vote if mr trump were to actually win that same percentage of the popular vote in 2020 with the vote placement he had in 2016 he would be essentially unbeatable it also is a good reflection of what the mueller report has meant for mr trump in itself it is only a de facto positive in as much as it removed the negative of the russian collusion allegation mr trump s seemingly small bump is indicative of what can happen as positives do occur by being unencumbered his ceiling has been raised it becomes increasingly clear as 2020 moves increasingly closer if democrats want mr trump encumbered they are going to have to do it themselves and the mueller report s early aftermath shows that democrats must have mr trump encumbered to win in 2020 democrats best bet then is to try to keep the russian collusion charge alive if at all possible it is a safe bet that they will do everything they can to do so j t young served in the office of management and budget and at the treasury d
