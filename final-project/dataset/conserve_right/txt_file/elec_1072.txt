victory speech which was delivered around 3 00 a m in new york city rival candidate hillary clinton had already called trump to concede he told the crowd trump complimented clinton on running a hard fought campaign she fought very hard he said hillary has worked very long and hard over a long period of time and we owe her a major debt of gratitude for her service to our country i mean that very sincerely trump then turned to the business of healing the vast political divide he promised to be a president for all americans for those who have chosen not to support me in the past of which there were a few people i m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work together and unify our great country he said the president elect claimed to have a great economic plan though he offered no details he closed by thanking his most vocal supporters his family rudy giuliani sen jeff sessions ben carson and others and assuring the american people that you ll be so proud of your president by the time his reign comes to an end trump s election has sent shockwaves the markets are in free fall democratic voters are petrified and the media has no idea what just happened libertarians should be girding themselves for four years of the federal government trampling their freedoms but of course we ve come to expect that regardless as i wrote on facebook earlier tonight it s perhaps moments like this where the case for the libertarian vision of a constrained government is most powerful i m watching msnbc as i write this and i just heard lawrence o donnell say the following the constitution anticipated this the founding fathers anticipated donald trump they feared tyrants they were overthrowing the rule of a king and they designed a separation of powers government in which all of the true powers belonged to congress those can then be reviewed by the courts that didn t take long the left is interested in limited government again would have been nice to have them with us during obama s eight years in office but we ll take what we can get i guess advertisement next donald trump projected winner president elect robby soave is a senior editor at

ugh i kept flipping back and forth between fox news msnbc and cnn just to get the full spectrum of emotional response the giddiness at fox the bitterness at msnbc and the constantly playing with map at cnn i make up to 90 an hour working from my home my story is that i quit working at walmart to work online and with a little effort i easily bring in around 70h to 86h go this website and click tech tab to start your work visit this web http www trends88 com i guess froot sooshi really is a progressive masquerading as a libertarian unless he was watching for the sweet sweet tears i was flipping between cnn and msnbc last night for those reasons i was just lapping up some sweet prog tears on my derpbook feed delicious donald what is best in life to crush your enemies see them driven before you and hear the lamentations of their women when you grab their pussy best lamentation delivered by npr from wellesley college check it out i think i may post that on derpbook just to keep the tears and outrage flowing freely the best one i ve had so far is that since the republican s won the senate and the house and we have president hitler trump gay rights and women s rights would be set back 100 years ummm no as far as that goes isn t trump pro gay rights also never mind the fact that her highness was against redefining marriage until just a few years ago when it suddenly became politically preferable to be pro gay marriage but ignore that trump fucking grabbed pussy as far as that goes isn t trump pro gay rights he seems to be which is weird lgbt democrats on my fb keep whining about how this is the end for them and they re gonna loose marriage i m just thinking i don t remember you whining like this when obama was first elected and he was explicitly against gay marriage not just imaginary against gay marriage you re not a libertarian trump grabbed robby by the pussy grab its motherfucking pussy historic it s gonna be fascinating watching lew rockwell cheer on federal government expansion under trump sweet salty tears there s never been a lesser or greater case for limited government robby there s just the case for limited government it s timeless and it s always been right and it always will be yes and just as the democrats rediscover their appreciation for limited government the republicans will discard it just like things switched 180 degrees between bush and obama i expect the anti war movement will suddenly twitch back to life as well why the hell did trump get us involved with isis anyway does this mean that finally everything is no longer bush s fault yup bush is finally off the hook now everything s trump s fault and homelessness yes indeed as will calls for free speech even by college leftists to answer robbie s question the other two presidents that were new york millionaires of dutch ancestry look if you keep posting threads like this the main election thread isn t getting to 2000 comments that thread was all glitchy for me for 3 hours i thought the russians brought down reason com but it was only the tears from progressives that damaged internet servers everywhere i though google staff was going to shut down everything when it was clear trump was winning same for me i fell asleep just after midnight think i ll get some coffee and look forward to wonderful wonderful prog and media tears oh they started about 1 30am est shocked they are trump dismissed all the curve balls thrown by liberal media rinos and progressives house cleaning is in order so how long until president pence what will pelosi wear where she becomes speaker again in 2019 will lizzie warren be prez in 2020 will this cause people to realize that the federal government is too powerful and we need to reduce its power if the wrong top man is such a threat hey stop laughing find out all this and more on the next episode of dope so trump won huh didn t expect that it was obvious that hillary wouldn t crush him though so does this make trump the new andrew jackson he does seem to be the closest equivalent except jackson was a senator wait for the new trail of mexican muslim tears let me know if trump invites bums into the white house for parties and walks around bare foot i could see wi sending a giant cheese wheel to the white house he s out for a gambol applause has there ever been a more powerful case for limited government yes froot sushi his name is barack obama you may have heard of him you know pres pen phone mr chief executive order that guy don t make robby do say anything that might be construed as racist that didn t take long the left is interested in limited government again would have been nice to have them with us during obama s eight years in office but we ll take what we can get i guess that s about as forceful as you get from froot sooshi unless your surname starts with o and ends with keefe then he ll get rhetorically shirt rippin florida man on your ass robby judges all people by their hair style and compared to trumpy obama is a clear winner thus trump is the most powerful case for limiting government also jfk the best president with reagan a close second melania will be flotus yes froot sooshi a real bona fide honest to goodness naturalised slavic immigrant and she hasn t been exactly been beaten with an ugly stick either i look forward to troomp s many burlusconi esque or burlusque episodes should prove to be quite entertaining obumbles for all his many faults is an attractive man even with all that snow on the roof i d expect robby to be googley eyed over obumbles hair flair i eagerly anticipate the white house bunga bung parties the lack of edit is painful assuming you meant flatus this is one of the main reasons i voted for trump i just did not want bill clinton as flotus i suppose that would be fgotus at least we ll have one of the best looking first ladies in the world never mentioning the horror a hillary win would have brought no no trump is the maniac you see not the woman with no achievements who is well documented as being a lying corrupt incompetent criminal sociopath who would be enabled by the federal bureaucracy the establishment politicians and the media well we ve made our choice between brain cancer bone cancer mcl tear or acl tear here is the good about trump he doesn t owe anybody anything not the big banks not wall street not corporate interests not foreign powers not even the republican party so he can act according to what he thinks would be best for country best of all he is reviled by the media the federal bureaucracy and career politicians of both parties so his ability to cause any actual mischief will be quite limited compared to hillary so i would say the nation chose a nagging toothache over colon cancer constipation vs colon cancer not sure how you can say he owes nothing to the republican party if the gop hadn t mobilized its resources to do the job trump couldn t be bothered doing you know like voter identification and gotv efforts that razor thin victory would have been a rout not to mention her warmongering finally all those proggy opponents of the imperial presidency will awaken from their 8 year hibernation and again favor us with their wisdom at last the return of the anti war giant paper mache heads protest will again be heroically patriotic rather than despicably racist oh and better cancel your cocktail party invitations not only will the progs be attacking trump s supposed libertarian ideology they will be attacking johnson for being a spoiler their sentiments are completely insincere when their bernie 2 0 candidate is elected they ll complain about how he can t get anything done because of the gop congress and they ll cheer every time he figures out a way around them look that may have been true before but this time this time they totally mean it and will totally see the light if robby believes hard enough he can change them he knows he can the home is that each time this happens and you get people from the out of power party becoming fibertarians is that you hold on to them when they recover power again excellent point will the con libertarians on this board become trump supporters we know who we are i ll do my best not to bow to the donald remember all those people talking about how opposed and constrained trump will be well now you have to prove it when he takes an anti liberty position slam him for it don t forgive him for it don t make excuses etc or you can just admit you re a republican who got interested in liberty because your team was out of power and you didn t want the government effecting your life listen we all know trump is a wild card i m not all that thrilled he is our president but the progtard tears will sustain me until january i will go back to being a good libertarian then i promise i don t trust trump to keep his promises if i did i d have voted for him because of his list of justices who would make the supreme court great again he still might use that list but i won t hold my breath but he sounds conciliatory right now who knows maybe he ll keep the supreme court promise and not the bad promises he will probably play things by ear and so might on occasion stumble into doing the right thing as opposed to hillary who is committed to doing the wrong thing i should say hillary who was committed to doing the wrong thing i hope she won t be in a position to do much wrong now that she s lost you shouldn t be trusting any newly elected president to keep his her promises so much for the whole only trump can lose to hillary and hillary s hope that trump would be a pushover however we have to deal with trump now um yeah you could have beaten hillary with those emails coming out unless you have some dark secrets we are unaware of so any bets on how long until comey suspiciously commits suicide my money is on weiner for the deadpool if i was carlos danger right about now i d be asking for a witness protection program relocation somewhere in alaska he s safe by losing the presidency hillary s power and protection have collapsed look for her to be indicted at some point in the coming months over the clinton foundation and then for trump to magnanimously pardon her look for her to be indicted at some point in the coming months over the clinton foundation and then for trump to magnanimously pardon her after letting her twist in the wind for a very long time i hope i m kind of curious to see which way the investigation goes if trump gives hillary a blanket pardon that would take trolling levels up to 10 000 blanket pardons from either trump or obama mean there is no excuse for refusing to testify when congress investigates and congress needs to investigate not to punish individuals but to know what is necessary to reform laws and government agencies in order to prevent future abuses obama made us a banana republic now let the truth commissions commence i predict a shuttering of the clinton foundation because there is no more graft to peddle trump will disclose as much of the evidence against them as he can but spare us the congressional investigations there will be no pardons in order to maintain leverage over them the clinton family will self exile to paris i d expect trump to stay out of it completely that didn t take long the left is interested in limited government again unjustified extrapolation from one data point on a very improbable hypothesis libertarians should be girding themselves for four years of the federal government trampling their freedoms and what happens after 4 years the resurgent limited government republicans wrest control of the gop back from the free spending populist trumpalos or the democrats abandon the last hundred years or so of their platform face it we re all socialists now libertarian moment fuck yeah if hillary had won our freedoms would totally not have been trampled don t forget our freedoms were totally safe and protected the last eight years too you cannot trample what will no longer exist another bad thing about trump winning is that when hillary croaks they will try to deify her for losing to trump then again adlai stevenson george mcgovern and hubert humphrey are not exactly the most beloved in death that happened here in missouri our senator died so his widow ran and won then his crooked children ran they lost mostly but are still a nuisance i have a feeling i ll spend the whole day explaining how the electoral college works me no dumbass the cunt won jersey so my vote didn t effect jack shit when hillary croaks they will try to deify her but they were going to do that regardless of this election and the events throughout the rest of her life she has been entrenched as a progressive goddess when she dies she ll be part of the pantheon with fdr and company pretty pathetic seeing as she has achieved absolutely nothing other than riding the coattails of her sexual predator husband i ve already been attacked on facebook for voting libertarian and costing hillary the election as i told one of the neither i nor any libertarian owe the democrats a goddamn thing least of all allegiance they should be bitching about their party leadership running a shitbag candidate expect a lot more of this fun fact trump will likely finish with less votes than mitt romney in 2012 however obama 2012 65 million votes clinton 2016 58 59 million votes depending on ca votes yep the obama coalition never turned out for clinton 7 8 million of whoever voted for obama in 2012 stayed home some of them may have even defected to trump that was the cause of clinton s defeat she was bleeding badly oh and wi and lost even though trump barely matched romney s support there 4 years ago the race was close in a lot of states but most dems who supported johnson changed their minds in recent days unless exit numbers show otherwise johnson took more votes away from trump not clinton either way i don t see how libs can blame this one on gary and lp their own base betrayed clinton either way i don t see how libs can blame this one on gary and lp their own base betrayed clinton don t worry prog will find a way another dewey defeats truman moment is this evidence of the libertarian moment eh gillespie smug prick dr gillespie called the race hitlery by 7 30 pm oh and if hillary gets more popular votes she gets to join president gore so the pundits who knew what was going to happen were wrong and now they ve got ptsd and they re anally extracting reasons why everything went so horribly wrong and they re already digging at trump i ve already heard how all the minorities in the country are weeping and wailing because a racist is set to take over the country and women everywhere are running scared and another was predicted that all the racial healing that took place under obama would be undone the ptb have no clue what just happened if trump thought getting elected was dirty wait until he finds out what winning will be like another was predicted that all the racial healing that took place under obama would be undone lol i ve been watching msnbc and lapping up the tears it s pretty fantastic watching about twenty years ago i was talking to an older client her son had just been arrested for a string of bank robberies during the course of the conversation she kept bringing up her need to go to the grocery store only she wouldn t leave it at that each time the grocery store came up she had to recite her entire shopping list it was clearly a defense mechanism and also deeply disturbing to witness each time only added to the sense of the depth of her inner turmoil i was reminded of that episode while watching some airhead on nbc last night as she kept repeating all of trump s negatives in an attempt to deny the reality that he was winning i could not get myself away from the tv it was magical watching all the excuses and blame going around and the puppets could not help themselves but to denigrate every voter of trump each time they spoke for more progtard deliciousness http www dailymail co uk new sage field submitted for your approval it almost sounded like the onion wrote this they don t understand history they probably didn t finish high school ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahaha lolololololooolololollolz fuck you bitch and all your statist globalist race baiting friends that s like prog tears porn or a snuff reel oh and for social liberalism the second divorced president is once again a republican and he has been divorced twice libertarian moment yo winny your mom left the twenty on the night stand tell her thanks bro the president elect claimed to have a great economic plan though he offered no details i suppose that this is the kind of incoherent idiocy that we can expect for the next four years look qjkxbmwvz i m just as concerned about this non policy as you i just heard about it in the news same as everyone else and i m going to make sure that we get the best people we have together so we can all get some answers about this because that sort of thing is not what america s all about no five year plan how will we know what to do i think the best we can hope for is that trump does nothing whatsoever this it is usually best does nothing undoes plenty that would be better that s a pretty damn good fb post dude i may need to use a variation of that eliquence on my own feed i both welcome and relish the anti libertarian hate i m about to get because i ve got the power of consistent viewpoints to counter all vitriol gotta find the silver lining somewhere in life shitbag harry nuclear option reid sheds a tear while claiming amnesia i hope that at least his drool bib didn t fall off the republicans are idiots if they don t use the nuclear option themselves to ram scotus appointments through since the democrats were planning that exact thing so of course the republicans won t use it and will allow the democrats to fillibuster another couple of kennedy s onto the court goodbye hillary forever you fucking cunt i ve been waiting a long time to say that sorry but we will have to be shown her booking photo soon do they make orange mao suits whoever this cunt is why is he still here barry diller who just call up my get out of murika hotline barry diller the funds to get your arse out of here are waiting for you i ll drive you myself i wish for once these assholes who make these threats would actually fucking leave libertarians should be girding themselves for four years of the federal government trampling their freedoms but of course we ve come to expect that regardless i agree we should gird ourselves for what we ve long come to expect because that s part of what america is all about god the absolute freakout on my facebook is amazing to watch they are going full blown toddler over the election everything from blaming all the white men saying america hates women unfriend me is you support hate etc such tolerant lovely little lefties oh it s great a couple of my brain dead friends liked a page saying if you voted trump explain to your lgbt non white and female friends why they don t matter to you did reason publish a libertarian case for hillary trump johnson stein etc where have you been these have appeared almost daily i guess the next s c justice will be picked by trump and the climate change ex orders are history then there s the tax cuts could be an interesting 100 days and i assume our nato allies are not happy right now countries like germany and belgium might actually have to actually train their soldiers rather than treat their armies as a glorified free jobs program what a shock that will be they might have to spend more than 1 of their gdp on defense too the horror the horror germany training soldiers now that s always a good thing that might give russia second thoughts about the election and poland and france and the czech republic and belgium and appropriate actually i wouldn t be entirely shocked if the senate decides to push mr garland through before trump takes over so many tears i need a surfboard 4m votes for johnson he beat the spread in about nine states too bad it s not enough for the matching funds debate and not automatic ballot access everywhere you only get that in ny in gubernatorial elections but still pretty good and a hell of a lot better than cucks like siv were bleating about on msnbc that s where rachel maddow went immediately people voting for johnson cost clinton the election because every vote for johnson was really just a protest vote against trump by a republican in my immediate circle two women who are lifelong democrats flipped to johnson this time around clinton couldn t hold on to the vote of a female union member school teacher it turns out she was a worse candidate than the worst candidate ever yeah the fact that i voted for romney 4 years ago and johnson this time doesn t factor into those sore fucking losers everyone on facebook right now is a sore fucking loser lashing out at everyone else and completely aghast that their shitty crooked candidate lost honestly that doesn t make any sense if you want to blame nader for gwb then ok he probably drew some votes from the left wing of the democrats and plausibly cost the dems florida what on earth makes you think that people who think that statism is bad would be natural allies of war mongering neocon like hillary clinton the argument i got into this on twitter like a full grown adult would is that i know more democrats protesting than actual libertarians which i pointed out was a product of being a democrat with mostly democrat friends but people are not statisticians as a rule also people get dumb about elections especially it never occurs to such people that all their friends are democrats so obviously most of the ones they know doing anything are democrats i mentioned this a day or two ago on here but one of my aunts is a lifelong democrat anti gun pro abortion type she has been a trumpkin since clinton became the presumptive nominee she despises clinton it s visceral fuck johnson and fuck the l p too they don t deserve 5 or ballot access or matching funds for putting up that fucking schmoo he and weld did their best to help hillary and did nothing for libertarians from the moment johnson got the nomination he started alienating his own supposed party throwing petersen s gift gun in the trash then acting like a fucking retard in every interview this was a golden opportunity for libertarians and johnson just shit on it that kind of behavior should not be rewarded in any way kick johnson to the curb immediately then fire nicholas sarwark and give the chairman job to austin petersen throwing petersen s gift gun in the trash sir d that s not a gun this is a gun johnson weld was a profoundly wasted opportunity mega fail and yes heads should roll soooooo anything interesting happening around here lately i heard a rumor the cubs won the world series elections have consequences yeah it sounds different now doesn t it idiots the constitution anticipated this the founding fathers anticipated donald trump hillary clinton they feared tyrants they were overthrowing the rule of a king and they designed a separation of powers government in which all of the true powers belonged to congress those can then be reviewed by the courts and i m positive they would have said this if hillary won right right i wonder how long before the war protestors are marching again unleash the paper mache trump heads hey what can i say i kind of miss the giant heads elections have consequences and at the end of the day i won president obama to house republican whip eric cantor january 23 2009 it is almost magical how quickly people can change their entire world view nothing magical about it their world view is based not on principles or right and wrong but on people and might makes right i won and i will trump you on that as if obumbles can even play bridge then there are the media whose failures may be as large as anyone else s we propped up trump when it served our bottom line needs and failed to adequately understand his appeal by the time that news outlets began highlighting his lengthy history of lies and the worst elements of his campaign the public s trust in our reporting had been widely shattered many americans didn t particularly care to read or hear what we had to say huffpo analysis on trump s victory so the hillary taint lickers are shocked and upset that people don t trust them quel dommage i love how they assume it s the media s job to defeat the republican candidate and get the democrat elected i just can t understand why people don t trust them the public s trust in our reporting had been widely shattered many americans didn t particularly care to read or hear what we had to say wow i am truly impressed i never expected that much self awareness from huffpo i suspect for every article like that however there are six articles calling for white males to be put in boxcars especially if they voted for johnson it s going to be so awesome watching the tone and tenor in this place completely change 180 degrees from the bullshit we ve had around here the last eight years no more of the everything is awesome and this is our libertarian moment garbage instead it s going to be a whole lot of the dark night of fascism has officially arrived in america in other words this is just about the most shameless piece of the pot calling the kettle black projection i ve ever seen but i do expect to continue to read about the wholesomeness of carbon taxes so there s that look trump won by stirring up fear and anger and division with his shockingly inflammatory rhetoric if he expects to be a legitimate president for all of the people it s incumbent upon him to recognize and accept that half the people in this country preferred hillary s policies and adopt her platform that s just logic if he wants to call himself a republican he has to balance that concession by governing as a democrat that s how bipartisanship works this is what the left really believes naturally we re all just simple lemmings easily swayed by words on tv we should all thank allmighty science that people like jerryskids can send top men to save us the best part of a trump presidency for me will be the opportunity to listen to progressives wailing and whining about the election results then sarcastically reply to them with it s the will of the people just like they always do when anyone else complains about an election result that wasn t in line with progressive principles truth the democrats have already rediscovered and embraced the notion of adversarial and obstructionist legislative behavior fortunately for trump they have established the precedent that it s okay for the president to circumvent congress because they refuse to cooperate and are being obstructionist i feel like the whole country has turned into florida you can t make this shit up i m gonna grab a beer and some popcorn and just watch this should be really entertaining how are you gonna feel when trump turns you into glue so many salty salty tears today there aren t enough buckets to capture all of the goodness here you go gallery of salty tears photos http mashable com 2016 11 09 fweoogbsqa thank you lizard voice one must have a heart of stone to look at those photos without laughing prog freak out they re moving out of the usa that is why i held my nose and voted for trump the more progtards we can get to leave the better shows sir chips alot the door kicks him on the ass looks like hillary will win the popular vote which will be even more hilarious why are all these leftists suddenly so interested in the secession movement and federalism now the constitution anticipated this the founding fathers anticipated donald trump they feared tyrants they were overthrowing the rule of a king and they designed a separation of powers government in which all of the true powers belonged to congress those can then be reviewed by the courts whatever the duopoly keeps bouncing back and forth between statists on both sides shhh don t spoil the celebration the progressive left truly are despicable what pisses me off about o donnell and his ilk even after the american people have spoken he still belittles them with a lame use of the constitution people like him don t give a shit about the constitution they pick and choose the parts they like fuck off you mention the constitution i m sure the 4th amendment just rolled over in its grave last night what s left of it will be dragged into the bathtub and drowned by ag christie and fbi director giuliani but celebrate on please last night was a huge victory for liberty christie better use the william howard taft sized tub if he s drowning anything in it otherwise he might get stuck hey you re getting your tears all over your whine libertarians should be girding themselves for four years of the federal government trampling their freedoms relative to how much hillary would have trampled on them will our 2nd amendment freedoms be trampled on in the way hillary would have done i don t think so also trump has claimed he wants to roll back the federal regulatory state if he actually does that to any significant degree that would be an increase in freedom he has stated that he wants to get rid of the dodd frank legislation that was premised on the liberal democrat fairly tale that the financial crisis was caused by the private sector rather than government policy that would be another increase in freedom if he cuts taxes that s another increase in the freedom of people to keep more of their own money we will also not have a president hillary appointing liberal supreme court judges that could rubber stamp further expansions of state power over us all for decades to come we will have to see how the mix of bad and good stuff that trump has stated he wants to do actually gets enacted and plays out to see if on balance freedom is expanded or contracted i suspect plenty of libertarians will be pleasantly surprised i wouldn t be surprised if trump reverts to his take on narcotics policy up until this campaign and pain patients for instance find it easier to get their pills in states where the state policy isn t worse than federal cannabis reform accelerates and breaks thru to the federal level and clinical drug research becomes much easier if congress just cooperates the aca will soon be hx cute how excited you are i m sure legislative restraint will be high in the agenda once team red has full control of all three branches of the federal government i m sorry i can t hear you over that incessant whine why bother as obama has shown trump can have plenty of fun with executive orders libertarians should be girding themselves for four years of the federal government trampling their freedoms relative to how much hillary would have trampled on them will our 2nd amendment freedoms be trampled on in the way hillary would have done i don t think so also trump has claimed he wants to roll back the federal regulatory state if he actually does that to any significant degree that would be an increase in freedom he has stated that he wants to get rid of the dodd frank legislation that was premised on the liberal democrat fairly tale that the financial crisis was caused by the private sector rather than government policy that would be another increase in freedom if he cuts taxes that s another increase in the freedom of people to keep more of their own money we will also not have a president hillary appointing liberal supreme court judges that could rubber stamp further expansions of state power over us all for decades to come we will have to see how the mix of bad and good stuff that trump has stated he wants to do actually gets enacted and plays out to see if on balance freedom is expanded or contracted considering how the whole federal apparatus just keeps rolling along i don t expect much roll back of the federal regulatory state there might be some rollback of obamacare but knowing how hard is is to kill federal programs i don t expect it to completely go away dodd frank was such a massive piece of legislation that it probably can t just be scrapped it touches so many areas that piece by piece fixes are probably the best that can be hoped for conservative supreme court judges have been quite willing to expand state power for their own purposes so i don t expect much there trump relationship with the rest of his party seems on edge so i don t expect the congress to just fall in line behind what he wants to do damn squirrels cue the left rediscovering their approval of assange wikileaks them too just yesterday i was listening to a nationalsocialist spy who wanted julian dead last year suddenly eructing praise for the hacker does this mean he can go outside without getting busted is manning if still alive pardoned so all of you uh libertarians celebrating the election of a big government populist congratulations i guess you all sound very pleased recognizing that the alternative candidate would have been worse doesn t constitute celebrating oh you silly silly person how old are you get back to me if you come up with anything substantive to say ok you and the rest of your ilk posting here are shortsighted partisan hacks you are celebrating the election of a unified government trump was probably the furthest candidate from a libertarian in this election and he won he hasn t even the slightest concept of the difference between positive and negative rights he s going to rule based upon his gut feeling and rule he will with a cowed majority in congress and handpicked justices on the sc people like guiliani christie and other uber statists are going to run his apparatus and you re celebrating ffs at least go celebrate on breitbart or some other team red site none of that refutes my prior post pointing out that recognizing that the alternative candidate would have been worse does not constitute celebrating i did not vote for or support trump or clinton they are both terrible but she is more terrible than him but she is more terrible than him we shall see eric 11 9 16 9 21am we shall see gee eric did you promise to leave the country if trump won did you bet the house on that hag i m seeing a butt hurt hil bot here no fuckface america is gonna be great again so i m staying i m sure you would have been weeping in your pillow about scotus picks with hillary depends on the issue i m not at all impressed with the originalists take on the 4th over the past decade and not impressed with hillary s take on the 2nd amendment or the 1st gods above eric you really need to do something about that whine i bet it s coming from the corrosion your salty tears are causing because really no one can hear your sobbing and gnashing of teeth over that whine so all of you uh libertarians celebrating the election of a big government populist congratulations i guess you all sound very pleased i m pleased the hag lost wow we did every single thing perfectly but america is just more racist and sexist than we thought dem post game strategy talk probably how naive is this progtards are going to progtard of course it is all about limiting the power of the other side now the progtards lost control however the second they get control back it will be all about the progtarding how naive is this progtards are going to progtard of course it is all about limiting the power of the other side now the progtards lost control however the second they get control back it will be all about the progtarding good thing there are no libertarians at reason who cheered on extralegal activities like oh daca and the precedent they set yes this is a bad day because we have taken one more step towards being just another eurocratic socialist state that was guaranteed to happen regardless of the winner but we ve now lost the one conservative party as well that will pay foul dividends for years to come it s hard to believe beyonce madonna and lady gaga didn t sway the election don t forget jay z and the misogynists jay z and the misogynists great name for a musical act kind of like siouxsie and the banshees so the rethugs nominated a loser who couldn t possibly win and yet the dems nominated a miserable venal crooked hag who couldn t beat him well at least he probably won t put the wh silverware on ebay btw is there a line at the canuk border of all the lefty twits promising to leave if trump won attention lefty twits i left these states for canada after national socialist nixon was elected and had a really wonderful time canadians are cool sweet people the place is civilized and fun but cold when you arrive you ll find there is a libertarian party of canada up and running already and because there are no abortion laws most immigrants have been women these past few decades yes take what we can get then come back and ask for more actually reading murray rothbard as opposed to hearing others misquote him revealed that the guy was no more an anarchist than rand s circle was a collectivist collective but by smearing him as anarchist intellectuals of the looter persuasion put a damper on his efficacy and well if the lout really won you can see how dissing libertarians helped that outcome i have to say the tears here the whining here coming from members of the hampersandr commentariat is the sweetest of all random lefties are good sure but the tasty toasted faces of all those whose masks were ripped off is so much better today i don t mind the piping because your whining is drowning it out 11111 1 won won won i can only imagine the sheer orgasmic joy of people who actually supported trump i fear what a maniac like trump could do with unchecked power and i fear what a corrupt dishonest war mongering vindictive maniac like clinton could do with unchecked power even more so should you the markets are already back up by the way clinton showed the world why she lost when she did not show up to congratulate her supporters in the truest sense of the word she phoned it in this was not a presidential election it was a referendum on the clintons trump was brilliant enough to recognize it and use it alas de maistre here we will get the government we deserve hahaha why are there libertarians butt hurt clinton lost we all realize trump is a wild card we will hold his feet to the fire when he does anything anti liberty re hit run blog trump gives victory speech liberals rediscover appeal of limited government has there ever been a more powerful case for limited government 1 trump the grump won yay i sure am glad i invested in brown shirts and jackboots 2 the last time liberals discovered limited government was when andrew jackson was president i voted for johnson just to get that out of the way should nevertrump and others hold trump accountable and fight for limited government principle says yes however i think a strong case could be made for trump to make the progressives take a strong dose of their own medicine i really don t think a constrained trump smaller executive for warren 2020 i think this is progressives playing possum until they get back in office now what could really really make them take a serious thought about presidential power it being deployed against them in a painful way want the irs depoliticized sick it on the dems now if i were in charge which i am not i d specifically have time limits for example i would refuse to grant any dem foia release for as long as irs didn t release emails i d allow irs to run wild on soros and whoever for the same length of time obama did it i d be very specific about that same with senate fillibuster i d remove it just as long as reid removed it because tit for tat is a proven game theory tactic to produce cooperation just a thought it will never happen the way i want it and probably would become permanent trump s election has sent shockwaves the markets are in free fall democratic voters are petrified and the media has no idea what just happened i ll say it now buy buy buy until i looked at the paycheck saying
