apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic yokohama japan ap about 500 passengers left the cruise ship diamond princess on wednesday at the end of a much criticized two week quarantine aboard the vessel docked in japan that failed to stop the spread of the new virus among passengers and crew the quarantine s flop was underlined as authorities announced 79 more cases bringing the total on the ship to 621 results were still pending for some other passengers and crew among the original 3 711 people on board japan s government has been questioned over its decision to keep people on the ship which some experts have called a perfect virus incubator the diamond princess is the site of the most infections outside of china where the illness named covid 19 emerged late last year top stories

christian expositor of the 21st century many foreign governments say they won t let passengers from the ship return unless they go through another quarantine period so it was striking to see

held a cane some passengers got on buses to be transported to train stations some people still in their cabins waved farewell from their balconies to those who had already been processed i m a bit

said wednesday he said the plan was approved by experts at the national institute of infectious diseases passengers are only asked to watch their health carefully for a few days and notify local health authorities if they have any symptoms or worries he said some passengers said on twitter they received health forms earlier in the morning asking if they had symptoms such as a headache fever or coughing passengers who tested negative and had no symptoms still had to get their body temperature checked before leaving passengers were provided with a certificate stating their negative test results and completion of the quarantine about 500 passengers who planned to leave on wednesday had all left the ship by evening and japanese officials are to spend the next three days conducting the disembarkation of about 2 000 others the diamond princess was quarantined in yokohama near tokyo after one passenger who left the ship earlier in hong kong was found to have the virus even though japanese officials insist the number of infected patients is leveling off cases on the ship continue to mount daily on tuesday 88 people tested positive a day after 99 others were found to be infected crew members who couldn t be confined to their rooms because they were working are expected to stay on the ship the national institute of infectious diseases said a report released wednesday that the crew had not been fully isolated during the quarantine period it said the quarantine was effective in reducing transmission among passengers and that the increase in cases toward the end was mostly among crew or passengers in shared cabins it should be noted that due to the nature of the ship individual isolation of all those aboard was not possible it said chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said a more controlled health watch for the crew members is starting now because they can be spread out and kept in isolation by using vacated passenger rooms the ship s operator princess cruises said in a statement tuesday that people who tested positive recently were still on the ship as they waited for transportation to hospitals the safety and transport logistics for moving hundreds of people

the ship he said the u s government said americans who remained on board instead of returning on chartered flights cannot return home for at least two weeks after they come ashore other governments picking up passengers have similar policies u s officials cited the passengers possible exposure to the virus while on board the diamond princess japanese health officials say the 14 day quarantine on the ship was adequate noting that all but one of more than 500 japanese who earlier were flown back from the center of the virus in china and initially tested negative were virus free at the end of
