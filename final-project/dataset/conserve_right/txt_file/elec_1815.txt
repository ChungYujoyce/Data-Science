jonathan kott kayleigh mcenany and beverly hallberg weigh in bernie sandersis on a roll after a strong showing in iowa and new hampshire and berning throughnevada the socialist senator from vermont is without a doubt the democrat front runner odds makers are giving bernie a 55 percent chance of becoming the democrat nominee which raises a legitimate question do democratsactuallywantto win the white house in november paul batura ronald reagan warned us about bernie sanders over 40 years ago i ask because it is generally agreed that ousting president trump will require winning back those blue collar workers in swing states who crossed party lines to vote republican in 2016 sanders is most definitely not the most likely candidate to do that there s a reason that left wing commentator chris mathews compared sanders win in nevada to france falling to the nazis in 1940 for democrats it s almost that dire but really bernie is not alone no candidate seems to be tailoring his or her message to thosetraditionaldemocratswho rejected hillary clinton remember them folks this is simple there are a great many longtime democrats living in toss up states who didn t like the direction that president obama took the country those voters many of them union members decided to take a flyer on neophyte candidate donald trump why because he talked about things that mattered to them like jobs and manufacturing and trade deals he also appealed to their patriotism and common sense like putting america first in the end better job opportunities and higher wages were more important to themthan climate change or gender neutrality or a whole bunch of politically correct drivel that democrats want to ram down the country s throat these are people who love their country and don t buy bernie sanders and joe biden s claim that it is essentially racist these are people who go to church and abhor the democrats enthusiasm for legalizing full term abortion these are people who work hard pay their taxes and believe others should do the same these are not nutty people they are the backbone of our country and right now they are looking at sanders and the other candidates who want to represent the democratic party the party of their parents and grandparents and saying these folks do not care about me they would be right from the outset of the campaign sanders and elizabeth warren jumped on medicare for all dragging others along with them convinced that health care was the issue that would topple republicans ironically they might have been right the gop has made a total hash of overhaulingobamacareand proposing a better alternative in part thanks to the late sen john mccain who single handedly undermined the party s health care initiative sanders hasled amarvelously fact free campaign when asked how he will fund his programs he dismisses the question and actsas though trillion dollar pricetags areinsignificantdetails but the approach taken by bernie and other progressives was so extreme demanding the end of private insurance that rather than galvanizing support for democrats it fractured the party astonishingly the candidates who jumped aboard single payer health care never stopped to think about how their plan would impact union workers who would be the group most opposed to ending private insurance for decades organized labor fought for the best insurance programs money could buy and they got them companies preferred giving out lavishhealth careand pension benefits to increasing wages which would have a more immediate impact on their bottom line these days the costs of those health care plans are enormous and the coverage is excellent far better than would be available under bernie s nationwide government run system union workers are not stupid they know this would be a loss for them and they will resist it remember that obamacare was to be paid for in part by a 40 percent tax on so called cadillac plans the high end plans that unions enjoy that tax was delayed twice by congress and finally repealed so intense was the opposition from big labor that resistance hasn t changed sanders found that out when the culinary workers in nevada failed to endorse him even as he was the obvious front runner in their state it isn t just on health care that democrats have gone off the reservation consider the candidates bernie among them vowing to banfracking andpromising the end of fossil fuels are they not aware that in critical swing states like pennsylvania and ohio thousands of workers are making lots of money working in the oilfields
