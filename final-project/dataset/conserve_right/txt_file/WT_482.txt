the failed impeachment process on friday proposed the establishment of a bipartisan commission also with subpoena power to investigate the trump administration s response to the coronavirus pandemic mr schiff another california democrat wants to set up a 9 11 style commission of 10 lawmakers to review the administration s actions and probe the government s preparedness in advance of the covid 19 pandemic after pearl harbor september 11 and many momentous events in american history independent bipartisan commissions have been established to provide a complete accounting of what happened what we did right and wrong and what we can do to better protect the country in the future mr schiff said in a statement friday though we are still in the early days of the coronavirus crisis there is no doubt that such a comprehensive and authoritative review will be required imagine that imagine lawmakers calling federal health officials off the front lines and into the house chambers to answer a bunch of biased questions including what did trump know and when did he know it to democrats everything is a potential watergate mr trump blasted the new call for another endless probe as he sought to calm americans fears during a white house briefing on the virus last week we have seen americans unite with incredible selflessness and compassion he said i want to remind everyone here in our nation s capital especially in congress that this is not the time for politics endless partisan investigations here we go again they ve already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years it s witch hunt after witch hunt after witch hunt mr trump continued and in the end it s people doing the witch hunt who are losing and they ve been losing by a lot and it s not any time for witch hunts speaking of the virus mr trump said it s time to get this enemy defeated conducting these partisan investigations during a pandemic is a really big waste of vital resources time attention and we want to fight for american lives not waste time and build up my poll numbers because that s all they re doing because everyone knows it s ridiculous the president noted that as the virus was sweeping the world democrats in congress were fixated on impeaching him and ousting him from office if you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere except increasing my poll numbers and instead focused on helping the people of new york then new york would not have been so completely unprepared for the invisible enemy mr trump wrote on twitter for the record while democrats focused on impeachment mr trump was busy on jan 30 the world health organization declared a global health emergency of international concern the same day the u s centers for disease control and prevention for the first time confirmed person to person spread of the wuhan virus and applauded who s decision that same day mr trump created the white house coronavirus task force to coordinate u s efforts regarding the new disease the next day on jan 31 the president declared coronavirus a u s public health emergency and issued a travel ban between the united states and china campaigning in iowa that day joe biden criticized mr trump s china travel ban saying this is no time for donald trump s record of hysteria and xenophobia and on feb 24 mrs pelosi encouraged people to visit san francisco s chinatown for the lunar new year celebration claiming it was perfectly safe to be there mr schiff was also blithely unaware his twitter feed did not mention the virus at all until feb 24 and his house office press releases didn t mention it until march 15 still mrs pelosi blames mr trump for the virus as the president fiddles people are dying she said but if federal lawmakers want to find someone to blame they should look closer to home when the trump administration held a briefing on jan 24 to inform senators about the coronavirus it was sparsely attended politico reported because it was held on the same day as a deadline for senators to submit their impeachment questions joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade
