numbers and shift the start dates but no amount of fiddling will change this the nation is angry and divided and our people are pessimistic president obama has depressed our nation in part because we had hope we hoped that an inexperienced young african american man could heal the country and bring us together he promised to do so and we believed him even many of us who hadn t voted for him honestly what were we thinking we were thinking that this is the greatest nation on earth and our problems are solvable we were thinking that barack obama was the man to solve them he would partner with republicans as had his predecessor bill clinton and together our political leaders would leap into action that s what we expected because that is what he promised we did not take into consideration that this president had no real life experience of the sort that might matter no management background no business expertise really these things are important when you are expected to lead a country though a financial crisis today there are innumerable signs of the country s disappointment for instance we are having fewer babies surely one of the most personal votes for the future our birthrate is estimated to hit a 25 year low this year as the economic slide engendered the most profound kind of pessimism how about the mood among small business owners which after rallying in the early years of mr obama s presidency has been sliding for months and is well below the historical average according to the national federation of independent businesses during the economic recovery now three years old the index has averaged 90 making this the worst recovery period from a recession in the nfib survey history which began in 1973 that can t be good we are also less confident in our institutions even those that have nothing to do with the economy confidence in religion for instance is at an all time low only 44 of americans believe in the church or organized religion according to gallup down from 52 in 2009 confidence in our public schools also hit a new record low this year only 29 of americans are positive about our schools compared to 33 four years ago in fact we as a nation are pretty down on our police big business organized labor newspapers the supreme court congress and banks confidence in each is way below historical averages how about this one only 37 of americans express confidence in the presidency as an institution compared with 45 in the past faith in big government at 30 a new low and down from 41 in 2008 these are terrible signs a country that has little faith in its governing institutions will not rally behind those institutions such lack of confidence saps our willingness to abide by our laws and could eventually lead to increased corruption is president obama to blame for this slide no but he surely hasn t done anything to reverse it the tales of monies being funneled to obama donors in the green energy space the bankruptcy of solyndra the nonsensical hand outs discovered in the stimulus the explosion in food stamp spending the willingness of the president to circumvent the law through executive orders the questionable use of drones to kill persons unknown the political cowardice that has blocked the senate from enacting a budget the list goes on and on principally however the nation is discouraged by our inability to get back on track we are not creating jobs sufficient to put our people back to work our president has not made that his top priority instead he chased after a legacy universal health care over that picked over carcass of rotten ideas swirled the vultures of division the dishonest presentation of the bill the cheating on the numbers the bribes paid for votes nothing could have more quickly soured the nation s enthusiasm for this president it roiled the country when we should have been joining forces to move forward to invest and spend instead the nation hunkered down fearful of a future clouded by trillion dollar deficits this is president obama s legacy many lament the chasm that has widened between democrats and republicans but few have blamed president obama and yet it was the health care battle that galvanized the nascent tea party and pushed republicans further to the right it was obama s push to widen the burgeoning safety net that alarmed the public and dropped budget discussions into the middle of our political discourse it was his disparagement of the business community that created more factions it was his continued suggestion that the rich are not paying their fair share that bred envy in the land are we worse off yes we are a discouraged nation some 63 of the country thinks we are on the wrong track who can blame them get the recap of top opinion
