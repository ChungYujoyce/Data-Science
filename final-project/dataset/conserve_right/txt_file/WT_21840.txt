the criticism by labeling a leading black congressman as himself racist in the latest rhetorical shot at lawmakers of color trump said his weekend comments referring to rep elijah cummings majority black baltimore district as a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live were not racist instead trump argued if racist elijah cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess his radical oversight is a joke trump tweeted sunday top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus

rights leader martin luther king jr and a longtime trump supporter also noted trump s longtime relationships with sharpton and civil rights activist jesse jackson these are his brothers king said trump appeared to dig a deeper hole even as a top white house aide sought to dismiss the controversy by describing trump s comments as hyperbole two weeks ago trump caused a nationwide uproar with racist tweets directed at four democratic congresswomen of color as he looked to stoke racial divisions for political gain heading into the 2020 election trump noted that democratic presidential contender and vermont sen bernie sanders had recently equated parts of baltimore to a third world country in 2015 comments i assume that bernie must now be labeled a racist just as a republican would if he used that term and standard trump tweeted monday sanders tweeted back that trump s lies and racism never end while i have been fighting to lift the people of baltimore and elsewhere out of poverty with good paying jobs housing and health care he has been attacking workers and the poor maryland gov larry hogan a republican on monday called the president s comments just outrageous and inappropriate hogan the new chairman of the national governors association said he recently gave an address at the nga about the angry and divisive politics that are literally tearing america apart i think enough is enough hogan said on the c4 radio show in baltimore i mean people are just completely fed up with this kind of nonsense and why are we not focused on solving the problems and getting to work instead of who s tweeting what and who s calling who what kind of names i mean it s just absurd michael steele the state s former lieutenant governor who went on to serve as the national chairman of the republican national committee said it was reprehensible to talk about the city the way trump did but he hoped the attention would elevate the conversation about how to help urban areas and he invited the president to be a part of the conversation put down the cellphone and the tweeting and come walk the streets in this community so that you can see firsthand the good and the difficult that needs to be addressed and let s do it together steele told the radio show speaking in television interviews on sunday acting chief of staff mick mulvaney said trump was reacting in frustration to the democrats unrelenting investigations and talk of impeachment he said trump swung hard at cummings and his baltimore district because he believes such capitol hill critics are neglecting serious problems back home in their zeal to unfairly undermine his presidency i understand that everything that donald trump says is offensive to some people mulvaney said but he added the president is pushing back against what he sees as wrong it s how he s done it in the past and he ll continue to do it in the future the president has tried to put racial polarization at the center of his appeal to his base of voters tapping into anxieties about demographic and cultural changes cummings is leading multiple investigations of the president s governmental dealings in his direct response to trump on twitter cummings said mr president i go home to my district daily each morning i wake up and i go and fight for my neighbors it is my constitutional duty to conduct oversight of the executive branch but it is my moral duty to fight for my constituents cummings has also drawn the president s ire for investigations touching on his family members serving in the white house his committee voted along party lines thursday to authorize subpoenas for personal emails and texts used for official business by top white house aides including ivanka trump and her husband jared kushner
