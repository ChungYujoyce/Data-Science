ion should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion what tack will president donald trump have to take to ensure that he does not have to employ moving vans after election day this autumn he has to win a majority among the republicans a majority among the independents and it would be nice if he picked up a few democratic voters you know democrats who luxuriated in the trump economy until march 13 when the thunderbolt hit how can he do it my suggestion is that he in his own inimitable style will have to maul the chinese maul the democrats and if joe will come out of his basement maul joe biden china is the origin of the wuhan virus oh i am sorry make that china is the origin of the coronavirus which is not to be confused with a mexican beer similarly named as we understand the virus origins now it was first spotted in the chinese city of wuhan most probably in a chinese military laboratory that is located very near an exotic foods market it goes without saying the zoning regulations in china are pretty lax top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots when the chinese authorities smartened up they curtailed all flights from wuhan to other parts of china but not flights from wuhan to other parts of the world for instance to europe and to america by the time the rest of the world had caught on that something was amiss in wuhan as many as one and a half million passengers had left wuhan for the outside world some infected some not donald trump had the good sense to shut down air travel from china to america on jan 31 the rest of the world was more dilatory as a result of the president s alertness a hostile press and his democratic opponents called him a racist a xenophobe and other unpleasant things he was not called an opponent of air travel but i bet the thought occurred to a few of his critics the president might take note that the charges of xenophobia and racism did not go over very well with the american people frankly i believe that the american people do not have a very high opinion of the chinese government and it is not because of the government s race or the fact that it is a long way away from our shores it is because china s business practices are not on the up and up moreover the chinese government is communist china s government has no conception of the bill of rights back in 2019 57 percent of the american people polled thought the chinese were up to no good more recently according to a gallup poll taken in february that figure was up to 67 percent that was before the american people discovered that china has been exporting the wuhan virus or the coronavirus or whatever we can call it my guess is that a country that engages in patent infringements dumping products and stealing intellectual property along with allowing pandemics to be shipped around the world is going to be increasingly unpopular anyone who has a good word for the country that allowed a virus to infect over 180 countries will be in a minority so mr president come the autumn election you would be wise to let the chinese government have it moreover i think it would be wise of you to remind the american people of your early acts during the pandemic the democrats attacked you as a racist and a xenophobe remind the electorate of that the democrats attacked you for shutting down air travel from china remind the electorate once again of that what is more you might call joe biden sleepy joe but no one was quicker to attack you for shutting down air travel than sleepy joe his policies have been open borders and open skies remind the world of joe s generosity during a time of national crisis one other thing the democrats told us during the obama years that a growth rate of barely 2 percent was the new normal for our economy you proved them wrong giving us a growth rate in the neighborhood of 2 5 percent if we want to get out of this recession we will need to return to the growth rates you gave us so let us get on with the election if president trump merely reports to the american people what he has done in recent weeks and reports honestly what the democrats have done he will have no need of moving vans for another four years r emmett tyrrell jr is founder and editor in chief of the american spectator he is the author most recently of the death of liberalism published by thomas n
