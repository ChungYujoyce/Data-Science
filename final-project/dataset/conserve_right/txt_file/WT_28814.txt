reporters thursday whether he thinks mr trump is a white supremacist and said it may be worse than that i believe everything the president says and has done encourages white supremacists and i m not sure there s much of a distinction as a matter of fact it may be even worse he said the definition of white supremacist is a person who believes the white race is inherently superior to other races and that white people should have control over people of other races according to merriam webster republican strategist john feehery said democrats look desperate by leveling the accusation against mr trump they are making these accusations because they make their base happy and because they believe that short of impeachment the only way they beat trump is making him so toxic that suburban voters won t vote for him mr feehery said i think they have gone way overboard because they aren t just attacking trump they are attacking everybody who voted for him mr o rourke who is polling around 2 in the democratic presidential primary has been one of the most vocal in labeling the president a white supremacist he is he has made that very clear mr o rourke said wednesday on msnbc he dehumanized those who do not look and pray like the majority of people here he said i wish we had more immigrants from nordic countries because those from haiti bring aids those from africa are s hole nations

intolerance cannot claim the moral high ground everyone who s calling president trump a racist and white supremacist most of them support killing in a very brutal way called abortion she said they re using that word moral but they re doing some of the most immoral deeds that america and humankind can ever see so i really just don t buy into this racist banter and this race baiting the president told reporters wednesday that he is concerned about the rise of any group of hate whether it s white supremacy whether it s any other kind of supremacy whether it s antifa he said referring to the far left anti fascist movement whether it s any group of hate i am very concerned about it and i ll do something about it the president tweeted later in the day the dems new weapon is actually their old

violence proactively while recognizing and protecting first amendment rights critics point to mr trump s comment after the deadly 2017 neo nazi rally in charlottesville virginia that there were very fine people on both sides of the demonstrations and his use of the term invasion to describe illegal immigration across the mexican border as incitement to white supremacists mr trump also said after the charlottesville incident racism is evil and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs on monday he said in response to the mass shootings in texas and ohio in one voice our nation must condemn racism bigotry and white supremacy the trump campaign this week highlighted 14 examples of his denouncements of racism hate crimes and other bigotry since taking office and seven interviews on tv in which he condemned the kkk david duke white supremacists and neo nazis dating to february 2000 trump campaign communications director tim murtaugh said in a post on twitter that democrats and media spent two years falsely calling mr trump a russian agent and then spent last 5 days recklessly calling him a mass murderer white supremacist same goes for all his supporters according to them he tweeted adding that when mr trump responds to the endless onslaught media dems freak out indeed liberals have been increasingly applying the white supremacist label and similar racism criticisms to all trump backers based merely on that support miami dolphins owner stephen ross is coming under fire from one of his players and other liberals for his plans to host a fundraiser for mr trump on friday at his home on long island new york the president is expected to attend the big ticket event in which the price for a private roundtable discussion with mr trump is 250 000 dolphins receiver kenny stills said mr ross support of the president conflicts with the mission of his ross initiative in sports for equality which aims to combat racial discrimination through sports

online ads warning of a hispanic invasion just like the el paso shooter mr ross defended his support of the president in a statement saying i have always been an active participant in the democratic process i have known donald trump for 40 years and while we agree on some issues we strongly disagree on many others and i have never been bashful about expressing my opinions white house senior counselor kellyanne conway defended tucker carlson on thursday for calling white supremacy a hoax the fox news channel host said the form of racial hatred exists but gets too much attention compared with all forms of hate mrs conway said she thinks white supremacy is real but she added that mr carlson likely meant that it receives outsized coverage versus other forms of hate such as anti semitism all forms of hate have to really they have to be reined in we have to look at the motivations we have to try to keep firearms out of the hands of those who are capable of doing such evil she told sinclair mr carlson received backlash after he brushed off concerns of white supremacy in the aftermath of the mass shooting in el paso which is suspected to have been fueled by anti immigrant rhetoric if you were to assemble a list a hierarchy of concerns of problems this country faces where would white supremacy be on the list right up there with russia probably mr carlson said this is a hoax just like the russia hoax it s a conspiracy theory used to divide the country and keep a hold on power that s exactly what s going on salem media radio host kevin mccullough said he absolutely believes the race based allegations against mr trump from democrats will get worse as the 2020 campaign progresses every one of those candidates has something to gain by fanning this discussion of trump and supposed white supremacy but it s not good for the country he said on fox former deputy attorney general rod rosenstein whose oversight of special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation often put him in conflict with the president said thursday that mr trump can seize the moment to bring the nation together thoughtful political rhetoric can be part of the solution as president trump implicitly recognized by urging americans to condemn racism bigotry and white supremacy mr rosenstein wrote in time magazine if a president s words matter and donald trump clearly believes they do then vociferous advocacy for tolerance might deter some people from adopting pernicious ideologies he concluded many presidents have used their bully pulpit to inculcate moral virtues president trump pledged in his inaugural address to lift our sights and heal our divisions this fraught political moment might inspire him to emphasize that laudable goal in future speeches just as sept 11 set a new course for president george w bush bailey vog
