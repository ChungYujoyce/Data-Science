l flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic if you believe united states presidential wars with russia and china not declared by congress are necessary to fulfill a divine mission to bring freedom justice dignity and civilization to the russian and chinese peoples then you should vote for democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton if you believe like former democratic secretary of state dean acheson that i n the final analysis the united states is the locomotive of mankind and the rest of the world the caboose an arrogance that begot the gruesome vietnam war then you should vote for hillary clinton her bellicose jingoistic foreign policy views bugled in a speech before the american legion on august 31 2016 confirms that her presidency would bow to mars the god of war not to minerva the goddess of wisdom top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed mrs clinton sermonized that america is an exceptional and indispensable nation that p eople all over the world look to us and follow our lead and that when we fail in our providential role to lead we leave a vacuum that either causes chaos or other countries or networks rush in to fill the void in other words the united states must conquer the world to avoid chaos wherever we are not or even worse the exercise of power outside our control mrs clinton must be incredulous that the world survived for thousands of years without falling into chaos before the birth of the united states in 1776 and produced giants like socrates aristotle and plato and marvels like the parthenon the hanging gardens of babylon and the great wall of china without united states assistance and does she really want other countries to follow our lead in endowing the executive with limitless power to go to war and to play prosecutor judge jury and executioner to kill any person suspected of threatening national security based on secret evidence according to mrs clinton the united states cannot sit idly by if the world balks at accommodating our interests while the interests of all nations are equal mrs clinton clucks our interests are more equal than all the others we thus have a responsibility to employ our unique and unparalleled ability to be a force for peace and progress a champion for freedom and opportunity to make all nations subservient to us we can deduce mrs clinton s conception of peace progress and freedom by examining her actions and advocacy as a united states senator secretary of state and presidential candidate she supported and continues to support united states wars i e the wholesale legalizations of first degree murder in afghanistan iraq yemen somalia libya and against isil and al qaeda everywhere on the planet if she had her way we would also be at war with syria in all of these conflicts however the promotion of freedom is a pretext for global dominance as it was in the vietnam war none of these countries or rebels we support respects the trappings of democracy or the rule of law further our military presence in these nations has aggravated rather than diminished chaos post gaddafi libya for instance is convulsed by scores of tribal sectaria or ethnic militias and competing governments and yemen is the very definition of hell as secretary of state mrs clinton assisted in orchestrating regime change in the ukraine and then championed the provision of military aid to the new government we created to fight russia in its historical sphere of influence she supports our expanded military presence in the baltic states and poland which similarly lie within that sphere mrs clinton s pivot to asia challenges china over its historical spheres of influence in the south china and east china seas and korea following the pivot we established a marine training base in darwin australia we are building a thadd u s missile system in south korea we established five military training bases in the philippines near the contested south china sea we committed to defending japan s claim to the senkaku islands against chinese attack we continued to maintain 50 000 troops in japan and 30 000 more in south korea we forged closer collaboration with the republic of singapore navy we escalated tensions with china in the air and on the sea including military patrols and exercises in the south china sea china understandably considers these acts aggressive and targeted at its sovereignty and security interests mrs clinton strongly urged president obama to dispatch an aircraft carrier to the yellow sea in response to a north korean provocation against south korea by triumphantly exclaiming we ve got to run it up the gut history speaks volumes about what is likely to happen when we challenge russia or china within their traditional spheres of influence while fiercely protecting our own we threatened china with armed forces and bombing along the yalu river during the korean war china responded by dispatching 3 million military and civilian personnel to korea and forcing gen douglas macarthur s troops back to the 38th parallel we threated russia s traditional sphere of influence with nuclear tipped jupiter ballistic missiles on its border with turkey and in italy in 1962 russia then the ussr responded by deploying missiles in cuba that engendered the cuban missile crisis which brought the world to the brink of destruction the 1964 presidential election is also instructive democratic presidential candidate lyndon b johnson held the same tribal simplistic good guys vs bad guys view of foreign policy as does hillary clinton his national security adviser mcgeorge bundy was a dean acheson disciple lbj was viewed as the peace candidate regarding vietnam as opposed to his rival republican sen barry goldwater lbj prevailed in a landslide but before he left office 569 000 american soldiers were fighting a futile war in the jungles of vietnam be forewarned hillary clinton is the 2016 war candidate who will fight wars with russia china and anyone else who refuses to pl
