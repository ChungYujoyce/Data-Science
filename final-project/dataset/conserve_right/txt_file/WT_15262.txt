police and the courts in the future i will report on another two current sitting members of the politburo standing committee as well as two previous members of the standing committee he said mr guo denied a report in the journal foreign affairs that he represents a leadership faction in beijing the businessman said he began speaking out as part of a long planned effort to bring democratic reform to china what i want to do is change the whole system that s what i want he said mr guo said chinese police killed his brother and in 1989 when china called out troops to put down unarmed pro democracy protesters in beijing s tiananmen square he was jailed for 22 months i ve prepared all that time until now he said i want to change the chinese government absolutely the chinese government is the mafia stepped up intelligence mr guo said chinese intelligence operations in the united states sharply increased after the 2012 communist party congress that brought president xi jinping to power before 2012 cumulatively china had around 10 000 to 20 000 agents working in the united states he said these agents had been sent to work in the united states over a 50 year period of time and they were working in a defensive mode according to the businessman defensive intelligence was mainly focused on learning about the united states the operations then shifted in 2012 to offensive spying he said by offensive operations i mean to be ready to destroy the u s in ways they can mr guo said china s annual budget for intelligence gathering before 2012 was around 600 million around 2012 a decision was made by chinese leaders to dispatch another 5 000 spies to the united states some of them were sent as students some as businessmen and some as immigrants but all together 5 000 mr guo said in addition to that they developed between 15 000 and 18 000 other spies and these are not directly sent but these are developed within the united states the recruited agents are not limited to asians and chinese americans but include all ethnic groups including hispanics blacks and caucasians and now the budget is between 3 billion and 4 billion annually and this is information up to one month ago he said mr guo said american counterintelligence agencies face several problems mainly a lack of knowledge about chinese intelligence agencies you don t know which organizations in china are responsible for sending these spies how they are managed and to what purpose he said and the u s adopts a very legalistic perspective to look at the question of spying yet for china their methods are not what the united states understands these spies when they come to the united states they could sleep around they could put poison in your glass of wine to kill you completely unscrupulous he said fbi spokesman matthew bertron declined to comment a chinese embassy spokesman did not respond to emails seeking comment intelligence targets china s intelligence targets included several strategic areas of the united states the first is to obtain military weapons related technology this is priority no 1 mr guo said second chinese intelligence agents are engaged in buying senior u s officials personally and a third objective is buying family members of american political or business elites with a view to getting intelligence and to make big business deals in china s favor he said a fourth priority is penetrating the american internet system and critical infrastructure by implanting malicious software and they have successfully penetrated all the major defense weapons suppliers of the u s government mr guo said adding that the scale of their operations is mind boggling mr guo said mr ma the mss vice minister told him that a major shift by the chinese was expanding the scope of agent recruitment from asians to other ethnic groups this is where the biggest danger lies he said it s clear the situation is getting more and more dangerous now the united states has the best weapons in its arsenal such as laser weapons etc yet the chinese spy system has penetrated into the bloodstream of american defense establishment with their viruses and everything else the united states is bleeding and is unaware that sooner or later the united states will run out of blood mr guo said asymmetrical advantage also the united states is overly reliant on technical spying while china has an asymmetrical advantage in using its tens of thousands of human spies china also is working to subvert the united states by working together with regimes such as north korea and iran so in a fight between rogues and a gentleman the rogues will always win he said because the gentlemen fight a civilized war the rogues do not fight a civilized war mr guo said he first visited the united states in 1983 when he was 13 and made numerous visits since then i love my nation i love my country but i hate the communist party he said mr guo has not defected to the united states and holds several foreign passports his information could provide a windfall of data for the u s government policymakers and intelligence analysts for example mr guo said he has frequently visited north korea and has known every member of the ruling kim jong un family all the trade conducted between north korea and china has been conducted by the relatives of the ruling families he said claiming that the u s insistence of relying on beijing to deal with north korea s nuclear and missile programs is madness in hong kong the mss dispatched an additional 3 000 intelligence officers to the former british colony after the may 2013 incident involving former national security agency contractor edward snowden who fled to hong kong after stealing some 1 7 million secret agency documents the mss agents were dispatched by ma jian after the spy service learned that the u s consulate in hong kong was hosting some 2 600 american agents the office they work for is the hong kong security department mr guo said noting that before that time it was a more hit and miss approach to spying they upped that until now they have 10 000 agents operating in hong kong alone mafia government mr guo said americans need to understand that china is not ruled by a normal government you should look at it as a mafialike organization he said americans also much study the relatives of the ruling elite in china he added once you get to know the interests of these powerful individuals and also the family members then you get to understand how the regime operates he said michelle van cleave former national counterintelligence executive during the george w bush administration said china has been preparing for a major escalation of espionage and influence operations against the u s remember their cybertheft of some 22 million personnel files from the office of personnel management she said the chinese now have a detailed roster of most if not all american contractors and government employees who have access to classified information plus a roster of their friends colleagues or co workers who may be useful conduits or potential assets in their own right ms van cleave said the opm data likely will be used by chinese intelligence to coerce blackmail or recruit new sources for an already extensive espionage infrastructure cyber and human espionage go hand in hand and the chinese excel at both she said we urgently need a better understanding of what they are doing and how they are doing it and a strategy to stop them because china s intelligence operations in the u s are poised to get much worse former fbi counterspy i c smith said the large number of mss officers could be a reasonable estimate if the figure includes chinese who work informally for the service such as students permanent resident aliens and visitors china is no friend of ours and is never going to be a responsible member of the world community as long as the chinese communist par
