 of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president obama issued a waiver loosening tiananmen arms sanctions for c 130 military transports for china a day after the nobel peace prize was awarded to an imprisoned chinese dissident who dedicated the prize this past weekend to the victims of the 1989 crackdown chinese state run news media on monday hailed the white house waiver announcement as a sign washington is moving to lift the 11 year old arms embargo however white house national security council spokesman michael hammer said the waiver issued on saturday will not allow c 130s sales under this announcement we are not selling any aircraft to anyone he stated in an e mail top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender mr obama s letter to house speaker nancy pelosi announcing the waiver states that it is lifting a ban on temporary munitions export licenses for c 130s that currently is banned by the fiscal 1990 foreign relations act the law bars sales to china of any defense item on the u s munitions control list unless the president makes a report waiving the restriction mr hammer said the waiver is intended to assist companies in southeast asia that use c 130s for cleaning up oil spills the waiver will permit c 130s to land in china to refuel or take on chemicals used in dispersing oil spills after first obtaining a u s export license he said sharon hom executive director of human rights in china said the lack of any urgent oil spill emergency and the timing of the waiver so close to the nobel award sends a mixed signal to the chinese leadership and undercuts president obama s call for liu xiaobo s release especially in light of the june 4 genesis of the u s export ban the waiver announcement and china s view of it also raised concerns among some specialists who view it as a step by the obama administration toward eventually lifting the arms embargo the c 130 proposal is obviously a toe in the water and as such should be rejected said john bolton former undersecretary of state for international security this administration seems to have two messages about america for foreign governments weak and weaker edward timperlake a former pentagon technology security official agreed this will ultimately undermine tiananmen sanctions because the chinese state controlled media is hyping that as their objective a very courageous chinese citizen just received the nobel prize and his wife has been placed under house arrest announcing this waiver now makes a mockery of any administration pretense of supporting human rights regardless of the expedient environmental fig leaf justification mr timperlake said an administration official said the waiver covers all c 130s military or civilian but is intended for those used by oil spill companies which routinely use them this waiver doesn t lift the u s license requirement and doesn t provide any kind of blanket authorization the official said we would still process license applications on a case by case basis this is merely for contingency plans to get material to the site wherever an environmental disaster occurs chinese human rights advocate liu xiaobo who was awarded the nobel peace prize on friday said over the weekend that he dedicated the prize to the victims of tiananmen square according to his wife liu xia mrs liu told reporters that mr liu said on sunday of the prize this is for the lost souls of june 4 the date used to described the events of the 1989 massacre in which hundreds and perhaps thousands of chinese were killed when military tanks and armored vehicles fired on pro democracy protesters in beijing s main square the waiver also appears linked to the current visit to vietnam by defense secretary robert m gates who on monday repeated u s concerns about growing chinese assertiveness over the south china sea the u s has a long standing national interest in freedom of navigation and open access to asia s maritime commons mr gates said vietnam is said by u s officials to be worried about growing chinese territorial encroachment in the resource rich south china sea which china has in the past declared off limits to non chinese fishing vessels china also set off alarms among governments in the region in august by announcing it has planted a chinese flag on the floor of the south china sea using a mini submarine the china times report quoted chinese col zhao xiaozhuo of the academy of military science as saying the u s should sell military goods like c 130s to china as a tactical transport c 130 cargo aircraft serve for middle ranged deliveries that is the distance is within the battlefield theater said col zhao the c 130 first flown in 1954 is considered one of the world s premier military transports that can take off and land on rough airstrips the aircraft is used widely by u s special forces commandos for parachute troops to launch drones and for dropping 10 000 pound bombs john tkacik a former state department china affairs specialist said the c 130 waiver and china s response appeared linked to mr gates visit to the region it sends the wrong message to the southeast asians its send the wrong message to the chinese mr tkacik said we should not be encouraging the chinese to have long range air lift capabilities for their military china currently operates a fleet of similar y 8 shaanxi transports and is building a y 9 transport that
