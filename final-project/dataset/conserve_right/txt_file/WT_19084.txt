apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap whatever happens next don t call it impeachment house democrats have been careful not to rush to impeachment proceedings against president donald trump in the aftermath of robert mueller s report despite calls to do so by high profile lawmakers and 2020 presidential contenders but as congress resumes monday the democratic oversight and investigations agenda is starting to look a lot like the groundwork that would be needed to launch an impeachment inquiry at some point it s a political difference rather than a practical one i don t think there s a magical moment at which proceedings become really impeachment proceedings said cornell law school professor josh chafetz top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century the judiciary committee is scheduled to hear testimony from attorney general william barr on thursday despite resistance from the administration the oversight committee has reached an agreement with the white house for testimony this week on security clearances the intelligence committee is probing trump s financial dealings and the ways means committee is pursuing trump s tax returns the house has such broad oversight powers that it really doesn t matter whether they re geared toward impeachment toward legislating toward overseeing the functioning of the executive branch etc chafetz said at the end of the day for the purposes of the powers available to the house i don t think it makes much of a difference whether they use the word impeachment or not house speaker nancy pelosi has insisted the door is neither open nor closed to impeachment instead she says congress is taking a step by step approach in exerting its role as a check on the executive branch it will lead wherever it leads and the public can decide while republicans and others in washington are ready to move on from the report from special counsel robert mueller democrats in congress are still fighting to see it the judiciary committee chairman rep jerrold nadler d n y subpoenaed for a full and un redacted copy of the 400 page report and its underlying materials he also wants mueller to testify before the panel by may 21 pelosi suggests that congress will have more to say on impeachment after lawmakers and the american public digests the findings of the two year probe of russian interference in the 2016 election and possible obstruction by trump in every way he is unfit to be the president of the united states pelosi said in an interview with the associated press earlier this month does that make it is that an impeachable offense well it depends on what we see in the report pelosi says she sets a very high bar for impeachment because i think it s very divisive in the country in many ways house democrats are trying to have it both ways pursuing the investigations that could serve as a prelude to impeachment proceedings without taking the politically fraught step of calling it impeachment the balancing act reflects recent polling that shows americans are interested in getting more information but also split a poll by the associated press norc center for public affairs research ahead of the report s release this month showed that even with the mueller probe complete 53 said congress should continue to investigate trump s ties with russia while 45 said congress should not a similar percentage 53 said congress should take steps to impeach trump if he is found to have obstructed justice even if he did not have inappropriate contacts with russia while high profile democrats including rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and presidential contenders elizabeth warren and beto o rouke have called for the house to begin impeachment proceedings others have not for many house democrats particularly newly elected freshmen representing districts trump won in 2018 putting their names to a floor vote to launch an impeachment inquiry would likely become politically fraught sarah binder a professor of political science at george washington university said as long as those cross currents exist within the house democratic caucus it s in pelosi s interest to slow down the impeachment train but hold the administration accountable for trump s first two year in office at this stage whether congress is conducting oversight or holding impeachment proceedings the tools are mostly the same subpoenas hearings investigations but that could change as trump is refusing to comply with subpoenas for administration officials to testify and blocking congress from obtaining more information on monday trump sued deutsche bank and capital one in an attempt to block congressional subpoenas for his financial records trump the trump organization and the president s children donald jr eric and ivanka asked a federal judge to declare the subpoenas unlawful and enforceable the lawsuit also seeks to block the financial institutions from disclosing information and complying with the subpoenas barr who is set to appear wednesday before senate judiciary committee where republicans have the majority has informed the house that he may not appear thursday if democrats insist on having committee staff from both sides question him after lawmakers do unbowed democrats scheduled a committee vote for wednesday to allow the staff questions pelosi in a brief interview monday said barr would be obstructing congress if he decided not to testify witnesses she said can t tell the committee how to conduct its interviews those tensions set up a legal battle that will test the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches and could become a defining one for this congress and this administration the outcome remains uncertain it s not at all clear that the house will ever fully broach the topic of impeachment and such proceedings have been rare in congress the house has impeached just 19 people mostly federal judges and fewer than half ended up being convicted by the senate according the congressional research service rep pramila jayapal d wash a member of the judiciary committee said she s focused on the investigations she said she thinks it s better at this point not to label them impeachment hearings but just to show voters what they find you can t win the political process unless you convince the people that there s something there she said associated
