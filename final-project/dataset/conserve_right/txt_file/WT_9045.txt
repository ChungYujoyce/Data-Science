unified with our community we want to be careful about how we deal with it but we do want to say to people come to chinatown here we are we re again careful safe and come join us not a mask or gloves in sight well why should she have bothered with those the world health organization who had consistently peddled the chinese communist party s lies about no human to human transmission as early as jan 6 centers for disease control and prevention director robert r redfield offered to send china a team specializing in infectious diseases but china refused it on jan 17 the cdc and the department of homeland security s customs and border protection ordered entry screening for symptoms of the virus at three major u s airports san francisco new york jfk and los angeles on jan 23 who reassured everyone that it was not a global health emergency but a mere week later dr tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general declared a public health emergency of international concern in his statement he gushed all over china the speed with which china detected the outbreak isolated the virus sequenced the genome and shared it with who and the world are very impressive and beyond words he said so is china s commitment to transparency and to supporting other countries in many ways china is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response it s not an exaggeration you got that right china lied about the virus for weeks allowing international travel at the same time it shut down internal travel to and from wuhan in other words they blithely or deliberately allowed millions of travelers to carry the virus to other countries creating a worldwide contagion for weeks who spouted chinese communist propaganda until finally labeling the crisis a pandemic on march 11 meanwhile china scoured the world buying medical supplies so it could act the role of the white knight rescuing the world it also issued propaganda blaming the u s military for the outbreak but to democrats and their media mr trump is the one singularly responsible for the whole thing for ignoring the medical experts that would be news to the most prominent expert on the white house coronavirus task force dr anthony fauci who was himself a victim of misinformation from china and the who this is not a major threat for the people in the united states dr fauci told newsmax on jan 21 and this is not something the citizens of the united states right now should be worried about no wonder mr trump on jan 24 praised the chinese for their efforts and transparency it will all work out well a week later to democrats cries of racism and xenophobia mr trump issued more stringent travel restrictions making the u s one of the first nations to do so as the crisis deepened the media grew more hysterical in a front page lead article on april 5 headlined 70 days of denial delays and dysfunction the washington post excoriated mr trump the newspaper compared his failure to the period leading up to 9 11 warnings were sounded including at the highest levels of government but the president was deaf to them until the enemy had already struck two things of note while trashing mr trump the post actually took the opportunity to blame president bush for the terrorist attacks on sept 11 2001 bill clinton let osama bin laden go when we had him cornered but never mind and in an outburst of honesty the post referred to the 9 11 islamist hijackers as the enemy in today s daily coverage of the latest islamist atrocity you have to plow through tons of verbiage about nondescript militants or insurgents but i digress let s get back to the who and what should be done about it mr trump has suspended u s funding to a corrupt entity caught toadying to communist china democrats and leftists worldwide are furious mrs pelosi who has already ordered up more impeachment seeking investigations featuring tv hound adam schiff is threatening to sue or perhaps drag mr trump along on her next tour of chinatown without a mask she says we need a coordinated international response with respect for science and data which is exactly why mr trump is giving the who a lesson in accountability robert knight is a
