if there s one thing that gets liberals blinded with rage it s voter id laws there was a whole panel dedicated to this issue at the progressive netroots nation last summer where panelists agreed that this is thelatest evolutionof jim crow laws but is it impactingelections nate cohn at the new york times wrote that such laws don t really sway elections granted there are some issues with voter databases that could prevent someone with a valid id from voting yet these errors also inflate the number of voters who are labeled as not having proper identification additionally it s hyperbolic to say these laws suppress the vote since the demographics that could potentially be disproportionately impacted don t vote often anyway to begin with the true number of registered voters without photo identification is usually much lower than the statistics on registered voters without identification suggest the number of voters without photo identification is calculated by matching voter registration files with state id databases but perfect matching is impossible and the effect is to overestimate the number of voters without identification take texas a state with a particularly onerous voter id law if i register to vote as nate but my id says nathan i might be counted among the hundreds of thousands of registered voters without a photo id but i ll be fine at the polling station on election day with a name that s substantially similar to the one on file the demographic profile of voters without identification young nonwhite poor immobile elderly is also similar to the profile of voters who turn out at low rates it s also possible that the voter file is the issue some people voted in past elections but have moved since and haven t been purged from the voter file even though their id may have expired if they had one in the first place some elderly voters might just be dead and not yet removed from the voter rolls the article also notes that some of these folks that don t have ids are republicans but those without identification are mostly breaking for democrats still it s not enough to decide anything but an extremely close election moreover it s not like democrats have been unable to win states with voter id laws cohn aptly noted that obama won indiana in 2008 concerning the american people voter id laws are immensely popular across the political spectrum in texas 67 percent support their voter id laws a fox news poll from may of 2014 found that70 percent including 55 percent of democrats support laws that protect the integrity of our elections in july of 2013 when parts of the voting rights acts were struck down as unconstitutional marist asked do you think it is a good thing or a bad thing if election laws were changed to do each of the following require voters to show identification in order to vote there was 70 percent approval across the board regions political ideology political affiliation income sex and race all said such were a good thing one statistic that stood out was 65 percent of those describing themselves as very liberal approved of voter id laws if there is one thing that s preventing americans from voting it s not voter id laws it s thelack of resources at polling stations in predominantly minority voting districts now take what you will from that narrative but it s clear the voter id laws are popular and they re not really deciding elections evenpresident obama said on al sharpton s radio showlast october that voter id laws are notpreventing minorities from voting alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
