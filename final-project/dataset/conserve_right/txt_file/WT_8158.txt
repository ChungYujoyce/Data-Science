they answer their own question with a sheepish no we were shameful lau said from this generation i ve learned the meaning of fraternity and solidarity adorable support even if just from the sidelines that older citizens of hong kong are displaying for the tens of thousands of young demonstrators on the protest movement s tear gassed front lines is making an already complex problem for hong kong s leaders only more delicate and intractable a further toughening up of the police response already widely decried as heavy handed to the months long protests could turn bystanders into more active
