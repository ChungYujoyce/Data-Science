ican senator ben sasse is the author of the new book them why we hate each other and how to heal this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday november 25 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host i aposm chris wallace on this thanksgiving weekend we look at the growing political divide in our country as the 2020 campaign heats up will it only get worse begin videotape wallace president trump at odds with the supreme court aposs chief justice president donald trump john roberts has been speaking a little bit about it i think we have to use some common sense this ninth circuit everybody knows it aposs totally out of control wallace and with the cia over the involvement of the saudi crown prince in the murder of jamal khashoggi trump they did not come to a conclusion they have feelings certain ways maybe the world should be held accountable because the world is a vicious place wallace we aposll discuss the growing tribalism with republican senator ben sasse and with cory lewandowski and david bossie outside advisors to the president who say mr trump aposs enemies including some top officials in the white house are undermining him plus our sunday panel tackles a new administration report on climate change that presents the grimmest picture yet of the threat to the u s all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington as family and friends get together on this thanksgiving weekend there aposs one piece of advice a lot of people are taking don apost talk politics views about president trump and hot button issues are so divisive you run the risk of blowing up the family gathering now as we head into the 2020 race for president will this growing tribalism get even worse in a few minutes we aposll sit down with two outside advisors to the president cory lewandowski and david bossie for their first interview on their new book about mr trump aposs enemies but first from nebraska republican senator ben sasse a frequent critic of the president and author of his own new book them why we hate each other and how to heal senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen ben sasse r neb thanks for coming to snowy nebraska chris wallace ok senator we aposll get to your book about political tribalism in a moment but i want to start discussing another threat and that is the 13 federal agencies came out with something called the national climate assessment on friday and here are the major findings from that assessment temperatures in the u s are 1 8 degrees higher than 100 years ago seas are nine inches higher heat waves hurricanes and wildfires are much worse and climate change could cut our gdp by 10 percent by 2100 if there are no changes senator how seriously do you take this report from the trump administration sasse well i think it aposs clear that the climate is changing i think reasonable people can differ about how much and how rapidly but i think it aposs clear that it aposs changing and it aposs clear that humans are a contributing factor i think the real question though becomes what do you do about it because you can apost legislate or regulate your way into the past we have to innovate our way into the future and right now you don apost hear a lot of people who put climate as their number one issue you don apost hear a lot of them offering constructive innovative solutions for the future it aposs usually just a lot of alarmism but i think the report is important and it shows that the climate is changing wallace but for instance you oppose what you call epa overreach including president obama aposs climate change plan according to the report rolling that back which would limit greenhouse gas emissions is exactly the wrong approach sasse yes well i think we have to recognize that this is a global issue and china and other countries that are rapidly building middle classes are going to be the number one drivers in the long term so what the u s needs to do is participate in a long term conversation about how you get to innovation and it aposs going to need to be a conversation again that doesn apost start with alarmism but that starts with some discussion of the magnitude of the challenge the global elements to it and how the u s shouldn apost just do this is a feel good measure but some sort of innovative proposal and right now that aposs not really what i get from most of the people who make this a top two or three issue for themselves wallace but just quickly i want to move on to other subjects china for instance is trying to grow into the future and has become a huge investor in solar panels there was an international agreement in which countries made commitments the paris climate accord and the president is going to pull us out of that so aren apost isn apost much of the rest of the world actually moving faster than we are sasse so i distinguish between the two parts of your answer i think the first part about chinese investment does show part of the way forward the u s needs to have a long term investment and innovation strategy that aposs true but things like the paris climate accord tend to be more binding on us than on other nations and so that aposs not good for the u s consumer and it aposs not a long term solution but conversations like that are certainly important going forward wallace all right let aposs turn to another big story this week and that is what role saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman may or may not have played in the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi and what the u s should do about it the cia has according to reports this week concluded that mbs was involved but president trump challenges that here he is begin video clip trump the cia points it both ways you know and as i said maybe he did maybe he didn apost but i will say very strongly that it aposs a very important ally end video clip wallace senator what do you think of president trump aposs conclusion that basically comes down to this regardless of what mbs did we need to continue doing business with saudi arabia sasse yes it was a very weak statement i think we need to distinguish between two things there is a whole there are a whole bunch of bad guys in the middle east and if you want to make a hard core realist case and i think this is some of what the president is trying to hint out there that there are places and times when our and saudis interests temporarily aligned and sometimes you have to work with bad guys in the world there aposs a coherent realist case to be made there saudi i often refer to them as the second worst players in the middle east second only to iran but that aposs a different thing making the realist case is a different thing than being so weak that we failed to tell the truth mbs murdered contributed to murdering somebody abroad and it is not strength to sort of mumble past that strength is telling the truth even when it aposs hard fortunately we have a u s intelligence community that aposs really good and a lot of us in the first branch of government the article one branch the congress have heard from the intelligence community and i aposll be getting another classified briefing on tuesday about this and our intelligence community is really good and the report is really clear and the president should be stronger that was a weak statement wallace another subject the president got into a remarkable face off this week with chief justice john roberts after a federal judge issued a nationwide ban on president trump aposs new policy that would basically bar asylum for anybody who crosses into the country illegally here aposs president trump on that begin video clip trump this was an obama judge and i aposll tell you what it aposs not going to happen like this anymore end video clip wallace chief justice roberts responded with this statement we do not have obama judges or trump judges bush judges or clinton judges what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them your reaction sir to the dustup between the president and the chief justice sasse well first of all it is clear the case that there are a lot of bad opinions that come out of the ninth circuit that aposs why they get turned over at a rate higher than any other circuit in the nation and it aposs legitimate to talk about that but the chief justice is right we don apost have obama judges and bush judges or trump judges or carter or reagan judges we have judges in the american system and they take on a black robe where they are supposed to shield their partisan preferences they are not red or blue state judges they are judges and so when the american people want to affirm a constitutional system with the article three branch which is where the judiciary sets when they have lifetime appointments that aposs because we believe they are supposed to lay down their partisan preferences so when the president wants to critique bad judging he should get out the merits of critiquing the particulars of a bad ruling and he should help explain to our kids why we think we shouldn apost have obama judges and trump judges we should have people who are impartial that aposs why they wear a black robe that aposs why they don apost run for election so we need to do a better job of teaching basic american civics and i think the chief justice aposs statement was right about what we want the next generation to understand about why we have three separate but equal branches that check and balance one another wallace all right senator let aposs turn out to your new book how do you explain the growing political tribalism in this country sasse we have an epidemic of loneliness in this country and one of the things we aposre not doing well is putting politics in its proper place so we are turning upside down the pyramid of attachments that should matter in people aposs lives politics matter but politics can apost come first if politics come first in your life something is wrong with you it aposs a sad thing and so the most basic relationships in american life are supposed to be with your family with your friends with your neighborhood at your local place of worship and at your workplace and right now we are living through a digital revolution that is undermining place this stuff isn apost about the last two years there are a whole bunch of people who watch cable news all day every day who want to hyperventilate about politics every minute there aposs something wrong when that aposs happening what aposs going on in america isn apost because of president trump he didn apost cause it he can apost fix it this isn apost the last two years or the next two years this is the last couple of decades and the coming couple of decades and this digital revolution is something we need to wrestle with because it aposs bigger than our politics but it aposs warping our politics as well wallace as you know our next guest in the next segment trump outside advisors cory lewandowski and david bossie have written a new book called trump aposs enemies which seems to speak exactly to this divide to this tribalism in the book they say this about republican senators corker flake and a fellow you may know named ben sasse some republicans who are not brave enough to run against trump for president occupy some of the loudest of the enemies of the president and they also write about political treason question senator sasse how do you plead sasse yes i hope you aposll get them to define their terms so republics aren apost healthy when people use words like treason about policy debates that aposs a pretty messed up world view so the most fundamental things in life are about the people who love you and who are going to comfort you in your old age what is politics about politics is about maintaining a framework for ordered liberty so that people can live in the neighborhoods and the communities that they live in so i haven apost seen their book i haven apost met corey lewandowski i aposve met david bossie before he seems like a nice guy but language about enemies and treason about policy and politics is pretty warped and i think most americans think it aposs weird when you when you look at the small subset of people who put politics at the center of their lives they tend to be really really lonely most healthy people want to coach little league they want to go to church and they want to have great coworkers at the office and they want to put on faceplate when nebraska aposs point football on saturdays that aposs the most natural way to live and then you want politicians to do a limited number of things to maintain a framework for ordered liberty and then they should go back home and one of the fundamental problem is we have in this country it aposs a political class of people who are so obsessed with politics that when they go to washington they never actually planned to leave that aposs why i aposm for term limits that aposs why it aposs messed up that five of the seven richest counties in america are the suburbs of washington d c where the lobbyists live i think the vast majority of 320 million americans want politics to be put back in a proper place not to be the center of people aposs worldview wallace senator thank you thanks for your time this holiday weekend and please come back sir sasse thanks chris wallace up next president trump has his enemies but are the worst inside his own white house two of the main players behind mr trump aposs 2016 win with an exclusive take on those trying to bring down the president commercial break wallace president trump enters the second half of his term facing many challenges but is one of the biggest coming from inside his own white house joining me now for their first interview the authors of the new book trump aposs enemies how the deep state is undermining the presidency the president aposs first campaign manager corey lewandowski now senior advisor to the vice president aposs pac great america committee and former trump deputy campaign manager david bossie david corey welcome back to fox news sunday corey lewandowski former trump campaign manager thanks for having us david bossie thank you wallace all right i want to start with the title of your book trump aposs enemies in which you include among his enemies not only democrats but the intelligence community the administrative state the media and the establishment corey is that really how you see the world of politics in washington you just heard ben sasse call that a warped weird lonely view of the world lewandowski well i respect senator sasse but what he has to acknowledge is that the attacks that this president has faced since the day that he won the election in november of 2016 have been unprecedented those attacks have come from the media the republican establishment who never supported candidate trump and still by and large don apost support donald trump even though he has taken over the republican party and then many others and so what we outline and the intelligence community and the big part of what we outline in this book is how the intelligence community went after the president through the fisa application process and those individuals who worked on the campaign because they simply disagreed with his political philosophy and that should be a very scary thing for every american wallace we aposre going to get into the russia investigation in a bit but you also go after people david who are working for the president you write this some of the people in the white house it was now becoming clear couldn apost and shouldn apost be trusted and you name specifically former economic advisor gary cohn former spokesperson sean spicer as members of what you call the november 9th club people who turned magically into trump supporters after he was elected david you aposre right that they wanted to control the president instead of as you said in your first book to let trump be trump bossie exactly let me just go step back for one moment and that is let aposs remember the what is going on here there aposs a vast left wing conspiracy going on that has been going on since the president won this election all throughout the transition and during those first two years a vast left wing conspiracy similar words i aposm using to what hillary clinton called the right wing conspiracy wallace which incidentally didn apost turn out not to be true bossie no it did turn out chris there was a vast there was an effort by the conservative movement to undermine president clinton wallace i understand but he did have a relationship with monica lewinsky bossie of course he did but what we are saying here in the book is the media the republican establishment and the intelligence services not together but separately are undermining this president and that is what this book trump aposs enemies is about wallace but the republican establishment is not left wing bossie no i wallace the intelligence community is not necessarily left wing the administrative state isn apost necessarily and neither is the media bossie mccabe comey strzok page we can go down the list of all of those within the doj and the fbi that undermined this presidency from the beginning they undermined him during the campaign there were using illegal operations against him wallace how about the people inside the white house lewandowski chris this is a very important point look we have seen individuals who my guess is not only do they not support him when he was running but probably didn apost vote for him on election day two years ago wallace such as lewandowski look i aposm sure gary cohn didn apost vote for them and there are other people who have been defined as globalist and there are many individuals who fought hard to get into the white house who did everything they could prior to him getting elected to keep them from being in the white house and what we do is we call these people out because it aposs the right thing to do the people who didn apost support his agenda and this is not dissimilar from what melania trump has said that there are still people inside the building who they don apost trust and president trump said in his own interview recently that there are people in the building who he cannot trust and i hope crosstalk bossie and we still don apost know who wrote the anonymous letter i mean there are clearly chris we don apost necessarily know who they are but there are people inside the white house who understand and are for this president aposs agenda and there are those who are there for their own agenda wallace all right corey i aposm going to ask you about something very specific you in your book go after the current white house chief of staff john kelly who you say as recently as august wouldn apost let the two of you walk around the west wing without a formal escort is kelly one of the people that you believe is undermining the president lewandowski well i respect john kelly for his service to the country and as long as the president wants to keep the message chief of staff that will be his prerogative but to say that dave and i two people who have been unresolved in our support for the president to have an escort which almost nobody else has to have i think is a little bit out of bounds and look we have been individuals who support the president aposs work on television in op eds across the board and to call into question our ability to walk around the campus of the white house i think is something that should be addressed wallace david bossie no i it aposs unfortunate you know i completely respect general kelly and i respect that the president wants to keep general kelly there it aposs unfortunate that general kelly doesn apost utilize us as much as he as much as we think he should it aposs his prerogative and he is in that job and we respect the job that he has done i wish that his people i wish that there were people within the white house structure that cared as much about their own jobs as they did about the midterms or they think they cared about the midterms as much as they did their own jobs this the failure of the midterms shows what we left on the table i think wallace i just want to get back to kelly for a moment do you believe that he is one of those people corey who is trying to control the president channel the president rather than let trump be trump lewandowski well i think it aposs fair to say that we would have very different management styles and the management style that john implement it when he became the chief of staff is one where to limit the access to the president to make sure that there is protocols and procedures and i think candidly that was needed when he came to the white house but i also think you have a president who wants access to individuals who wants to take phone calls and in our book look we interview him and he says nobody calls me i don apost get my messages that aposs a failure somewhere in the staff chain that the president doesn apost have the right to get to the people who are trying to reach him and i don apost know where that failure is but ultimately that should be resolved wallace i know you don apost want to answer this question but i aposm going to ask you it anyway did you get into a physical altercation with john kelly this last winter that had to be broken up by the secret service yes or no lewandowski well the secret service didn apost break anything up john and i had a very candid discussion as he probably has many times with the president the difference is wallace did he grab you lewandowski look i don apost want to get into what john may or may not have done but what i do think is he understands that my position is to support the president and the president aposs agenda all the time wallace david you say your toughest words to the russia investigation i want to put up some of what you said you write the upper echelons of the intelligence community and federal law enforcement have waged a full on war against the president and you say former fbi director james comey set in motion a conspiracy that would seek to cause critical damage to the presidency bossie i think that that aposs well established now i think what james comey did as fbi director is shameful i think that i know james comey long before he was fbi director i respect them i respected him for a long time and i thought he was one of the good guys what i see what i saw happen inside the fbi whether it was his field line agents whether it was strzok and page the mccabe operation or his leaking of information or dumping that fake russian dossier on the table to show then president elect trump that then really spun this out of control i think he was irresponsible and i wish that the president had fired him on day one instead of you know sometime in may he the president felt like he wanted to give the fbi director a chance and i think that is unfortunate wallace all right we are running out of time and i want to get to a couple of more questions the bottom line issue is whether or not this kind of us versus them view of politics is useful serves the president or whether in fact it jeopardizes his chances for reelection let aposs take a look at the midterms you talked about house democrats picked up at least 38 seats suburban women went for democrats 57 percent to 38 percent independents supported democrats 43 percent to 33 percent corey there aposs no question the president aposs base is rock solid the question is he hasn apost done enough to expand his base lewandowski look i think with the president has done as it relates to the economy and jobs are all going to be a reminder when he aposs on the ballot and the individuals who are running in some of these places ran away from the president which i think was a mistake particularly in some of those house seats when you look at where the president campaign the most whether it was georgia or indiana or in florida those candidates were winning time and time again because the republicans and the independents came out in support of those candidates which i think by extension was the trump agenda wallace ok but there are other places where republicans didn apost win and i want to talk let aposs put this up on the screen these are places where republicans lost democrats won races for senator and governor in wisconsin michigan and pennsylvania david i don apost have to tell you if the president doesn apost carry those three states in 2020 he doesn apost get reelected bossie well we aposre going to make sure that he works hard in those states we aposre going to be helping every step of the way but it aposs if you read our book trump aposs enemies and the interview we did with the president the president talks about the fake news divisions not that the media is the enemy of the people but that the fake news is wallace except he basically says fake news is everybody bossie fake news is all over the place because if you look at what aposs going on across this country he is i believe one of the greatest things that i agree with the president one of the great things he aposs done as president is educate the american people about what aposs going on in the fake news and i think it aposs he is going up against you talk about that map he aposs going up against the entire establishment of the washington democratic party and the media he has a big hill to climb and he aposs going to do it because he aposs going to tell the american people about his incredible list of accomplishments and where our economy is wallace corey david thank you both thanks for coming in it aposs always good to talk with you lewandowski thank you bossie thanks chris wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to continue the discussion about the country aposs growing political divide who aposs responsible and can we turn it around commercial break wallace coming up president trump taking on the courts over rulings on border security begin video clip trump the ninth circuit everybody knows it aposs totally out of control they aposre very unfair most importantly to the people of our country because i aposm keeping them safe end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel about the dustup between the president and chief justice next commercial break begin video clip trump i am calling fake news fake reporting is what aposs tearing this country apart because people know people like things that are happening and they aposre not hearing about it end video clip wallace president trump in our interview last week focusing on just one of the many obstacles to his presidency he says he has to overcome and it aposs time now for our sunday group jonah goldberg of the national review mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service adrienne elrod former advisor to hillary clinton aposs campaign and editor in chief of the washington free beacon matthew continetti so jonah we in the first half hour we heard two very different descriptions and analyses of our politics you have bossie and lewandowski you talk about trump aposs enemies and it aposs not just democrats it aposs the establishment the deep state the intelligence community the media and then you have ben sasse who calls that kind of view of the world warped and weird where do you come down jonah goldberg national review oh i aposm very much on team sasse when it comes to this one i think ben aposs ben sasse aposs book is great about how it pinpoints that most of our problems in our politics are upstream of washington we have problems in civil society we have problems in institutions and if you listen to dave bossie and corey lewandowski and i aposm i aposm an old friend of david bossie aposs they exhibit the exact problem they are actually endorsing this idea that even trump supporters are secret enemies if they only started supporting the president after the election he if you took their advice at face value they actually want the republican coalition to be even smaller than it is and it is already melting away big chunks it aposs like arctic ice caps just melting away under donald trump and they want to define the republican party as blind support for one man rather than a set a whole group of ideas and i think that aposs a suicidal choice wallace mo in the in just the past week the president fought with the chief justice his own cia the fake news media the special counsel he says though if he doesn apost fight he doesn apost win mo elleithee georgetown institute of politics and public service yes look i think the president there are a lot of fissures in our politics and our society today and they aposre not just ideological it aposs not left versus right there aposs urban versus rural there aposs people versus the elites what have you and there aposs a lot of reasons we can get into as to why that is there aposs two ways out of it one is to try to mend those fissures and the other is to exacerbate them for political gain and that aposs what the president aposs doing the president is finding the weak spots and he aposs jumping in and he aposs using it to his political advantage to try to undermine the credibility of the media to undermine the credibility of the courts to undermine the credibility of just about every institution because that aposs how he got elected we can be better as a civil society we can be better and we need to be better if we aposre going to heal some of these fissures we need to do a better job of listening to people on the other side we need to do a better job of understanding people and the other side what we don apost need to do is vilify people on the other side it aposs what the president complained about during the campaign yet here he is doing it to the umpteenth degree wallace but matt i mean look at trump aposs immediate predecessor barack obama and lord knows there wasn apost lollipops and unicorns in washington then and in fact the president said at the end of his term one of his great failures was he failed to unify the country so i think putting this all on trump isn apost really fair matthew continetti the washington free beacon i agree i mean i think president obama of course did criticized judges his famous rebuke of the supreme court after the citizens united decision he did criticize media specifically this network so this is larger than president trump what aposs happened i think is two fold the first is our politics is less and less about who gets what and it aposs more about much larger concept like values principles rights and when politics is about that then the arguments are much more vicious and much more sustained and the second thing that aposs happened chris is technology you know we call it social media but it aposs actually quite depersonalizing and once you aposre on these social networks i think you feel liberated to really show your worst self and so when i aposm looking to how we can kind of change things i think it aposs human person to person contacts and i saw that recently with dan crenshaw the congressman who went on snl after he was insulted and even carlos curbelo who actually met with someone who had threatened his life and they ended up holding a joint press conference together wallace adrienne you know this has been building for decades and you can talk about a lot of the outside politics issues like social media like all news cable and all the a variety of things but i mean i remember vividly during when clinton was president clinton derangement syndrome and then after the 2000 election there was bush derangement syndrome and it just seems to have started a long time ago but if anything to have gotten worse adrienne elrod democratic strategist yes but i think this president has taken it to a whole new level and to the point that matthew just made i do think social media has just highlighted in more and highlighted more of what what has actually been going on out there everybody can be their own pundit right on twitter so and we aposre hearing more from people who are on social media more than we did before before social media existed so you know look we aposre dealing with in my opinion the most uncivil president of the united states that we aposve ever had he is doing nothing to try to fix this problem he attacks the media every day he exacerbates inaudible wallace do you do you not remember clinton derangement syndrome do you not remember obama derangement syndrome bush bush elrod yes but this is wallace i mean from the moment that george w bush 43 was elected in 2000 and understandably it was a contested election a lot of people thought he wasn apost the legitimate president elrod look and a lot of this what i mean president trump to a large extent is a byproduct of what has been growing to this point right he was elected president we aposd had such a divided country but instead of actually trying to bring both sides together he aposs only further dividing so again i think if we want to restore civility we need to start from the top and that needs to be coming from the president of the united states wallace matt continetti well um again i think this is larger than trump one other thing that is i think particular worrisome to me anyway is that the polarization i actually don apost think most americans polarize but the polarization and the political class is now taking on a geographic dimension and so if you look at those election results what did we see we saw suburbs voting like suburbs whether they were in the north or the south this is something new we saw rural areas voting like rural areas whether they were in the midwest or the west or in the south and so now the key factor in our politics isn apost so much regional it aposs density it aposs how many people are around you and the more people that are around you the more likely you are to be liberal once these geographic cleavages emerge chris i think they aposre very difficult to resolve elrod yes goldberg but it aposs also the case that our politics of being nationalized where it used to be most of most of what you got out of politics was at the local or community level and now because of the nature of media because we now see presidents whether they aposre liberal or or conservative or liberal we see them as symbols of a culture war and we invest in them as matt was saying these abstract principles so we live in an era of very high negative polarization which basically says that there are millions of people who say they aposre democrats because they hate republicans and there are millions of republicans who say they aposre republicans because they hate democrats and when you live in that kind of era the impetus is to do things that simply are considered wins if they make the right people angry elleithee right and goldberg and donald trump has tapped into that very well wallace let me bring mo into this i was in missouri a couple of weeks ago talking to a largely republican crowd and while they supported a lot of what president trump did they they came up to me afterwards a lot of them i was surprised how many and said how do we how do we bring it back how do we make our country less divisive where it aposs you know one versus another tribes and i didn apost have a good answer do you elleithee yes i don apost know that there is a good answer other than we all have to as individuals those people you talked to have to take responsibility themselves for it look you know there was a survey here wallace but they aposre going about their lives they aposre selling insurance or working at the bank or whatever elleithee but part of the challenge part of the challenge we were talking about this in the green room earlier sociologists have been talking for quite some time about this phenomenon called the great sort where people are moving into communities where they are surrounded by people who think and sound like they do increasingly so and that aposs spreading into other aspects of our lives we go to work surrounded like people who think and sound like we do and we go to school surrounded by people who think and sound like we do and we get our news from information sources that reinforce what we already think our social media feeds absolutely are populated by people who think and sounds like we do to the point where we are isolating ourselves number one from different perspectives and number two disparaging those different perspectives when we hear them there aposs got to be a point where people there was a poll recently were parents for the first time are more offended by the idea of their children marrying outside of their political party than outside of their race or their faith now i guess on some warped level you can call that progress right wallace i was going to say that elleithee right that is progress but at the same time to be offended by your child marrying outside of your political persuasion that aposs not something washington is going to fix wallace all right we this is going to something we aposre not going to settle here but a very interesting discussion to be continued we have to take a break here when we come back we aposll discuss that new climate change report that paints a dire picture for the u s environment and economy commercial break begin video clip trump we do have an impact but i don apost believe the impact is nearly what some say and other scientists that dispute those findings very strongly end video clip wallace president trump earlier this month on axios casting doubt on the effects of climate change and we aposre back now with the panel so matt as i discussed with senator sasse the national climate assessment came out friday from 13 federal agencies inside the trump administration says paints a very dire picture of the climate situation in this country and says it is quote intensifying is it getting harder for the president to do as he did there to question the human impact and to argue as he also did in that interview well climate change sometimes it aposs hotter sometimes it aposs closer continetti certainly this eye opening report makes it more difficult i think to just wave away the issue right and so much of our discussion on climate change chris seems to be about that first principle question is it happening are humans contributing to it i think it would be wise may to kind of bring the conversation down to a lower level which is what are we going to do about it and there i think the what aposs interesting about the report is it talked about adaptation and a lot of the most scariest findings were premised on the idea that we weren apost going to adapt and so the question is how are we going to adapt and what policies can we do to kind of mitigate these very scary predictions that the government has outlined for us wallace adrienne the president argues that basically this is a choice between long term environmental impacts which are questionable in his mind and immediate short term economic impacts which are undeniable and that formulation makes it a tougher political call elrod yes but you know it aposs so irresponsible for the president to even go out there and you know sort of deny that climate change is real i mean what more proof do we need in this country we aposve got california burning up we aposve got hurricanes that are destroying florida and our coastal regions i mean you cannot deny that climate change is real so for the president of the united states to come out here and insinuate that oh maybe it aposs a hoax or some scientists just don apost believe that it aposs real it aposs completely irresponsible and it is incumbent upon the president now whether you aposre a democrat or a republican to actually do something about it this was a very damaging report that came out of course the friday after thanksgiving i think the administration might have been trying to bury it a little bit because it is such bad news but 20 30 years from now we aposre not going to be able to reverse what needs to actually be changed now it aposs going to be too late then about the good news about this report is it actually lays out some principles that we can institute now that will actually impact for the better what aposs happening wallace jonah goldberg i actually think that the report itself is a little on the alarmist side if you look at the big numbers that they aposre talking about the economic projections they wallace ten percent cut in gdp goldberg right wallace well but it doesn apost if we don apost reverse things by 2100 goldberg right but that is according to rodger pelki ph twice the actual production they have elsewhere in the report about how bad things are going to get i aposm a luke warmist when it comes to things i think it aposs real i do think it is over it is overhyped at the same time there are things that we can do that as matt was saying that can mitigate it or that can prepare us better for the worst case scenario but the way this is usually talked about is it aposs all worst case scenario when that the data doesn apost support that i don apost think and actually there are there that come with global warming like lower growing seasons and the rest that are actually good things elleithee but the authors of the report will say they didn apost look just at worst case scenario that they looked at every single scenario and i think the point you just made jonah actually is an important one that whether it aposs 10 percent or 5 percent or 8 percent there will be economic shrinkage so let aposs put the environmental point aside for a second this president is wants to be wants an economic a long lasting long term economic legacy that aposs pretty clear that aposs what he wants to focus on he may make this argument about short term economic growth versus questionable environmental findings but if 13 federal agencies are saying there will be long term economic shrinkage that will be his economic legacy not that he caused this but that he could have been the president to begin to do something about it and he chose not to elrod right wallace all right just when you think you aposve seen it all president trump got into a dustup this week with chief justice john roberts over the independence of the judiciary it happened when the president went after what he called an obama judge for issuing a nationwide ban on his new asylum policy which would basically have said if you cross the border illegally you aposre not eligible for asylum here aposs the president begin video clip trump it aposs a shame it aposs a disgrace frankly and essentially they aposre legislating they aposre saying what to do some judge sitting in some location very far away is telling our incredible military and law enforcement what to do end video clip wallace jonah who aposs got the better side of this argument the president or the chief justice goldberg i think everybody has got a side in this argument there aposs a in philosophy it aposs the is ought ph problem it is true that the ninth circuit is very liberal and it aposs full of very liberal judges who do legislate from the bench it is also true that the president of the united states should probably stay in his lane more and not further politicize the courts with this kind of rhetoric that he aposs talking about i don apost know what benefit comes from it i think jonathan turley makes a good case that justice roberts could do a better job of policing his own branch of government better because there really is a divergence between our political appointees on one side or the other and wallace but wait wait how aposs he going to do that goldberg i don apost know but it ain apost my job you know it aposs his job wallace well no but i mean i mean he can apost sit there what aposs he going to go and say to a bush appointee hey listen you made a ought to tone it down and to a clinton goldberg there is an awful lot of speechifying from the bench about various partisan issues that i think he could call some up people up and say hey look we have we aposre living in a moment where the judiciary is being politicize more than ever let aposs all be a little responsible he tries to do that on the supreme court by having these going with the most narrow interpretation possible to get the biggest majority he can i think there aposs a there aposs an argument for doing that kind of thing but at the same time the president has a point wallace i want to get to that adrienne because the fact is the president says well there aposs an obama judge the fact is obama judges obama appointed judges act differently rule differently than a bush judge or a trump judge generally elrod well i mean not necessarily obviously there have been democratic president to who have appointed republicans to the federal bench there have been republican presidents wallace not not lately elrod who have well maybe well not lately but it has happened in the past president clinton certainly appointed many conservative leaning judges to the bench but there aposs also been reports that show that maybe some of these cases that are being overturned by the federal courts that the trump administration is putting forward are being overturned because they go beyond the constitutional authority of the president of the united states so it aposs not necessarily you shouldn apost be blaming the circuit court the ninth circuit for some of these decisions when actually the president is overreaching in terms of some of the court cases that he aposs putting forward wallace i well he doesn apost bring the court case it aposs brought elrod his administration wallace he he makes a policy and then and that aposs what i i want to ask you about matt because it this doesn apost get to the ninth circuit these are these rulings are coming from federal district judges there are 700 federal district judges these aren apost appeals courts or the supreme court a federal district judge in san francisco looks at the president aposs asylum policy says i think it aposs unconstitutional and not only is it unconstitutional here it aposs unconstitutional nationwide and he basically stops shuts down a program nationwide continetti it aposs a huge problem and it aposs been happening since the beginning of the trump administration with the very initial travel ban right this idea of nationwide injunctions issued by district court judges who are basically geographically located in either san francisco or hawaii and the aclu and amnesty international their lawyers there know any time a new controversial policy is issued by the president they can go to these judges in these two areas and get a nationwide injunction stops the policy as i says nationwide you know who was actually leading a very good charge against this was jeff sessions and unfortunately he aposs now out i hope that the administration continues to press not so much this larger issue of trump or obama wallace is is there anything you can do in other words if a judge a federal district judge says this is you know this is a nationwide temporary restraining order is there anything anybody can do continetti there probably statutory the second the first branch of government that congress has the right to rein in the courts and this has been talked about in conservative circles for a long time we haven apost really done it as much as conservatives like myself would hope and of course now we have a very short window to do it because the with the house democrats coming in january the chances of any raining is very small wallace thirty 30 seconds elleithee the president bemoaning the politicization of the court i think is ironic considering he was a candidate who put out a list of potential supreme court nominees that he would appoint during the campaign look yes they aposre ideological some of these decisions are ideological because they aposre ideological interpretations of some of these laws that aposs not the problem to me as much as and that aposs why we have a process of appeals that aposs not as much of a problem to me as the president undermining the legitimacy of the entire judiciary wallace thank you thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week oh boy once again i dance with the turkeys commercial break wallace here aposs a holiday riddle we ask every thanksgiving who founded a huge tech company created a successful cosmetic business and now raises turkeys like the native americans did once again here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape sandy lerner ayrshire farm farm with the land farm with the seasons know your soil know your rainfall know your know your weather know your animals wallace sandy lerner is talking about sustainable farming raising livestock and growing vegetables without the chemicals that are so common in what she calls factory farming just days before thanksgiving she took me out to see and yes to dance with her 1 300 turkeys heritage breeds that trace back to the indians lerner come on raise your arms gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble gobble wallace lerner is mistress of ayrshire farm 800 acres in upperville virginia but as interesting as her business is how she got here she grew up on a farm in california making enough from raising cattle to send herself to college lerner what i learned was to love work i aposm really happiest when i aposm engaged in in working and thinking and and striving wallace she got into computers in 1984 she and her then husband started cisco systems that found a way to link networks of computers the foundation of the internet but six years later venture capital people were running cisco wallace on camera how do you get fired from a company that you started lerner we just basically got taken to the cleaners and part of that was if you don apost have an employment contract i got fired by the same guy who fired steve jobs wallace voice over lerner had a second act she started a cosmetics company called urban decay with edgy colors for women like her and in 1996 she bought ayrshire farm lerner it aposs historically been people who had disposable income who made strides in farming look at george washington or look at thomas jefferson you aposre such a pretty girl because pretty is as pretty does wallace she raises shires warhorses that go back centuries scotch highland cattle and those turkeys which she says taste better because of the lives they lead wallace on camera how much is an aryshire turkey cost as compared to what i aposd get in the grocery store lerner well our turkeys are expensive they aposre between i think they aposre running this year about 160 to 200 wallace voice over at those prices there are questions about how to make this kind of farming profitable but while lerner is determined to run a sound business it aposs not just about the bottom line there aposs a 40 room mansion on the farm wallace on camera what aposs it like living their lerner i don apost know wallace what do you mean lerner i live in a little log cabin and i love it wallace do you think you aposre a bit eccentric lerner i am now that i aposm rich i used to just be weird wallace voice over and so just days
