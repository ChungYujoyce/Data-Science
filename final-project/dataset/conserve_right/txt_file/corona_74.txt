a first amendment organization has chimed in on the university of california system s recent guidance forbidding use of terms like chinese virus saying officials need to rethink their approach earlier this month the council of chief diversity officers at uc issued the document equity and inclusion during covid 19 which states do not use terms such as chinese virus or other terms which cast either intentional or unintentional projections of hatred toward asian communities and do not allow the use of these terms by others refer to the virus as either covid 19 or coronavirus in both oral and written communications the foundation for individual rights in education notes the edict is framed as guidance suggesting the directives are merely aspirational the problem is the words do not which appear to indicate a mandate what will happen to those who don t adhere to the guidelines fire asks will students be punished will professors be passed over for tenure from fire s statement the uc system is a public university system bound by the first amendment as a government actor it may not prohibit protected speech no matter its intention in doing so statements like these directives impermissibly chill protected expression as students and faculty may self censor for fear of crossing a line they cannot see uc may certainly take a more speech approach to addressing inclusivity on its campus during this unprecedented moment in history it may educate students on the effects of discourse surrounding the novel coronavirus as other government actors have the centers for disease control and prevention and the world health organization for example both provide guidance on the best practices for disease naming as well as information about why covid 19 was so named both organizations explain why they have concluded that avoiding associating a disease with its nation of origin is an important part of ensuring broader public health uc and other public universities that now confront similar questions may do the same they may not however appear to ban speech outright we ve already seen paroxysms of self righteous indignation regarding this very topic at uc schools and elsewhere at uc berkeley for example a student used the mandarin term for wuhan virus as a screen name during a virtual lecture and was immediately reported for doing so at uc davis a student took to the pages of the school newspaper to denounce as xenophobic a graffiti message criticizing the chinese government similarly at the university of wisconsin madison anti chinese government chalkings were panned as racist and xenophobic and coronavirus based free speech inanity isn t confined to things china related a professor at brown university had to apologize for her presumption of heterosexuality after saying there are enough virus tests to test women in labor but not their husbands read the fire statement more uc system tells students and faculty not to use term chinese virus more coronavirus prompts professors to hide their lectures from the public image shutterstock com like the college fix on facebook follow us on twitter sign up for the college fix s newsletter we won t bombard your inbox or share your info we just send compelling campus news twice a week
