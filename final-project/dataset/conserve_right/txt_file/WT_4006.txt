region to avoid getting caught in the middle of a war between turkey and the kurdish led u s allied syrian democratic forces sdf turkey s initial four pronged onslaught reportedly hit civilian areas

fighting each other for centuries they re bitter enemies possibly always will be the u s fought alongside the sdf for years to roll back the islamic state s caliphate straddling the syrian iraqi border kurdish officials estimate they have lost more than 10 000 fighters in the struggle but turkey considers parts of the sdf to be terrorists and has vowed to push the group out of northern syria altogether turkey also hopes to resettle millions of largely arab syrian refugees it has been housing during syria s brutal civil war european and nato leaders blasted turkey s offensive and the united nations security council announced an emergency session thursday to discuss the next steps mr erdogan has remained defiant in the face of an international backlash and pledged to move ahead

than 75 cases have been filed against those engaged in dark propaganda the turkish armed forces together with the syrian national army rebel groups backed by turkey just launched operationpeacespring against kurdish militias and the islamic state group in northern syria mr erdogan said in a post on twitter as turkish planes reportedly began dropping bombs on kurdish positions near the city of

territorial integrity and liberate local communities from terrorists sdf leaders on the ground said turkish shelling resulted in at least eight deaths they also said the turkish military targeted a detainment facility for isis fighters and argued that the attack could free the prisoners and help fuel the terrorist group s resurgence vicinity of al chirkin prison hosting isis prisoners was shelled by turkish army the place where the most dangerous jihadists are held in sdf spokesman mustafa bali tweeted as part of a series of posts that also showed grisly images of injured and dying kurds hit by turkish airstrikes and artillery mr trump has tried to walk a fine line between opposing the attack and backing the kurds he placed faith in mr erdogan to not step over the line into all out genocide and defended his core foreign policy conviction that the u s can no longer entangle itself in middle eastern conflicts the united states does not endorse this attack and has made it clear to turkey that this operation is a bad idea mr trump said in a statement shortly after attacks began there are no american soldiers in the area from the first day i entered the political arena i made it clear that i did not want to fight these endless senseless wars especially those that don t benefit the united states turkey has committed to protecting civilians protecting religious minorities including christians and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place and we will hold them to this commitment mr trump said he expected turkey to ensure that the thousands of isis detainees would not go free and appeared to suggest that u s forces have moved some of the most dangerous isis captives to other locations we are taking some of the most dangerous isis fighters out the president said we ve taken them out and we re putting them in different locations where it s secure he again faulted european nations that he said have refused to take back their nationals who traveled to syria to join the islamic state he said most of the isis detainees wanted to go to europe even though the majority of the estimated 11 000 detainees are believed to come from syria and iraq sickening despite the u s and global calls for restraint sdf leaders said civilians including teenagers had become casualties across northern syria thousands of civilians reportedly packed their cars and fled toward safety others tried to escape the region on foot mr trump s critics including some usually reliable republican allies said the situation is the predictable result of the president s stand down order this week president trump s decision to withdraw u s forces from northern syria is having sickening and predictable consequences rep liz cheney wyoming republican said in a statement turkey is invading syria in reported coordination with russian backed forces isis terrorists are launching attacks in raqqa and thousands of isis fighters are biding their time in makeshift prisons the u s is abandoning our ally the kurds who fought isis on the ground and helped protect the u s homeland this decision aids america s adversaries russia iran and turkey and paves the way for a resurgence of isis the pentagon said roughly 1 000 u s troops will remain in syria the president s decision this week affects only 50 to 100 u s special operations troops who had been operating in a key buffer zone along the turkish syrian border but even that modest troop movement some lawmakers say sends a larger message that the u s is abdicating its responsibilities american isolationism did not work before wwii did not work before 9 11 will not work now sen lindsey graham south carolina republican said in a post on twitter when it comes to fighting isis it s a bad idea to outsource american national security

get strong bipartisan support the sanctions target military relations and energy as well as mr erdogan and some of his government s top officials these sanctions will have immediate far reaching consequences for erdogan and his military mr van hollen said meanwhile international leaders blasted the turkish assault and looked for ways to head off what could become a major humanitarian crisis
