apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing ap china acknowledged wednesday it let two american b 52 bombers fly unhindered through its newly declared air defense zone in the east china sea despite its earlier threat to take defensive measures against unidentified foreign aircraft the u s flights which tested the chinese zone for the first time since it was declared over the weekend raised questions about beijing s determination to enforce its requirement that foreign aircraft identify themselves and accept chinese instructions china s lack of any action suggested that it was merely playing out a diplomatic game to establish ownership over the area rather than provoke an international incident top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens the flights followed days of angry rhetoric and accusations over beijing s move designed to assert chinese claims to a group of uninhabited islands controlled by japan the u s and japan have said they don t acknowledge the zone and taiwan and south korea both close to the u s also rejected it u s vice president joe biden will raise objections over the chinese declaration when he visits the country next week senior administration officials said in washington on condition their names not be used they said biden would press beijing policymakers on the unsettling pattern of how they deal with neighbors but state department spokeswoman jen psaki said that u s civilian air carriers were being advised to take all steps they consider necessary to operate safely in the east china sea region psaki did not specify what those steps might be and stopped short of saying airlines should provide flight details to chinese authorities she said the u s was still attempting to determine whether china s new rules apply to civil aviation commercial air flight a chinese defense ministry statement said the u s b 52s planes were detected and monitored as they flew through the area for two hours and 22 minutes it said all aircraft flying through the zone would be monitored and that china has the capability to exercise effective control over the relevant airspace asked repeatedly about the incident at a regularly scheduled briefing foreign ministry spokesman qin gang said it had been handled according to procedures laid out in the saturday statement but offered no specifics different situations will be dealt with according to that statement qin said the u s which has hundreds of military aircraft based in the region described the flights as a training mission unrelated to china s announcement of the zone u s officials said the two unarmed b 52 bombers took off from their home base in guam around midday and were in the zone that encompasses the disputed islands for less than an hour before returning to their base adding the aircraft encountered no problems the bomber flights came after state department spokeswoman jen psaki said china s move appeared to be an attempt to change the status quo in the east china sea this will raise regional tensions and increase the risk of miscalculation confrontation and accidents she told reporters the pentagon said u s defense secretary chuck hagel discussed the situation by telephone on wednesday with his japanese counterpart itsunori onodera and hagel said u s military operations will not in any way change as a result of china s announcement australia meanwhile said it called in the chinese ambassador to express concern about the sudden zone declaration the timing and the manner of china s announcement are unhelpful in light of current regional tensions and will not contribute to regional stability australian foreign minister julie bishop said in a statement beijing s move fits a pattern of putting teeth behind its territorial claims and is seen as potentially leading to dangerous encounters depending on how vigorously china enforces it and how cautious it is when intercepting aircraft from japan the u s and other countries china is sending its sole aircraft carrier to the south china sea for its first sea trial alarming the philippines which has conflicting claims with beijing over parts of the region manila said the aircraft carrier s presence in the sea threatens regional stability chinese reaction to the u s bomber flights was predictably angry with some recalling the 2001 collision between a chinese fighter and a u s surveillance plane in international airspace off china s southeastern coast the kind of accident some fear china s new policy could make more likely the chinese pilot wang wei was killed in the crash and the u s crew forced to make a landing on china s hainan island where they were held for 10 days and repeatedly interrogated before being released let s not repeat the humiliation of wang wei make good preparations to counterattack wrote zheng daojin a reporter with the official xinhua news agency on his twitter like weibo microblog businessman li pengliang said the island dispute had heightened anti japanese sentiment but doubted the chances of an open conflict the public is outraged but i still believe that the leaders in power are sober minded they will not act on impulse li said still others criticized the government s handling of what they termed a battle of psychological pressure and international public opinion china is terrible at telling its side of the story the silent one is the loser so why don t they better explain our response to the american bomber flight wrote hu xijin editor of the nationalist tabloid global times on his blog it wasn t clear whether beijing had anticipated the forceful response from washington and others or how well it is prepared to back up its demands chinese scholars who often serve as ad hoc government spokesmen criticized tuesday s flights as a crude show of force and said beijing wasn t looking for a fight it s not that china didn t want to enforce its demands but how do you expect china to react said
