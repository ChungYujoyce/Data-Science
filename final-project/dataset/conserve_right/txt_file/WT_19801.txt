apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic in the end president trump didn t fire robert mueller defying the predictions of democrats who were convinced he wouldn t allow the special counsel to see his probe through to the end and mr mueller left to do his work delivered a report that mr trump called total exoneration but that didn t mean the president was ready to let it go top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning it s a shame that our country had to go through this to be honest it s a shame that your president has had to go through this he said before i even got elected it began and it began illegally and hopefully somebody is going to look at the other side in a follow up email to campaign supporters mr trump named names house speaker nancy pelosi the 2020 democratic field and the fake news media the president asked his loyal followers to send him cash as a show of solidarity saying the investigation wasn t just a probe of himself but an attempt to diminish the 2016 election results their mission was to silence you he wrote the campaign also posted an online video showing clips of top democrats who said they had seen evidence of collusion with russia sen richard blumenthal of connecticut rep adam b schiff of california chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence rep jerrold nadler of new york chairman of the house judiciary committee and democratic national committee chairman tom perez the campaign stamped a large red wrong over each claim and asked americans to text witchhunt to show their support for the president distraught and blindsided by the results of the 2016 elections democrats lied to the american people continually hoping to undo the legitimate election of president trump said brad parscale mr trump s campaign manager despite a roving special counsel and desperate democrats trailing him every step of the way president trump has kept his focus where it belongs achieving for the american people according to the four page summary of mr mueller s work he found russian operatives did offer to work with trump campaign figures but he found no evidence any of mr trump s associates accepted the offers or worked with russians mr mueller was less definitive in his conclusions about the president s behavior after the election suggesting there were troubling actions that in some contexts may have been seen as obstruction but attorney general william p barr said there wasn t enough evidence to prosecute particularly because there was no evidence of the underlying crime of conspiracy mr mueller in his report specifically says his work does not exonerate the president mr trump wasn t having any of it it s complete exoneration no collusion no obstruction he said a white house spokesman later said it is not up to prosecutors to exonerate but rather to bring charges they don t prove a negative that s just silly spokesman hogan gidley said mr trump was briefed on the barr letter in florida where he spent the weekend at his mar a lago resort mr gidley said the president was happy with how it all turned out this is very good the spokesman quoted mr trump as saying after he was briefed the president s supporters saw in the justice department letter not only vindication for mr trump but also black eyes for media and mr trump s critics every media outlet owes president trump a nonstop apology for their continued claims that there was a conspiracy and that his presidency was illegitimate said rick manning president of americans for limited government mr mueller did prosecute several figures from mr trump s orbit including his former campaign chairman his former national security adviser and his former personal attorney but none of those cases involved a russian connected conspiracy to interfere in the election in the court of public opinion the sheer length of the 2 year old mueller investigation could bolster the president s view that the investigation was a witch hunt i think the one thing that has hurt the mueller investigation in the eyes of the public is how long it s taken said republican strategist mark corallo a former justice department official who worked briefly on the president s legal team you would think we would know by now whether there had been any overt or covert efforts by members of the trump campaign to engage with the russian government of vladimir putin to fix the election mr trump consistently insisted that was the case less than a month into his presidency he referred to the persistent accusations of collusion as this russian connection nonsense he soon began calling it a hoax and a witch hunt by spring 2017 he had fired fbi director james b comey enraging his critics who said he was trying to cover up a conspiracy they alleged that this action itself constituted obstruction of justice deputy attorney general rod rosenstein the man who wrote the letter that mr trump used to justify firing mr comey then appointed mr mueller to conduct an independent investigation mr trump spent nearly two years offering some cooperation with the investigation privately while trying to undermine its legitimacy publicly his attacks on mr mueller personally intensified and he accused the special counsel of being conflicted in the days before the report s release the president tried another line of attack that mr rosenstein and mr mueller were not elected to do anything i have a deputy appoints a man to write a report on me to make a determination on my presidency mr trump told fox business network this week people will not stand for it i had one of the greatest election victories in history some observers said the president s view ignores the role of law enforcement there s nothing illegitimate about the justice department conducting investigations under the purview of article ii of the constitution mr corallo said the president is the one who appoints the leadership of the federal agencies they serve at his pleasure mr trump did indeed appoint mr rosenstein who assumed oversight of the special counsel investigation when jeff sessions as attorney general recused himself to the president s everlasting criticism stephen dina
