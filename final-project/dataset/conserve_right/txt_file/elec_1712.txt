the second gop debate has come and gone and boy was it a doozy featuring 11 candidates including carly fiorina who was bumped up from the kids table debate following a change in cnn s eligibility criteria the discussion lasted for three hours with topics including everything from immigration to vaccinations fiorina wasted no time in justifying why she was allowed to participate on the main stage she dominated the first third of the debate and made her presence known immediately fiorina struck first on foreign policy and proved that she was informed and qualified to deal with foreign leaders she also showed intense debating talent by managing to seamlessly meld iran and pro life issues in one coherent response and finally fiorina closed out her dominating first hour performance by taking the high road after being asked to respond to donald trump s look at that face comment from last week rather than snark back at trump s own persona fiorina responded tactfully that women all over this country heard very clearly what mr trump said in what was likely the most viral moment of the night sen rand paul ky called out gov jeb bush fl for his past marijuana use yet reluctance to embrace medical or recreational marijuana legalization bush admitted to smoking weed and an argument over marijuana legalization ensued sorry mom sen marco rubio also had a decent performance sounding coherent and logical on immigration and immigration reform rubio highlighted the need for sensible immigration reform to fix the legal immigration system that no longer works and stressed the need for a merit based system new jersey gov chris christie was in rare form last night and was much livelier and focused than he was in the first debate christie defended pres bush s invasion of afghanistan citing his family s personal experience on september 11 2001 and his work as a prosecutor perhaps the most head scratching moment of the night came at the hands of dr ben carson and donald trump when carson a neurosurgeon was asked to basically tell trump to stop saying that vaccines cause autism they don t he essentially waffled and refused to straight up condemn trump s comments carson easily could have swept the floor with trump on this considering you know he s a doctor but he settled for a lame laugh line as katie wrote bush and gov scott walker didn t have much in the category of memorable lines but this tag team exchange defending george w bush s policies was a highlight the next debate will be held on october 28 alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
