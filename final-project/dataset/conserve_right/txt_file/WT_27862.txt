tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn the conservative house freedom caucus is home to president trump s most ardent fans but is not the trump caucus the group s new chairman declares rep andy biggs the arizona republican who was elected this month to take the reins of the group of sometimes defiant hard liners said its members are not afraid to buck mr trump as they did in opposing his attempt to repeal obamacare in 2017 we took a stand and said no this is a bad deal and we got the crap kicked out of us and the president wasn t happy with that mr biggs told the washington times in a wide ranging interview top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time though the freedom caucus has a reputation for rebelling against house republican leadership mr biggs said the president knows the group will support him when push comes to shove he pointed to the fact that his members rallied around the president during the campaign season and have been his staunchest defenders in committee hearings that democrats are using to investigate him on several fronts the president trusts us because he knows that we look for every opportunity to defend him i personally believe that is the right thing to do because you ve got 90 plus percent of republicans that approve of what he s doing he said so wherever we re in agreement we re going to fight and defend he added one of the ways the freedom caucus has supported mr trump is by defending the creative and lawsuit inducing ways he has attempted to circumvent congress and get the funds he needs to build his border wall despite strongly railing against such unilateral actions as president obama s creation of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program which granted amnesty to young illegal immigrants mr biggs said mr trump is within his rights to act unilaterally because congress has given up so much of its authority if we don t like it then what we need to do is say we re taking back that authority but we didn t take back the authority he said ok we don t like it congress you d better act like congress should some in washington have compared the right wing caucus to the group of four firebrand liberal congresswomen known as the squad and the associated congressional progressive caucus because of its reputation for unruly uprisings against party leaders mr biggs didn t agree with that comparison he said freedom caucus members rely on playing by the rules to fight for their priorities i think they re using a bully pulpit or something like that far more than we do he said but the far right caucus is closer to the president than to its chamber s leadership which it has irked on several occasions not only did freedom caucus members derail the obamacare fix but they also bucked party leaders in june 2018 on immigration reform they chided the leadership for not pushing for an enforcement heavy option though some of the more moderate members felt the caucus was moving the goal posts on negotiations there s a lot of traits and characteristics i admire of the freedom caucus sticking together but honesty is just not one of them then rep jeff denham california republican said on msnbc at the time last year rep jim jordan of ohio one of the founding members of the freedom caucus challenged rep kevin mccarthy california republican and the top lieutenant for speaker paul d ryan for leadership of the party caucus mr jordan argued that party leadership had failed to make good on its campaign promises now though mr biggs is looking to turn a corner with party leadership as he aims to ensure the freedom caucus gets a say in not just procedures but also policy advancement he said his relationship with mr mccarthy is under construction the republican leader agreed to have regular meetings leaving mr biggs hopeful and optimistic i m a big believer that to be successful you keep your principles he said you also realize that you form coalitions you work together where you can and so we ll see how this plays out part of that includes helping republicans rally together for the 2020 elections though the president is facing a primary challenge from a former freedom caucus member mark sanford mr biggs doubts mr trump has anything to worry about it s a gnat on the back of a water buffalo type of thing he said the president is not overly concerned with him mr biggs said you know mark s out there it s a chaotic type of effort i don t think it s going to do anything mr biggs agreed with his friend s focus on addressing fiscal issues such as the rising national debt but said it ultimately wouldn t be able to make a dent in the president s overwhelming popularity with the republican base because if you re a never trumper you re still going to be a never trumper and if you re a trumper you re going to be a trumper he said mr biggs cautioned against trusting the anti trump polling data and said republicans should focus on counting electoral votes rather than generic voters that s kind of what we were hearing last time in 2016 and it just didn t materialize he said as for the house mr biggs said he is confident republicans will win control in 2020 he said democrats two dozen seat majority is built on districts they won by a combined 95 000 votes last year republicans general plan is to zero in on 31 districts that the president won in 2016 13 of which were held by more than 6 percentage points republicans hope the president s popularity will help reverse the 2018 blue wave and help them secure the 19 seats t
