floyd death oklahoma bans quality of life health care rationing biden s middle class tax pledge glenn beck as the election of 2008 approached america was in crisis and as we would soon learn that crisis would not go to waste years after bill clinton disingenuously claimed that the era of big government was over obama won his party s nomination by promising its furious revenge for constitutional conservatives the republican contest functioned less like a primary and more like an abandonment politically orphaned by their party conservatives were forced to either stay home or hold their noses and vote for a progressive republican advertisement glenn beck as the election of 2008 approached america was in crisis and as we would soon learn that crisis would not go to waste years after bill clinton disingenuously claimed that the era of big government was over obama won his party s nomination by promising its furious revenge for constitutional conservatives the republican contest functioned less like a primary and more like an abandonment politically orphaned by their party conservatives were forced to either stay home or hold their noses and vote for a progressive republican there was a silver lining however rising out of the ashes of that electoral defeat came the tea party the media struggled to explain it away as racist xenophobic and jingoistic but the truth is the tea party did not arise because barack obama defeated his opposition it arose because there was no opposition over the years there have been endless fractures in the fa ade of individual freedom but three policies provided the fuel that lit the tea party fire the stimulus the auto bailouts and the bank bailouts barack obama supported all three so did donald trump advertisement over the years there have been endless fractures in the fa ade of individual freedom but three policies provided the fuel that lit the tea party fire the stimulus the auto bailouts and the bank bailouts barack obama supported all three so did donald trump while conservatives fought against the stimulus donald trump said it was what we need praising obama s schemes of building infrastructure building great projects putting people to work in that sense while conservatives fought against the auto bailouts donald trump claimed the government should stand behind the auto companies 100 percent because they make wonderful products while conservatives fought against the bank bailouts donald trump called them something that has to get done let his reasoning sink in for a second the government can take over companies and frankly take big chunks of companies when conservatives desperately needed allies in the fight against big government donald trump didn t stand on the sidelines he consistently advocated that your money be spent that your government grow and that your constitution be ignored sure trump s potential primary victory would provide hillary clinton with the easiest imaginable path to the white house but it s far worse than that if donald trump wins the republican nomination there will once again be no opposition to an ever expanding government this is a crisis for conservatism and once again this crisis will not go to waste advertisement glenn beck is a nationally syndicated radio host the founder of theblaze and a best selling author david boaz

transparent gossamer of false modesty and forget trying to determine whether he s a conservative given that at the suggestion of bill clinton he has like a tapeworm invaded the schismatically weakened body of the republican party it s a pointless question because like allah in islamic theology he is whatever he pleases to be at the moment the only principle being the triumph of his will all such

slightly interrupted by the reagan years the conservative president we desperately need requires a paradoxical combination of boldness and restraint the president will need to be bold in challenging the runaway power and reach of his own branch against the fury of the bureaucracy itself its client groups and the media this boldness is necessary to restore the restraint that a republican executive should have in our constitutional order trump exhibits no awareness of this supreme constitutional task his facially worthy challenge to political correctness is not a sufficient governing platform

fundamental portents of disaster usually pass unnoticed like obama he is astoundingly ignorant of everything that to govern a powerful complex influential and exceptional nation such as ours he would have to know i recall that30 or more years ago he said he could master the politics of the cold war nuclear strategy and arms control in two weeks the proof being that he had fixed the wollman ice skating rink evidently he didn t spare the time revealing in debate that he was clueless about the nuclear triad something that could be rather dangerous if the person always at his side with the briefcase of nuclear codes cuffed to his wrist were not a stolid military officer but britney spears or ozzy osbourne and don t count that out he doesn t know the constitution history law political philosophy nuclear strategy diplomacy defense economics beyond real estate or even despite his low level mafioso comportment how ordinary people live but trumping all this is a greater flaw presented as his chief strength governing a great nation in parlous times is far more than making deals compared with the weight of the office he seeks his deals are microscopic in scale and as he faced far deeper complexities he would lead the country into continual russian roulette if despite his poor judgment he could engage talented advisers as they presented him with contending and fateful options the buck would stop with a man who simply grasps anything that floats by following obama s a trump presidency would be yet more adventure tourism for a formerly serious republic mark helprin is a

donald trump is no conservative that s not a crime it s just a reason to vote against him many fine people are not conservatives but the reason trump s candidacy should worry the right runs much

that america s elites are weak and unwilling to put the interests of americans first have gained him a hearing from many on the right but when he gestures toward prescriptions trump reveals that even his diagnoses are not as sound as they might seem conservatives incline to take the weakness of our elite institutions as an argument for recovering constitutional principles and so for limiting the power of those institutions reversing their centralization of authority and recovering a vision of american life in which the chief purpose of the federal government is protective and not managerial trump on the contrary offers himself as the alternative to our weak and foolish leaders the guarantee of american superiority and the cure for all that ails our society and when pressed about how he will succeed in these ways his answer pretty much amounts to great management the appeal of trump s diagnoses should be instructive to conservatives but the shallow narcissism of his prescriptions is a warning american conservatism is an inherently skeptical political outlook it assumes that no one can be fully trusted with public power and that self government in a free society demands that we

donald trump is no conservative he s a populist whose theme is our government is broken and i ll fix it he s right on point one both parties have failed to lead obama and congressional democrats manipulate the levers of power to push america farther toward european socialism republicans promise free market alternatives but end up caving in to pressure or carrying water for the gop s own big government special interests the american people have signaled in recent elections that they ve had enough of business as usual and now they want to clean house yet trump is no better than what we already have he ll say anything to get a vote but give us more of the same if he gets into office trump beguiles us defies the politically correct media and bullies anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes none of that makes him a conservative who cherishes liberty for decades trump has argued for big government about health care he has said everybody s got to be covered and the government s going to pay for it he has called for boycotts of american companies he doesn t like told bureaucrats to use eminent domain to get him better deals on property he wanted to develop and proudly proposed the largest tax increase in american history trump has also promised to use tariffs to punish companies that incur his disfavor he offers grand plans for massive new spending but no

the president of the club for growth michael medved which dictionary definition of the word conservative as either an adjective or a noun applies comfortably to donald trump is he traditional in style or manner avoiding novelty or showiness please stifle your laughter does he count as cautiously moderate would he describe himself as an individual who is disposed to preserve existing conditions and institutions or to restore traditional ones and to limit change trump s defenders insist that his flashy shameless non conservative style will help win support for his views which are they say substantively conservative but where exactly do we find the conservative substance his much heralded hard line on immigration discards pragmatic reform policies favored by the two most popular conservatives of the last half century ronald reagan and george w bush building a yuuuuge wall along the southern border hardly qualifies as a cautiously moderate approach nor would uprooting 11 million current residents and presumably millions more of their american citizen children and spouses in the greatest forced migration in human history worst of all trump s brawling blustery mean spirited public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right according to conventional caricature conservatives are selfish greedy materialistic bullying misogynistic angry and intolerant they are we re told privileged and pampered elitists who revel in the advantages of inherited wealth while displaying only cruel contempt for the less fortunate and the less powerful the left tried to smear ronald reagan in such terms but failed miserably because he displayed none of the stereotypical traits in contrast trump is the living breathing bellowing personification of all the nasty characteristics democrats routinely ascribe to republicans and then there s the uncomfortable unavoidable issue of racism even those who take trump at his word accepting his declaration that he qualifies as the least racist individual in the nation can imagine the parade of negative ads the democrats are already preparing for radio stations with mainly black audiences and for spanish language television even if trump won a crushing majority of self described white voters he could hardly improve on romney s landslide victory 59 percent to 39 percent in that demographic group if trump becomes the nominee the gop is sure to lose the 2016 election but the problem is much larger will the republican party and the conservative movement survive if asians and latinos come to reject republican candidates as automatically and overwhelmingly as african americans do the party will lose all chance of capturing the presidency and inevitably it will face the disappearance of its congressional and gubernatorial majorities as well there is one sure strategy to pursue if the gop for some reason wishes to suffer such self inflicted wounds nominate a presidential candidate who exemplifies the most unpleasant and non conservative characteristics that the mainstream media and liberal pundits invoke to demonize the right michael medved hosts a daily radio talk show heard on more than 300 stations across the country edwin meese iii there are two tactical approaches for candidates seeking their party s nomination in election campaigns one is to strongly debate the issues and firmly advocate your positions but to avoid personal attacks on your opponents or needless divisiveness the other is to vigorously attack your fellow candidates disparaging them personally and seeking to raise yourself up by dragging them down ronald reagan was famous for epitomizing the former path donald trump unfortunately has chosen to follow the latter course when reagan first ran for governor of california in 1966 his party was deeply divided by past electoral conflicts to restore unity he adopted a new political rule which had been proposed by the party chairman the eleventh commandment thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican the goal was to avoid internecine warfare during the primary which could lead to defeat in the general election while contending for the nomination reagan showed respect for his primary opponent and even left open places in his campaign organization so that he could eventually include those party leaders who had initially opposed him the resulting coalition won the general election by an overwhelming margin reagan kept the eleventh commandment in his subsequent contests for the presidency and it was a unifying factor in his victories in the 1980s at the beginning of the current campaign for the republican presidential nomination it appeared that the party had one of the strongest arrays of candidates in many years successful governors senators business and professional leaders etc today however the political atmosphere is polluted by the vicious personal attacks that the republican contenders have unleashed against one another heading the attackers in both vigor and vitriol has been donald trump his broadsides can almost be predicted by the other candidates standing in the polls the result has been to divide and discourage potential republican party supporters questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run or that another cannot be elected or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign restoring economic growth strengthening national security eliminating cronyism and corruption and improving the lives of all americans at a time when the nation is suffering under one of the most divisive and incompetent presidents in history our people need positive unifying leadership not negative destructive political rhetoric edwin meese iii served in ronald reagan s gubernatorial and presidential administrations these views are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of any organization with which he is affiliated russell moore in 2009 the manhattan declaration led by chuck colson and robert p george reaffirmed the three primary goals of religious conservatives to protect all human life including that of the unborn to reinforce the sanctity of marriage and the family and to conserve the religious freedom of all persons all three goals would be in jeopardy under a trump presidency yes trump says that he is pro life now despite having supported partial birth abortion in the past the problem is not whether he can check a box pro life voters expect leaders to have a coherent vision of human dignity and to be able to defend against assaults on human life in the future some of which may be unimaginable today and will present themselves only as new technologies develop trump s supposed pro life conversion is rooted in nietzschean social darwinist terms he knew a child who was to be aborted who grew up to be a superstar beyond that trump s vitriolic and often racist and sexist language about immigrants women the disabled and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons not just the winners of the moment are created in god s image one also cannot help but look at the personal life of the billionaire it is not just that he has abandoned one wife after another for a younger woman or that he has boasted about having sex with some of the top women of the world it s that he says after all that that he has no need to seek forgiveness at the same time trump has made millions off a casino industry that as social conservatives have rightly argued not only exploits personal vice but destroys families one may say that trump s personal life and business dealings are irrelevant to his candidacy but conservatives have argued for generations that virtue matters in the citizenry and in the nation s leaders can conservatives really believe that if elected trump would care about protecting the family s place in society when his own life is unapologetically what conservatives used to recognize as decadent under withering assault in the obama years social conservatives have maintained consistent with the beliefs of the founders that religious freedom is a natural right not a matter of special pleading to be submitted to majority vote most americans do not agree with the little sisters of the poor on contraception and the sisters do not have a powerful lobby in washington this shouldn t matter trump s willingness to ban muslims even temporarily from entering the country simply because of their religious affiliation would make jefferson spin in his grave trump can win only in the sort of celebrity focused mobocracy that neil postman warned us about years ago in which sound moral judgments are displaced by a narcissistic pursuit of power combined with promises of winning for the masses social and religious conservatives have always seen this tendency as decadent and deviant for them to view it any other way now would be for them to lose their soul russell moore is the president of the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention and the author of onward engaging the culture without losing the gospel michael b mukasey for a hint of why a donald trump presidency would imperil our national security consider just a couple of trump s suggestions for protecting us against islamist terrorists he would start with a temporary ban on the entry of alien muslims into the united states until our leaders can figure out what the hell is going on this prescription overlooks that many people already have figured out precisely what the hell is going on that we face a supremacist movement based in islam that is intent on destroying western civilization and have intelligent suggestions for dealing with it moreover trump s proposal would assure the enmity of all muslims including those whose support we need if we are to prevail even assuming an infallible way to identify who is muslim the proposal is both under and over inclusive it is under inclusive because it does not address potential terrorists who have u s passports or residence permits or are already here or may threaten us abroad it is over inclusive because it bars the huge majority of muslims who are not potential terrorists trump says he would order the military to kill the families of terrorists that would be a direct violation of the most basic laws of armed conflict which require that deadly force be used only when required by military necessity under circumstances that allow distinction between military and civilian targets and when incidental damage to non military targets is proportional to the military advantage gained a military that adhered to the laws of armed conflict would necessarily disobey such an order if it followed the order both the person who gave it and those who followed it would be subject to prosecution for war crimes we have already suffered seven years of feckless leadership that has invited the contempt of our enemies and the distrust of our friends we remain the world s strongest power and can recover but to inspire the respect that creates fear and trust when and where each is necessary we will need a president who summons our strength with a reality based strategic vision not one who summons applause with tantrums and homicidal fantasies michael b mukasey served as u s attorney general from 2007 to 2009 and as a u s district judge from 1988 to 2006 he has advised the jeb bush campaign on national security issues katie pavlich given the high stakes both at home and abroad america cannot afford to elect a man who is not rooted in conservatism and donald trump a political con man who sympathizes with hit man vladimir putin and republicans such as charlie crist manifestly is not trump has made a living out of preying on and bullying society s most vulnerable with the help of government he isn t an outsider but rather an unelected politician of the worst kind he admits that he s bought off elected officials in order to get his way and that he has openly abused the system the rabid defense he gets from some quarters is astonishing trump s liberal positions aren t in the distant past he has openly promoted them on the campaign trail trump isn t fighting for anyone but himself which has been his pattern for decades conservatives have a serious decision to make do we truly believe in our long held principles and insist that politicians have records demonstrating fealty to them or are we willing to throw these principles away because an entertainer who has been a liberal democrat for decades simply says some of the right things in short do our principles still matter a vote for trump indicates the answer is no katie pavlich is the editor of townhall and a best selling author john podhoretz donald trump is the apotheosis of a tendency that began to manifest itself in american culture in the 1980s most notably in the persons of the comic andrew dice clay and the shock jock howard stern the american id guys like the dice man and stern had been told and taught and trained by respectable middlebrow culture to believe that their tastes and desires were piggish and thuggish and gross and they said so be it clay filled stadiums across the country with young men who chanted dirty nursery rhymes along with him stern invited young actresses onto his show to discuss their breasts the screams of outrage that greeted them were part of the act clay had nowhere to go with his shtick after a few years and faded away stern adapted to changing circumstances but the american id remained as ids do you want to call me a goon fine so i ll act like a goon see how you like it the cultural signposts trump brandished in the years preceding his presidential bid are all manifestations of the american id his steak business his casino business his green marble and chrome architecture his love life minutely detailed in the columns of cindy adams his involvement with vince mcmahon s wrestling empire and his reality tv persona as the immensely rich guy who treats people like garbage but has no fancy airs this id found its truest voice in his repellent assertion that the first black president needed to prove to trump s satisfaction that he was actually an american in any integrated personality the id is supposed to be balanced by an ego and a superego by a sense of self that gravitates toward behaving in a mature and responsible way when it comes to serious matters and failing that has a sense of shame about transgressing norms and common decencies trump is an unbalanced force he is the politicized american id should his election results match his polls he would be unquestionably the worst thing to happen to the american common culture in my lifetime john podhoretz is the editor of commentary r r reno trump has always been trump his public pronouncements over the last few decades give no evidence of consistent or coherent political views by comparison hillary clinton is a principled public figure he made noises about running in 2000 and was serious in 2012 but the talk went nowhere when he declared in 2015 we laughed again donald trump absurd boy were we wrong i suppose we should have known better the republican party has become home to a growing number of americans who want to burn down our political and economic systems and hang our cultural elites they re tired of being policed by political correctness often with the complicity of supposed conservatives they don t like republican candidates who denounce them as takers with no future in the global economy and they suspect rightly that the chamber of commerce will sell them down the river if it adds to the bottom line all true but it s sad that this frustrated cohort now fixes on trump as its savior he presents himself as a strong man who promises to knock heads and make things right again in this he has a lot more in common with south american populist demagogues than with our tradition of political leaders but i suppose that s the reason for his popularity the middle class consensus in america has collapsed this is the most important political and social earthquake since world war ii the conservative movement s leadership isn t up to the challenge and a good number of voters are willing to gamble on trump s bluster bad bet our nation s solidarity is being tested it will only make things worse if we go trumpster diving r r reno is the editor of first things thomas sowell in a country with more than 300 million people it is remarkable how obsessed the media have become with just one donald trump what is even more remarkable is that after seven years of repeated disasters both domestically and internationally under a glib egomaniac in the white house so many potential voters are turning to another glib egomaniac to be his successor no doubt much of the stampede of republican voters toward mr trump is based on their disgust with the republican establishment it is easy to understand why there would be pent up resentments among republican voters but are elections held for the purpose of venting emotions no national leader ever aroused more fervent emotions than adolf hitler did in the 1930s watch some old newsreels of german crowds delirious with joy at the sight of him the only things at all comparable in more recent times were the ecstatic crowds that greeted barack obama when he burst upon the political scene in 2008 elections however have far more lasting and far more serious or even grim consequences than emotional venting the actual track record of crowd pleasers whether juan per n in argentina obama in america or hitler in germany is very sobering if not painfully depressing after the disastrous nuclear deal with iran we are entering an era when people alive at this moment may live to see a day when american cities are left in radioactive ruins we need all the wisdom courage and dedication in the next president and his or her successors to save ourselves and our children from such a catastrophe a shoot from the hip belligerent show off is the last thing we need or can afford thomas sowell is a senior fellow at the hoover institution stanford university cal thomas i wanted to like donald trump much as i wanted to like richard nixon s vice president spiro agnew both men have said many things with which i agree agnew attacked media bias and trump attacks the establishment s failure to make america great as he nonspecifically puts it but a proper diagnosis does not equal competence in administering a cure if i developed a brain tumor i would want ben carson to operate on me but do i want donald trump operating on america everyone has a temperament the dictionary defines it as the combination of mental physical and emotional traits of a person would trump s combination make him a good president i think not i once compared trump to lonesome rhodes the character played by andy griffith in the 1957 film a face in the crowd trump might also be compared to elmer gantry the fictional evangelist who used religion to mask his dark side on january 13 trump spoke to a packed convention center in pensacola fla while he made many good points especially when it came to uncontrolled immigration he was rambling and unfocused he spent time criticizing his poor quality microphone and said he wasn t going to pay for it a far cry from ronald reagan s i am paying for this microphone line during the 1980 new hampshire primary campaign which conveyed strength not petulance in pensacola trump again drew wild applause when he repeated his promise to build a wall along the mexican border and make mexico pay for it the wall keeps getting higher as the story gets older he never says how he will force mexico to pay anger is not policy trump channels a lot of the righteous and some of the unrighteous anger of voters and sees the solution as himself isn t a narcissist what we currently have in the white house comments cal thomas is a

strength with a reality based strategic vision not one who summons applause with tantrums and homicidal fantasies michael b mukasey served as u s attorney general from 2007 to 2009 and as a u s district judge from 1988 to 2006 he has advised the jeb bush campaign on national security issues katie pavlich given the high stakes both at home and abroad america cannot afford to elect a man who is not rooted in conservatism and donald trump a political con man who sympathizes with hit man vladimir putin and republicans such as charlie crist manifestly is not trump has made a living out of preying on and bullying society s most vulnerable with the help of government he isn t an outsider but rather an unelected politician of the worst kind he admits that he s bought off elected officials in order to get his way and that he has openly abused the system the rabid defense he gets from some quarters is astonishing trump s liberal positions aren t in the distant past he has openly promoted them on the campaign trail trump isn t fighting for anyone but himself which has been his pattern for decades conservatives have a serious decision to make do we truly believe in our long held principles and insist that politicians have records demonstrating fealty to them or are we willing to throw these principles away because an entertainer who has been a liberal democrat for decades simply says some of the right things in short do our principles still matter a vote for trump indicates the answer is no katie pavlich is the editor of townhall and a best selling author john podhoretz donald trump is the apotheosis of a tendency that began to manifest itself in american culture in the 1980s most notably in the persons of the comic andrew dice clay and the shock jock howard stern the american id guys like the dice man and stern had been told and taught and trained by respectable middlebrow culture to believe that their tastes and desires were piggish and thuggish and gross and they said so be it clay filled stadiums across the country with young men who chanted dirty nursery rhymes along with him stern invited young actresses onto his show to discuss their breasts the screams of outrage that greeted them were part of the act clay had nowhere to go with his shtick after a few years and faded away stern adapted to changing circumstances but the american id remained as ids do you want to call me a goon fine so i ll act like a goon see how you like it the cultural signposts trump brandished in the years preceding his presidential bid are all manifestations of the american id his steak business his casino business his green marble and chrome architecture his love life minutely detailed in the columns of cindy adams his involvement with vince mcmahon s wrestling empire and his reality tv persona as the immensely rich guy who treats people like garbage but has no fancy airs this id found its truest voice in his repellent assertion that the first black president needed to prove to trump s satisfaction that he was actually an american in any integrated personality the id is supposed to be balanced by an ego and a superego by a sense of self that gravitates toward behaving in a mature and responsible way when it comes to serious matters and failing that has a sense of shame about transgressing norms and common decencies trump is an unbalanced force he is the politicized american id should his election results match his polls he would be unquestionably the worst thing to happen to the american common culture in my lifetime john podhoretz is the editor of commentary r r reno trump has always been trump his public pronouncements over the last few decades give no evidence of consistent or coherent political views by comparison hillary clinton is a principled public figure he made noises about running in 2000 and was serious in 2012 but the talk went nowhere when he declared in 2015 we laughed again donald trump absurd boy were we wrong i suppose we should have known better the republican party has become home to a growing number of americans who want to burn down our political and economic systems and hang our cultural elites they re tired of being policed by political correctness often with the complicity of supposed conservatives they don t like republican candidates who denounce them as takers with no future in the global economy and they suspect rightly that the chamber of commerce will sell them down the river if it adds to the bottom line all true but it s sad that this frustrated cohort now fixes on trump as its savior he presents himself as a strong man who promises to knock heads and make things right again in this he has a lot more in common with south american populist demagogues than with our tradition of political leaders but i suppose that s the reason for his popularity the middle class consensus in america has collapsed this is the most important political and social earthquake since world war ii the conservative movement s leadership isn t up to the challenge and a good number of voters are willing to gamble on trump s bluster bad bet our nation s solidarity is being tested it will only make things worse if we go trumpster diving r r reno is the editor of first things thomas sowell in a country with more than 300 million people it is remarkable how obsessed the media have become with just one donald trump what is even more remarkable is that after seven years of repeated disasters both domestically and internationally under a glib egomaniac in the white house so many potential voters are turning to another glib egomaniac to be his successor no doubt much of the stampede of republican voters toward mr trump is based on their disgust with the republican establishment it is easy to understand why there would be pent up resentments among republican voters but are elections held for the purpose of venting emotions no national leader ever aroused more fervent emotions than adolf hitler did in the 1930s watch some old newsreels of german crowds delirious with joy at the sight of him the only things at all comparable in more recent times were the ecstatic crowds that greeted barack obama when he burst upon the political scene in 2008 elections however have far more lasting and far more serious or even grim consequences than emotional venting the actual track record of crowd pleasers whether juan per n in argentina obama in america or hitler in germany is very sobering if not painfully depressing after the disastrous nuclear deal with iran we are entering an era when people alive at this moment may live to see a day when american cities are left in radioactive ruins we need all the wisdom courage and dedication in the next president and his or her successors to save ourselves and our children from such a catastrophe a shoot from the hip belligerent show off is the last thing we need or can afford thomas sowell is a senior fellow at the hoover institution stanford university cal thomas i wanted to like donald trump much as i wanted to like richard nixon s vice president spiro agnew both men have said many things with which i agree agnew attacked media bias and trump attacks the establishment s failure to make america great as he nonspecifically puts it but a proper diagnosis does not equal competence in administering a cure if i developed a brain tumor i would want ben carson to operate on me but do i want donald trump operating on america everyone has a temperament the dictionary defines it as the combination of mental physical and emotional traits of a person would trump s combination make him a good president i think not i once compared trump to lonesome rhodes the character played by andy griffith in the 1957 film a face in the crowd trump might also be compared to elmer gantry the fictional evangelist who used religion to mask his dark side on january 13 trump spoke to a packed convention center in pensacola fla while he made many good points especially when it came to uncontrolled immigration he was rambling and unfocused he spent time criticizing his poor quality microphone and said he wasn t going to pay for it a far cry from ronald reagan s i am paying for this microphone line during the 1980 new hampshire primary campaign which conveyed strength not petulance in pensacola trump again drew wild applause when he repeated his promise to build a wall along the mexican border and make mexico pay for it the wall keeps getting higher as the story gets older he never says how he will force mexico to pay anger is not policy trump channels a lot of the righteous and some of the unrighteous anger of voters and sees the solution as himself isn t a narcissist what we currently have in the white house comments cal thomas is a nationally syndicated usa today columnist and a fox news contributor comments david mcintosh donald trump is no conservative he s a populist whose theme is our government is broken and i ll fix it he s right on point one both parties have failed to lead obama and congressional democrats manipulate the levers of power to push america farther toward european socialism republicans promise free market alternatives but end up caving in to pressure or carrying water for the gop s own big government special interests the american people have signaled in recent elections that they ve had enough of business as usual and now they want to clean house yet trump is no better than what we already have he ll say anything to get a vote but give us more of the same if he gets into office trump beguiles us defies the politically correct media and bullies anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes none of that makes him a conservative who cherishes liberty for decades trump has argued for big government about health care he has said everybody s got to be covered and the government s going to pay for it he has called for boycotts of american companies he doesn t like told bureaucrats to use eminent domain to get him better deals on property he wanted to develop and proudly proposed the largest tax increase in american history trump has also promised to use tariffs to punish companies that incur his disfavor he offers grand plans for massive new spending but no serious proposals for spending cuts or entitlement reforms these are not the ideas of a small government conservative who understands markets they are instead the ramblings of a liberal wannabe strongman who will use and abuse the power of the federal government to impose his ideas on the country my old boss ronald reagan once said the founding fathers knew a government can t control the economy without controlling people reagan fought for economic freedom for reining in government so the private sector could thrive that s economic conservatism it is not donald trump david mcintosh is the president of the club for growth michael medved which dictionary definition of the word conservative as either an adjective or a noun applies comfortably to donald trump is he traditional in style or manner avoiding novelty or showiness please stifle your laughter does he count as cautiously moderate would he describe himself as an individual who is disposed to preserve existing conditions and institutions or to restore traditional ones and to limit change trump s defenders insist that his flashy shameless non conservative style will help win support for his views which are they say substantively conservative but where exactly do we find the conservative substance his much heralded hard line on immigration discards pragmatic reform policies favored by the two most popular conservatives of the last half century ronald reagan and george w bush building a yuuuuge wall along the southern border hardly qualifies as a cautiously moderate approach nor would uprooting 11 million current residents and presumably millions more of their american citizen children and spouses in the greatest forced migration in human history worst of all trump s brawling blustery mean spirited public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right according to conventional caricature conservatives are selfish greedy materialistic bullying misogynistic angry and intolerant they are we re told privileged and pampered elitists who revel in the advantages of inherited wealth while displaying only cruel contempt for the less fortunate and the less powerful the left tried to smear ronald reagan in such terms but failed miserably because he displayed none of the stereotypical traits in contrast trump is the living breathing bellowing personification of all the nasty characteristics democrats routinely ascribe to republicans and then there s the uncomfortable unavoidable issue of racism even those who take trump at his word accepting his declaration that he qualifies as the least racist individual in the nation can imagine the parade of negative ads the democrats are already preparing for radio stations with mainly black audiences and for spanish language television even if trump won a crushing majority of self described white voters he could hardly improve on romney s landslide victory 59 percent to 39 percent in that demographic group if trump becomes the nominee the gop is sure to lose the 2016 election but the problem is much larger will the republican party and the conservative movement survive if asians and latinos come to reject republican candidates as automatically and overwhelmingly as african americans do the party will lose all chance of capturing the presidency and inevitably it will face the disappearance of its congressional and gubernatorial majorities as well there is one sure strategy to pursue if the gop for some reason wishes to suffer such self inflicted wounds nominate a presidential candidate who exemplifies the most unpleasant and non conservative characteristics that the mainstream media and liberal pundits invoke to demonize the right michael medved hosts a daily radio talk show heard on more than 300 stations across the country edwin meese iii there are two tactical approaches for candidates seeking their party s nomination in election campaigns one is to strongly debate the issues and firmly advocate your positions but to avoid personal attacks on your opponents or needless divisiveness the other is to vigorously attack your fellow candidates disparaging them personally and seeking to raise yourself up by dragging them down ronald reagan was famous for epitomizing the former path donald trump unfortunately has chosen to follow the latter course when reagan first ran for governor of california in 1966 his party was deeply divided by past electoral conflicts to restore unity he adopted a new political rule which had been proposed by the party chairman the eleventh commandment thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican the goal was to avoid internecine warfare during the primary which could lead to defeat in the general election while contending for the nomination reagan showed respect for his primary opponent and even left open places in his campaign organization so that he could eventually include those party leaders who had initially opposed him the resulting coalition won the general election by an overwhelming margin reagan kept the eleventh commandment in his subsequent contests for the presidency and it was a unifying factor in his victories in the 1980s at the beginning of the current campaign for the republican presidential nomination it appeared that the party had one of the strongest arrays of candidates in many years successful governors senators business and professional leaders etc today however the political atmosphere is polluted by the vicious personal attacks that the republican contenders have unleashed against one another heading the attackers in both vigor and vitriol has been donald trump his broadsides can almost be predicted by the other candidates standing in the polls the result has been to divide and discourage potential republican party supporters questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run or that another cannot be elected or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign restoring economic growth strengthening national security eliminating cronyism and corruption and improving the lives of all americans at a time when the nation is suffering under one of the most divisive and incompetent presidents in history our people need positive unifying leadership not negative destructive political rhetoric edwin meese iii served in ronald reagan s gubernatorial and presidential administrations these views are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of any organization with which he is affiliated russell moore in 2009 the manhattan declaration led by chuck colson and robert p george reaffirmed the three primary goals of religious conservatives to protect all human life including that of the unborn to reinforce the sanctity of marriage and the family and to conserve the religious freedom of all persons all three goals would be in jeopardy under a trump presidency yes trump says that he is pro life now despite having supported partial birth abortion in the past the problem is not whether he can check a box pro life voters expect leaders to have a coherent vision of human dignity and to be able to defend against assaults on human life in the future some of which may be unimaginable today and will present themselves only as new technologies develop trump s supposed pro life conversion is rooted in nietzschean social darwinist terms he knew a child who was to be aborted who grew up to be a superstar beyond that trump s vitriolic and often racist and sexist language about immigrants women the disabled and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons not just the winners of the moment are created in god s image one also cannot help but look at the personal life of the billionaire it is not just that he has abandoned one wife after another for a younger woman or that he has boasted about having sex with some of the top women of the world it s that he says after all that that he has no need to seek forgiveness at the same time trump has made millions off a casino industry that as social conservatives have rightly argued not only exploits personal vice but destroys families one may say that trump s personal life and business dealings are irrelevant to his candidacy but conservatives have argued for generations that virtue matters in the citizenry and in the nation s leaders can conservatives really believe that if elected trump would care about protecting the family s place in society when his own life is unapologetically what conservatives used to recognize as decadent under withering assault in the obama years social conservatives have maintained consistent with the beliefs of the founders that religious freedom is a natural right not a matter of special pleading to be submitted to majority vote most americans do not agree with the little sisters of the poor on contraception and the sisters do not have a powerful lobby in washington this shouldn t matter trump s willingness to ban muslims even temporarily from entering the country simply because of their religious affiliation would make jefferson spin in his grave trump can win only in the sort of celebrity focused mobocracy that neil postman warned us about years ago in which sound moral judgments are displaced by a narcissistic pursuit of power combined with promises of winning for the masses social and religious conservatives have always seen this tendency as decadent and deviant for them to view it any other way now would be for them to lose their soul russell moore is the president of the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention and the author of onward engaging the culture without losing the gospel michael b mukasey for a hint of why a donald trump presidency would imperil our national security consider just a couple of trump s suggestions for protecting us against islamist terrorists he would start with a temporary ban on the entry of alien muslims into the united states until our leaders can figure out what the hell is going on this prescription overlooks that many people already have figured out precisely what the hell is going on that we face a supremacist movement based in islam that is intent on destroying western civilization and have intelligent suggestions for dealing with it moreover trump s proposal would assure the enmity of all muslims including those whose support we need if we are to prevail even assuming an infallible way to identify who is muslim the proposal is both under and over inclusive it is under inclusive because it does not address potential terrorists who have u s passports or residence permits or are already here or may threaten us abroad it is over inclusive because it bars the huge majority of muslims who are not potential terrorists trump says he would order the military to kill the families of terrorists that would be a direct violation of the most basic laws of armed conflict which require that deadly force be used only when required by military necessity under circumstances that allow distinction between military and civilian targets and when incidental damage to non military targets is proportional to the military advantage gained a military that adhered to the laws of armed conflict would necessarily disobey such an order if it followed the order both the person who gave it and those who followed it would be subject to prosecution for war

even assuming an infallible way to identify who is muslim the proposal is both under and over inclusive it is under inclusive because it does not address potential terrorists who have u s passports or residence permits or are already here or may threaten us abroad it is over inclusive because it bars the huge majority of muslims who are not potential terrorists trump says he would order the military to kill the families of terrorists that would be a direct violation of the most basic laws of armed conflict which require that deadly force be used only when required by military necessity under circumstances that allow distinction between military and civilian targets and when incidental damage to non military targets is proportional to the military advantage gained a military that adhered to the laws of armed conflict would necessarily disobey such an order if it followed the order both the person who gave it and those who followed it would be subject to prosecution for war crimes we have already suffered seven years of feckless leadership that has invited the contempt of our enemies and the distrust of our friends we remain the world s strongest power and can recover but to inspire the respect that creates fear and trust when and where each is necessary we will need a president who summons our strength with a reality based strategic vision not one who summons applause with tantrums and homicidal fantasies michael b mukasey served as u s attorney general from 2007 to 2009 and as a u s district judge from 1988 to 2006 he has advised the jeb bush campaign on national security issues katie pavlich given the high stakes both at home and abroad america cannot afford to elect a man who is not rooted in conservatism and donald trump a political con man who sympathizes with hit man vladimir putin and republicans such as charlie crist manifestly is not trump has made a living out of preying on and bullying society s most vulnerable with the help of government he isn t an outsider but rather an unelected politician of the worst kind he admits that he s bought off elected officials in order to get his way and that he has openly abused the system the rabid defense he gets from some quarters is astonishing trump s liberal positions aren t in the distant past he has openly promoted them on the campaign trail trump isn t fighting for anyone but himself which has been his pattern for decades conservatives have a serious decision to make do we truly believe in our long held principles and insist that politicians have records demonstrating fealty to them or are we willing to throw these principles away because an entertainer who has been a liberal democrat for decades simply says some of the right things in short do our principles still matter a vote for trump indicates the answer is no katie pavlich is the editor of townhall and a best selling author john podhoretz donald trump is the apotheosis of a tendency that began to manifest itself in american culture in the 1980s most notably in the persons of the comic andrew dice clay and the shock jock howard stern the american id guys like the dice man and stern had been told and taught and trained by respectable middlebrow culture to believe that their tastes and desires were piggish and thuggish and gross and they said so be it clay filled stadiums across the country with young men who chanted dirty nursery rhymes along with him stern invited young actresses onto his show to discuss their breasts the screams of outrage that greeted them were part of the act clay had nowhere to go with his shtick after a few years and faded away stern adapted to changing circumstances but the american id remained as ids do you want to call me a goon fine so i ll act like a goon see how you like it the cultural signposts trump brandished in the years preceding his presidential bid are all manifestations of the american id his steak business his casino business his green marble and chrome architecture his love life minutely detailed in the columns of cindy adams his involvement with vince mcmahon s wrestling empire and his reality tv persona as the immensely rich guy who treats people like garbage but has no fancy airs this id found its truest voice in his repellent assertion that the first black president needed to prove to trump s satisfaction that he was actually an american in any integrated personality the id is supposed to be balanced by an ego and a superego by a sense of self that gravitates toward behaving in a mature and responsible way when it comes to serious matters and failing that has a sense of shame about transgressing norms and common decencies trump is an unbalanced force he is the politicized american id should his election results match his polls he would be unquestionably the worst thing to happen to the american common culture in my lifetime john podhoretz is the editor of commentary r r reno trump has always been trump his public pronouncements over the last few decades give no evidence of consistent or coherent political views by comparison hillary clinton is a principled public figure he made noises about running in 2000 and was serious in 2012 but the talk went nowhere when he declared in 2015 we laughed again donald trump absurd boy were we wrong i suppose we should have known better the republican party has become home to a growing number of americans who want to burn down our political and economic systems and hang our cultural elites they re tired of being policed by political correctness often with the complicity of supposed conservatives they don t like republican candidates who denounce them as takers with no future in the global economy and they suspect rightly that the chamber of commerce will sell them down the river if it adds to the bottom line all true but it s sad that this frustrated cohort now fixes on trump as its savior he presents himself as a strong man who promises to knock heads and make things right again in this he has a lot more in common with south american populist demagogues than with our tradition of political leaders but i suppose that s the reason for his popularity the middle class consensus in america has collapsed this is the most important political and social earthquake since world war ii the conservative movement s leadership isn t up to the challenge and a good number of voters are willing to gamble on trump s bluster bad bet our nation s solidarity is being tested it will only make things worse if we go trumpster diving r r reno is the editor of first things thomas sowell in a country with more than 300 million people it is remarkable how obsessed the media have become with just one donald trump what is even more remarkable is that after seven years of repeated disasters both domestically and internationally under a glib egomaniac in the white house so many potential voters are turning to another glib egomaniac to be his successor no doubt much of the stampede of republican voters toward mr trump is based on their disgust with the republican establishment it is easy to understand why there would be pent up resentments among republican voters but are elections held for the purpose of venting emotions no national leader ever aroused more fervent emotions than adolf hitler did in the 1930s watch some old newsreels of german crowds delirious with joy at the sight of him the only things at all comparable in more recent times were the ecstatic crowds that greeted barack obama when he burst upon the political scene in 2008 elections however have far more lasting and far more serious or even grim consequences than emotional venting the actual track record of crowd pleasers whether juan per n in argentina obama in america or hitler in germany is very sobering if not painfully depressing after the disastrous nuclear deal with iran we are entering an era when people alive at this moment may live to see a day when american cities are left in radioactive ruins we need all the wisdom courage and dedication in the next president and his or her successors to save ourselves and our children from such a catastrophe a shoot from the hip belligerent show off is the last thing we need or can afford thomas sowell is a senior fellow at the hoover institution stanford university cal thomas i wanted to like donald trump much as i wanted to like richard nixon s vice president spiro agnew both men have said many things with which i agree agnew attacked media bias and trump attacks the establishment s failure to make america great as he nonspecifically puts it but a proper diagnosis does not equal competence in administering a cure if i developed a brain tumor i would want ben carson to operate on me but do i want donald trump operating on america everyone has a temperament the dictionary defines it as the combination of mental physical and emotional traits of a person would trump s combination make him a good president i think not i once compared trump to lonesome rhodes the character played by andy griffith in the 1957 film a face in the crowd trump might also be compared to elmer gantry the fictional evangelist who used religion to mask his dark side on january 13 trump spoke to a packed convention center in pensacola fla while he made many good points especially when it came to uncontrolled immigration he was rambling and unfocused he spent time criticizing his poor quality microphone and said he wasn t going to pay for it a far cry from ronald reagan s i am paying for this microphone line during the 1980 new hampshire primary campaign which conveyed strength not petulance in pensacola trump again drew wild applause when he repeated his promise to build a wall along the mexican border and make mexico pay for it the wall keeps getting higher as the story gets older he never says how he will force mexico to pay anger is not policy trump channels a lot of the righteous and some of the unrighteous anger of voters and sees the solution as himself isn t a narcissist what we currently have in the white house comments cal thomas is a nationally syndicated usa today columnist and a fox news contributor comments david mcintosh is the president of the club for growth michael medved which dictionary definition of the word conservative as either an adjective or a noun applies comfortably to donald trump is he traditional in style or manner avoiding novelty or showiness please stifle your laughter does he count as cautiously moderate would he describe himself as an individual who is disposed to preserve existing conditions and institutions or to restore traditional ones and to limit change trump s defenders insist that his flashy shameless non conservative style will help win support for his views which are they say substantively conservative but where exactly do we find the conservative substance his much heralded hard line on immigration discards pragmatic reform policies favored by the two most popular conservatives of the last half century ronald reagan and george w bush building a yuuuuge wall along the southern border hardly qualifies as a cautiously moderate approach nor would uprooting 11 million current residents and presumably millions more of their american citizen children and spouses in the greatest forced migration in human history worst of all trump s brawling blustery mean spirited public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right according to conventional caricature conservatives are selfish greedy materialistic bullying misogynistic angry and intolerant they are we re told privileged and pampered elitists who revel in the advantages of inherited wealth while displaying only cruel contempt for the less fortunate and the less powerful the left tried to smear ronald reagan in such terms but failed miserably because he displayed none of the stereotypical traits in contrast trump is the living breathing bellowing personification of all the nasty characteristics democrats routinely ascribe to republicans and then there s the uncomfortable unavoidable issue of racism even those who take trump at his word accepting his declaration that he qualifies as the least racist individual in the nation can imagine the parade of negative ads the democrats are already preparing for radio stations with mainly black audiences and for spanish language television even if trump won a crushing majority of self described white voters he could hardly improve on romney s landslide victory 59 percent to 39 percent in that demographic group if trump becomes the nominee the gop is sure to lose the 2016 election but the problem is much larger will the republican party and the conservative movement survive if asians and latinos come to reject republican candidates as automatically and overwhelmingly as african americans do the party will lose all chance of capturing the presidency and inevitably it will face the disappearance of its congressional and gubernatorial majorities as well there is one sure strategy to pursue if the gop for some reason wishes to suffer such self inflicted wounds nominate a presidential candidate who exemplifies the most unpleasant and non conservative characteristics that the mainstream media and liberal pundits invoke to demonize the right michael medved hosts a daily radio talk show heard on more than 300 stations across the country edwin meese iii there are two tactical approaches for candidates seeking their party s nomination in election campaigns one is to strongly debate the issues and firmly advocate your positions but to avoid personal attacks on your opponents or needless divisiveness the other is to vigorously attack your fellow candidates disparaging them personally and seeking to raise yourself up by dragging them down ronald reagan was famous for epitomizing the former path donald trump unfortunately has chosen to follow the latter course when reagan first ran for governor of california in 1966 his party was deeply divided by past electoral conflicts to restore unity he adopted a new political rule which had been proposed by the party chairman the eleventh commandment thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican the goal was to avoid internecine warfare during the primary which could lead to defeat in the general election while contending for the nomination reagan showed respect for his primary opponent and even left open places in his campaign organization so that he could eventually include those party leaders who had initially opposed him the resulting coalition won the general election by an overwhelming margin reagan kept the eleventh commandment in his subsequent contests for the presidency and it was a unifying factor in his victories in the 1980s at the beginning of the current campaign for the republican presidential nomination it appeared that the party had one of the strongest arrays of candidates in many years successful governors senators business and professional leaders etc today however the political atmosphere is polluted by the vicious personal attacks that the republican contenders have unleashed against one another heading the attackers in both vigor and vitriol has been donald trump his broadsides can almost be predicted by the other candidates standing in the polls the result has been to divide and discourage potential republican party supporters questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run or that another cannot be elected or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign restoring economic growth strengthening national security eliminating cronyism and corruption and improving the lives of all americans at a time when the nation is suffering under one of the most divisive and incompetent presidents in history our people need positive unifying leadership not negative destructive political rhetoric edwin meese iii served in ronald reagan s gubernatorial and presidential administrations these views are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of any organization with which he is affiliated russell moore in 2009 the manhattan declaration led by chuck colson and robert p george reaffirmed the three primary goals of religious conservatives to protect all human life including that of the unborn to reinforce the sanctity of marriage and the family and to conserve the religious freedom of all persons all three goals would be in jeopardy under a trump presidency yes trump says that he is pro life now despite having supported partial birth abortion in the past the problem is not whether he can check a box pro life voters expect leaders to have a coherent vision of human dignity and to be able to defend against assaults on human life in the future some of which may be unimaginable today and will present themselves only as new technologies develop trump s supposed pro life conversion is rooted in nietzschean social darwinist terms he knew a child who was to be aborted who grew up to be a superstar beyond that trump s vitriolic and often racist and sexist language about immigrants women the disabled and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons not just the winners of the moment are created in god s image one also cannot help but look at the personal life of the billionaire it is not just that he has abandoned one wife after another for a younger woman or that he has boasted about having sex with some of the top women of the world it s that he says after all that that he has no need to seek forgiveness at the same time trump has made millions off a casino industry that as social conservatives have rightly argued not only exploits personal vice but destroys families one may say that trump s personal life and business dealings are irrelevant to his candidacy but conservatives have argued for generations that virtue matters in the citizenry and in the nation s leaders can conservatives really believe that if elected trump would care about protecting the family s place in society when his own life is unapologetically what conservatives used to recognize as decadent under withering assault in the obama years social conservatives have maintained consistent with the beliefs of the founders that religious freedom is a natural right not a matter of special pleading to be submitted to majority vote most americans do not agree with the little sisters of the poor on contraception and the sisters do not have a powerful lobby in washington this shouldn t matter trump s willingness to ban muslims even temporarily from entering the country simply because of their religious affiliation would make jefferson spin in his grave trump can win only in the sort of celebrity focused mobocracy that neil postman warned us about years ago in which sound moral judgments are displaced by a narcissistic pursuit of power combined with promises of winning for the masses social and religious conservatives have always seen this tendency as decadent and deviant for them to view it any other way now would be for them to lose their soul russell moore is the president of the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention and the author of onward engaging the culture without losing the gospel michael b mukasey for a hint of why a donald trump presidency would imperil our national security consider just a couple of trump s suggestions for protecting us against islamist terrorists he would start with a temporary ban on the entry of alien muslims into the united states until our leaders can figure out what the hell is going on this prescription overlooks that many people already have figured out precisely what the hell is going on that we face a supremacist movement based in islam that is intent on destroying western civilization and have intelligent suggestions for dealing with it moreover trump s proposal would

the rabid defense he gets from some quarters is astonishing trump s liberal positions aren t in the distant past he has openly promoted them on the campaign trail trump isn t fighting for anyone but himself which has been his pattern for decades conservatives have a serious decision to make do we truly believe in our long held principles and insist that politicians have records demonstrating fealty to them or are we willing to throw these principles away because an entertainer who has been a liberal democrat for decades simply says some of the right things in short do our principles still matter a vote for trump indicates the answer is no katie pavlich is the editor of townhall and a best selling author john podhoretz donald trump is the apotheosis of a tendency that began to manifest itself in american culture in the 1980s most notably in the persons of the comic andrew dice clay and the shock jock howard stern the american id guys like the dice man and stern had been told and taught and trained by respectable middlebrow culture to believe that their tastes and desires were piggish and thuggish and gross and they said so be it clay filled stadiums across the country with

marble and chrome architecture his love life minutely detailed in the columns of cindy adams his involvement with vince mcmahon s wrestling empire and his reality tv persona as the immensely rich guy who treats people like garbage but has no fancy airs this id found its truest voice in his repellent assertion that the first black president needed to prove to trump s satisfaction that he was

match his polls he would be unquestionably the worst thing to happen to the american common culture in my lifetime john podhoretz is the editor of commentary r r reno trump has always been trump his public pronouncements over the last few decades give no evidence of consistent or coherent political views by comparison hillary clinton is a principled public figure he made noises about running in 2000 and was serious in 2012 but the talk went nowhere when he declared in 2015 we laughed again donald trump absurd boy were we wrong i suppose we should have known better the republican party has become home to a growing number of americans who want to burn down our political and economic systems and hang our cultural elites they re tired of being policed by political correctness often with the complicity of supposed conservatives they don t like republican candidates who denounce them as takers with no future in the global economy and they suspect rightly that the chamber of commerce will sell them down the river if it adds to the bottom line all true but it s sad that this frustrated cohort now fixes on trump as its savior he presents himself as a strong man who promises to knock heads and make things right again in this he has a lot more in common with south american populist demagogues than with our tradition of political leaders but i suppose that s the reason for his popularity the middle class consensus in america has collapsed this is the most important political and social earthquake since world war ii the conservative movement s leadership isn t up to the challenge and a good number of voters are willing to gamble on trump s bluster bad bet our nation s solidarity is being tested it will only make things worse if we go trumpster diving r r reno is the editor of first things thomas sowell in a country with more than 300 million people it is remarkable how obsessed the media have become with just one donald trump what is even more remarkable is that after seven years of repeated disasters both domestically and internationally under a glib egomaniac in the white house so many potential voters are turning to another glib egomaniac to be his successor no doubt much of the stampede of republican voters toward mr trump is based on their disgust with the republican establishment it is easy to understand why there would be pent up resentments among republican voters but are elections held for the purpose of venting emotions no national leader ever aroused more fervent emotions than adolf hitler did in the 1930s watch some old newsreels of german crowds delirious with joy at the sight of him the only things at all comparable in more recent times were the ecstatic crowds that greeted barack obama when he burst upon the political scene in 2008 elections however have far more lasting and far more serious or even grim consequences than emotional venting the actual track record of crowd pleasers whether juan per n in argentina obama in america or hitler in germany is very sobering if not painfully depressing after the disastrous nuclear deal with iran we are entering an era when people alive at this moment may live to see a day when american cities are left in radioactive ruins we need all the wisdom courage and dedication in the next president and his or her successors to save ourselves and our children from such a catastrophe a shoot from the hip belligerent show off is the last thing we need or can afford thomas sowell is a senior fellow at the hoover institution stanford university cal thomas i wanted to like donald trump much as i wanted to like richard nixon s vice president spiro agnew both men have said many things with which i agree agnew attacked media bias and trump attacks the establishment s failure to make america great as he nonspecifically puts it but a proper diagnosis does not equal competence in administering a cure if i developed a brain tumor i would want ben carson to operate on me but do i want donald trump operating on america everyone has a temperament the dictionary defines it as the combination of mental physical and emotional traits of a person would trump s combination make him a good president i think not i once compared trump to lonesome rhodes the character played by andy griffith in the 1957 film a face in the crowd trump might also be compared to elmer gantry the fictional evangelist who used religion to mask his dark side on january 13 trump spoke to a packed convention center in pensacola fla while he made many good points especially when it came to uncontrolled immigration he was rambling and unfocused he spent time criticizing his poor quality microphone and said he wasn t going to pay for it a far cry from ronald reagan s i am paying for this microphone line during the 1980 new hampshire primary campaign which conveyed strength not petulance in pensacola trump again drew wild applause when he repeated his promise to build a wall along the mexican border and make mexico pay for it the wall keeps getting higher as the story gets older he never says how he will force mexico to pay anger is not policy trump channels a lot of the righteous and some of the unrighteous anger of voters and sees the solution as himself isn t a narcissist what we currently have in the white house comments cal thomas is a nationally syndicated usa today columnist and a fox news contributor comments worst of all trump s brawling blustery mean spirited public persona serves to associate conservatives with all the negative stereotypes that liberals have for decades attached to their opponents on the right according to conventional caricature conservatives are selfish greedy materialistic bullying misogynistic angry and intolerant they are we re told privileged and pampered elitists who revel in the advantages of inherited wealth while displaying only cruel contempt for the less fortunate and the less powerful the left tried to smear ronald reagan in such terms but failed miserably because he displayed none of the stereotypical traits in contrast trump is the living breathing bellowing personification of all the nasty characteristics democrats routinely ascribe to republicans and then there s the uncomfortable unavoidable issue of racism even those who take trump at his word accepting his declaration that he qualifies as the least racist individual in the nation can imagine the parade of negative ads the democrats are already preparing for radio stations with mainly black audiences and for spanish language television even if trump won a crushing majority of self described white voters he could hardly improve on romney s landslide victory 59 percent to 39 percent in that demographic group if trump becomes the nominee the gop is sure to lose the 2016 election but the problem is much larger will the republican party and the conservative movement survive if asians and latinos come to reject republican candidates as automatically and overwhelmingly as african americans do the party will lose all chance of capturing the presidency and inevitably it will face the disappearance of its congressional and gubernatorial majorities as well there is one sure strategy to pursue if the gop for some reason wishes to suffer such self inflicted wounds nominate a presidential candidate who exemplifies the most unpleasant and non conservative characteristics that the mainstream media and liberal pundits invoke to demonize the right michael medved hosts a daily radio talk show heard on more than 300 stations across the country edwin meese iii there are two tactical approaches for candidates seeking their party s nomination in election campaigns one is to strongly debate the issues and firmly advocate your positions but to avoid personal attacks on your opponents or needless divisiveness the other is to vigorously attack your fellow candidates disparaging them personally and seeking to raise yourself up by dragging them down ronald reagan was famous for epitomizing the former path donald trump unfortunately has chosen to follow the latter course when reagan first ran for governor of california in 1966 his party was deeply divided by past electoral conflicts to restore unity he adopted a new political rule which had been proposed by the party chairman the eleventh commandment thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican the goal was to avoid internecine warfare during the primary which could lead to defeat in the general election while contending for the nomination reagan showed respect for his primary opponent and even left open places in his campaign organization so that he could eventually include those party leaders who had initially opposed him the resulting coalition won the general election by an overwhelming margin reagan kept the eleventh commandment in his subsequent contests for the presidency and it was a unifying factor in his victories in the 1980s at the beginning of the current campaign for the republican presidential nomination it appeared that the party had one of the strongest arrays of candidates in many years successful governors senators business and professional leaders etc today however the political atmosphere is polluted by the vicious personal attacks that the republican contenders have unleashed against one another heading the attackers in both vigor and vitriol has been donald trump his broadsides can almost be predicted by the other candidates standing in the polls the result has been to divide and discourage potential republican party supporters questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run or that another cannot be elected or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign restoring economic growth strengthening national security eliminating cronyism and corruption and improving the lives of all americans at a time when the nation is suffering under one of the most divisive and incompetent presidents in history our people need positive unifying leadership not negative destructive political rhetoric edwin meese iii served in ronald reagan s gubernatorial and presidential administrations these views are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of any organization with which he is affiliated russell moore in 2009 the manhattan declaration led by chuck colson and robert p george reaffirmed the three primary goals of religious conservatives to protect all human life including that of the unborn to reinforce the sanctity of marriage and the family and to conserve the religious freedom of all persons all three goals would be in jeopardy under a trump presidency yes trump says that he is pro life now despite having supported partial birth abortion in the past the problem is not whether he can check a box pro life voters expect leaders to have a coherent vision of human dignity and to be able to defend against assaults on human life in the future some of which may be unimaginable today and will present themselves only as new technologies develop trump s supposed pro life conversion is rooted in nietzschean social darwinist terms he knew a child who was to be aborted who grew up to be a superstar beyond that trump s vitriolic and often racist and sexist language about immigrants women the disabled and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons not just the winners of the moment are created in god s image one also cannot help but look at the personal life of the billionaire it is not just that he has abandoned one wife after another for a younger woman or that he has boasted about having sex with some of the top women of the world it s that he says after all that that he has no need to seek forgiveness at the same time trump has made millions off a casino industry that as social conservatives have rightly argued not only exploits personal vice but destroys families one may say that trump s personal life and business dealings are irrelevant to his candidacy but conservatives have argued for generations that virtue matters in the citizenry and in the nation s leaders can conservatives really believe that if elected trump would care about protecting the family s place in society when his own life is unapologetically what conservatives used to recognize as decadent under withering assault in the obama years social conservatives have maintained consistent with the beliefs of the founders that religious freedom is a natural right not a matter of special pleading to be submitted to majority vote most americans do not agree with the little sisters of the poor on contraception and the sisters do not have a powerful lobby in washington this shouldn t matter trump s willingness to ban muslims even temporarily from entering the country simply because of their religious affiliation would make jefferson spin in his grave trump can win only in the sort of celebrity focused mobocracy that neil postman warned us about years ago in which sound moral judgments are displaced by a narcissistic pursuit of power combined with promises of winning for the masses social and religious conservatives have always seen this tendency as decadent and deviant for them to view it any other way now would be for them to lose their soul russell moore is the president of the ethics and religious liberty commission of the southern baptist convention and the author of onward engaging the culture without losing the gospel michael b mukasey for a hint of why a donald trump presidency would imperil our national security consider just a couple of trump s suggestions for protecting us against islamist terrorists he would start with a temporary ban on the entry of alien muslims into the united states until our leaders can figure out what the hell is going on this prescription overlooks that many people already have figured out precisely what the hell is going on that we face a supremacist movement based in islam that is intent on destroying western civilization and have intelligent suggestions for dealing with it moreover trump s proposal would assure the enmity of all muslims including those whose support we need if we are to prevail even assuming an infallible way to identify who is muslim the proposal is both under and over inclusive it is under inclusive because it does not address potential terrorists who have u s passports or residence permits or are already here or may threaten us abroad it is over inclusive because it bars the huge majority of muslims who are not potential terrorists trump says he would order the military to kill the families of terrorists that would be a direct violation of the most basic laws of armed conflict which require that deadly force be used only when required by military necessity under circumstances that allow distinction between military and civilian targets and when incidental damage to non military targets is proportional to the military advantage gained a military that adhered to the laws of armed conflict would necessarily disobey such an order if it followed the order both the person who gave it and those who followed it would be subject to prosecution for war crimes we have already suffered seven years of feckless leadership that has invited the contempt of our enemies and the distrust of our friends we remain the world s strongest power and can recover but to inspire the respect that creates fear and trust when and where each is necessary we will need a president who summons our strength with a reality based strategic vision not one who summons applause with tantrums and homicidal fantasies michael b mukasey served as u s attorney general from 2007 to 2009 and as

german crowds delirious with joy at the sight of him the only things at all comparable in more recent times were the ecstatic crowds that greeted barack obama when he burst upon the political scene in 2008 elections however have far more lasting and far more serious or even grim consequences than emotional venting the actual track record of crowd pleasers whether juan per n in argentina obama in america or hitler in germany is very sobering if not painfully depressing after the disastrous nuclear deal with iran we are entering an era when people alive at this moment may live to see a day when american cities are left in radioactive ruins we need all the wisdom courage and dedication in the next president and his or her successors to save ourselves and our children from such a catastrophe a shoot from the hip belligerent show off is the last thing we need or can afford thomas sowell is a senior fellow at the hoover institution stanford university cal thomas i wanted to like donald trump much as i wanted to like richard nixon s vice president spiro agnew both men have said many things with which i agree agnew attacked media bias and trump attacks the establishment s failure to make america great as he nonspecifically puts it but a proper diagnosis does not equal competence in administering a cure if i developed a brain tumor i would want ben carson to operate on me but do i want donald trump operating on america everyone has a temperament the dictionary defines it as the combination of mental physical and emotional traits of a person would trump s combination make him a good president i think not i once compared trump to lonesome rhodes the character played by andy griffith in the 1957 film a face in the crowd trump might also be compared to elmer gantry the fictional evangelist who used religion to mask his dark side on january 13 trump spoke to a packed convention center in pensacola fla while he made many good points especially when it came to uncontrolled immigration he was rambling and unfocused he spent time criticizing his poor quality microphone and said he wasn t going to pay for it a far cry from ronald reagan s i am paying for this microphone line during the 1980 new hampshire primary campaign which conveyed strength not petulance in pensacola trump again drew wild applause when he repeated his promise to build a wall along the mexican border and make mexico pay for it the wall keeps getting higher as the story gets older he never says how he will force mexico to pay anger is not policy trump channels a lot of the righteous and some of the unrighteous anger of voters and sees the solution as himself isn t a narcissist what we currently have in the white house comments cal thomas is a nationally syndicated usa today columnist and a fox news contributor comments edwin meese iii there are two tactical approaches for candidates seeking their party s nomination in election campaigns one is to strongly debate the issues and firmly advocate your positions but to avoid personal attacks on your opponents or needless divisiveness the other is to vigorously attack your fellow candidates disparaging them personally and seeking to raise yourself up by dragging them down ronald reagan was famous for epitomizing the former path donald trump unfortunately has chosen to follow the latter course when reagan first ran for governor of california in 1966 his party was deeply divided by past electoral conflicts to restore unity he adopted a new political rule which had been proposed by the party chairman the eleventh commandment thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow republican the goal was to avoid internecine warfare during the primary which could lead to defeat in the general election while contending for the nomination reagan showed respect for his primary opponent and even left open places in his campaign organization so that he could eventually include those party leaders who had initially opposed him the resulting coalition won the general election by an overwhelming margin reagan kept the eleventh commandment in his subsequent contests for the presidency and it was a unifying factor in his victories in the 1980s at the beginning of the current campaign for the republican presidential nomination it appeared that the party had one of the strongest arrays of candidates in many years successful governors senators business and professional leaders etc today however the political atmosphere is polluted by the vicious personal attacks that the republican contenders have unleashed against one another heading the attackers in both vigor and vitriol has been donald trump his broadsides can almost be predicted by the other candidates standing in the polls the result has been to divide and discourage potential republican party supporters questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run or that another cannot be elected or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign restoring economic growth strengthening national security eliminating cronyism and corruption and improving the lives of all americans at a time when the nation is suffering under one of the most divisive and incompetent presidents in history our people need positive unifying leadership not negative destructive political rhetoric edwin meese iii served in ronald reagan s gubernatorial and presidential administrations these views are his own and do not necessarily reflect those of any organization with which he is affiliated russell moore in 2009 the manhattan declaration led by chuck colson and robert p george reaffirmed the three primary goals of religious conservatives to protect all human life including that of the unborn to reinforce the sanctity of marriage and the family and to conserve the religious freedom of all persons all three goals would be in jeopardy under a trump presidency yes trump says that he is pro life now despite having supported partial birth abortion in the past the problem is not whether he can check a box pro life voters expect leaders to have a coherent vision of human dignity and to be able to defend against assaults on human life in the future some of which may be unimaginable today and will present themselves only as new technologies develop trump s supposed pro life conversion is rooted in nietzschean social darwinist terms he knew a child who was to be aborted who grew up to be a superstar beyond that trump s vitriolic and often racist and sexist language about immigrants women the disabled and others ought to concern anyone who believes that all persons not just the winners of the moment are created in god s image one also cannot help but look at the personal life of the billionaire it is not just that he has abandoned one wife after another for a younger woman or that he has boasted about having sex with some of the top women of the world it s that he says after all that that he has no need to seek forgiveness at the same time trump has made millions off a casino industry that as social conservatives have rightly argued not only exploits personal vice but destroys families one may say that trump s personal life and business dealings are irrelevant to his candidacy but conservatives have argued for generations that virtue matters in the citizenry and in the nation s leaders can conservatives really believe that if elected trump would care about protecting the family s place in society when his own life is unapologetically what conservatives used to recognize as decadent under withering assault in the obama years social conservatives have maintained consistent with the beliefs of the founders that religious freedom is a natural right not a matter of special pleading to be submitted to majority vote most americans do not agree with the little sisters of the poor on contraception and the sisters do not have a powerful lobby in washington this shouldn t matter trump s willingness to ban muslims even temporarily from entering the country simply because of their religious affiliation would make jefferson spin in his grave trump can win only in the sort of celebrity focused mobocracy that neil postman warned us about years ago in which sound moral judgments are displaced by a narcissistic pursuit of power combined with promises of winning for the masses social and religious conservatives have always seen this tendency as decadent and deviant for them to view it any other way now would

terrorists he would start with a temporary ban on the entry of alien muslims into the united states until our leaders can figure out what the hell is going on this prescription overlooks that many people already have figured out precisely what the hell is going on that we face a supremacist movement based in islam that is intent on destroying western civilization and have intelligent suggestions for dealing with it moreover trump s proposal would assure the enmity of all muslims including those whose support we need if we are to prevail even assuming an infallible way to identify who is muslim the proposal is both under and over inclusive it is under inclusive because it does not address potential terrorists who have u s passports or residence permits or are already here or may threaten us abroad it is over inclusive because it bars the huge majority of muslims who are not potential terrorists trump says he would order the military to kill the families of terrorists that would be a direct violation of the most basic laws of armed conflict which require that deadly force be used only when required by military necessity under circumstances that allow distinction between military and civilian targets and when incidental damage to non military targets is proportional to the military advantage gained a military that adhered to the laws of armed conflict would necessarily disobey such an order if it followed the order both the person who gave it and those who followed it would be subject to prosecution for war crimes we have already suffered seven years of feckless leadership that has invited the contempt of our enemies and the distrust of our friends we remain the world s strongest power and can recover but to inspire the respect that creates fear and trust when and where each is necessary we will need a president who summons our strength with a reality based strategic vision not one who summons applause with tantrums and homicidal fantasies

conservatives have a serious decision to make do we truly believe in our long held principles and insist that politicians have records demonstrating fealty to them or are we willing to throw these

no katie pavlich is the editor of townhall and a best selling author john podhoretz donald trump is the apotheosis of a tendency that began to manifest itself in american culture in the 1980s most

along with him stern invited young actresses onto his show to discuss their breasts the screams of outrage that greeted them were part of the act clay had nowhere to go with his shtick after a few years and faded away stern adapted to changing circumstances but the american id remained as ids do you want to call me a goon fine so i ll act like a goon see how you like it the cultural signposts trump brandished in the years preceding his presidential bid are all manifestations of the american id his steak business his casino business his green marble and chrome architecture his love life minutely detailed in the columns of cindy adams his involvement with vince mcmahon s wrestling empire and his reality tv persona as the immensely rich guy who treats people like garbage but has no fancy airs this id found its truest voice in his repellent assertion that the first black president needed to prove to trump s satisfaction that he was actually an american in any integrated personality the id is supposed to be balanced by an ego and a superego by a sense of self that gravitates toward behaving in a mature and responsible way when it comes to serious matters and failing that has a sense of shame about transgressing norms and common decencies trump is an unbalanced force he is the politicized american id should his election results match his polls he would be unquestionably the worst thing to happen to the american common culture in my lifetime john podhoretz is the editor of commentary r r reno trump has always been trump his public pronouncements over

but the talk went nowhere when he declared in 2015 we laughed again donald trump absurd boy were we wrong i suppose we should have known better the republican party has become home to a growing number of americans who want to burn down our political and economic systems and hang our cultural elites they re tired of being policed by political correctness often with the complicity of supposed conservatives they don t like republican candidates who denounce them as takers with no future in the global economy and they suspect rightly that the chamber of commerce will sell them down the river if it adds to the bottom line all true but it s sad that this frustrated cohort now fixes on trump as its savior he presents himself as a strong man who promises to knock heads and make things right again in this he has a lot more in common with south american populist demagogues than with our tradition of political leaders but i suppose that s the reason for his popularity the middle class consensus in america has collapsed this is the most important political and social earthquake since world war ii the conservative movement s leadership isn t up to the challenge and a good number of
