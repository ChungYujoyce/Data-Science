the vehicles we sell in china are built in china ford does export a number of vehicles to china from the u s mccleery said our biggest concerns are impacts retaliatory tariffs would have on our exports and our expanding customer base in china chinese officials have targeted operations of american companies in china by slowing customs clearance for them and stepping up regulatory scrutiny

through late last week trump administration officials were suggesting that negotiators were making steady progress u s officials say they got an inkling of china s second thoughts about prior

agreement is reached while u s officials want to keep them as leverage to ensure compliance a real enforcement mechanism is critical the american chamber of commerce in shanghai said in a statement ap
