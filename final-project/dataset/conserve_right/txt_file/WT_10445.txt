hael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic first of three parts berlin germany has leveraged its economic strength to take the leading role in addressing europe s debt crisis but ironically it owes much of that success recently to the appeal of german products in emerging countries such as china and russia far outside its traditional markets in europe german companies unusual success in selling pricey top quality goods including luxury cars and new kitchens around the world has given citizens here rising confidence that their characteristic thrift perfectionism and hard work can make their country a role model for the rest of europe and indeed the world as governments from athens to washington struggle to get their fiscal houses in order top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey as the largest economy remaining with an untarnished aaa credit rating german leaders have insisted that greece italy spain and other european countries learn to live within their means as a condition of staying in the bloc of countries using the euro and getting an estimated 600 billion in loans and guarantees funded by berlin the strictures imposed by germany combined with the turmoil spawned by the debt crisis have led to major government upheavals and increasing social strife in the southern rim of europe as fellow eu nations are forced into an era of recession and austerity resentment is mounting toward the teutonic giant from the streets of athens and madrid where nearly 1 in 5 workers is unemployed and protesters have violently denounced germany s demands to the cocktail parties of london biting outbursts laced with references to germany s aggression in world war ii have become common the spreading turbulence took as its latest victim french president nicolas sarkozy a conservative who gave support and legitimacy to the austerity agenda promoted by his friend and collaborator german chancellor angela merkel mrs merkel sought to influence the french election this spring by endorsing mr sarkozy over his opponent socialist candidate francois hollande but the move may only make the french electorate s vote sunday for a left leaning government appear all the more a stinging slap in the face for germany german leaders in interviews here seem taken aback at the backlash arguing that other wealthy northern european countries also are demanding budgetary restraint from their southern neighbors in exchange for bailout loans some shrug it off likening critics to spoiled children who are angry about not always getting their way our authority and our influence is mainly based on our economic success people envy us for this german foreign minister guido westerwelle said at a recent gathering of german manufacturers filling a void germany s emergence as the dominant political power in europe owes in no small part to america s shrinking influence in continental economic affairs since the euro crisis broke out two years ago u s officials have mostly sat on the sidelines cheering on efforts to get europe s debts under control and offering economic advice which often is ignored in berlin analysts say it may have been inevitable that germany would resume its role as the economic engine of a reunited europe after nearly a century punctuated by wars occupation and political division they say the real question was whether it would rise gracefully to the political responsibilities that come with such economic power the country was unprepared for the promotion said thomas kleine brockhoff an analyst with the german marshall fund germans are visibly uncomfortable as the boss and brains of european economic affairs after having grown comfortable in their role as only one of several leading nations within the trans atlantic alliance suddenly european countries are looking to germany to save the day he said but are all the while resenting their dependence meanwhile germany is not used to having to propose solutions for an entire continent and patiently explain german motives to distrustful citizens of other nations he said in demanding sacrifices from their southern neighbors germans point out that they too had to learn to do without after the abrupt reunification of east and west germany in the early 1990s at that time the country s economy was in shambles weighed down with debt and suffering from low productivity in the eastern regions where communism had decimated good corporate management and undermined the solid work ethic it was only after struggling with budgetary belt tightening and labor reforms which required german workers to accept years of stagnant wages to bolster productivity that germany emerged in the past decade as the most powerful and financially solid economy on the continent today germany has become europe s indispensable economy growing at a strong 3 percent rate last year while many other nations crumbled back into deep recessions under the stress of the debt crisis unemployment in germany at 6 percent is well below the u s rate of 8 1 percent reported friday and the average rate of 10 8 percent in the rest of europe germans stress that their prescription of budget austerity mixed with painful labor and economic reforms is aimed at enabling the troubled economies of southern europe to regain competitiveness and prosper again just as germany did a decade ago while warming to their role as the stern disciplinary father of europe germany s leaders have not been shy about jabbing at the stumbling giant across the atlantic the u s like much of europe since the recession has amassed breathtaking mountains of government debt in recent years the u s economy has become increasingly dominated by technology and low paying service businesses as large portions of its manufacturing base succumbed to asian competitors we do not live on cutting people s hair or delivering pizza mr westerwelle told the gathering of german manufacturing moguls we make great products reliable products that have beautiful designs and are sought around the world german businessmen and political leaders take pride that their products are seemingly old fashioned in striving for perfection and reliability rather than incorporating the latest technological gimmicks they say german brands are loved worldwide for that reason there was life before the e book mr westerwelle quipped taking a swipe at the trendy digital technologies that have taken hold in the u s and asia credit goes to china still german leaders acknowledge that their success owes in no small part today to the ascendance of china and other emerging countries where a burgeoning class of newly affluent consumers has developed a strong appetite for german luxury goods while other european countries remain the biggest market for german products mr westerwelle said asian countries now account for about one fifth of german exports and that is where the growth is fastest we must understand that this is the source of our prosperity he said in a recent tour of german factories in dresden berlin and nuremberg one chief executive after another echoed that assessment confirming the growing importance of the emerging markets for germany as sales in europe and the u s stay flat or deteriorate german businesses are opening offices and plants in places such as moscow beijing and abu dhabi to cater to the trend ulrich welter founder of a small german company that makes luxury wall coverings said he was surprised by the enthusiasm he found for his products among consumers in some of the most exotic places around the world when i m abroad particularly when i m in beijing i realize there is very much respect for german products he said well to do consumers everywhere seem to understand the principle that less is more when it comes to living well and are willing to pay high prices for the quality that germany provides he said we increase the most in asia first of all mostly in china said dieter burmester chief executive officer of burmester audiosysteme gmbh a celebrated maker of high end musical sound systems made in germany is very well accepted in asia he said and sales have been brisk in japan taiwan and south korea as well the asian market has become so important to burmester that the company goes to great lengths to avoid offending asian customers by not using the number four on any of the sound equipment sold there because that number connotes death and destruction in many asian traditions he said deutsche workstation a company that designs high end interiors for yachts hotels and offices recently opened an office in moscow where it has a number of wealthy clients and expects to find more said chief executive officer fritz straub the company already has offices in london paris and switzerland the company is working on a luxurious yacht interior for a russian oligarch whom it declined to name the middle east with its oil riches also has proved fertile ground for the company which designed a megayacht my abdul aziz owned by the king of saudi arabia deutsche workstation s fortunes appear to have become so linked to the wealth in oil states that a look at its revenue flows in the past five years shows they largely rose and fell with fluctuations in oil prices the company had a particularly bad spell in 2009 when premium crude prices briefly crashed to around 35 a barrel from all time highs over 150 in july 2008 our clients are rich said mr straub we make basically toys we make beautiful homes and yachts but they are toys catering to the rich luxury goods sales have held their own as well in the u s and europe where well heeled customers were not hurt as much by the recession and sluggish economic recovery as were middle class consumers but emerging markets are driving a boom in luxury goods worldwide according to standard poor s corp affluent shoppers have retained their buying power everywhere said standard poor s credit analyst nicolas baudouin who predicts another good year for high end products in 2012 but in particular he said luxury goods are selling very well in developing countries such as russia and china as well as in middle eastern gulf states peter may a consultant for small german luxury manufacturers said that expansion into emerging markets is the future for german industries from the auto giants mercedes benz and volkswagen to the smallest family owned firms china already has become the biggest market for one luxury automaker audi and its parent company volkswagen claims the biggest share of the chinese auto market which at 16 million vehicle sales a year is now the world s largest audi s luxury sedans line the parking lots of chinese government agencies in beijing and elsewhere they are so heavily favored by china s well heeled and well connected bureaucrats that the government recently moved to require agencies to purchase domestic cars in a bid to boost china s fledgling car industry because german workers earn high wages by world standards german companies cannot compete with chinese competitors on price so they must earn the high prices they charge by surpassing all the other options in quality mr may said our products have to be perfect they have to be masterpieces that is the criteria to succeed he said while only the wealthiest people in most nations can afford many of these products as a group they control huge amounts of money and are one of the fastest growing markets in the world he said the broad mass of people do not have money to buy these products he said your target group is very limited but it is growing because globalization is a reality in particular the target group is small in germany but big worldwide so german manufacturers must keep seeking new markets outside the country germany s success holds some key lessons for struggling businesses in the united states and other countries analysts say particularly the nation s renowned system of apprenticeship for training young workers to learn the highly specialized skills they need in german industries the u s has no comparable system and u s manufacturers chronically complain that they cannot find workers with the skills they need to fill the specialized and complex jobs performed in factories today germany s success also points up the advantages of its system of close collaboration among business labor and government that system led to the adoption of apprenticeship programs in german industries and served to put a lid on unemployment during the recession by working out cooperative plans for workers to cut hours rather than jobs to weather the downturn in business past its prime but some pundits dismiss germany s famed industrial machine and say its heyday is passing with the rise of new technologies the source of german wealth is sputtering said wall street analyst andy kessler germany s industrial icons mercedes bmw siemens thyssenkrupp are so 80s while germans proudly shun the latest digital fads and incorporate only what they consider the most worthy technologies into their products that stubborn old fashionedness has left them far behind the economic curve mr kessler said teutonic efficiency hasn t adapted well to modern knowledge industries he said germany doesn t have an apple or a google or a cisco let alone a linkedin or zynga german software leader sap is oracle s weak sister there s no pfizer or johnson johnson moreover germany s population is shrinking pointing to an inevitable decline in its economic power and wealth he said while it caters to the growing wealthy class in developing countries germany has not embraced immigration of talent from those countries as a way to help maintain its economic strength he said go to germany and you basically see germans he said entrepreneurial companies require the best no matter the nationality silicon valley feasts on a smorgasbord of international scientists and coders the same in london german businessmen acknowledge that they do not always know where they will find their future workforce with the number of young german workers dwindling many are recruiting labor from eastern europe to keep their factories running mr kessler suggested that this underlying weakness in germany s economy may be the reason mrs merkel is looking to increase the country s power and influence throughout the rest of europe it s clear what germany is up to he said it is dangling bailouts and loans as bait for debt stricken countries to give up sovereign control of their own budgets in the end he said germany will come to the rescue and end up owning europe but the growth of german power will benefit the rest of europe if mrs merkel is successful at transferring some of germany s teutonic efficiency to help streamline the less productive economies of its neighbors he said the eurozone is a wasteland of entitlementarians while germany is an industrial might with the know how to better manage the other european economies the analyst said managing europe start with french wine italian fashion spanish farming and greek tourism they can all use huge management efficiencies he said in france bureaucrats control half of the economy just privatizing government stakes can set off a productivity bonfire under german management there also is potential for a european silicon valley emerging in estonia and other parts of eastern europe mr kessler said dieter farwick retired brigadier general and senior vice president of the world security network foundation also questioned whether germany s rise in influence will be more than transitory nowadays the majority of germans believe that germany is unsinkable he said one hundred years ago the titanic s passengers felt the same they were wrong too mr farwick expects that german efforts to hold together the 17 nation eurozone will be defeated eventually by the overwhelming burden of trying to rescue the floundering nations of southern europe for the next few decades rich european countries like germany and france will have to spend trillions of euros to help put the poor countries back on track he said there will be no resources left for defense security and stability and the european project will crumble he said jerry jasinowski former president of the u s national association of manufacturers tips his hat to german leaders for staying focused on maintaining the strength of their awesome manufacturing machine even as the u s allowed its industrial heartland to bleed jobs and sales to emerging rivals such as china they recognize that manufacturing is the foundation of a modern nation s economy he said manufacturing not only spurs the innovations that have made life better for consumers worldwide but it also provides a steady source of good paying factory jobs and stokes growth in an array of service and ancillary businesses that feed into manufacturing for more than a decade we have stood by while foreign competitors employing predatory trade practices have absconded with major portions of our manufacturing base mr jasinowski said the persistent weakness in our economy today and especially the stubbornly high unemployment is the result quoting sony founder akio morita mr jasinowski said the world power that loses its manufacturing base wi
