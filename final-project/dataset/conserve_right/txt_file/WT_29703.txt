battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion in attacking the squad president trump again undercut sound strategy with unsound tactics contrasting himself with congress in general and house democrats in particular is strategically astute however focusing on these four first term women is the wrong way to advance it instead of shrinking his target he needs to expand it to the democratic party and their eventual nominee it is hardly the first time mr trump s instincts have been right but his outbursts have been wrong on july 14 he tweeted about the progressive democratic congresswomen why don t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came sic known as the squad all four are women freshmen and minorities his statement s crucial inaccuracy gave easy opening to his opponents only one came from abroad and all are u s citizens immediately labeling the attack racist democrats rushed to the squad s defense top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time mr trump s remarks were a godsend to the house democratic leadership who were themselves embroiled in a fight with the squad and had racist aimed at them their fight had erupted over a border crisis spending bill which had passed the house but split the party just before july 4 during that debate the squad and others on the party s left had targeted moderate democrats with immoderate accusations that eruption still smoldered when mr trump blundered to understand mr trump s transformative effect look at two votes on the june 27th border funding vote democrats split 129 in favor and 95 opposed that split between moderates and the left festered for two weeks until mr trump s 7 14 tweet on july 17 house democrat leadership moved to condemn mr trump s remarks all 235 democrats voting in support the democrats split disappeared replaced by unity against mr trump mr trump s strategy to position himself against the democratic house was right just his tactics to pursue it were wrong attacking congress is very advantageous to mr trump on july 22 real clear politics averaged mr trump s national job approval 45 percent for congress it was less than half his 19 2 percent such an advantage is definitely worth exploiting historically this has proved fruitful too most famously harry truman did so running against what he dubbed a do nothing republican congress despite having initially questionable re election prospects he won relatively comfortably and flipped congress to democratic control bill clinton won re election in 1996 doing the same combined with this general unpopularity are individual democrats particular instances mr trump has already seized on some s espoused socialism the squad presents similarly inviting targets firebrands to their own leadership they constantly produce hot takes and headlines mr trump is strategically correct to look to exploit these opportunities however focusing on the squad narrows the focus when his greater advantage would come from expanding it to their broader party especially their eventual 2020 nominee instead of interjecting himself into the squad mr trump should be seeking to drag the rest of the democrats into it this is exactly what the house democratic leadership sought to avoid before mr trump temporarily solved their problem for them again a house vote reveals the house democratic leadership s problem on the same day they voted to condemn mr trump s tweets on the squad leadership had to beat back an impeachment motion against mr trump the intra party split resurfaced 137 opposing impeachment and 95 supporting the democratic split between moderates and left is real mr trump does not need to exacerbate it democrats will do that for him he needs to exploit it the best way to do so is not by injecting himself into their fight but forcing democratic leaders and moderates to take a stand on their left s actions not his forcing democrats to take a position on their left offers far more reward and much less risk for mr trump a consummate entrepreneur mr trump should see the advantage in that in politics as well as business he simply needs to keep putting that ball back over the net and making them scramble to it instead of personifying the left through the squad he should be party fying democrats through the squad doing so presents them an impossible choice alienating their left or their moderates difficult for democratic leaders now it will be impossible for democrats nominee next year j t young served in the office of management and budget and at the treasury d
