re senator chris coons democrat member of the senate foreign relations committee joins chris wallace on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday january 12 2020 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news anchor i aposm chris wallace president trump says iran appears to be standing down in the wake of his decision to take out its top general and he is offering tehran both carrots and sticks begin videotape donald trump president of the united states the united states is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it mike pompeo secretary of state we believe the sanctions that we impose today further that strategic objective wallace but does the president have a strategy that will work trump as long as i am president of the united states iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon wallace we aposll discuss the state of relations with iran and the prospects for peace with robert o aposbrien the white house national security advisor in his first appearance on fox news sunday then sen chris coons d de only congress has the power to declare war and a critical question that many raised is whether or not consultation with congress is a necessary and constructive thing wallace we aposll ask democratic senator chris coons about that effort in congress to limit the president aposs military actions against iran plus house speaker pelosi announces she aposll send the articles of impeachment to the senate this week we aposll ask our sunday panel what the impeachment trial will look like all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the fallout from president trump aposs showdown with iran continues to be felt across the middle east thousands of iranians protest as tehran now admits shooting down that ukraine airliner the president tells fox news the top iranian general he killed was planning attacks against four u s embassies and senate democrats pushed for a vote to limit the president aposs military powers while also preparing to deal with the articles of impeachment the house will send over this week in a moment we will discuss the u s face off with national security advisor robert o aposbrien but first let aposs bring in kevin corke with the latest from the white house kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris calls for change echoing across tehran once again this weekend those demands however garnered the attention of a rather prominent observer half a world away begin videotape corke protests swept over the iranian capital over the weekend in response to the downing of the ukrainian airliner that killed everyone on board including many iranian university students who had been studying abroad some of the protesters even calling for the supreme leader to resign after days of denial tehran acknowledged it launch the missile strike calling it a mistake but later claim without evidence that the aircraft turned towards a sensitive military site the angry demonstrations were in sharp contrast to the days of morning following the death of iranian general qassem soleimani who the president accused of plotting attacks on several u s embassies justifying his removal from the battle field the president took his concerns directly to the iranian people tweeting in farsi and in english that the government of iran must allow human rights groups to monitor and report facts from the ground adding that there cannot be another massacre of peaceful protesters nor an internet shut down the world is watching meanwhile back in washington the senate is watching and waiting for speaker pelosi to transmit articles of impeachment if she does so on tuesday and wednesday as many expect a senate trial could begin soon but first the california democrat is expected to select four to ten members of the house to manage the trial period ends end videotape corke sources tell fox news the speaker will likely make her selection from a diverse group of members among them the intel committee chair adam schiff of california he of course chris ran the trump ukraine investigation wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you and joining us now white house national security adviser robert o aposbrien welcome to fox news sunday robert o aposbrien national security adviser good to be with you chris wallace after first denying it iran now admits that it accidentally shot down that ukraine airliner with 176 people on board but iran aposs foreign minister says and we aposre putting it up human error at time of crisis caused by u s adventurism led to disaster a couple of questions what does president trump think of iran aposs effort to shift the blame for the shoot down of a civilian airliner and is there anything the president can do beyond tweets to support the thousands of protesters in the streets o aposbrien oh it aposs a great question first of all our condolences go out to the families and friends of the folks who were lost on that ukrainian air flight 752 a tragedy but the iranian response is typical first they cover it up and then when social media came out with photos of the missiles they couldn apost cover it up then they said the plane veered towards sensitive military sensitive military area that turned out not to be true and now zarif who aposs one of the great dissemblers in international diplomacy is attempting to shift the blame to the united states and so we we aposll reject that the ukrainians have to have an international investigation has to be apparent they have to apologize they have to pay compensation to the families and they need to make sure this never happens again wallace and what can we do to help the protesters this week some of whom are calling for the supreme leader the ayatollah khamenei to step down o aposbrien what aposs interesting is they aposre chanting death to the dictator and when president trump tweeted yesterday in farsi it had 200 times support of the protesters it had 200 000 likes i aposm told that aposs the world record for the number of likes in social media for a farsi language tweet so unlike past administrations where there hasn apost been support demonstrated to the iranian people president trump has made it clear throughout his administration that he stands with the people in iran not with the regime and we aposre going to continue to do so wallace there aposs been quite a debate this week about the president aposs justification for taking out iranian general qassem soleimani he has said top administration officials have said you have said that there was an imminent threat the president was a little bit more specific about that threat when he sat down with laura ingraham on friday take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i can reveal that i believe it would have been four embassies and i think that probably baghdad already started end video clip wallace but members of congress who attended a 75 minute briefing with the secretaries of state defense the cia director say there was not a single mention during those 75 minutes classified briefing members of congress about imminent threats to u s embassies so why is he saying it on television but that top officials didn apost tell members of congress o aposbrien well i think something we aposve been clear on i aposve seen the intelligence on this chris and it was very strong and looking and in some ways i would love to release the intelligence and show the american people and i can tell you they can trust the administration on this unfortunately we don apost want to lose that valuable stream of intelligence that will allow us to protect americans going forward going to the briefing congress what we aposve always said well i aposve said from day one is that there were severe threats to american diplomats to american soldiers sailors airmen marines and to american facilities in the region iraq likely syria and potentially other countries that i won apost name now so you know i think that i think what the president said is consistent with what we aposve been saying since day one wallace but could you explain because there does seem to be a contradiction he aposs telling laura ingraham our esteemed colleague but in a 75 minute classified briefing your top national security people never mentioned this to members of congress why not o aposbrien so i wasn apost at the briefing and i don apost know how the q a went back and forth i mean sometimes it depends on the questions that were asked or how they were inaudible i don apost know i wasn apost there all i can tell you is we aposve been clear from the start that there were very significant threats to american facilities in the region and to american military officials officers and men and women and also the u s diplomats and i think that aposs consistent with what the president aposs saying now wallace and would you agree with what the president said that there were specific imminent threats to four u s embassies o aposbrien i look it aposs always difficult even with the exquisite intelligence that we have to know exactly what the targets are but it is certainly consistent with the intelligence to assume that they would have hit embassies in at least four countries crosstalk o aposbrien but again if we we knew there were threats to american facilities now whether they were bases embassies you know it aposs always hard until the attack happens but we had very strong intelligence that they were looking to kill and maim americans at u s facilities in the regions and and so i think the president aposs absolutely right you know when he talks about the threats to america that they came from soleimani they came from the quds force and they came from their proxies wallace i want to step back a little bit and talk about the whole question of the administration aposs strategy for dealing with iran the u s imposed still more sanctions on iran on friday and the secretary of state secretary of treasury said you have two goals you want iran to behave like other nations in the world and you want them to stop their nuclear program but let aposs look at the record so far the administration has now imposed sanctions on more than 1 000 iranian companies organizations and individuals back in september the treasury secretary said basically we have cut off all funding to iran and instead of caving iran is moving step by step out of the nuclear deal and in recent months they had six ships attack saudi oil facilities and set fire to the u s embassy in baghdad you said this weekend in an interview with axios that you think iran is now more likely to negotiate but the maximum pressure campaign at least if you look at the last six months has made iran less aggressive more aggressive rather not less aggressive o aposbrien look i think the maximum pressure campaign is working it aposs the demonstrable that it aposs working the iranian economy is contracted by at least 10 percent i mean we haven apost seen that with a modern economy in many many years iran went from producing 3 to 4 million barrels of oil a day down to 150 000 to 400 000 barrels depending on the day iran is being choked off and iran aposs going to have no other choice but to come to the table we had to get out of the jcpoa it was a terrible deal it had a sunset clause and i don apost think a lot of people realize that on the jcpoa this year in 2020 iran would have been permitted to buy advanced ballistic missiles main battle tanks fast attack jets a whole range of weapons would have been on the shelf of the iranian wallace i agree with all of that and you certainly whipped ph them but they haven apost been less aggressive they haven apost indicated that they aposre going to come to the table in fact they aposve been more aggressive and they aposre pulling out of the nuclear deal so why do you say as you aposve said this weekend you think that they aposre more likely to negotiate o aposbrien because iran is being choked off and iran is going to have no other opportunity there aposs no other way for them to get the money they need to fund the guard to fund their regime to fund their malign activities and you aposre seeing protests now breaking out across iran and we aposve seen it now for several months people are fed up with this regime if iran wants to maintain a modern country a modern economy they aposre going to have to come to the table and negotiate i think that aposs highly likely wallace but i remember in september you were the national security adviser then president trump was at the u n i interviewed the iranian president rouhani the president and the french president macron were trying to get him even to get in the phone and talk and he refused to do so i will tell you he said at that time to me there was no chance we aposre going to negotiate unless and until the u s lift sanctions o aposbrien what aposs going to cause them to negotiate is the pressure on their economy and when you got students out chanting death to the dictator and when you have thousands of iranians out protesting the street that aposs the sort of pressure that aposs going to bring them to the table and listen the president has made it very clear to iran we aposre not talking about regime change we want to see an iran that forswears nuclear weapons that stops taking americans hostage that stops supporting proxies and terrorism in the region and stops building these ballistic missiles which we saw them launch last week we can get there and i think by the way chris you aposre going to see more support from our allies in the coming days and week in europe as they realize how dangerous this iranian situation is wallace all right let aposs change a little bit iraq aposs prime minister has sent a message to the united states i want to put it up on the screen he aposs asked the u s to send representatives to iraq to put in place a mechanism for implementing the parliament aposs decision implementing parliament aposs decision for the safe withdrawal of forces from iraq but secretary of state pompeo says that we will continue our mission there question on what ground is the u s saying we aposre going to ignore the request by a sovereign nation to leave o aposbrien well with respect to the resolution you aposre talking about that was a nonbinding resolution so it seems like they aposve learned something from our democracy with nonbinding resolutions crosstalk wallace yes but this is a specific statement by the prime minister o aposbrien this is a nonbinding resolution passed by a shia only group of legislators the sunnis boycotted it the kurds boycotted it and crosstalk wallace but the shia represents a majority they can control the parliament o aposbrien it yes we aposll see what happens when they have a full vote but in any event our goal is to get out of iraq as well the president said we want to be out of the middle east and and but what we need to do is leave on our terms and we need to leave in a fashion in which isis daesh is has been fully eliminated we took care of the physical caliphate and we aposre working very hard now to mop up the rest of isis we saw that with the raid that took out al baghdadi we made tremendous progress there well we will certainly work with the iraqis we look forward to doing so we talk with them every day we talk with our counterparts there and i think we aposre going to have you know we aposre working on a resolution we had a team from nato here this week i think you aposre going to see far more nato involvement in iraq so this will be crosstalk wallace but the belief ph that we aposll leave on our terms they aposre a sovereign country if they tell us to leave you aposre saying we aposre still going to leave on our terms o aposbrien look we aposll work with the iraqis and we look forward to leaving an iraq that aposs safe and that aposs secure and that aposs independent and that aposs what the iraqis want as well and we aposre going to continue to work with all our partners in iraq wallace i aposm running out of time i aposve got a couple of quick questions there aposs a report today that the u s is expelling a dozen saudi servicemen who aposve been training at u s military bases this after that terrible shooting at pensacola do we have indications that more of these saudi servicemen had ties to extremism o aposbrien yes i don apost want to say that i think secretary esper has done a great job over at the pentagon in reviewing the way we vet foreign troops that come over and train with americans we have a longstanding relationship with the saudis to train their pilots we work with them both in saudi arabia crosstalk o aposbrien well i think we aposre being very careful obviously pensacola showed that there had been errors in the way that we vetted and i think out of an abundance of caution secretary esper aposs taking these actions to protect our service men and women wallace finally let aposs talk about congress president trump says he didn apost notify the congressional leaders the gang of eight the majority and minority leaders the heads of the intelligence committees beforehand about the attack on soleimani basically because he didn apost trust them here he is this week begin video donald trump president of the united states so they want us to call them now schiff is a big leaker you know he leaks to crazy cnn off the record they aposve got the number one terrorist in the world soleimani and they aposre going to get him they aposre going to take him out in the next 10 minutes end video wallace ambassador o aposbrien can you point to a single instance when president trump your administration has given sensitive national security information to top congressional leaders about an ongoing military operation and they have leaked that to the media o aposbrien i think what president trump is doing there is something very consistent with what president obama and other leaders did president obama did not brief the congressional leadership before the sensitive raid on osama bin laden he did not brief the congressional leadership prior to taking out anwar al awlaki in yemen this is crosstalk wallace he never said it aposs because i don apost trust them to leak o aposbrien this is standard procedure and as soon as soleimani was taken off the battlefield the gang of eight was notified the intelligence committees and key leaders in congress were notified i participated in a number of those calls and then we had a very long briefing as you referenced at the top of your show 75 minutes with all the members of congress both house and senate so we think we aposve met our obligations in notifying congress and we think we aposre also very consistent with what the obama administration the bush administration the clinton administration crosstalk wallace specifically is there reason to believe that if that information had been given to adam schiff he would have leaked it o aposbrien look i think there aposs always a concern when you have an operation that is this sensitive and the lives of our servicemen and women are in danger as we go after a leading terrorist you have to be extraordinarily careful with that information no matter who it is wallace finally as you know the house has voted to limit the president aposs war powers the house the senate is working on that under what circumstances would the administration feel it had to go to congress to get approval for action against iran o aposbrien well i think that aposs set out in a number of cases so under article two of the constitution the president is allowed to exercise military power to defend the american people and defend our soldiers sailors airmen and marines and if it aposs in the national interest and the action doesn apost rise to the level of war so that aposs a long and substantial involvement the president has that article two power to take action to protect america and that aposs what we did here and that aposs what we aposll continue to do in the future if that changes and there aposs a situation where there what we expect a conflict that will have a scope and duration that aposs similar to war certainly we aposd go to congress and again i think we aposre in on firm legal footing here very similar to president obama president bush president clinton wallace ambassador o aposbrien thank you your first time on fox news sunday i hope we didn apost scare you off and that you aposll come back o aposbrien i look forward to it thank you chris wallace thank you sir up next democrats move to rein in president trump aposs ability to use military force against iran unless he gets approval from congress we aposll discuss that plus what to expect from the impeachment trial in the senate with democrat chris coons that aposs next commercial break wallace democrats in the senate are looking to drum up bipartisan support to limit the president aposs ability to use military force again iran without congressional approval joining us now here in washington delaware senator chris coons a top democrat on the foreign relations committee and senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen chris coons d de thanks chris great to be with you again wallace ever since president trump took out general soleimani about a week ago democrats have been calling it a major escalation and have been warning of dire consequences but after a pretty ineffectual missile strike iran aposs foreign minister javad zarif said this iran took and concluded proportionate measures in self defense and here aposs what president trump said begin video clip donald trump president of the united states iran appears to be standing down which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world end video clip wallace senator isn apost it possible that president trump aposs action decision worked that it took out one of our worst enemies in the middle east and re established american deterrence coons well it certainly took out one of our worst enemies in the middle east let aposs start there none of us are going to mourn the passing of general qassem soleimani the quds force which he commanded was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of americans in iraq and throughout the region thousands of civilians so nobody should be mourning his passing but the larger question is does it make us safer did it make our position in the region more stable and is there a clear strategy for moving forward president trump ran in no small part on ending the forever wars in the middle east but we aposve got 15 000 more troops in the middle east today and the very real prospect as you were just discussing with the national security advisor of our being expelled from iraq soleimani that aposs been one of his core goals for 15 years he may accomplish our expulsion from iraq and the creation of a big vacuum there in his death in a way he couldn apost in his life wallace but wouldn apost you at least concede that president trump and i know there was a lot of concern oh my gosh this is going to get us into a war that so far the iranians have as the president said stood down said we don apost want to escalate this situation and maybe it made things better not worse maybe coons this is an opening for the president and his whole team to show that there is a path towards negotiation and towards reengagement with iran about what a stronger better longer iran nuclear deal might look like and i hope they aposll take it my concern is that iran has lots of ways that they can take action against us both overt and covert and i don apost think they aposre done trying to seek revenge the real question in front of us i think chris is whether or not president trump and his senior administration officials believe that before taking actions that predictably over months over a long period of time could lead to war with iran they have to come to congress to seek authorization wallace all right we aposre going to get to that in a moment i want to talk about one of the other issues out there the debate over how imminent the threat was that soleimani represented and why they had to take him out here aposs what secretary of state pompeo said on friday begin video clip pompeo this was going to happen and american lives were at risk and we would have been culpably negligent as the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said we would have been culpably negligent had we not recommended to the president that he take this action against qassem soleimani he made the right call and america is safer as a result of that end video clip wallace is the secretary of state lying coons well i won apost say that frankly in the classified briefing that lasted 75 minutes and had virtually the entire senate there we got less detailed information than president trump shared with laura ingraham so we were told repeatedly that there was reliable intelligence of an imminent threat that aposs it there was no more detail than that there was no more specifics than what the president aposs been comfortable sharing on cable news so the larger point about the consultation with congress working with congress on a bipartisan basis to come up with a strategy that will work in the middle east and that gives us some chance of deterring iran that aposs the big and the larger question i aposll remind you president trump taken some very impulsive even erratic moves in the middle east recently his decision to abandon our kurdish allies in syria led to hundreds of isis fighters being released led to a number of our close european partners in the counter isis campaign to be frustrated with us so some skepticism on the part of congress about whether or not there really is a thorough and a deliberate strategy here i think is justified by recent action wallace ok let me pick up on that because you heard me question ambassador o aposbrien the national security adviser about the larger strategy there is no question that as part of the iran nuclear deal the deal that john kerry and barack obama negotiated iran got back billions of dollars in frozen assets and that it used those assets to spread terror give it to hezbollah hamas other bad actors around the middle east would you be willing to concede that as part of the president aposs maximum pressure campaign that at least they turned off the terror money spigot coons there aposs been a real impact on the iranian economy and on the resources available to the terrible iranian regime as a result of the maximum pressure campaign wallace so that aposs a success coons that aposs a positive but here aposs the negative that aposs happening at the same time a real weakening of our alliances and our partnerships what made the iran deal possible was getting most of the world aligned with the united states in putting sanctions pressure on iran that aposs what got them to the table now we aposre in a place where although president trump and i appreciate his saying this is saying here aposs a moment for diplomacy we need nato more engaged in the middle east we need our partners in europe lots of other actions and steps he aposs taken in the last three years have weakened and strained those alliances and those partnerships this recent incident of killing qassem soleimani has further strained some of our partnerships with germany with france with the u k in the region and we need them if we aposre going to build a stronger next iran deal wallace in this week aposs classified briefing the 75 minutes we aposve been talking about you confronted secretary of state pompeo at the end i gather three times what happened coons well i was simply trying to to get us to a point of what i thought would be common agreement that if there aposs an instance of imminent threat article two commander in chief the president has the power to act to protect our troops and our interests overseas but if there aposs an instance as we now seem to be embarking on where the president aposs drawn a clear red line no nuclear weapons for iran and there aposs the real risk of months and months of preparation for a military strike to prevent that of course in that fact pattern you have to come seek authorization there wasn apost a clear commitment to doing that and i think there has to be a democracy when we go to war is stronger when the constitution is followed and the people aposs representatives authorize that conflict i think that strengthens our resolve as a nation and i think that strengthens our hand in the world to ignore congress to not even consult with us let alone seek authorization i think weakens us on the world stage wallace finally speaker pelosi will finally send the articles of impeachment over to the senate this week the senate aposs going to begin its trial how confident are you if not at the beginning at some point that you can get four republicans to come over and agree with the democrat to call key witnesses coons well that aposs what this is all going to come down to is majority leader mcconnell is going to give us as much of a fair trial as four republican senators demand there aposs a key difference between trials and cover ups trials have witnesses cover ups don apost president trump might have had his reasons for being skeptical of the house process in a republican controlled senate i can apost think of any reason he wouldn apost want folks like secretary of state pompeo or national security adviser john bolton who were in the room who were on the e mail chains who know what happened to come to the senate testify and clear his name if he is exonerated in the senate by a purely partisan vote i don apost think he will have been exonerated at all and this is only the third time in our nation aposs history that we aposre going to have an impeachment trial wallace do you have any commitment from senators republican senators that they will vote to call witnesses coons no at this point there aposs just conversations trying to find some reasonable bipartisan path forward to insist on a fair trial i respect that there are republicans who deeply want president trump to have a fair trial i think that aposs what all of us should want but to have a trial where the critical witnesses were blocked by the president from appearing in front of the house to have a trial where there aposs no sworn testimony available is unprecedented president clinton even president nixon directed his closest advisers and cabinet officials to cooperate and in the clinton impeachment trial there was sworn testimony that they were debating about how it would be presented wallace i aposve got about a minute left coons yes wallace president trump says if john bolton is subpoenaed and if john bolton agrees to testify he won apost allow him to discuss their conversations about ukraine take a look begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i would love everybody to testify but there are things that you can apost do from the standpoint of executive privilege you have to maintain that end video clip wallace would any president allow his national security adviser to discuss the conversations they had over national security in the oval office coons if that national security adviser could clear his name by doing so i think most presidents would the executive privilege doesn apost exist to allow you to cover up a crime that aposs what the president aposs being accused of here i think he should want a former national security adviser to testify truthfully in front of the senate wallace and if he says if bolton there are a lot of ifs here coons there aposs a lot of ifs wallace if bolton is allowed to testify and the president invokes executive privilege your response would be what coons you can apost invoke executive privilege to cover up a crime bolton should testify wallace senator coons thank you thanks for coming in coons thank you wallace we aposll be watching what happens this week both on iran and the impeachment trial up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss whether the showdown with iran is over or just taking a short pause commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we caught a total monster and we took him out and that should have happened a long time ago we did it because they were looking to blow up our embassy rep nancy pelosi d ca we must avoid war and the cavalier attitude of this administration oh i inform you by reading my tweets no that aposs not the relationship that our founders had in mind end video clip wallace well president trump defending his decision to kill qasem soleimani while house speaker pelosi criticizes his handling of the operation and it aposs time now for our sunday group jonah goldberg editor in chief of the dispatch fox news political analyst juan williams former dnc chair donna brazile and fox news correspondent gillian turner jonah there i think it aposs fair to say has been a lot of hand wringing from about president trump from democrats that he aposs in the process of getting us into a war in the middle east but after iran aposs i think it aposs fair to say half hearted missile salvo and then iranian officials saying that they have concluded their response is it fair to say at least so far so good jonah goldberg fox news contributor absolutely look as you know i aposm a sort of a trump skeptic but this seems like an unalloyed with the exception of the shooting down of the ukrainian plane this seems like an unalloyed win for the united states of america the intended point of this wasn apost to start world war iii as a lot of people screamed it was in fact to end an escalating cycle where iran was more and more using its own forces rather than proxy forces to try to chase us out of the region and if the trade off is killing is is is taking soleimani off the board in exchange for some empty barracks that is an unalloyed win for the united states what makes it so perplexing is this guy needed ph killing a thousand ways from sunday why the president feels the need to talk about this these embassy attacks as when no one else can confirm it just it gets in the way of what i think is a perfectly solid case on the merits wallace donna and i think it aposs fair to say that there are the democrats had been a lot of doom saying oh this is going to get us into a war this was a risky escalation don apost democrats run a risk here when they raise concerns about the killing of one of the worst people on earth when they immediately rush to the floor of the house and now to the senate and demand war power aposs limitations don apost they risk running looking like they aposre weak on national security donna brazile fox news contributor absolutely not and and here aposs why first of all we have heard four maybe five different conflicting reasons of the imminent threat that the general appeared to have made towards the united states no one mourned his death not a not a democrat or a republican he was a wretched human being the problem that democrats have and i think the problem that most americans is that what is the strategy we knew maximum pressure was to try to get iran back to the table that didn apost work and now we have a situation where the iraq he prime minister is calling upon the united states to begin to figure out the mechanisms to withdraw so no i think the democrats are absolutely right to put a resolution on the floor we know that you know since the aumf was was wallace authorization for the use of military force brazile authorization i mean that is as old as my you know what we need a new rationale for starting wars ending wars or being in the middle east wallace no wait wait i mean george bush started new wars without getting a new aumf barack obama took out gaddafi in libya he didn apost get an authorization for the use of military force i mean talk about being as old as brazile but but but congress had already but congress had already approved of those measures congress did not have wallace they they hadn apost approve taking out qaddafi in libya brazile congress they they congress had already well well we can get into libya congress had already authorized that we need of new resolution chris and and what this and if iraq decides to expel u s forces at a time isis is still you know active this would all have been for not i i just think it was still a huge mistake wallace gillian there aposs the bigger question which which donna raised which is does this administration have a strategy for dealing with iran and you heard my conversation with the national security advisor maximum pressure more sanctions bring them to the table but although treasury secretary mnuchin announced still another round of sanctions on friday they we about sanctioned out and iran is not getting less aggressive they aposre not being more pliable they aposre being more aggressive i mean they aposre you know they they aposve gone after tankers in the persian gulf they went went after the saudi oil facility they aposre pulling out of a nuclear deal is is there a strategy that aposs going to work gillian turner fox news correspondent well first of all there was what precipitated the last ten days of this crisis we everybody i think it bears a reminder was and iran sponsored attack on the u s embassy in baghdad it wasn apost the killing of soleimani that didn apost set this chain of events this particular chain of events in motion it was the attack on baghdad which according to many defense analysts in of itself constitutes an act of war so i think it aposs that bears a reminder for people here the strategy for the trump administration so far with these sanctions has been very successful widespread consensus that they are working a lot of analyst describing them as crippling on the iranian economy but as you mentioned chris the problem now is we are very rapidly reaching the end of their utility as was evidenced on friday when the trump administration announces this new round of sanctions which really were not new sanctions but a sort of re doubling down on industries they aposve already sanctioned in the past i will say about the nuclear deal looking forward another alarming thing for those who want to say mission accomplished and now everything is ok between the u s and iran is our nuclear scientists america aposs best nuclear scientists are now predicting iran aposs seven to 11 months away from developing its own nuclear weapons capability wallace so they aposre closer to breakout turner they aposre they are closer today and they could be even closer if they instead are able to buy components from other countries from other non state actors which is still a possibility wallace juan it was interesting to me this week to see and this isn apost a new thing but it just continues the degree to which president trump wants to be the anti obama his reaction and i think gillian aposs right the precipitating cause for taking out soleimani was the attack of the embassy he said we aposre there aposs not going to be a benghazi on my watch and he continues to attack president trump aposs iran nuclear deal saying that it it juan williams fox news political analyst president obama did wallace president obama sorry nuclear deal because of the fact that it opened the spigot and released billions of dollars to iran for them to spread around the middle east williams you know i call this obama derangement syndrome chris i mean to me from the racist birther lies that he told to now the lies about obama gave this money that aposs now being used to fire missiles at americans the fact is that money was unfrozen as part of the nuclear deal that aposs the fact it aposs nobody giving any and it was their money so it was unfrozen money wallace well but it was frozen williams correct wallace and and the point he aposs making is it gave a maligned regime more resources williams you know what it was their money and what we got out of it was that they agreed to stop development of nuclear weaponry that aposs the deal that we entered into it was a containment plan not appeasement containment of an enemy and it was quite effective now we aposre seeing as we move forward we don apost have the leverage of that nuclear deal the sanctions as you aposve point out repeatedly on this show have not had the effect of slowing iranian aggression so now we don apost have the leverage that came from having them in the nuclear deal what gillian just said about the range of time that they could develop nuclear weaponry puts our key ally in the middle east israel at greater risk we aposre not in position to fight isis at the moment or protect the oil reserves all of this at greater risk because of the provocative action without long term strategy taken by president trump wallace all right we aposre not going to settle this today we aposre not going to settle this in this segment and we have to take a break here but when we come back we aposre now just three weeks from the iowa caucuses the latest on the fast moving democratic race plus what would you like to ask the panel about speaker pelosi sending over the articles of impeachment in the next few days kicking off the trial in the senate just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i think it aposs ridiculous i she should have sent them a long time ago it it just it belittles the process nancy pelosi will go down as probably the least successful speaker of the house of the history of our nation end video clip wallace president trump reaction to house speaker pelosi aposs announcement she aposll finally send the articles of impeachment over to the senate sometime this week and we aposre back now with the panel well we asked you for questions for the panel and on this question of pelosi aposs deciding to finally send over the articles of impeachment we got this on twitter from mya voice which is an interesting name will the senate call relative witnesses with direct knowledge of the president aposs actions and conduct a fair trial juan did pelosi aposs delay at least put a focus on this issue of whether or not to call witnesses and now you hear that republican senator susan collins of maine is working with a few of her other gop colleagues on exactly that issue whether or not to call witnesses williams yes i think that if you were to say what aposs the good of the delay you aposd say number one is the spotlight on fairness of the trial a washington post abc poll this week had 70 percent including 64 percent of republicans saying if you don apost have documents and witnesses this is nothing but a cover up that whole focus now i think is the result of pelosi delaying sending over the articles of impeachment remember on all 15 prior impeachment of federal officials there have been witnesses and documents clinton had witnesses clinton didn apost block other people from testifying but as you point out the only hope is susan collins lisa murkowski maybe mitt romney because you only need 51 votes to change the rules wallace well you need you need one more than those williams yes but you don apost but yes they have 53 republican senators you take away a few and suddenly mitch mcconnell who says he aposs coordinating with the white house council will be in a position of having to accept witnesses wallace gillian what do you make of former national security advisor john bolton saying if subpoenaed he will testify and we heard earlier president trump say he would invoke executive privilege if he did invoke it does john bolton have to live with that or could he just ignore it and say what he wanted to say turner well this is to me one of the more interesting plot lines in the impeachment story john bolton aposs willingness and aversion into going along with the administration at different points in this process the president said friday essentially i will block his testimony because not just because of executive privilege but because of national security concerns and i think for the administration that aposs the more powerful line of argument to get at here with somebody like a bolton unlike with somebody like a mick mulvaney or some other folks wallace but but i don apost know if you know the answer to this if if i understand it aposs an excuse for a witness who wants to take it but if bolton wants to testify in the president says no executive privilege does bolton have to observe that turner well unless goldberg no i think it aposs up to justice roberts to rule on that turner it aposs up ultimately he aposll have to rule on it which ironically will give bolton the outcome he has most desired all along when he initially joined filed to join the charles kupperman lawsuit what his attorney said was he doesn apost want to be the man in the middle that has to choose between following guidance from congressional regulators and from the commander in chief so you all in the courts figure this out and let us know what you want us to do this is a way for bolton to get where he wanted to be anyway a lot of conspiracy theories surrounding why he aposs agreeing to do this now i think it aposs probably simpler than people imagine i think it aposs probably because he aposs going to get the outcome he wanted he won apost have to make the decision wallace meanwhile the iowa caucuses are just three weeks from tomorrow we aposre finally getting there folks and the always reliable often reliable i guess nobody aposs always reliable new des moines register poll is out this weekend it shows bernie sanders back in the lead at 20 percent that aposs up five points from november with warren and buttigieg and biden all closely bunched as you can see with buttigieg who was the leader in the previous november poll down nine points donna given his lead in that poll given how well he aposs doing in new hampshire given the fact that he is the strong leader in fundraising is bernie sanders now the frontrunner in the democratic race brazile oh you know two weeks ago someone said is mayor pete the frontrunner four months four weeks ago it was warren wallace i understand that we aposve got to cover the news brazile yes well yes and you know what and he is the frontrunner he aposs the frontrunner at this hour i suspect that over the next couple of days especially as we prepare for the next debate he aposs going to come under a lot of scrutiny maybe one of the second tier candidates will take a aim a shot at him not literally but in terms of politically look at the end of the day chris we are in no way close to deciding who the nominee is i see pluses and minuses in in the polls for bernie but i also see joe biden as still the the frontrunner overall in the race wallace ok and that brings me to joe biden because the other news to me not just that bernie is doing so well biden in that poll i understand it aposs within the margin of error was in fourth place for all of his support and yes he has a lot of support in the african american community which would come into place once we get to south carolina if joe biden the former vice president the punitive frontrunner finishes fourth in iowa how damaging goldberg i think it aposs damaging but it unlike a lot of these other candidates it wouldn apost be fatal because of the firewall he aposs got in south carolina and in nevada this is in a lot of ways shaping up to me to be really reminiscent of the 2004 kerry versus howard dean dynamic where a large segment of voters were basically voting to the person they thought most likely to beat george w bush and then another segment those are the progressive wing was voting their hearts and desires and all the rest and what aposs interesting about this time around is that the tiebreaker between these two opposing forces of sort of moderates versus you know progressive is actually the african american vote and that seems decisively to be going for biden so i still think biden is a is better placed than than bernie sanders is wallace and let me throw juan another scenario at you and we aposve only got about a minute left you could end up with different winners there are four early races iowa new hampshire nevada south carolina four different winners in all of them wouldn apost that set things up at least theoretically perfectly for michael bloomberg who aposs sitting there on a huge war chest slightly raising rising in the polls for super tuesday williams you know it aposs incredible to me but it does look like the stars are aligning for mike bloomberg if you aposre thinking well could we go to the point where on super tuesday it aposs like 40 percent of the delegates that aposs when he gets in his advertising has been overwhelming he aposs even bought a super bowl ad i think you will see it and to me the idea that he bought a minute on the super bowl i think 10 million it aposs boosted him now to about 6 percent in the polls he aposs now going to you know he can apost participate because he hasn apost raised enough money he just relies on his own but he has a chance that i didn apost think i really didn apost see it but he does have a chance now better than at any point brazile juan he may go up in the polls but remember it aposs about delegates and unless you get to a 15 percent threshold not only statewide but per congressional district you get no delegates williams but in an open convention wallace well and i aposve got to say you cannot watch tv and not see those ads thank you panel see you next sunday up next i aposll be back with a big announcement commercial break wallace now for my announcement i aposve been working for much of the past year on a book project i wanted to find a major event almost everyone knows about and dig deep coming up with new revelations and compelling details that will surprise you the result is countdown 1945 the extraordinary story of the 116 days that change the world it aposs the tale of harry truman aposs sudden rise to the presidency after the death of fdr and the struggle he faces in making one of the toughest decisions ever whether to drop the atomic bomb on hiroshima and obliterate tens of thousands of people but it aposs not just truman as we countdown the days until the bomb is dropped you aposll meet the scientists racing to make sure the weapon works the fiercely competitive flight crews vying to be on the final mission you aposll meet giants of the 20th century like albert einstein and robert oppenheimer dwight eisenhower and george marshall and you aposll meet 10 year old adecco tomora ph who survives the blast at ground zero but l
