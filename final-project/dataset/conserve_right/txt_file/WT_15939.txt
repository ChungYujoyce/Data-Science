apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china s test of an anti satellite weapon increased the number of space debris pieces threatening u s and other nations satellites by more than 9 percent a senior air force space command official said brig gen c donald alston the command s director of space operations told the washington times that the jan 11 test also triggered a comprehensive review of space monitoring efforts within the military s primary space defense command we re tracking actively 15 000 objects in space it was 14 000 or so prior to jan 11 so there s an additional 1 000 as a consequence of the chinese test he said noting that the tracking is a full time job at the command top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time in the anti satellite test china fired a missile into space ramming a weather satellite about 500 miles above the earth other officials have said that the number of pieces is about 1 200 and that they will pose a threat to orbiting satellites for 20 to 30 years gen alston said the test proved that space is a contested realm and has made it more difficult to know the cause of satellite failures before you may have almost exclusively attributed a failure to a space environmental concern now there s more ambiguity about what is the root cause of the problem he said hostile threats to satellites include ground based lasers electronic jammers to disrupt ground to space communications and kinetic and explosive anti satellite weapons china has made a major investment in space including manned spaceflight and space sensors in addition to its space arms gen alston said he also said he is aware of reports that china will have enough anti satellite missiles to destroy all u s low earth orbit satellites by 2010 the chinese have not been forthcoming about what their intentions are so the fact that they ve proven this capability is of concern to us he said space command also is worried that china could build sufficient force structure to magnify that threat he said to deal with space weapons from nations such as china the space command works to understand the environment and ensure that we preserve the capability of u s space systems that provide asymmetrical advantages to u s military forces he said gen alston said the command is conducting a clean sheet examination of space surveillance needs which sensors are available now and what will be needed the review also will look at whether needed upgrades are being done fast enough in most cases i think the answer to that will be yes he said one urgent need is the deployment of a new space surveillance satellite in fiscal 2008 which begins oct 1 that s important to us that we get that up there he said noting that the only current surveillance satellite a 15 year old msx satellite has so exceeded its expected life that that could fail at any time the chinese test also raised the question of whether space systems can be repaired or upgraded while in space to reduce their vulnerabilities to attack or environmental disruption gen alston said reducing the threat from space attacks should be part a broad based effort beyond military countermeasures if we try to solve this kind of problem in one dimension say a military dimension our discussion becomes do we fight in space none of us find that attractive he said other elements of national power should be used to reduce the danger of war in space including diplomacy economic measures and engagement to produce a dialogue aimed to preventing space attacks he said military leaders also are looking at the sensitive question of whether to develop offensive space weapons as a strategic deterrent to china s space arms an alternative to developing new space weapons would be to develop operationally responsive space satellites that would be ready to launch at any time in order to replace immediately those destroyed by an enemy gen alston said there are no indications that u s satellites have been damaged by space debris although there were reports that a french satellite was harmed and space shuttles have been hit by
