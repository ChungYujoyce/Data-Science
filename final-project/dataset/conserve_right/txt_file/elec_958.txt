known for being soft on journalists during his time in office on monday s starting point on cnn giuliani pushed back at cnn morning anchor soledad o brien who started their interview typically by offering the obama talking points for giuliani s reaction but when o brien started insisting that the word cover up was going too far and started asking her assistant miguel for all the obama transcripts giuliani asked man am i debating with the president apos s campaign i mean the defense of the president is overwhelming giuliani simply did not believe that if the obama administration had any savvy they would believe that the terrorist attack on libya erupted out of a spontaneous demonstration over an old youtube clip uploaded from california he thought u n ambassador susan rice should have known this public relations line would flop before she announced it on five sunday network news shows susan rice goes on television four days later i was on cnn with her that morning says it was a spontaneous demonstration he said i knew it wasn apos t i apos m not part of the administration i knew it wasn apos t the day after and she had to know it wasn apos t they were saying it wasn apos t the national security adviser said it was a terrorist plot o brien aired more of the administration spin so the white house now is basically saying the state department dropped the ball the state department is looking and saying listen i apos m just telling you how it goes and they apos re saying there apos s intel issues giuliani shot back who put susan rice on the state department or the political people it was a political appearance on cnn so what they apos re really trying to do is they apos re trying to run out the clock they apos re going to have this investigation the investigation will be after the debate after the election is over so what they apos re trying to do is cover up this scandal as much as possible o brien really started to protest calling something a cover up kind of takes it a further step don apos t you think no wait a second giuliani replied there was a statement was made including by the president of the united states that this was due to this terrible movie about mohammed then o brien grew passionate but he actually didn apos t say it the verbatim the actual verbatim of what he said he did not say it was something other than that but it was mentioned but he did not succinctly say this was due to a movie miguel why don apos t you pull all these transcripts for me we have them all in the back room we can just pull them out giuliani insisted there was information both in the state department and the white house that it wasn apos t a protest there was no protest in advance this sounds like a cover up i mean if this weren apos t a democratic president i think all of you people would be crazy there apos s plenty to make a careful journalist crazy on cnn apos s own state of the union program on sept 16 rice announced let apos s recall what has happened in the last several days there was a hateful video that was disseminated on the internet it had nothing to do with the united states government and it apos s one that we find disgusting and reprehensible it apos s been offensive to many many people around the world that sparked violence in various parts of the world including violence directed against western facilities including our embassies and consulates rice was even clearer in misstating the problem on cbs apos s face the nation what happened in benghazi was in fact initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in cairo almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in cairo prompted by the video rice said cnn would have a tough time locating something president obama actually precisely said on libya and he often lumped that deadly attack together with protests at other embassies but in a sept 20 interview with univision he said of libya i don t want to speak to something until we have all the information what we do know is that the natural protests that arose because of the outrage over the video were used as an excuse by extremists to see if they can also directly harm u s interests miguel could have shown soledad this report from libya by cnn apos s arwa damon from six days earlier libyan security officials have been telling us that for months now they apos ve been warning the united states about this growing extremist threat and that they have been growing ever more concerned about how little control they actually themselves have over the
