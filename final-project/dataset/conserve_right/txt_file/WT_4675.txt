investigation her prepared remarks were obtained by the associated press she left without answering questions new york rep sean patrick maloney a democrat said yovanovitch occasionally had to leave the room because she was overcome with emotion as she was recounting how she was thrown to the wolves in ukraine it is clear to me that she was fired because she was a thorn in the side of those who sought to use the ukrainian government for their own political and financial gain and that includes president trump maloney said lawmakers leaving the meeting would not provide specifics from the confidential deposition but they indicated that yovanovitch provided information that would help with the impeachment inquiry it was compelling it was impactful it was powerful and i just feel

disclose the private conversation trump in a july 25 phone call told ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy that yovanovitch was bad news according to a partial transcript released by the white house neither giuliani nor trump has publicly specified their objections to her she said in her statement friday that she was abruptly told this spring to depart ukraine on the next plane she left her post in may and was later told the president had lost confidence in her and had been pressuring state department officials for many months to remove her she said democrats leading the investigation said they subpoenaed yovanovitch on friday morning after learning late thursday that the state department had directed her not to appear trump has forbidden all government employees to cooperate and yovanovitch remains employed by the state department she is doing a fellowship at georgetown university her testimony in the face of trump s opposition won t be the last as the congressional panels

from office on monday fiona hill a former white house adviser who focused on russia is expected to appear and three current state department officials are tentatively scheduled next week they include gordon sondland who was blocked from appearing this week but whose attorney said he would testify next thursday as for yovanovitch s dealing with pressure from washington the former diplomat who spoke with her said the ambassador refused to do all this offline personal informal stuff and made clear that the u s government had formal ways to request foreign governments help with investigations the state department traditionally relies on mutual legal assistance treaties under which u s and foreign officials agree to exchange evidence and information in criminal investigations in her statement to lawmakers yovanovitch said that false narratives had resulted from an unfortunate alliance between ukrainians who continue to operate within a corrupt system and americans who either did not understand that corrupt system or who may have chosen for their own purposes to ignore it she said she had only minimal contacts with giuliani three that she could recall and none related to the events at issue she speculated that individuals who have been named in the press as contacts of mr giuliani may have believed their personal financial ambitions were stymied by u s anti corruption policy two florida businessmen tied to giuliani were arrested on thursday and are facing federal charges of campaign finance violations an indictment filed in the case alleges that the men who were raising campaign funds for a u s congressman asked him for help in removing yovanovitch at least partly at the request of ukrainian government officials yovanovitch also said in her statement that she had never met hunter biden and that joe biden the former vice president had never spoken to her about his son or the gas company with which he was involved state department officials have said previously that secretary of state mike pompeo had tried to protect her but was forced to concede when he realized the white house was intent on removing her four current and former officials said pompeo arranged for her to have a soft landing after her recall from kyiv the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the confidential arrangement she met with the house intelligence foreign affairs and oversight and reform committees friday despite trump s declaration earlier this week that he would block all officials from testifying in the impeachment probe trump lambastes the investigation daily and now contends it is illegitimate because the full house has not voted on it despite the officials expected testimony next week former ambassador sondland s attorney said he would not be able to produce documents concerning his official responsibilities as they are controlled by the state department democrats want to ask sondland about text messages released last week that show him and two other u s diplomats acting as intermediaries as trump urged ukraine to investigate ukraine s involvement in the 2016 u s election and hunter biden s involvement with a gas company there associated press writers adam geller and jocelyn noveck in new york and lisa mascar
