tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning he pointed to mr barr s recent summary that said the report didn t establish collusion between the trump campaign and russia and that mr barr and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein concluded there wasn t enough evidence to establish that the president tried to obstruct justice there s no way those two good lawyers would have written that kind of letter if there s any issue mr giuliani said mr giuliani said he would support giving all the information in the report to congressional democrats who have demanded that mr barr release a full unredacted version the president has told the attorney general has told everybody the world i am comfortable with
