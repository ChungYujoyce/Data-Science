las vegas the democratic presidential candidates are holding their first debate tuesday night in las vegas it marks the first time frontrunner hillary clinton and her main challenger so far socialist sen bernie sanders i vt will appear on the same stage in this campaign along with the other three candidates this campaign was expected to be a cakewalk for the former first lady but it hasn t turned out that way one big reason seems to be the story that just won t away how she used a private email server to conduct government business it s fed a perception that she can play by a different set of rules even so clinton still has a decent lead nationally over the socialist senator from vermont but sanders is coming on strong he s beating her comfortably in the key state of new hampshire and is close in iowa too plus sanders is the one drawing tens of thousands of people to his events democratic voters seem to be listening intently to his populist messages with the threat from sanders a reality clinton is now trying to reposition herself a little more leftward just recently she came out against president barack obama s big trans pacific partnership free trade agreement that s a reversal because while serving as secretary of state she was for it this new position puts her more in line with the liberal base of her party as of today i am not in favor of what i have learned about it clinton said i don t believe it s going to meet the high bar i have set so tonight the drama will center on how much sen sanders and the other democrats confront clinton directly on the debate stage expect former maryland gov martin o malley to be an instigator he s trying to get traction and has taken some shots at clinton over the last few months as for clinton herself she s trying to avoid a repeat of 2008 when she went in as the heavy favorite then ran into a buzz saw called barack obama this time around the buzz is growing for bernie sanders submitted by escamp on august 31 2015 3 04pm stay informed with the latest from cbn news delivered to your inbox
