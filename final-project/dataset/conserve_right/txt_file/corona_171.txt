nothing to do with what we re talking about mr trump said it s not a way for them to get some of the goodies that they haven t been able to get for the last 25 years i happen to think that a payroll tax cut would be a very good idea it distributes it very evenly among middle class and other workers the economy which was surging until the virus hit is closely tied to mr trump s reelection
