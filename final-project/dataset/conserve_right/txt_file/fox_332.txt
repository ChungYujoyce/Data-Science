to enjoy all the benefits of our website demonstrators in iraq and lebanon have stood their ground for seven weeks but to succeed protest movementsneed credible leaders programmes of reform and at least some control over the levers of power when do demonstrations become a revolution we romanticise the failures of the arab spring but success has its costs too in the modern middle east only the iranian revolution has succeeded in bringing a new ruling class to power but the 1979 revolution failed to bring about what the philosopher michel foucault predicted would be a new political dawn instead it marked the eclipse of both persian constitutionalism and the republican nationalism of former prime minister muhammed mossadeq in the arab world there has been no equivalent the series of revolutions from 1949 in syria to 1969 in libya were military coups while the arab spring was followed by a rebooted authoritarianism across the region there are now new mass uprisings in four countries that were largely spared in 2011 algeria sudan iraq and lebanon will it be different this time surveys such as the arab barometer and the demonstrators themselves tell us that the underlying discontents are the same as in 2011 corruption oppressive and incompetent government and the absence of meaningful opportunities for youthful populations the median age in sudan is 19 in iraq 21 in algeria 28 and in lebanon 29 since 2014 oil prices have halved and economic growth has slowed public debt youth unemployment andenvironmental degradation have increased this second generation of demonstrators is overwhelmingly young in iraq they re mostly aged between 17 and 25 but increasingly has support across generational and religious lines they don t remember the lebanese civil war or the agonies of saddam hussein s rule but they have learned lessons from their immediate predecessors they see the enemy not as an individual but a system a deep state where paramilitary force is disguised as potemkin democracy so far protesters have avoided the dangers of sectarianism and kindled lines of solidarity that cut across national and religious divides in beirut demonstrators
