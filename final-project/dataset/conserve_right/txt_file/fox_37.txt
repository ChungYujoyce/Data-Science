ent trump offers temporary protection for people brought to u s illegally as children in bid to secure border wall funding vice president mike pence breaks down the proposal on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday january 20 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace host and hello again from fox news in washington and if things look a little bit different here today that aposs because of the fact that we have a fire yes a fire in our building on north capitol street and so we are over at our wonderful affiliate wttg in northwest washington but we are going to put on a show today we may not have a lot of the bells and whistles we normally have but just take a little time travel and pretend you are back in the 1950s and you will feel very comfortable about that the ball is now in the democrats apos court after the president made an offer yesterday trading full funding for the border wall 5 7 billion in return for temporary protected status for the dreamers and for refugees in this country as well as reopening the shutdown the disruption keeps growing after the standoff over the president aposs border wall reaches day 30 yes we are into the fifth week of the shutdown and we are honored on this very irregular program to have the vice president of the united states mike pence mr vice president welcome thank you for being with us mike pence vice president thank you chris good to be here wallace ok so we were going to have a piece from kevin corke explaining everything that aposs in this plan but i aposm now just going to ask you briefly what did the president offer pence what the president offered was a good faith compromise to address what is a genuine humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border and end the government shutdown and the senate leadership senator mcconnell have agreed to bring this bill to the floor on tuesday congress will begin its work but really what the president did over the last month and notably over the last two weeks was direct our team to meet with rank and file democrats to find out what they were looking for you know the legislative process traditionally is republicans would offer their solutions democrats would offer amendments but the president said look we want we want to put it all on the table in a very real sense what president trump did hear was he set the table for a deal that will address the crisis on our border secure our border and give us a pathway to reopen the government wallace ok but as you well know house democrats rejected the president aposs plan before he even offered it speaker pelosi called it a quote nonstarter and i want to point out their specific objection they say that it doesn apost reopen the government first which they insist on they say that it doesn apost provide permanent protection for the dreamers and the tps refugees it aposs only three years and they say that the full funding of the president is still demanding 5 7 billion for the wall is a waste of money so i guess my question is is the president willing to sit down and negotiate the differences or it is what he offered yesterday his final offer pence well there aposs a legislative process that is going to begin on tuesday in the united states senate and it was disappointing to see speaker pelosi reject the offer before the president gave his speech i mean look the president is offering a solution and what we have from democrat leadership so far is just some bites and american people want us to work together to resolve these issues wallace wait if i may sir when you say work together does that mean that you are willing to negotiate from what the president said or is that the final offer pence well of course the legislative process is a negotiation and up to this point literally for the last month while the president and i have stayed here in washington and been engaging continuously with democrat leadership and with rank and file members in the house and senate what we heard again and again is we will not negotiate until the president reopens the government well this bill would reopen the government wallace well they are saying reopen the government first and then negotiate about border security and immigration are you rejecting that pence well look i think it was about a week and a half ago the president spoke to speaker pelosi in the situation room and said look if i gave you everything you wanted if i reopen the government and gave you 30 days to work with us on homeland security issues to address the crisis on our southern border would you give me border security and funding for a wall she said no so the president said to us let aposs go to rank and file members and since that time our negotiation team has been sitting down talking to house democrats we aposve been in contact with senate democrats and the president told us to listen and what the american people heard yesterday was statesmanship was the president laying out a genuine compromise even this morning even this morning the washington post said make the deal wallace ok pence because they can see that both sides are getting what they want the president has made it clear that we want border security we want funding for a wall a steel barrier on the southern border we want money for additional technology additional personnel humanitarian assistance we want changes in amnesty laws so that children can apply for amnesty in central american countries all of those things coming together and the president added to that three years of temporary relief for daca recipients wallace ok but pence of temporary crosstalk wallace i aposm not saying whether it aposs reasonable or unreasonable i aposm just saying that democrats aren apost going to accept that package so let me ask you a couple of specific questions pence well i aposm not sure that aposs true chris i aposm not sure that aposs true we aposve had a lot of dialogue wallace well all right let me ask you let me ask you a question the senate is going to take this bill up this week do you have the seven senate democrats that you aposre going to need to break the filibuster yes or no pence well as the president often says we aposll see wallace but you don apost have them right now pence you know i think when the american people have an opportunity to look at this proposal which is truly a balanced good faith compromise when they reflect on what is a real humanitarian crisis on our southern border i mean we have 60 000 people a month attempting to come into this country illegally if 2 000 people a day and for the first time chris ever the vast majority are families and unaccompanied children being exploited by human traffickers and cartels that take cash to have them take the long and dangerous journey it is overwhelming our system and in the midst of that narcotics criminals are coming across our borders 17 000 apprehended last year the american people want action on our southern border they want border security 800 000 federal workers want us to find a way to open the government we wallace you could open the government tomorrow you could open the government tomorrow pence we can do all of that we can do all of that wallace you could open the government tomorrow the house has passed bills to open the government tomorrow why don apost you sign them and open the government and then you can negotiate about this pence well because i mean you know frankly chris what the american people want us to do is to work on the priorities and the american people want us to secure the border crosstalk wallace no i mean isn apost it really that you just want to leverage and that you figure if you don apost keep the government closed that then they are going to go nowhere pence well again i was sitting there i was sitting right next to the president when speaker pelosi said if we reopen the government and took 30 days to negotiate wallace ok pence that she would not give the president funding for wallace i want to ask you one pence border security or the wall so what we want to do is go into the legislative process the president has now embraced and said he is willing to sign a three year extension temporary relief for daca three year extension for people with temporary protective status these are priorities the democrats have had the president has embraced them crosstalk wallace they say they want it to be permanent let me just ask you one more question and then we aposll move on pence now people will start voting and we aposll see where they stand but the most important thing is for the american people to let their voice be heard wallace ok there are immigration hardliners letting their voice be heard and they say what the president offered goes too far and that its amnesty and ann coulter one of those immigration hardliners that we voted for trump and we got jeb isn apost this if it aposs three years i understand but they say it aposs a three year amnesty and you don apost even get a full wall you get part of a wall pence the president made it clear earlier this year that he was open to resolving the issue of dreamers we are talking about 700 000 people who were brought into this country as children the average age was first grade at the time and the president has shown a willingness to address that issue but let aposs be clear what he put on the table wallace so is it amnesty what do you say about the amnesty issue pence it aposs not amnesty we are asking for 5 7 billion for funding on a wall wallace i aposm talking about the dreamers and the tps pence and the president has said that we will support temporary relief for three years for daca recipients and those who are in temporary protected status this is not amnesty there aposs no pathway to citizenship there aposs no permanent status here at all which is what amnesty contemplates what is this is is a good faith effort to address the issue bring relief to daca recipients democrats have proposed in the bridge act a three year reprieve that could be renewable the president has embraced three years temporary relief and again i think is the american people look at this chris they aposre going to see this for what it is president trump said bring me all the ideas from both sides let aposs put them all on the table the president has made it clear what he would support wallace ok pence now it aposs time for the senate and the house to start voting to secure our border and reopen the government wallace i want to talk to about a couple of other subjects the buzzfeed report that came out on friday that the president directed his former fixer michael cohen to lie to congress the special counsel made a rare public statement saying it isn apost true what does that tell you about robert mueller special counsel who the president keeps accusing of conducting a witch hunt that he came out one of his where statements to say this attack on the president is not true pence well the president expressed his appreciation to the special counsel for clarifying that that report was inaccurate but i think what it says more about is the obsession of many in the national media to attack this president for any reason for any allegation for any report in the media i mean it was remarkable what we saw happening for 24 hours in the media on the basis of the report that appeared in buzzfeed and i just think it aposs one of the reasons why people are so frustrated with many in the national media and the constant obsession on this look this administration crosstalk wallace if i may because i really want to move along here what about the house democrats some of whom would say if true but if it aposs true we need a resignation or impeachment pence again the media aposs obsession on this issue wallace i aposm talking about of congress pence and frankly the reflexive willingness of the president aposs critics in the democratic party to accept the worst facts and the worst interpretation look the american people expect better this administration has fully cooperated with the special counsel produced over a million documents the special counsel will complete his work and we will have all the facts the president has maintained he aposs done nothing wrong the american people the american people ought to be confident that our administration is cooperating and frankly this was a week where i think the american people saw the hyper partisanship among democrats to assume the worst about this president and many in the national media aposs willingness to assume the worst about the president and the reality is what the american people want us doing with the president sought to do yesterday with layer framework for where we could work together let aposs start talking to one another wallace even though we are in a different studio i aposm going to try to move you along president trump has just announced another summit meeting with kim jong un of north korea for late next month this week the president said we have made quote tremendous progress with north korea on the other hand on wednesday you said we are still waiting for them to make your words concrete steps so which is it we made tremendous progress or since the singapore summit last june are we still awaiting any concrete steps they don apost seem to go together pence well they go perfectly well together look think about where we were two years ago when the president and i took our oath of office two years ago today we had a regime in north korea that was testing nuclear weapons that was firing missiles over the sea of japan making menacing statements against the united states and our allies crosstalk wallace but u s intelligence says they are still continuing to make more nuclear fuel and more missiles pence no testing what the president talks refers to no because of his strong stance and because of his engagement with kim jong un directly at that first summit in singapore no testing of nuclear weapons no firing of missiles i had the great honor of being in hawaii when the remains of our fallen heroes in the korean war crosstalk wallace but they are not denuclearizing pence home but to the point and other president will be announcing details in the days ahead the meeting that took place this week confirmed there will be a second summit and at that summit we will be laying out our expectation for north korea to take concrete steps to begin to make real the denuclearization that kim jong un committed to and again the president is very optimistic the communications that i aposve seen between him and chairman kim have been truly remarkable wallace i aposve got one last pence the president believes that we can make real progress and we are going to continue to strive forward wallace i got one last question for you this week you defended the president aposs decision to pull u s troops out of syria and here aposs the quote normally in these circumstances we aposd have a sound bite we are bringing our troops home the caliphate has crumbled and isis has been defeated but you were briefed before that statement about the fact that there had been this horrific suicide bombing that killed four americans is that with the defeat of isis looks like pence chris first and foremost our hearts go out to the families of those four american heroes and we are praying especially for them yesterday as there remains returned to dover air force base in presence of the president of the united states but look the progress that we have made against isis since this president came into office has truly been remarkable after president obama withdrew american forces from iraq in 2011 we literally saw this isis caliphate rise up and overrun vast areas of syria and iraq that had been won by the american soldier president obama began the process of a bombing campaign two years later but president trump changed the rules of engagement he told our military his commander in chief to go after them and our soldiers and the americans in the fight along with our allies have literally crushed the isis state now as i also said in that same meeting the president made the decision as commander in chief to hand off the fight against isis in syria to our coalition partners we are working in the process of doing that the president wants to bring our troops home but recognize there are remnants there are isis fighters still in the region but we aposve taken back 99 percent of the territory that the caliphate had claimed in a very real sense the isis state has been defeated but we will not rest or relent until we drive isis not only from the region but from the face of the earth wallace mr vice president thank you thanks for talking with us and thank you especially for switching signals instead of going to one place coming here pence you bet chris wallace you really saved our bacon thank you sir pence good to see you up next how democrats will respond to the president aposs offer is it enough to end of the nearly one month government shutdown we aposll talk to the number three democrat in the house house majority whip james clyburn that aposs next commecial break wallace the president offered concessions to the democrats this weekend but as we told you when our interview with vice president pence they rejected it before the president even officially made his offer we aposre going to be talking now to get reaction from the number three democrat in the house jim clyburn of south carolina congressman welcome back to fox news sunday rep james clyburn d s c house majority whip thank you so much for having me chris wallace why flatly reject the president aposs offer which yes it calls for more money for the wall but on the other hand it does offer temporary protection for the dreamers temporary protection for those tps refugees and would reopen the government why not sit down and negotiate isn apost that a reasonable opening offer clyburn well thank you so much for having me you know what we are trying to do here is get the government open and what we said to the president is let aposs open up the government we could do that as you said tomorrow morning he has bills that he could sign and could open the government up right away let aposs not hold the american people especially the federal workers hostage to these negotiations and hopefully we will open with what he has put on the table and let aposs go back and forth on this and see where we can find common ground we are all for negotiating and we would love to have a permanent fix for daca and tps just as he wants a permanent wall i think it aposs a nonstarter for him to ask for a permanent wall and for us to have a temporary fix just think about what happened to daca children if you aposre finishing high school and get a temporary three year fix it means by the time you got to your junior year of college you are under threat of having this rug ph pulled out from under you never being able to finish school just as the president did when he came into office and got rid of what president obama had done for daca recipients and so this is the kind of stuff we want to sit down and put some stability in people aposs lives and have some permanent solutions to this immigration problem and the president aposs team is the one who continues to play games with us he gets a permanent fix for his wall and we get a temporary fix wallace congressman clyburn clyburn yes wallace yes so i just want to make sure bottom line are you saying no negotiations until the president reopens the government and are you saying as speaker pelosi does under no circumstances no money new money for the wall clyburn no i aposm not saying that i aposm saying yes to the first part to the second part it seemed as if the president started talking about barriers in a statement yesterday and as you realize i have been talking about barriers for a long time a smart wall will be a barrier a smart wall would be using drones using sensors using x ray equipment to be an effective wall not just something that would be a monument to one aposs existence but to be a deterrent at the border and to be an effective barrier for people who are trying to come in illegally and while we aposre doing that wallace but congressman clyburn let aposs fix our ports of entry yes wallace ok i was going to say is look with the president is offering on his side protection yes temporary but protection for the dreamers and tps refugees more money for immigration judges more money for border patrol more money for detention beds humanitarian support and drug detection technology don apost democrats and up looking like you don apost care about border security and that you don apost want to reopen the government clyburn well i don apost know how it may look to someone but all i would ask is look at the billion dollars that was put on the table before the president had his statement on yesterday 450 million for hiring new judges hiring new personnel border policeman and another 550 billion for ports of entry for having the infrastructure that we need so that is already on the table so i don apost know if the president did anything that was new all he did was regurgitate the stuff that we have already given him in the past several months wallace but just to make clear you aposre saying no negotiations no compromise until he agrees to reopen the government is that correct clyburn that aposs absolutely correct i can apost see us keeping federal employees 800 000 people out of work while we go back and forth on negotiations these negotiations could take three or four weeks we ought to open the government up we can pass a continuing resolution for 30 days get the government open get people back to work and then let aposs sit around the table and see where the common ground is it may be just a simple as taking temporary off the tps fixes and i would hope that his tps fix will include those countries where i find my roots where he seemed to be so dismissive of some time ago and that is haiti african countries temporary protected status for all people seeking to come to this country wallace congressman i want to switch to two other subjects before we let you go first buzzfeed special counsel robert mueller as i just discussed with the vice president knocked down the buzzfeed story that the special counsel had evidence that the president directed michael cohen to lie to congress now as soon before he did before he knocked the story down house democrats jumped on the story i want to read a couple of the quotes from what they said jamie raskin democrat of maryland said we don apost know if it aposs true of course but already people of course are saying this is the matter of the gravest urgency david cicilline said congressman from rhode island if true this is i think the most serious threat to the trump presidency that we aposve seen so far should your members be more cautious because it almost seemed in this rush to judgment as if there were a lot of house democrats that want to impeach the president clyburn well chris when you preface her statement with if this is true that to me gives you all the cover you need and i would say that if it is true now if they had said something as if it were true then that would be one thing to be concerned about but they aposve all said if this is true there are a lot of things that i hear daily if it were true i would be concerned about it sometimes you would preface it with that and sometimes you just don apost say anything so i don apost think that my democratic friends in any way rushing to judgment because the qualified right upfront if this is true wallace all right i want to talk to this week and of course is martin luther king weekend you aposre going to be speaking tomorrow in the state capital in columbia on an observance of dr king aposs birthday some members democrats who are potential candidates in 2020 are going to be there a couple of questions first of all is there anybody so far in this crazy field that could be as many as two dozen candidates is there anybody that stands out for you and more importantly and specifically is there any one of them who you think could advance dr king aposs legacy clyburn oh quite a few of them could advance that legacy i think i don apost know who all is going to run but you aposve got people like joe biden who spends a lot of time in south carolina joe biden has demonstrated a commitment to martin luther king jr aposs legacy you aposve got cory booker kamala harris these are three people that i aposve seen and heard from mostly in south carolina but eric swalwell was here last night we have others who will be coming very soon i talked with kirsten gillibrand i think she told me that she aposs on her way to south carolina i worked with all of these people i think they are outstanding people they will make great public servants they already are great public servants and so any one of them would do a good job of pushing that legacy remember in fact i will be talking about this tomorrow i aposve told people a lot aside from the bible i think one of the most timeless documents i aposve ever read in my life was martin luther king jr aposs letter from the birmingham city jail i aposve read that letter about 100 times i read it again not all of it but i read some of it again last night and what jumped off the page at me is injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere and that reminds me so much of what we are going through today the injustice that we see taking place at our southern border the injustice that we see taking place in fair housing these things are things that democrats have been pushing for us to get fixed and i think that anyone of these candidates would be good messengers for that wallace congressman clyburn thank you thank you so much for joining us today and we aposll of course be following what happens next in this shutdown thank you sir robert mueller aposs office breaks its silence to knock down that buzzfeed story that president trump ordered his former fixer to lie to congress up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss what it means for democrats pushing for impeachment and for the president aposs attacks on the media commercial break begin video clip president donald trump i appreciate the special counsel coming out with a statement last night i think it was very appropriate that they did so i very much appreciate that i think that the buzzfeed piece was a disgrace to our country end video clip wallace president trump with rare praise for special counsel robert mueller after he knocked down that buzzfeed story the president directed his former lawyer michael cohen to lie to congress and it aposs time now for our sunday panel speaker of the house newt gingrich former democratic congresswoman donna edwards and co host of benson and harf on fox news radio guy benson speaker gingrich first of all welcome to our fox affiliate wttg if you knew how we had scrambled newt gingrich former house speaker people tell me by the way that you were the first person to notice the fire wallace speaker well we could all smell it how damaging is the buzzfeed story and the almost total knockdown by the special counsel to the media gingrich well it comes on top of the previous week aposs new york times story that such trump could be a russian agent until you get to paragraph nine when it said actually there aposs no proof at all that this story is true i mean you had this continuous wallace this was a story that there was a counterintelligence investigation by the fbi gingrich right yes and then they said they found nothing and it aposs not true wallace right that he was a russian agent gingrich but the headline wallace right gingrich trump said about 90 percent negative and i did tell him he tweeted about this i said to him i think he aposs had the worst media hostility since lincoln i think you cannot find any other president who has been a relentless and ending assault much of it dishonest and of course mueller frankly saved my bacon because i was on fox and friends and had not seen the report and they said well what about buzzfeed and i said it aposs a lie and luckily it turned out mueller said yes it aposs not true wallace yes you did say it was a lie very quickly gingrich that aposs right wallace congresswoman edwards as i discussed with congressman clyburn as soon as this story came out there was this almost rush to judgment i aposm going to get back to the media i promise guy but there was a rush to judgment by a lot of democratic congressman and yes they said if true but they almost seem to want it to be true i just want to read one piece of sound here but we don apost have any sound so i aposll read it to you representative joaquin castro of texas if the president directed michael cohen to lie to congress then that aposs a clear case of participating in perjury and obstruction of justice and he should resign but if he doesn apost resign he should be impeached does that hurt the credibility of the democrats in congress in the house that before they even knew whether this was true yes they did say if it aposs true but man we aposre already talking about impeachment and resignation donna edwards d md former u s congresswoman look i think that what you are really from the democratic leadership and from the house chairmen and women who will really control this agenda is you actually hear a little restraint saying let aposs wait until the report is issued and one of the reasons is because there have been so many multiple reports of supposed information coming out and around the mueller investigation and really what we aposve learned is through indictments we aposve learned through court proceedings but we don apost really know what robert mueller has and i think it aposs really important for us to wait for that investigation to complete itself and move ph wallace so do you think some of your former colleagues made a mistake edwards well i you know what i as i think the speaker has said she is not the language police she is not the one who can police all of the comments or other of members and they did preface it with if it aposs true but what you hear from the leadership is we aposre going to wait for the mueller report and that aposs been pretty consistent i do think that there are things that are outside of the mueller investigation in other courts in other jurisdictions that actually could give rise to consideration of investigation for impeachment in the house of representatives the robert mueller report the russia investigation has not come to that fruition yet wallace guy as somebody said the other day the worst thing that can happen is in our business is to have an exclusive that stays an exclusive guy benson townhall com right wallace meaning that nobody else corroborates it and as you know everybody on friday was rushing like crazy trying to say all right you know they aposve got it is it true and we couldn apost get it and eventually it was knocked down by the special counsel how damaging do you think this is to the credibility not just of buzzfeed but of the media in general benson well it aposs a black eye for buzzfeed there aposs no question about that and you aposre right this story hung out there for hours and hours and hours and then into the next day and beyond just that another thing that smelled a little fishy was the two journalists who reported the story seemed to contradict each other the next day about whether or not they had seen the supposed documentary evidence that allegedly backed up this explosive claim one said we didn apost see it one said they did that was odd and then of course the statement comes out from mueller i think broadly speaking about the media there was a sense of palpable disappointment among many of our colleagues in the mainstream media they wanted so badly for this to be true this was finally the one that was going to get the president and watching them sort of gravel with that extraordinary statement from mueller in real time was sort of entertaining wallace why do you think mueller who has been so silent this whole time that he felt he had to come out and knocked down this story benson because it was so explosive and i think that the president was going to be damaged by the story even being out there and i think to his credit he decided that he wanted to set the record straight i think he enhanced his own credibility here by saying look i am a fair minded person i don apost want the president to be treated unfairly i think it aposs very hard to argue that this is a witch hunt after the special counsel did precisely what he did this week which is the right thing to do wallace speaker gingrich i don apost want to bring back old bad feelings but you and republicans paid a price for the impeachment of president clinton back in 1998 what advice would you give to house democrats based on the mistakes that all of you made not to repeat gingrich well you aposve put me in an awkward position here wallace well that is kind of what i aposm paid to do gingrich well look i would say first of all everybody should read jimmy breslin aposs how the good guys finally won which is about tip o aposneill and watergate and the mistake i made was not following tip aposs leadership tip was very cautious he was very careful he kept it as non partisan as possible he brought peter rodino in who people thought was a very fair judiciary chairman and said do the right thing the right way and i think that we got a little too involved in personal feelings about clinton himself and in in the whole way that the report came out at the same time you know the president and to be defensive for a second president clinton did lose his license to practice law he did have to pay a fine i mean there were a lot of things going on there that were complicated but i think that the challenge for the democrats and the media is there aposs very high likelihood that nothing aposs going to happen that leads to conviction i mean as we discovered you know to impeach in the house is one thing but then you aposve got to get a conviction in the senate and there is zero possibility that this senate is going to convict wallace all right i got less than a minute left congresswoman edwards is there anything that speaker gingrich said that you think maybe we should follow that advice edwards well i mean i do think that speaker pelosi has indeed been exercising the kind of restraint that speaker gingrich is indicating wallace but she aposs having a little trouble with some of her members edwards but she is the leadership wallace i agree edwards and she aposs the one who aposs going to decide ultimately how and whether this goes forward and i think that she has said she aposs waiting for the mueller report to come out i think that that aposs a responsible thing to do and you know the other members have to decide for themselves what it is that they aposre going to say about it along the way wallace all right we have to take a break here but when we come back president trump announces a second summit with north korean leader kim jong un we aposll discuss chances for a breakthrough plus what would you like to ask the panel about how the feud between president trump and speaker pelosi is affecting prospects for ending this shutdown and reopening the government we aposll get to all of that in the next segment commercial break wallace president trump making an offer to democrats yesterday in exchange for border wall funding and an end to the government shutdown and we aposre back now with the panel well speaker gingrich what do you make of the president aposs offer and given the immediate rejection by democrats does it do anything to break the logjam gingrich well i think it does a lot and particularly because senator mcconnell has already said he aposs going to move it in the senate and i have suspicion that they have the votes to get that out of the senate wallace you think they have seven democratic votes gingrich i think they do that aposs my guess there aposs a the white house is very optimistic that they listed carefully that when you add in help for the dreamers and you add in help for the people who are on the refugee status wallace that was temporary we aposve got to say three years gingrich yes well but three but three years wallace right gingrich well three years compared to zero is a lot and i think in addition i think the pressure from 800 000 families to get this government reopened and their salaries paid is very real so i think there are a number of people i aposve already seen individual democrats who have said yes i could vote for the wall if that aposs what it takes so the challenge for speaker pelosi is real simple she aposs she should be challenged to bring up her bill and to allow kevin mccarthy the republican leader to have a substitute and see whether or not there are 25 or 30 democrats who side with mccarthy because her bill will not be signed into law and will not in fact be taken up by the senate wallace and and what you think of and we heard from clyburn again we aposve heard it from pelosi we aposve heard it from hoyer we heard it from clyburn this morning no negotiations until you reopen the government gingrich right well first of all it aposs a nonstarter they don apost accept the fact that whether they dislike him or liken him trump is the president and as president he can veto anything he wants to and furthermore he has a senate majority leader mcconnell who won apost even take up the bill unless he aposll sign it second i served with reagan tip o aposneill didn apost help reagan tip o aposneill would bring a bill up he would allow a republican substitute the original tax cuts were a bipartisan substitute and because o aposneill understood he could be defeated on the floor and his left wouldn apost be that mad but if he personally compromised they would have killed him pelosi can apost compromise you you aposve got two years now of her screaming no but what can happen is a bipartisan majority can run the house wallace ok all right we aposll bring congressman edwards in here here aposs what president trump said yesterday about speaker pelosi walls work and we need walls and whether it aposs personal or not it aposs not personal for me she pelosi is being controlled by the radical left did the president yesterday make an offer that pelosi can apost refuse or an offer she can apost accept edwards no i mean it this was not an offer in compromise let aposs look at it it was funding for a wall that democrats and the majority of the american people oppose it was temporary reprisal and temporary protective status and for the for the dreamers something that the president took away and so you don apost give back something that you took away and and say that that is an offer in compromise and i think that the speaker pelosi recognizes this i think that she recognizes that the american people are with her on this and you know president trump needs to open government and they can legitimately debate what the funding is for for border security wallace yes but he say he aposs if he opens the government that he aposs going to lose all his leverage and he asked her will you give me a wall in 30 days if i open the government 30 days and negotiate will you ever give me money for the wall and she said no edwards well the american people don apost want a wall but here aposs the thing wallace well no no edwards you can apost hold wallace you you can apost speak for the american people with all due respect edwards well i just look at the the polls that say that they don apost support the wall but look you can apost wallace but there are millions who do want it edwards look you cannot hold 800 000 americans hostage and not pay them and some of whom are working and not pay them because you aposre not getting your way and so i don apost think the president is negotiating in good faith when he puts on the table a wall and temporary status temporary status is what he took away imagine i think what mr clyburn said is right you aposre three years into your into going to college and then you what did your fourth year because you know longer have status an employer trains you for for a job and then says well i really can apost have you because in three years you aposre going to be gone wallace right edwards this is not an acceptable offer in compromise and the president needs to come to the table wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from mark strickler who writes trump couldn apost do it with ryan and republicans why should pelosi be any different guy how do you answer mark because he does make a point which is when you had a republican house and a republican senate with ryan in charge in the house you still didn apost get much funding for the wall benson yes that aposs a clean hit on the republicans there aposs no question about that barack obama and the democrats did the same thing they punted on immigration for two years did nothing and then sort of stirred the pot once the republicans won the house the same has now occurred with the parties in reverse and that aposs not a defense of the republicans at all with respect congresswoman i feel like the answer could be if it aposs not an acceptable offer from the president that aposs fine the democrats should counter offer with something as opposed to with nothing at all today in the washington post the editorial board which is not a right wing editorial board they wrote quote trump aposs offer should be welcomed if not the final word to refuse to even talk until the government reopens does no favors to sideline federal workers and contractors and i think that aposs exactly right the president has made his position very clear he has now made an offer with a compromise on the table and if nancy pelosi and her team profess to care so deeply about these workers play ball come back with something wallace ok i want to turn to another big story this week and that was the announcement on friday for president trump that he aposs going to hold another summit meeting late next month with north korean leader kim jong un speaker gingrich does this summit make sense it aposs true there have been no more ballistic missile tests there have been no more nuclear test but there really has been nothing that we would call denuclearization and in fact u s intelligence says that they aposre continuing to produce more nuclear fuel and more missiles so why give them another summit gingrich you know i aposve i aposve lived with this problem for a very long time and we first negotiated what i was speaker and bill clinton was trying to negotiate with the north koreans and it aposs almost always been the same thing but something very different happened recently kim jong un went on national television and made an address in a western suit in a western studio looking like a modern part of the regular world now by north korean standards that was a revolutionary moment and he has been talking with the south koreans who very much want this summit and i think that this is a part of continuing moving in the direction of getting him engaged into the modern world and i think wallace but but does this bother you because it gives him a pr bonanza and it also weakens the international sanctions since singapore last july or june rather the chinese are trading more with them the russians are trading more with them so you aposre giving them a lot and so far we aposve gotten nothing gingrich well but our i think our sanctions have been very very effective and nothing we do whether meeting with him or not meeting with him affects the russians and the chinese i mean they aposre going to act out of their own belief but i think that it also helps to have him meet with the president and understand how firm we are on these things and i think that secretary pompeo aposs been very clear about this as secretary of state so i i don apost regard this as a boondoggle or as a mistake i frankly expected it to happen and i think that there have been some signs of opening up north korea in ways that are pretty close to revolutionary wallace ok i aposve got less than a minute left congressman edwards this summit makes really no sense i mean summits are especially with the adversaries there aposs supposed to be a reward for better behavior and the north koreans actually haven apost exhibited that and appearing in a western suit is not the same thing as denuclearizing and so i think it aposs important to continue a dialogue with the north koreans at a diplomatic level but not a president meeting with the with the north koreans wallace guy benson i agree with the congresswoman on this one i just i don apost think that they have shown enough to be rewarded again wallace and so at as to the point of the speaker that it engages them keeps them in the game benson they have to be in the game right if they want these sanctions taken off if they want to be part of the international community i just don apost think you give that level of respect to kim jong un again absent some major progress and i think we haven apost seen that wallace all right thank you panel see you next sunday thank you for scrambling and getting her today up next feeding the furloughed relief for some of the thousands not getting paid during the longest government shutdown in history commercial break wallace how does a famed restaurateur get nominated for the 2019 nobel peace prize well here aposs an update on one of our power players of the week begin videotape wallace voice over jose
