military support and brotherhood to the chinese people battling the scourge of an overwhelming often brutal invasion the pilots in p 40 flying tigers and their counterparts flying cargo supply missions over the burma hump showcased in deeds what american spirit is often about helping a friend in need as allies to defeat evil it was a remarkable moment in u s chinese relations a we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the end of world war ii we should be demonstrably mindful of what bold presidential leadership achieved for the world then and what china and the united states can achieve

china and the united states are dependent on each other the world has moved from the wright brothers to neil armstrong in a blink of an eye we have manipulated the atom and made information accessible

have not always been at odds our countries share a unique friendship that has been lost in the annals of history and political differences more than two centuries have passed since the u s merchant ship the empress of china set sail for china her crew the goods they brought and the new gust of spirit that arrived set the template for harmonious exchanges between china and the united states then as the storms of world war ii thundered down there was another arrival that opened the door to the east that reminded the chinese of our shared visions and that left a legacy of peace and cooperation my grandfather gen claire l chennault revitalized a defeated chinese air force and defended china s skies with his flying tigers chennault and his american volunteer group were instrumental in weakening japanese forces and saving millions of chinese people in world war ii along with american cargo pilots my grandfather and the flying tigers continued what had been decades of respectful fraternal cooperation and friendship between americans and chinese officially known as the 1st american volunteer group of the chinese air force in 194142 the flying tigers comprised pilots from the united states army air corps navy and marine corps recruited under clear authority from president franklin roosevelt to save lives and provide humanitarian and military decisiveness the shark faced nose art of the flying tigers remains among the most recognizable image of any individual combat aircraft or unit of world war ii the tigers first saw combat on dec 20 1941 they destroyed 299 enemy aircraft while losing only 12 pilots chewing gum and tape held the planes together and my grandfather s tactical innovations kept them victorious in the skies they were usually outnumbered at least 10 to one and never beaten in battle equally stalwart were the cargo pilots who suffered great losses of personnel and equipment the first mission over the hump was on april 8 1942 almost 70 years ago to

differences between our two countries in 1949 chennault ended his memoir way of the fighter with this it is my fondest hope that the sign of the flying tiger will remain aloft just as long as it is needed and that it will always be remembered on both shores of the pacific as the symbol of two great peoples working toward a common goal in war and peace this way the sino u s friendship can flow
