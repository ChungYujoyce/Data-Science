right way mr wolf said mr trump who is campaigning hard to win the state again has joined in a public fight with the governor the president said monday that pennsylvanians want their freedom now and they are fully aware of what that entails the democrats are moving slowly all over the usa for political purposes they would wait until november 3rd if it were up to them don t play politics be safe move quickly mr trump tweeted at a press conference monday mr trump again cited pennsylvania as a state that is slow walking its reopening for partisan purposes there just seems to be no effort in certain blue states to get back into gear the president said and the people aren t going to stand for it they want to get back the governor said of mr trump s visit i would urge anybody coming to pennsylvania to respect our efforts to stay safe to keep people safe and businesses wherever he visits i hope he does everything in his power to keep employees safe u s rep susan wild a democrat who represents lehigh county was more hostile about the president s visit to her district pictures of the lehigh valley will look great in your next ad but people aren t getting sick along party lines she tweeted at the president it s not about politics it s about policy and you ve failed them so when you pose with our frontline workers wear a mask it s literally the least you can do to date the

ranks 9th in deaths per 100 000 population infection rates are higher in the more populous southeast and eastern regions including philadelphia the battle over reopening comes less than six months before mr trump hopes to capture pennsylvania in november against mr biden who is a native of the state though he represented delaware in congress the president narrowly won pennsylvania in 2016 becoming the first gop presidential candidate since george h w bush in 1988 to do so but mr biden is leading the president by 6 5 percentage points in the real clear politics average of polls the
