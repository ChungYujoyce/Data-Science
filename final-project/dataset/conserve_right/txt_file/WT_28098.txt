questions from senators thursday about a defense department budget maneuver that democrats said amounts to a political gimmick the target of the their criticism was the trump administration s decision to put 98 billion into a war account outside of the pentagon s base budget in order to stay within congressional caps on defense spending calling it a slush fund and a shell game members of the senate

should be in the regular budget but he said the pentagon was trying to be transparent with congress there is no slush fund he said the senators also complained that the department has not answered their repeated requests for details on what military projects could be cut or delayed in order to pay for the border wall they said shifting that money to the wall would essentially put an indefinite

touched but those without contracts could be vulnerable shanahan eventually promised that he would deliver the list of at risk projects to congress later thursday they said that in any case money for

can contribute but it is not about cost plus 50 percent defense officials have acknowledged that the pentagon has been asked to gather data on the costs of keeping troops in other countries and how much those nations contribute to the expenses shanahan also said the u s and its partners in syria have liberated virtually all the territory the islamic state group once held but he did not declare
