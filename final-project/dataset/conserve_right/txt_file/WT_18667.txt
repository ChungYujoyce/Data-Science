s government has again blocked certification of a new russian intelligence aircraft that conducts legal spying flights under the 1992 open skies treaty the united states has not signed the certification of the tu 214 aircraft at this time according to white house national security council guidance language this does not preclude the united states from certifying the new aircraft following further consultations in washington the guidance said rejection of the new aircraft was first reported wednesday by russia s official military newspaper krasnaya zvezda red star the tu 214 surveillance aircraft would conduct missions over the united states canada and europe under the treaty pentagon and u s intelligence officials say the russian spy flights using advanced sensors capable of seeing through clouds and some structures would compromise military secrets sergei ryzhkov head of the russian nuclear risk reduction center told krasnaya zvezda that the united states provided no explanation for the refusal to approve the aircraft in breach of the open skies treaty provisions the head of the u s delegation refused to sign the final document without giving any explanations or reasons and citing direct instructions from washington he said we insist that the u s side return to the open skies treaty framework and demand that the current situation be explained with reference to the treaty s provisions a total of 72 experts from 23 states visited the kubinka airfield near moscow from sept 2 until tuesday to examine the new tu 214 which employs digital imaging equipment for open skies inspections all visiting foreign delegations approved the aircraft except the united states the krasnaya zvezda said the national defense authorization act signed by president trump last month contains a provision restricting implementation of the treaty section 1242 prohibits the pentagon from spending any funds on arms control implementation of the open skies accord until the president certifies to congress that the administration has imposed countermeasures for russian violations under open skies specifically the legislation blocks all funding that would allow voting or approval for state parties to the treaty to certify infrared or synthetic aperture radar sensors that provision is directed at the radar and sensors on the tu 214 the legislation says funds can be used to approve the aircraft only if the defense secretary certifies that allowing the use of the new sensors would not undermine u s national security it also requires a report on the costs of countermeasures against russian overflights using infrared and synthetic aperture radar sensors the report must assess the counterintelligence risks and vulnerabilities to russian flights in
