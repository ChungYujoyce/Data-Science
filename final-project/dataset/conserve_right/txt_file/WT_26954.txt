of this committee can have a ton of examples of where the defense department has wasted money shamelessly committee chairman adam smith said wednesday rejecting gop calls for a higher spending mark the washington state democrat argued that given an additional 17 billion the pentagon will not be efficient with the dollars mr thornberry fired back saying the notion that you don t give them what they want and that s just going to squeeze out ways has empirically been proven not to be the case pointing to a rise in training accidents within the military when spending was slashed the texas
