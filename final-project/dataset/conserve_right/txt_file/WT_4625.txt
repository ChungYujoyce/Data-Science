trump repeatedly defended himself against what he called the deranged impeachment witch hunt and accused democrats of doing anything to take him down and invalidate the results of the 2016 election

always good for the president to help out republicans up and down the ticket said rick gorka a spokesman for trump s campaign and the national republican party he needs reliable partnerships and strong leaders in the states in order to continue to enact his policies so this is a way to lend his support to tate reeves to close out this election strong reeves has sought to tie hood as closely as possible to national democrats such as house speaker nancy pelosi who are deeply unpopular in a state that voted heavily for trump in the last presidential election hood says reeves and other republicans have underfunded schools and ignored the financial plight of rural hospitals while giving tax breaks to big businesses hood has not invited national democratic figures to mississippi he s running campaign commercials that show him with his family his pickup truck and his hunting dog buck in one hood unpacks a rifle and says that tate reeves and his out of state corporate masters are spending money on a bunch of lies gorka said the party was confident heading into tuesday s election day we re looking at a strong possibility of winning in mississippi but also flipping seats in louisiana and keeping the one in kentucky he said so the way we always approach any election is we invest to win both with data and infrastructure but also with the most precious resource the
