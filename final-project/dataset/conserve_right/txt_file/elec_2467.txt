 yesterday we told you about the bloomberg poll showing hillary clinton ahead of donald trumpby 12 points in the general election noting that she has now led in nine straight polls dating back to mid may even more worrisome for republicans is trump s average support languishingin the high 30 s even after his nice polling bump after locking up the gop nomination let s sayyou re inclined to dismiss direct head to head polling we ve argued that it s getting a bit late in the game for that and to write off the bloomberg numbers as an outlier fine but two subsequent national surveys offer additional cause for alarmamong trump supporters acbs news poll taken entirely after the orlando terrorist attack shows heavy public opposition to trump s response to the massacre obama is above water 10 clinton is running roughly even 2 and trump is deep underwater 26 as for the presumptive gop nominee s quasi resurrected temporary muslim ban proposal public opinion runs two to one in opposition with independents breaking heavily against it writes allahpundit if even a major terror attack can t get voters to take a second look at the would be strongman what ll it take trump s image is so horribly poor among the general electorate that he can t win without convincing voters to give him a second look if a jihadi shooting up a nightclub while trump is demanding a ban on muslims abroad doesn t do it maybe nothing s going to do it a reasonable concern is his description of trump s standing among the overall electorate as horribly poor perhapsa bitunfair not according to a new washington post abc news poll remember when i characterized trump s 67 percent unfavorable mark in that series as unelectable territory back in march well the billionaire rebounded to a less catastrophic 37 60 after clinching the nomination last month edging slightlyahead of clinton on a hypothetical ballot those gains have nowdisappeared and then some wapo abc poll 55 of voters hold unfavorable view of hillary 70 hold unfavorable view of trump including 56 strong unfav yes seven in ten american votershave a negative view of trump with the percentage expressing a strongly unfavorable opinion eclipsing hillary s high negatives which haven t improved at all since securing her party s crown the preposterous notion that nothing hurts trump thejudge garbage has clearly taken a toll is being exposed in a general election setting as many analystsanticipated he is now41 points underwater on favorability here s how trump s unfavorables in wapo abc poll independents 68 under 50 76 women 77 hispanics 89 blacks 94 pair that informationwith bloomberg s finding that 55 percent of likely voters say they dnever pull the lever for him and cbs measurement of broad opposition to his response to orlando and it would appear that donald trump and the republican party have a real problem on their hands thetrend lines speak for themselves the realdonaldtrump effect at 30 points net negative the ratings for the gop haven t been this bad since feb 2014 pic twitter com kzegpe6gp5 counter point things haven t been this bad for the gop since the winter of 2014 several months beforerepublicans got creamed at the polls oh wait counter counter point these waves of negative polling alongside the would be nomineemanufacturing oneheadache causing controversy afteranother have spurred quite a lot ofthis sentiment online for the gop what is the downside versus the alternative of blatantly stealing the nomination from trump at the convention what s the downside the downside is shunting aside the voices of millions of primary voters who elected trump knowing full well exactly who he is he wasn t subtle and asidefrom mass disenfranchisement blatantly stealing the nomination away from trump would guarantee a republican bloodbath in november many oftrump s fanatical followers wouldn t justshrug and turn out for whomever the party picks in cleveland they d angrily sit out the election or they d show up to actively teach the party a lesson by punishing down ballot republicans whatever gains the party might win among independents and among the nevertrump margins they d enrage a sizable portion of their own base in a waywe ve never seen before this week s bloomberg poll showsjust 33 percent of gop voters expressing enthusiasm about trump that s very low but a party cannot win by writing off one third of its base evenif the polling gets much worse for trump between now and mid july and even if the appetite to dump trump increases significantly among gop voters mortified by the prospect of a hillary presidency i don t see how a convention coup could possiblyend well parting thought is the polling likely to get much worse for trump at this stage he s alreadytrailing clinton nationally and isstruggling in somedeep red states but she s quite unpopular herself and the public has been subjected to nonstop coverage oftrump s antics and theatrics for a year now i guess it s just hard to imagine how trump could do worse than a 70 percent unfavorable rating update new top lines from the cbs news poll hasclinton up six on trump who is again miredin the 30 s with libertarian nomineegary johnson included in the survey the spread is virtually unchanged that makes ten straight polls with clinton in the lead with the margin
