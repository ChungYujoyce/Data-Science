president barack obama fumbled the ball on responding to russian meddling during the 2016 election that appears to be the growing consensus among democrats rep adam schiff d ca the ranking member of the house intelligence committee mentioned last week that the obama administration could have done more on cnn s gps with fareed zakaria co chair of the senate intelligence committee sen mark warner d va said that president obama choked on russia do you think that the obama administration choked and should have done more when they knew the russians were interfering in the 2016 election asked zakaria with the value of hindsight yes replied warner yet the virginia democrat tried to offer some cover saying that there were many threads of information coming in and no one seemed to have been able to put them together really the washington post s bombshell article reported that the obama white house knew as soon as august of 2016 that russia was interfering and that they feared what the russians might do if they responded hence the bunker mentality coupled with a weak post election response which amounted to a slap on wrist according to former acting cia director michael morrell he told cbs s face the nation on june 25 that the obama administration actually did a decent job coordinating with other states to shore up security efforts with their voting systems yet he noted the response to all of this was an abject failure and did nothing to deter the russians from engaging in other interference activities in the future emphasis mine was this an election hack no the 21 election systems that were targeted were not related with vote tabulations the vote tallies were also not altered by the russians then attorney general loretta lynch said no technical interference occurred on election night and dhs did not detect any spikes in malicious cyber activity that would have suggested an attack that night either it was an interference game mostly grounded in the peddling of fake news by state funded media outlets and social media trolls and those fake news stories played no pivotal role in the election just like with ukraine obama virtually did nothing with russia a nation that supposedly was no longer a threat and relic of the cold war era now borderline russophobia permeates the democratic party also before we draw conclusions regarding russia putin and the interference campaign it was only the director of national intelligence the fbi the cia and the nsa who said they had high confidence that putin ordered this interference campaign it wasn t all 17 intelligence agencies which is something the new york times had to clear up alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
