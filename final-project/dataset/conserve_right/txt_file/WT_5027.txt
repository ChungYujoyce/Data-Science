apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion what do ukrainians think about the trump zelensky call do they support trump s impeachment these are the kinds of questions i m asked almost daily since returning from the eastern ukrainian cities of berdyansk and zaporizhia where i spent three weeks recently teaching american criminal law unfortunately it took news of u s president donald trump s requesting a favor from president volodymyr zelensky to put ukraine on the map for most americans but we should have been paying close attention since february 2014 when students and other citizens swarmed the streets of kyiv the capital to protest the pro russian policies of then ukrainian president viktor yanukovych in what is now known as the revolution of dignity mr yanukovych had rejected a trade agreement with the european union and instead looked longingly toward moscow desiring closer ties with the west and tired of government corruption ukrainian protesters forced mr yanukovych to give up power and flee the country top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk russia characterized the revolution of dignity as a putsch organized by american intelligence agents pro russian politicians in the crimea in southern ukraine rejected the revolution and decided to stop sending tax payments to kyiv russian special forces descended into the region seized key installations and later presided over a fraudulent referendum in which crimean voters chose to become part of the russian federation meanwhile ethnic russian separatists in eastern ukraine created the people s republic of luhansk and people s republic of donetsk backed by moscow the two republics have merged and are now fighting the ukrainian army with russian weapons and often russian soldiers the front stretches for several hundred miles and is covered with a network of trenches reminiscent of world war i an estimated 1 5 million ukrainians have fled their homes and another 13 000 have been killed in the conflict with the war dragging on and corruption rampant in kyiv desperate ukrainian voters earlier this year gave political novice zelensky a former comedian an overwhelming 73 percent mandate in the presidential election hoping he can turn things around most ukrainians i talked with were more offended by mr zelensky s apparent kowtowing to president trump than to president trump s request for a favor regarding presidential hopeful joe biden and his son indeed several of my students referred to him as monica zelensky a reference to former president bill clinton s intern and paramour the typical ukrainian would not quibble with mr trump s boast that he s done much to help ukraine nor his complaint that the countries of western europe have failed to assist their neighbor indeed the trump administration has provided ukraine with sophisticated weaponry such as javelin anti tank missiles while the obama administration sent only rations and less advanced equipment the europeans have been pressing mr zelensky to make peace with russia by in essence accepting the loss of significant territory mr zelensky recently landed in hot water when he announced acceptance of the steinmeier formula for ending hostilities named for german president frank walter steinmeier and advocated by france and germany the plan calls for local elections in the occupied territories and recognition of the disputed land as a special autonomous region mr zelensky asserts that elections will be held only after russian troops withdraw from the occupied territories an unlikely proposition at this juncture ukrainians fear mr zelensky is selling them out by agreeing to the plan which has not been formalized on paper so the people can see what the arrangement really involves i had several students originally from donetsk an industrial area in eastern ukraine now occupied by russians lament that mr zelensky and the europe union were writing them off in addition to the russian occupation ukraine continues to be plagued by corruption lawyers i met with complained that the key to a successful legal practice has little to do with legal acumen and more to do with knowing who to bribe judges i interviewed were glum about the matter suggesting that corruption is so systemic it will take years to defeat ukrainians are certainly aware of the goings on in washington the impeachment proceedings and their country s place in the american political spotlight but they re focused on more important issues such as the occupation of their territory by an aggressive neighbor the economic distress caused by the war and the cancer of corruption threatening the rule of law the propriety of mr trump s call with mr zelensky is a distraction given our own problems perhaps we should focus on other issues as well william j watkins jr a lawyer is a research fellow with the independent institute in oakland calif and author most recently of
