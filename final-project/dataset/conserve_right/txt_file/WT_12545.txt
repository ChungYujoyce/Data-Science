apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president obama will veto republican backed legislation if it allows the pentagon to shift funds meant for conflicts to other defense spending to circumvent sequestration limits defense secretary ashton carter told congress on wednesday the topic of so called overseas contingency operations oco pronounced oh ko money transfers was a main element of mr carter s testimony before the senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees the pentagon defense hawks in congress came up with the funding workaround for spending caps placed on the base defense budget required by the 2011 budget control act the house defense bill would add 38 billion to the president s request of 51 billion for oco for a total of 89 billion that would allow the pentagon to use the money for readiness operations and weapons systems top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches in the past oco funding was limited for use by the military for conflicts in afghanistan and other hot spots as well as recent operations in iraq against the islamic state the controversial funding shift was approved this week as part of a massive fiscal 2016 budget that would authorize 613 billion for defense and nuclear programs according to defense officials mr carter s testimony reflects white house opposition to the new spending policy the president and his key advisers are said to oppose the measure because of a bias against military spending and a desire to lift sequestration limits across the board so that more domestic programs can be funded not just defense and military related programs mr carter in his testimony said the oco approach is clearly a road to nowhere because it ignores the vital contributions made by the state justice treasury and homeland security departments legislation that implements this budget framework will therefore be subject to veto he testified the pentagon under mr obama has taken more than 750 billion in sudden and unpredictable cuts to future defense spending mr carter said a senior house armed services committee aide defended the funding shift to the oco the bill meets the president s funding request and advances a number of reforms that carry broad bipartisan support what label gets put on the funds shouldn t be the basis of a veto threat the aide said jcs pick disappoints pro china camp the announcement this week that president obama has picked marine corps gen joseph f dunford jr to be the next chairman of the joint chiefs of staff the president s top military adviser is a setback for pro china advocates in the military and policy communities according to a defense official as reported april 22 in this space mr obama picked gen dunford currently the marine corps commandant along with air force gen paul j selva to be the next vice chairman the generals once confirmed by the senate represent a major personnel change as the two top military leaders at the pentagon with broad power to influence defense policy and military forces and operations gen dunford will replace army gen martin e dempsey whose term ends in september gen selva currently commander of the u s transportation command will replace adm james a winnefeld jr according to defense officials the selection of the two generals is a blow to officials in the military and the obama administration who were hoping that the nomination would go to adm samuel locklear commander of the u s pacific command who has been a major influence on sino u s policies adm locklear had formed a special group of advisers who were working behind the scenes in washington to influence the chairman selection process in favor the four star admiral who has been in charge of pacific command since 2012 the admiral last year sought to curry favor with the white house by telling a reporter that climate change not china or north korea was his biggest worry in the pacific he also made military exchanges with china one of his highest priorities despite growing concerns among america s asian allies that the united states is appeasing beijing and its communist controlled military and some defense officials also privately suggested that adm locklear has sought to slow roll the administration s signature policy of rebalancing forces to asia he like other pro china officials in the administration is said to have regarded the pivot to asia as unduly provocative of china defense hawks both in and out of government have criticized adm locklear for his conciliatory policies toward china that have focused on trying to build trust with china s military through exchanges ship visits and other military to military activities that often benefited china s war fighting development but did little to induce greater openness or cooperation instead of closer ties china s military during adm locklear s tenure has grown more belligerent and less cooperative critics say with moves such as the transfer of strategic nuclear missile launchers to north korea for kn 08 missiles beijing s unilateral declaration of an air defense zone over japan s senkaku islands a near collision caused by a chinese amphibious warship sailing dangerously close to the cruiser uss cowpens in the south china sea and china s first out of area deployment of submarines to the indian ocean pacific command spokesman capt
