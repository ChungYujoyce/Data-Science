washington can be proud of hundreds of thousands of federal workers face their first payday friday without getting paid talks to reopen nine federal departments have broken down and lawmakers are out of town until tomorrow afternoon meanwhile the president has gone back and forth on whether to declare a national emergency at the border let aposs get the latest now from kevin corke live at the white house kevin kevin corke correspondent chris from the white house to the southern border a more measured tone from administration officials this week about the need for enhanced border security a lot less talk about a wall and more about the exploding humanitarian crisis begin videotape trump we are here today to address the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border this is a humanitarian crisis a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul kirstjen nielsen dhs secretary this is a severe humanitarian and security crisis corke on twitter mr trump insisted that democrats come back from their vacations and get back to work i aposm in the white house ready to sign a sharp elbowed reference to the thousands of democratic lawmakers who trotted to puerto rico for a retreat where they hope to strategize ways to help the dead mired u s territory and even planned to see a special performance of the hit broadway show hamilton this is as the new york times reported that the fbi allegedly looked into whether or not the president was secretly working on behalf of russia during and following the 2016 campaign a suggestion that drew a scathing rebuke from the president aposs attorney john dowd who wrote the new york times story is an unwitting disclosure and verification of the utter corruption of their oaths by comey and his colleagues to undermine the free election of the president of the united states jeanine pirro host are you know or have you ever worked for russia mr president trump i think it aposs the most insulting thing i aposve ever been asked i think it aposs the most insulting article i aposve ever had written end videotape corke quite a week here in washington by the way chris the white house has asked the army corps of engineers to look into additional possible ways to help fund border security including an examination of the 2018 february emergency supplemental they say that would actually draw funds from disaster relief we aposll see if that happens chris wallace kevin corke reporting from a snowy white house kevin thank you joining us now from south carolina republican senator lindsey graham who after meeting with the president friday urged him to use his executive powers to build a wall senator welcome back to fox news sunday graham thank you wallace this week you first tried to arrange a compromise a border wall funding in return for some protection for the dreamers the white house said no graham no wallace now you are telling the president urging the president to use his executive powers to fund the wall and the president on friday said not so fast question what is the president aposs strategy graham i just talked to them about 30 minutes ago he says let aposs make a deal they did not turn down wall for the bridge that aposs not that story line i tried to see if we could open up the government for limited period of time to negotiate a deal and the president says let aposs make a deal then open up the government nancy pelosi says even if you open up the government i wouldn apost fund a wall so that aposs why i aposm depressed you know there aposs not much talk about what she said she aposs telling the president even if you open up the government i aposm not going to do a deal on the wall and that aposs a nonstarter for the president wallace well i don apost mean in any way to cast aspersions on the president or nancy pelosi but do you know one of the definitions of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result graham yes wallace what aposs going to go on president says make a deal the democrats say not funding for the wall not saying it aposs right or wrong graham right wallace but what happens graham well i think it just plays out what bothers me so much is that your next guests chris coons a great guy we could sit down to make a deal with him wall plus daca wall plus tps every democrat that i aposve worked with for about ten years now has agreed to funding for barriers walls on obama aposs watch on bush aposs watch and all of a sudden it aposs a bad thing on trump aposs watch it really does perplex me how you expect this to end when you tell the president of the united states you get 1 for a wall when in the past democrats have appropriated billions for the wall what are we supposed to do just give in he aposs not going to give in wallace he aposs not going to give in he said in a tweet i believe it was yesterday that he has a plan what aposs the plan graham the plan is to do a deal he is willing in my view to do wall plus funding for the wall that we desperately need that aposs been done in the past see if we can do a deal around the tps recipients who are going to lose their legal status wallace those are temporary protected status crosstalk wallace let me just state temporary protected status graham right wallace people who came in from disasters graham thank you yes there are about 400 000 they are going to lose their legal status soon he aposs willing to extend that the daca recipients they are all tied up in court but i think he would give them work permits for three years one time renewable if you could get wall funding i don apost want to speak for the president i don apost want to lock him in but i aposm confident what i just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the white house and a lot of democrats and i aposm just so frustrated we can apost get in a room and hammer it out wallace now some white house officials it aposs been reported are now talking about well maybe the president will be using his state of the union speech to make this case graham right wallace that aposs 16 days from now some white house officials are talking about this extending into february how much damage does that two of this government shutdown goes on for weeks even into next month graham less damage than if we don apost fix a broken immigration system you aposve got to bad choices here continue to stalemate and see parts of the government shutdown it will be inconvenient and it can create problems into the federal workforce i aposm sorry you caught up in this mess but the real damage is people coming across the border selling drugs killing americans that needs to come to an end so the real damage is a broken border compared to a partial shutdown the president is not going to give in no wall no deal but he aposs ready to deal and your next guest i am sure would provide funding for a barrier where it made sense if he could get something for it wallace you have been one of the loudest voices among republicans urging the president to declare a national emergency i have two questions graham right wallace one why doesn apost he just go ahead and do that he seems to think that aposs a way out of this secondly there are a lot of your gop colleagues who say that would be a terrible precedent because someday there aposs going to be a democratic president and they aposre going to say well you know what it aposs a national emergency so let aposs fund climate change it aposs going to be a national emergency so let aposs fund income inequality graham let aposs start with the president i ask him mr president if you want to go down the emergency path i stand with you he said just 30 minutes ago that aposs my last option i think the legislative route is the best way to go let aposs make a deal but i will do it if i have to so we have found in the past presidents declared emergencies for different things i am going to support him before he pulls the plug on the legislative option and i think we are almost there i would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time like three weeks before he pulls the plug see if we can get a deal if we can apost at the end of three weeks all bets are off see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers that aposs my recommendation but i think the legislative path is just about shut off because nancy pelosi the leader of the house said even if you open up the government i will give you 1 for the wall as long as that aposs the case we are never going to get a legislative package no matter what the senate does wallace i want to just pursue this emergency option one more time because in 2014 president obama used his executive powers to try and protect 5 million immigrants and here aposs what you said at the time graham right begin video clip graham this is wrong it aposs a responsible and will do damage to our efforts to fix a broken immigration system this is a tremendous presidential overreach end video clip wallace so why was that an overreach for president obama then but not for president trump now graham well what president obama did he didn apost declare a national emergency about the daca recipients he took his power to pardon an individual or a smaller group and applied it to 1 8 million people ever president not every a lot of presidents have declared emergencies after 9 11 we did and they have taken money and powers to deal with a national emergency i think there is a crisis at the border i think it fits the definition of a national emergency it aposs the last option not the first option but we aposre pretty close to that being the only option how do you negotiate with the speaker of the house when she tells you even if you open up the government are not going to give you but 1 for the wall so until that changes there aposs not much left except the national emergency approach and to my republican colleagues stand behind the president as this is his last option he ran on this as a centerpiece of his presidency and it is a crisis and if you don apost see the crisis you are not looking very hard wallace ok i want to switch subjects the new york times now reports that after president trump fired fbi director james comey that the bureau opened up a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the united states was working on behalf of the russians one did you know about that two what do you think i have to say it aposs an astonishing idea the fbi the bureau investigating whether the president was a russian agent graham well number one that story came from somebody who leaked it with an agenda so i aposd like to know who leaked it because they have an agenda not very friendly to president trump and i for one don apost trust what i read in the new york times having said all that i aposm going to ask the fbi director was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the russians i find it astonishing and to me it tells me a lot about the people running the fbi mccabe and that crowd i don apost trust them as far as i throw them so if this really did happen congress needs to know about it and what i want to do is make sure how could the fbi do that what kind of checks and balances are there wallace let me you have a lot of clout in asking the fbi questions because you aposre the new chair of the senate judiciary committee congratulations mr chairman graham thank you wallace and your committee is going to begin holding confirmation hearings this week on the president aposs nomination of william barr to be the new attorney general what do you intend to ask him about the special counsel investigation and whether or not the special counsel is going to be allowed to finish his investigation and issue a full unedited report to congress graham i aposm going to ask him do you see any reason to fire mr mueller based on what you know now for cause do you trust mr mueller to be fair to the president of a country will you make sure he can finish his job if you get the report will you be as transparent as possible i aposve asked him those questions and i aposm very comfortable with those answers so i think you aposd be a great attorney general great job by the president to pick mr barr i see no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and the russians but that would be up to mr mueller to make his report to attorney general and he soon will i hope wallace another question for the new chair of the senate judiciary committee justice ruth bader ginsburg this week after cancer surgery for the first time astonishingly in her quarter century on the court missed oral arguments now we all wish her a speedy recovery the doctors say that she is cancer free but there are reports for the white house has begun reviewing a possible short list of candidates to replace her as the chair of the committee that would vote on a replacement have you given any thought how you aposd prevent this from becoming a political circus graham well number one i wish her well and hope she recovers and continues to serve for many years but here aposs what will happen if there aposs a vacancy no matter from the liberal wing of the court there aposd be a lot of pushback from the left but my democratic colleagues felt when they were in charge we should confirm judges by majority vote they changed the rules to accommodate president obama they tried to stack the court they never thought clinton would lose so what you aposre going to have is harry reid and chuck schumer aposs desire to stack the court on their democratic watch has come back to haunt them if there is an opening whether it aposs ginsburg or anybody else i will urge the president to nominate a qualified conservative and hopefully those people will get through that person will get through and i expect it to be along party lines and this is what happens when you change the rules this has come back to bite them i predicted it would and we aposll see i hope justice ginsburg serves for a long time but there aposs an opening on this court i aposm going to be hell bent to put a conservative to replace whoever steps down for whatever reason wallace and just finally and i got about 30 seconds left if you got donald trump and again this is if you have donald trump replacing a liberal icon like ruth bader ginsburg isn apost that a formula for i mean doesn apost that make the kavanaugh hearings look like a tea party graham they should have thought of that before they changed the rules they try to destroy conservative judges i voted for sotomayor and kagan understanding what i was getting so this decision by reid and schumer may come back to haunt them but i am dead set on making sure it is a conservative nominee and elections have consequences the rules of the senate were changed not by me by them and we had to do it on the supreme court because they would not give us any votes to nominate anybody and kavanaugh was a fine man they tried to destroy him all this is going to come back to haunt them one day wallace yes let me just really quickly explained that when the democrats with the majority majority leader harry reid changed it for judicial nominees short of the supreme court and for cabinet appointees graham right wallace it went from the 60 vote margin to 51 and then the republicans did it for the supreme court senator graham thank you thanks for your time graham can i just say one last thing wallace yes sir graham one last thing we don apost need we don apost need one democrat to replace a liberal justice and the reason that aposs the case is because of what harry reid did what he set in motion thank you wallace always good to speak with you sir ok i guess you think it was ok to speak with us up next democrats challenge the president to reopen the government and discuss border security measures both sides can agree on democratic senator chris coons joins us next commercial break wallace these days donald trump is facing the toughest set of challenges of his presidency the government shutdown the new democratic majority in the house and the special counsel aposs russia probe that appears to be close to wrapping up joining us now from delaware democratic senator chris coons senator welcome back to fox news sunday sen chris coons d delaware thanks chris good morning wallace house speaker pelosi says that the border wall is immoral and that she won apost give i guess she will give 1 to pay for it do you agree with her coons well i agree with the advice that lindsey graham just gave to president trump which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on i personally don apost think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral what i think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the trump administration forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage like facilities the humanitarian crisis i think may have been what she was referring to the larger point here chris is that we don apost have a fundamental disagreement between democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country far from it all of us have voted for more investment in border security several times and the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year which passed the senate unanimously it will give the president another 1 3 billion for border security on top of the 1 3 billion from last year that hasn apost been fully spent yet i do think if we reopen the government if the president ends this shutdown crisis we have folks who can negotiate a responsible modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer wallace so let aposs you aposre exactly right i you have voted for a border barrier in the past and i aposve been looking at your records so let aposs put it up on the screen in 2013 as part of comprehensive immigration reform you supported 46 billion for border security including 350 miles of new fencing in 2018 last year you and most senate democrats approved 25 billion for border security including physical barriers so here aposs the question i understand the idea that you don apost want a 2 000 mile wall but you have supported and a lot of democrats including pelosi including schumer have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing so why not make a deal a deal that right now without opening the government why not make a deal that lindsey graham was talking about some money for border barriers fencing wall whatever you want to call it in return for some concessions on dreamers and on tps immigrants coons chris it would be great if we could reach a resolution to our country aposs broken immigration system and find a path forward we all agree to invest in border security in new technologies and approaches that would actually make us safer one of the challenges of negotiating with president trump as lindsey graham knows better than anyone else is i feel like i aposve signed up for the trump of the day club i don apost know what position we aposre going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two it was senator graham who famously talked about tuesday trump and thursday trump when he and senator durbin brought a comprehensive resolution a bill to president trump last year he embraced on tuesday and then walked away and announced it on thursday i will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place majority leader mitch mcconnell put a bill on the floor that was adopted unanimously by the senate at the end of last year that would have kept the government open and supported 1 3 billion in border security the president reversed position the next day and rejected something he told mitch mcconnell he would sign why is mitch mcconnell completely absent from these negotiations it aposs because he doesn apost really know what the president will accept wallace but coons i don apost expect the president to capitulate i do expect them to compromise we are clearly not going to build a border wall funded by mexico but we should negotiate wallace forgive me but congressman ph the question is will nancy pelosi compromise the republican say and you heard what lindsey graham just said she aposs unwilling to give any money for the wall i understand the issue with president trump and he certainly has reversed course a few times what i aposm asking you now and this is we are in week four of the shutdown so the situation has become dire coons right wallace are you are the democrats willing to make a compromise that includes money for a border wall fencing a border barrier i will call it in return for some concessions from the president on people in this country illegally coons i think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he aposs willing to put forward look chris you know me i work with republicans regularly i aposve been on the phone with a half dozen democratic and republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by republican senators to negotiate a compromise got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly even one effort that was being led by vice president mike pence crosstalk wallace i mean because i want to move on coons so compromise and while the government is shut down i will remind you we got 41 000 federal law enforcement officers out there today being forced to work without pay we aposve got farmers all over the country not getting the relief payments for the impact on the soybean industry due to tariff war wallace sir i understand all that i aposm just asking you if he agrees to a compromise that includes other things that the democrats want will the democrats give way and include money for the border barrier yes or no coons democrats will invest in border security i aposm not going to sit here on your show and negotiate on behalf of speaker pelosi but i aposll tell you that what lindsey graham himself just told the president is a great place to start here wallace ok coons reopen the government stop harming our country and our economy and let aposs make our best efforts because we all agree we need to invest more in border security the only crisis here is one that aposs been created by the president aposs abrupt change in position at the end of last year in the last days of a republican controlled congress wallace ok i want to move on just because i aposve got so many other questions to ask you coons sure wallace what you think about the report in the new york times that in 2017 the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the united states was a russian agent coons well that was a concerning even alarming report and it suggests to me that the mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion i aposm grateful for the partnership of senator graham now the chairman of the judiciary committee in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with senators tillis and booker to protect the mueller investigation and i think that report by the new york times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place i will also say this chris i was very concerned by president trump aposs steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that vladimir putin aposs russia had interfered in our 2016 election there aposs been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of president trump to complement president putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for president putin but i do think what we can all agree on is that the mueller investigation should reach its conclusion wallace all right coons should deliver a report publicly and that will be the topic of the barr nomination hearings this coming tuesday wallace let me i got these two more questions and i got two minutes so let aposs try and squeeze them in you aposre also a member coons sure wallace of the judiciary committee which is going to hold the confirmation hearings coons yes wallace on bill barr as the next attorney general what does he need to say to persuade you to assure you that he is going to let the mueller investigation go to its conclusion and be reported to congress and is there anyway that that you can vote to confirm bill barr coons i aposm keeping an open mind we had a very constructive meeting this past week i did ask him a number of questions right along those lines and will ask them again in the public confirmation hearing i would need a firm commitment that he would not allow any interference in the mueller investigation he will allow it to reach its conclusion and he will release the report to the public i also asked him about seeking an ethics opinion from the department of justice about whether he should recuse himself given some of the opinions he aposs expressed both in a memo that he sent unsolicited challenging the obstruction of justice basis for some of robert mueller aposs investigation he didn apost make that commitment he said it would depend on the facts at the time i will re ask that question this coming week i have some other concerns about his views on criminal justice and civil rights but the mueller investigation the rule of law his willingness to defend the appropriate independence of the department of justice will be critical to my vote wallace and briefly sir i want to pick up on the conversation i was having with senator graham given justice ginsburg aposs recent illness the fact that she is going to be turning 86 in march it aposs only understandable that there would be some discussion about the possibility of replacing her at some point have you given any thought given how and i know you were concerned about how ugly the kavanaugh hearing is how you avoid a repeat particularly if it comes to the situation of donald trump replacing a woman who has become a liberal icon coons well frankly i think the confirmation of justice gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning middle and end what made the confirmation hearings of justice kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing wallace right coons i have talked with republican colleagues about finding a way that we have a clearer process for welcoming and vetting and making part of the confirmation process any such allegations so they don apost arise at the last moment i think there was a great deal of consternation over the timing of those allegations and then how seriously they were taken and investigated or not wallace senator coons thank you thanks for joining us today please come back sir coons thank you chris thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss how and when the government shutdown will finally end plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs threat to declare a national emergency just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break wallace coming up the shutdown standoff drags on begin video clip trump dealing with these people is ridiculous i don apost know if they know how to make a deal sen chuck schumer d n y minority leader this is ridiculous and it aposs cruel and it needs to end now end video clip wallace we aposll ask our sunday panel whether the president will declare a national emergency to fund his border wall next commercial break begin video clip trump i haven apost done it yet i may do it if this doesn apost work out probably i will do it i would almost say definitely i have the absolute right to do it but i aposm not going to do it so fast because this is something congress should do end video clip wallace president trump changing course in a day on whether he is about to declare a national emergency and build a border wall on his own and it aposs time now for our sunday group gop strategist karl rove columnist for the hill juan williams former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the woodrow wilson center and josh holmes senator mitch mcconnell aposs former chief of staff well karl let aposs start with the new wrinkle this week can the president declare a national emergency to build the wall should he declare a national emergency to build the wall karl rove contributor yes well look i aposm not a lawyer and i didn apost stay at a holiday inn express last night so i aposm not the expert on this but i have been paying careful attention to people who are david french ph in the national review had i thought a particularly penetrating article on this he pointed out that the sections of the law in which the president would have to rely say the president can declare an emergency that quote requires the use of armed force he can do military construction projects that are necessary to support that use of armed force that seems to me to not apply in this situation the other statute that would be used says that the president can declare an emergency that terminates projects quote not essential to national defense and apply those monies to quote construct or assist in the construction maintenance or repair of of inaudible wallace i just asked you what time it is i don apost want to know how the watch is made what what aposs the answer rove bottom line is i think the authority to do so is is wallace should he do it rove well he may he maybe he should do it in order to get us out of the boxed canyon because if he does do it it will go to court and quickly i think the courts will say you don apost have the authority in this instance i mean the administration in 2017 and 2018 has said on the record no terrorist organization has sent people to the united states through mexico so hard to declare it a national security emergency wallace all right jane harman director woodrow wilson center right wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the president aposs thought about declaring a national emergency we got this tweet from greg engle by declaring a national emergency will this open the door for future future presidents to do the same over topics such as climate change health care or even gun control laws because of mass shootings is this really a national emergency or just fulfilling a campaign pledge congresswoman harman how do you answer greg harman it aposs not a national emergency it is fulfilling a campaign pledge the wall is a primal scream in your conversation with your very good conversation just before with lindsey graham and chris coons both of them made clear that there are ways that congress can make a deal that aposs the right answer and i aposm going to get in a fight with josh because i think that mitch mcconnell his old boss who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called playing the long ball is bunting here and he could if he chose to rouse a veto proof majority in the senate to pass what the senate passed in the last senate which is the collection of crs and then just leave one that would be the department of homeland security bill with a shorter time frame to negotiate have lindsay and as far as i aposm concerned chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on tv which maybe trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it wallace i love the fact that this is a fight between president trump and nancy pelosi and poor senator mcconnell you aposre probably sitting out there with your lovely wife elaine chao watching this and suddenly he gets dragged into this fight harman well he is wallace well wait wait let me let me as the shutdown drags into its fourth week both sides are digging in harder than ever take a look begin video clip trump this is a choice between right and wrong justice and injustice pelosi it was a petulant president of the united states a person who would say i aposll keep the government shutdown for week a month or years unless i get my way end video clip wallace josh we have seen how government shutdowns play out we aposve all been here for them usually they go on a week maybe a week and a half and at some point the public seems to turn against one side that site generally blinks and they make a deal one why isn apost it happening this time and two how long is this going to go on josh holmes founder cavalry well first let me respond to my good friend jane aposs criticism his book is named to the long game which unfortunately is not the end of the untruths or misunderstands that we had about mitch mcconnell aposs role here harman it aposs long though holmes he basically played a role for eight years as minority leader in the senate were democrats control the senate wallace all right let aposs go let aposs move on i don apost want to talk about mitch mcconnell i want to talk about the shutdown holmes well it aposs i think this is important to know because at that point he had an obligation to do a deal with an administration that didn apost see eye to eye with his conference that is precisely the role that chuck schumer and nancy pelosi find themselves in at this particular juncture and instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government nancy pelosi aposs telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up open up the government and fund the wall that aposs ridiculous this is not a particularly difficult thing to bridge here we aposre talking about a 4 billion discrepancy in a 4 trillion budget this is not difficult if this is if this is as difficult as it gets from here in this congress we aposre all going to be in good shape wallace so what are you saying the deal should be some money for the wall something between 1 billion and 5 billion in return for some concessions on people in this country illegally like dreamers and the temporary protected status refugees holmes yes i think it aposs obvious right i mean if you aposre talking about a 4 billion discrepancy there aposs got to be a way to get come to the middle of it certainly if you were in the democratic party right now there are concessions that you aposre interested in accomplishing right and if that is the case you ought to wonder down to the speaker aposs office and minority leader chuck schumer aposs office and give them a piece of your mind wallace so juan why doesn apost speaker pelosi why don apost the democrats make a deal juan williams political analyst well i think it aposs pretty clear right now if you look at the polls this morning that the president and republicans are being blamed overwhelmingly for shutting down the government and as chris coons pointed out to you this morning chris mitch mcconnell and the republicans had a unanimous support republicans and democrats for a bill that would have opened the government kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward it aposs the president who has made it a point to say i aposm shutting down this government over the wall wallace ok but wait a minute but there are real people affected right williams yes wallace eight hundred thousand people who aren apost getting paid people who are depending on services on going to the airport today i don apost know what is going to happen with tsa or williams right wallace the flight controllers or whatever i understand all of that and there aposs a lot of bad faith on both sides why not make a deal williams well i think you have a situation here just in pure political terms where one it aposs only a shrinking republican base that backs the president and you don apost want to reward bullying and that aposs what this comes down to secondly wallace so they aposre going to demand the president surrender williams no not surrender see i don apost think it aposs a matter of capitulation or surrender i think it aposs a matter of saying to the president let aposs be honest about this you had two years of republican majorities didn apost get done you had the senate majority leader say let aposs negotiate you refused so it aposs bad behavior and i might add here remember that on the southern border eight congressional districts including one republican none of them including the republican voted for this wall chris so the politics of this are very clear its trump not the republicans rove that aposs simply not accurate look last year wallace but let me just no let me ask i don apost want to go do history how does this get resolved rove it gets resolved by adults showing up at this discussion we have people on both sides who could find a way to get this done josh is right we aposre talking about 4 billion that is one tenth of 1 percent of the federal budget out of every 100 spent by the federal government we aposre talking about if you gave them 4 billion for the wall it would be 0 10 out of every williams this is in the weeds karl rove let me let me finish williams karl let me just say this to you rove let me finish let me finish williams didn apost he say mexico was going to pay for this rove let me finish williams not the american taxpayer rove ok fine we can stay stuck harman totally fully rove we can stay stuck in this and we can argue about nancy pelosi saying it aposs an immoral wall which she voted for the wall last year and did not declare when when barack obama wrote built 133 miles of wall that that was immoral harman right williams no that was fencing it was fencing and barriers not wall rove oh no no it was wall it was wall williams but it doesn apost matter this rove look here aposs the bottom line williams he said mexico will pay for this this rove ok you can you can say stuck yesterday williams ok rove i think the american people are saying a pox on both your houses harman yes well and 800 000 of them are out of work because of it rove take a look let me finish let me finish let me finish let me finish the economist the economist poll said wallace quickly rove asked the question in an interesting way who do you blame a lot for this do you blame the democrats in congress a lot 46 percent blame them a lot do you are blame the republicans in congress 46 percent blame republicans and 59 percent wallace well and there aposs a new poll an abc washington post poll that says 53 percent for the president and republicans try anyway rove well but it aposs only wallace may i just say one thing because we we we need to move onto the next segment what i aposm really happy about is that we were able to reach agreement at this table rove exactly wallace which indicates that the shutdown aposs going to go on a long time rove at least three of us can at least three of us can wallace all right panel we have to take a break here harman inaudible wallace when we come back we aposll discuss that shocking report the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether president trump was working for the kremlin plus is the white house already preparing its supreme court short list in case justice ginsburg steps down from the court all that next commercial break begin video clip trump was going to fire comey i there aposs no good time to do it by the way i said to myself i said you know this russia thing with trump and russia is a made up story it aposs an excuse by the democrats for having lost an election that they should have won end video clip wallace president trump in may of 2017 mentioning the russia investigation as a reason he fired fbi director james comey the new york times now reports that was one of the reasons the fbi launched a counterintelligence probe into the president and we aposre back now with the panel well karl we have been in uncharted territory for much of the trump presidency but this has got to be the topper the fbi the fbi launching a counterintelligence investigation into whether the president of the united states is a russian agent your thoughts rove yes well this happened in the aftermath of the firing of comey this was leaked to the new york times which says something about the culture inside the fbi the only good news out of this is in all likelihood since comey was fired in a very short period of time less than two weeks later mueller is appointed this was probably immediately subsumed by mueller the mueller investigation and has been i suspect handled in an entirely appropriate way but it says something that the fbi would react to the firing of comey this way and that somebody somebody who was then near the top of the fbi leaked this to the new york times shame on them wallace president trump not surprisingly went on a twitter storm about this story yesterday here aposs just one of his tweets wow just learned in a failing new york times that the corrupt leaders of the fbi almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason and with no proof after i fired lyin apos james comey a total sleaze one sentence incidentally pretty impressive juan you have to assume if they had found evidence in the last year and a half that the president was a russian agent they would have intervened williams no i think it was as karl said all went to the mueller pro and wallace but if they found that the president williams they aposre an investigative agency right wallace i understand but if the white house if the fbi found evidence that the president was an ongoing manchurian candidate an agent for the russians you don apost think that that they they aposd just sit on that and harman no williams i think it aposs up to mueller it aposs up to mueller to say this is one provable and part of my ultimate report you do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation and this is unprecedented the fbi as you said going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn a manchurian candidate for the russians but what we can say and i it aposs contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have mueller having so many guilty pleas so much smoke coming michael cohen is not going to testify before congress i think there aposs there aposs there aposs fire wherever there aposs so much smoke and right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 pennsylvania avenue there something going on but i don apost think it aposs the case that oh therefore if they had found something right away it would have led to immediate charges against this president wallace josh holmes well i think if you cut away from the sort of conspiracy and all the invective that this new york times article actually injects into our public discourse what we aposve learned here is the mind set of the fbi at the time we learned nothing about the fact pattern that the president of the united states engaged in in fact we aposve known all of this for months what we now know is that the the fbi formalized what mccabe strzok lisa page and all others have been doing for a matter of months before that point of view they believed in their core of core that the president of the united states was a foreign agent and they were going to conduct investigations come hell or high water this provided a perfect excuse for them to do so wallace i want to go quickly to this and then move on harman ok no and i think that what you said chris is right this is a counterintelligence investigation not a criminal investigation and if they have had real evidence that the president was a manchurian candidate i think they would have intervene right then i mean we can apost have that go on an unprecedented whatever i collusion cooperation arrangement with one of our most important strategic competitors russia so we aposll learn soon from mueller what aposs going on here i do want to agree with karl agree with karl and deplore the leak of information like this rove and i and i agree with your finding about this this is sort of like this wallace ok no no this no we need shouting ok i want to move on there rove this came out of a gi joe movie yes wallace there were new questions this week about justice ginsburg after it turned out that she has missed arguments a lot of us didn apost know this for the first time in her quarter century on the court here aposs what she said in 2017 about how long she will continue as a justice begin video clip justice ruth bader ginsburg supreme court as long as i can do the job full full steam i will do it end video clip wallace josh you know a lot of us deplored whatever side you were on the kavanaugh hearing and how ugly that was and how the senate seemed to break down over it i got to say if you have donald trump replacing the notorious rbg that aposs a perfect political storm isn apost it holmes yes i mean let me say at the outset i think everybody hopes that justice ginsburg recovers fully wallace of course holmes but but you aposre right wallace and there aposs every sign that she is holmes yes i think given what we saw with the kavanaugh hearings and everything else you can you can say what you will but this will be the first time that there is a seat that actually changes from a liberal held seat to a conservative held seat and and if you think the kavanaugh hearings was divisive wait until you get a load of this i mean this will be the the granddaddy of them all in terms of supreme court battles i think i was encouraged by what i heard from chris coons earlier in your interview that he was working alongside republicans to try to find a process which of course i believe is the biggest problem with the kavanaugh hearings the process that was held closed until the last minute and try to jump into a make the whole thing a political dynamic which of course ruined wallace what you aposre saying is the fact that suddenly christine blasey ford and all of that stuff came out at the last at the 11th hour holmes it was designed to create a political circus and sabotage two people aposs lives in the process that is absolutely the wrong way to go and i aposm encouraged that it what we aposre hearing from a senate judiciary committee that we aposre going to try to reform some of that wallace congresswoman harman this is a delicate subject i understand it as i ask the question was it foolish for ruth bader ginsburg not to step down in the middle of president obama aposs term harman no it wasn apost foolish i she may look frail but she aposs she aposs an iron maiden she is a i knew her first when she was a litigator in the apos70s and she aposs always been a petite woman whose voice sometimes wobbles but her mind is strong and it aposs her call and she wears that diva t shirt in the gym at the at the supreme court and she aposs a trailblazer for women i mean and she aposll know when it aposs time she aposs not going to hang on if she can apost function fully in the job and the only thing she aposs missing right now are oral arguments she aposs participating by phone in the decision about what cases to take and hopefully she will fully recover soon her doctors say she aposs on course and she aposs cancer free wallace all right all right we have time i want to get into one last subject secretary of state pompeo is on a tour of the middle east this week in cairo he went after barack obama aposs mideast policy take a look begin video clip mike pompeo secretary of state the age of self inflicted american shame is over and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering end video clip wallace karl he was talking there specifically about the president and and firing back at the policies of the president you worked for bush 43 but where are we on syria right now because the president said we aposre going to get out right away then john bolton the national security advisor said well it depends on what happens with the kurds and isis now we hear the pentagon is pulling equipment out do you know where we are rove no and we have a disconnect between i what i thought was an excellent speech by pompeo he opens up by saying america is a force for good in the middle east repudiates the obama era doctrines but there is a disconnect between that and pulling us out of syria my hope is is that our withdraw from syria i assume that the president aposs going to fulfill it is done in an orderly fashion but let aposs recognize our withdrawal empowers russia it empowers iran it empowers the syrians and the ultimate result of it may be iranian supported militias on the northern border of israel which is anathema to our interests and our allies wallace well it we aposve got less than a minute left congresswoman i mean this was such a sore point when the president said we aposre going to pull out that james mattis the defense secretary quit over it now they seem to be reshuffling it do you understand what the policy is harman no and i don apost think there aposs one person in the trump administration who agrees with the policy understand that bret mcgurk who was the special advisor dealing with the isis coalition wallace the coalition harman also retired early in protest so that aposs two but i aposve been looking around and and karl is exactly right on who it exposes but in addition to that there could be a turk massacre of the kurds who fought side by side with us not only in syria but in iraq and israel
