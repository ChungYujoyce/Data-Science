n of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion joe biden is at it again living in his own parallel universe the same former vice president who says that his son hunter was hired by the ukrainian oil and gas company because of his expertise in energy policy is now claiming that president trump has squandered the strong obama economy he inherited here is how mr biden put it in a speech last week in scranton pennsylvania donald trump inherited a strong economy from barack and me then he added things were beginning to really move and just like everything else he s inherited he s in the midst of squandering it what s next jimmy carter taking credit for the reagan boom top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey this is the continuing history rewrite of the left to explain the booming economy in the third year of mr trump s presidency today we are at or below record levels of unemployment inflation and interest rates in half a century wages and salaries are rising at their fastest clip in at least two decades there are an all time high 7 million unfilled jobs in the united states the washington post is freaking out about the continued good news on the economy and especially the latest data that i reported on these pages two weeks ago that median household income is up by 5 003 since mr trump became president this was based on census data but the post ranted last week that donald trump continues to inflate his own numbers nearly every assertion in the article was wrong or twisted and mr trump was right what is especially rich in the claims by the washington post and joe biden and others that mr trump s success is just a continuation of the obama economy is that this time three years ago these same trump haters promised that a trump presidency would cause a global financial calamity and even a second great depression the stock market would never recover from mr trump s election paul krugman of the new york times assured us now whoops with the economy surging all of a sudden it is just mr obama s doing the double standard here is so transparent that only someone suffering from tds trump derangement syndrome would miss it if the economy were crashing today the left would say that it s all mr trump s fault but with the economy doing quit well mr obama gets the credit the continuation of the obama trend argument is leaky at best first mr obama gave us the weakest recovery from a recession since the end of world war ii the economy grew by about 14 percent in the obama recovery over seven years in the normal recovery the economy grew by almost twice that amount or 27 percent in the last obama year the economy slowed down to a piddly 1 6 percent growth and economists warned that a recessions is right around the corner yes mr biden is right that at the end of the obama biden presidency things were really starting to move in the wrong direction this is why mr trump won the election nearly every poll in 2016 showed that jobs and the economy were the biggest worries of the american voters especially in the midwestern states that mr trump flipped from blue to red income growth had grown in mr obama s second term but it flattened out in 2016 and the surge in middle class incomes started to accelerate in early 2017 after mr trump took office middle class incomes have grown almost three times faster under mr trump than mr obama this is like trading in a pinto for a porsche and as you are flying 80 miles down the highway saying this is just a trend small business and consumer confidence as well as the stock market surged in the days after the trump election and have stayed high ever since coincidence hardly more to the point most of mr trump s policies have been to reverse obama policies not to continue them mr obama raised tax rates mr trump cut them mr obama grew regulations at a record pace mr trump has been rescinding them at a record pace mr obama negotiated the paris climate accord a 100 billion tax on the american economy and mr trump smartly pulled us out mr obama passed obamacare mr trump has been everyday finding ways around the law they called the affordable care act in order to reverse stampeding health costs and try to make health care affordable the economy is far from perfect and the latest weakness in industrial production for example are worrisome the china trade standoff has clearly slowed growth in mr trump s third year in office i would never say never to a recession in the next year or two but i m with larry kudlow it doesn t seem likely right now but the biggest threat to the economy right now is that we repeal the trump growth policies and return to obamanomics this is what mr biden is promising and if it comes to pass we will learn the bitter lesson that the good old days under mr obama really weren t so good at all stephen moore a columnist for the washington times is an economic consultant
