n the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic in an address to the federalist society on friday evening in washington attorney general william barr lashed out at the democratic party resistance against president trump saying it is a incendiary and scorched earth movement signaling that america is ruled by an occupying military power not an elected executive the fact of the matter is that in waging a scorched earth no holds barred war of resistance against this administration it is the left that is engaged in the systematic shredding of norms and the undermining of the rule of law mr barr told attendees of the society s 2019 national lawyers convention delivering a blistering indictment of today s progressives who treat politics as their religion mr barr did not specifically mention the ongoing impeachment push by house democrats led by speaker nancy pelosi of california and rep adam schiff of california but republicans have depicted the proceedings as just another bid in a three year long democratic party campaign to delegitimize and destroy the president top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey immediately after president trump won election opponents inaugurated what they called the resistance and they rallied around an explicit strategy of using every tool and maneuver available to sabotage the functioning of his administration mr barr said friday now resistance is the language used to describe insurgency against rule imposed by an occupying military power it obviously connotes that the government is not legitimate this is a very dangerous indeed incendiary notion to import into the politics of a democratic republic mr barr laid blame squarely on democrats as a prime example he cited senate democrats who are requiring virtually ever trump nominee to go through cloture a time consuming voting process democrats have demanded cloture on 236 trump nominees in president obama s eight years cloture was cited just 17 times it is reasonable to wonder whether a future president will actually be able to form a functioning administration if his or her party does not hold the senate he said while mr barr did not himself delve into a timeline of democratic resistance tactics however democrats began drumming up impeachment talk right after the election often citing the so called anti trump russian dossier in which an ex british spy supposedly gleaned dirt on trump from kremlin operatives after special counsel robert mueller found no proof of a russia trump conspiracy democrats turned to ukraine they allege he held up military aid to try to get kiev to investigate former vice president joe biden and the ukraine business dealings of his son hunter mr barr said on friday what it means is that instead of viewing themselves as the loyal opposition as opposing parties have done in the past they essentially see themselves as engaged in a war to cripple by any means necessary a duly elected government while senate democrats block formation of a government house democrats constant harassment have mired the white house in demands for witnesses and documents democrats have all but abandoned executive privilege a legal doctrine that allows an administration to withhold certain private decision making documents and witnesses i do not deny that congress has some implied authority to conduct oversight as an incident to its legislative power mr barr said but the sheer volume of what we see today the pursuit of scores of parallel investigations through an avalanche of subpoenas is plainly designed to incapacitate the executive branch and indeed is touted as such mr barr contrasted progressives thirst for power with conservative theory of government whatever means they use are therefore justified because by definition they are a virtuous people pursing a deific end he said they are willing to use any means necessary to gain momentary advantage in achieving their end regardless of collateral consequences and the systemic implications conservatives on the other hand do not seek an earthly paradise we are interested in preserving over the long run the proper balance of freedom and order necessary for healthy development of natural civil society and individual human flourishing mr barr has clashed with democrats almost from the day he was confirmed as attorney general in february 2019 he said the obama administration spied on the trump campaign bringing democratic condemnation of the word spy he tapped john durham the u s attorney for the district of connecticut to investigate how the obama administration started the fbi trump russia probe and
