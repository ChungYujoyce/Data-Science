trump is sending vice president mike pence and national security adviser robert o brien to ankara as soon as possible in an attempt to begin negotiations pence said trump spoke directly to turkish leader recep tayyip erdogan who promised not attack the border town of kobani which in 2015 witnessed the islamic state group s first defeat in a battle by u s backed kurdish fighters president trump communicated to him very clearly that the united states of american wants turkey to stop the invasion implement an immediate ceasefire and to begin to negotiate with kurdish forces in syria to bring an end to the violence pence said top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk the americans were scrambling for syria s exits a move criticized at home and abroad as opening the door to a resurgence of the islamic state group whose violent takeover of syrian and iraqi lands five years ago was the reason american forces came in the first place trump said the approximately 1 000 u s troops who had been partnering with local kurdish fighters to battle is in northern syria are leaving the country they will remain in the middle east he said to monitor the situation and to prevent a revival of is a goal that even trump s allies say has become much harder as a result of the u s pullout the turks began attacks in syria last week against the syrian kurdish fighters whom the turks see as terrorists on monday syrian government troops moved north toward the border region setting up a potential clash with turkish led forces trump said turkey s invasion is precipitating a humanitarian crisis and setting conditions for possible war crimes a reference to reports of turkish backed fighters executing kurdish fighters on the battlefield the kurdish forces previously allied with the u s said they had reached a deal with president bashar assad s government to help them fend off turkey s invasion a move that brings russian forces deeper into the conflict in his sanctions announcement trump said he was halting negotiations on a 100 billion trade deal with turkey and raising steel tariffs back up to 50 trump also imposed sanctions on three senior turkish officials and turkey s defense and energy ministries i am fully prepared to swiftly destroy turkey s economy if turkish leaders continue down this dangerous and destructive path trump said treasury secretary steven mnuchin said the sanctions will hurt an already weak turkish economy pence said the u s will continue to ramp up the sanctions unless turkey is willing to embrace a ceasefire come to the negotiating table and end the violence american troops consolidated their positions in northern syria on monday and prepared to evacuate equipment in advance of a full withdrawal a u s defense official said the official who was not authorized to be quoted by name said u s officials were weighing options for a potential future counter is campaign including the possibility of waging it with a combination of air power and special operations forces based outside syria perhaps in iraq the hurried preparations for a u s exit were triggered by trump s decision saturday to expand a limited troop pullout into a complete withdrawal defense secretary mark esper said monday he would travel to nato headquarters in brussels next week to urge european allies to impose diplomatic and economic measures against turkey a fellow nato ally for what esper called ankara s egregious actions esper said turkey s incursion had created unacceptable risk to u s forces in northern syria and we also are at risk of being engulfed in a broader conflict the only exception to the u s withdrawal from syria is a group of perhaps 200 troops who will remain at a base called tanf in southern syria near the jordanian border along the strategically important baghdad to damascus highway those troops work with syrian opposition forces unrelated to the kurdish led fighters in northern syria esper said the u s withdrawal would be done carefully to protect the troops and to ensure no u s equipment was left behind he declined to say how long that might take in a series of tweets monday trump defended his gamble that pulling u s forces out of syria would not weaken u s security and credibility he took sarcastic swipes at critics who say his syria withdrawal amounts to a betrayal of the kurds and plays into the hands of russia anyone who wants to assist syria in protecting the kurds is good with me whether it is russia china or napoleon bonaparte he wrote i hope they all do great we are 7 000 miles away trump has dug in on his decision to pull out the troops believing it fulfills a key campaign promise and will be a winning issue in the 2020 election according to white house officials this has effectively ended a five year effort to partner with syrian kurdish and arab fighters to ensure a lasting defeat of the islamic state group hundreds of is supporters escaped a holding camp amid clashes between invading turkish led forces and kurdish fighters and analysts said an is resurgence seemed more likely just months after trump declared the extremists defeated trump spoke about the is detainees in a phone call monday with kurdish general mazloum kobani pence said mazloum assured the president that kurdish forces would continue to support the prisons holding is fighters speaker nancy pelosi d calif said late monday that the house will vote this week on bipartisan legislation aimed at blocking military sales to turkey and clamping sanctions on its leaders assets she said trump s sanctions package was insufficient adding his erratic decision making is threatening lives risking regional security and undermining america s credibility in the world republican senate leader mitch mcconnell normally a staunch trump supporter said he was gravely concerned by events in syria and trump s response so far withdrawing u s forces from syria would re create the very conditions that we have worked hard to destroy and invite the resurgence of isis he said in a statement and such a withdrawal would also create a broader power vacuum in syria that will be exploited by iran and russia a catastrophic outcome for the united states strategic interests however trump got quick support from republican sen lindsey graham of south carolina who earlier had lambasted his withdrawal decision as shortsighted irresponsible and unnerving to its core graham said he was asked to join the president and his team for phone calls with the key leaders in the conflict president trump made it clear to president erdogan this incursion is widely unpopular in the united states greatly destabilizing to the region is putting in jeopardy our successes against isis and will eventually benefit iran graham said the kurds have turned to the syrian government and russia for military assistance further complicating the battlefield the prospect of enhancing the syrian government s position on the battlefield and inviting russia to get more directly involved is seen by trump s critics as a major mistake but he tweeted that it shouldn t matter others may want to come in and fight for one side or the other he wrote let them ass
