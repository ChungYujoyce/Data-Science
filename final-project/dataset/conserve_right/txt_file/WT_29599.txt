tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion a 75 year old woman came forward a few days ago to claim that president trump raped her in a department store dressing room in the mid 1990s big news right nope america yawned and so weirdly did america s media although the horrific accusation from e jean carroll a longtime advice columnist for a women s fashion magazine came out friday not one of the main tv networks nbc abc cbs cnn and fox talked about the accusation on their sunday political talk shows back when mr trump was running for president the networks couldn t get enough of the salacious sex stories that appeared about him every few weeks including bridget sullivan the former miss new hampshire who said he once hugged her a little low on her back top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens n y gov andrew cuomo s careless cruelty shows in coronavirus nursing home policy so why the collective media silence when ms carroll made her alarming accusation no one knows for sure but here are a few thoughts on why the story crashed and burned before it ever got off the ground first ms carroll is in a word odd when cnn on monday decided to interview her for its new day morning show no doubt realizing by then that it was missing an easy bash trump story she retold the tale she first alleged in new york magazine throughout the retelling of what she said was a somewhat violent rape she laughed and smiled she said she met mr trump at a bergdorf goodman store in new york about 23 years ago and that he recognized her as the elle advice columnist mr trump asked her to help him pick out something for a mystery girl she said adding that he shouted lingerie mr trump she said found a see through body suit and told her to go put it on ms carroll who said she was spinning a comedy scene in my head said maybe he should try it on ms carroll followed mr trump into a dressing room and the minute he closed that door i was banged up against a wall then he just went at it she said it was against my will 100 legally it was rape cnn host alisyn camerota said helpfully before replaying a tape in which mr trump said you can grab women by the p asked about her reaction to that tape ms carroll said i felt relief and i that s right that s right second ms carroll said she s barely political but the washington post noted that ms carroll is a registered democrat who supported hillary clinton in 2016 she donated 1 000 this cycle to emily s list which supports female candidates who back abortion rights and 500 to president barack obama s reelection campaign in 2012 according to campaign finance records on twitter she has posted several sharp remarks about trump and retweets of satirical and critical articles about him the post wrote in her cnn interview she said i can t believe that he is in the white house and it makes me sick third the shocking accusation appeared just days before ms carroll s latest book what do we need men for a modest proposal hits bookstores mr trump pointed that out in his statement about the allegation saying he s never met this person in my life she is trying to sell a new book that should indicate her motivation it should be sold in the fiction section mr trump said there is zero evidence no pictures no surveillance no video no reports no sales attendants around i would like to thank bergdorf goodman for confirming they have no video footage of any such incident because it never happened of course this has happened to mr trump before most notably with two books by author michael wolff fire and fury and siege trump under fire both insider tales that were widely discredited mr wolff wrote that mr trump was having an affair with nikki haley then the u s ambassador to the united nations prompting a new york times writer to say mr wolff was spreading evidence free detail fourth ms carroll said that while she still has the very dress she was wearing that fateful day she won t allow the new york police department to test it for dna a la monica lewinsky i do not know if the president ejaculated i have no idea ms carroll said well a dna test would determine that and new york city mayor bill de blasio running for the democratic nomination in 2020 said if she brought a criminal case the city would pursue it again she said no last there was this very odd exchange when ms carroll appeared on anderson cooper 360 rape mr cooper said is a violent assault ms carroll replied i think most people think of rape as being sexy let s take a quick break mr cooper said abruptly they think of the fantasies ms carroll continued hmm we re er mr cooper stammered gonna uh take a sh quick break we re if you can stick around we ll talk more on the other side you re fascinating to talk to ms carroll said mr cooper who had just solemnly declared that ms carroll was violently raped laughed end of story joseph curl covered the white house and politics for a decade for the washington times he can be reached at emailprotected and on
