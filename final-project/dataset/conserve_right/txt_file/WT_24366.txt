would send a signal that the united states doesn t stand by its partners and allies particularly at a time when threats from hostile countries such as iran are increasing saudi arabia has long been a regional rival to iran its strategic importance has grown as tensions with iran have mounted after trump unilaterally withdrew the u s from a 2015 accord that restricts the iranian nuclear program the senate votes came as the house oversight committee released a report criticizing the trump administration over its apparent willingness to allow the president s friends and allies undue influence over u s policy toward saudi arabia new documents obtained by the committee raise serious questions about whether the white house is willing to place the potential profits of the president s friends above the national security of the american people and the universal objective of preventing the spread of nuclear weapons the report said the report exposes how corporate and foreign interests are using their unique access to advocate for the transfer of u s nuclear technology to saudi arabia said rep elijah cummings of maryland the panel s democratic chairman cummings who has repeatedly targeted the trump administration in a series of investigations came under sharp attack from trump this weekend when the president called the congressman s district a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess where

rick perry steven mnuchin mike pompeo rex tillerson james mattis and wilbur ross the report said the report also criticized the white house for refusing to produce any documents in the investigation and said communications obtained from outside sources indicate that kushner and other officials used personal email or text accounts to communicate about saudi related deals the private communications appear to violate white house policy and the presidential records act the report said the white house did not respond to requests for comment monday a spokesman for barrack said he has been cooperating with the oversight panel and provided documents the committee requested the spokesman owen blicksilver said barrack s investments and business activities are well known and are intended to
