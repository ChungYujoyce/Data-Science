obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic president trump said sunday that he is not happy with china over the communist nation s early fumbles in disclosing the novel coronavirus as the u s government and intelligence agencies investigate the origins of the virus and whether beijing initially concealed information about the outbreak mr trump said he wants to get into china to investigate what led to the outbreak from wuhan vice president mike pence told the sunday talk shows that beijing wasn t as forthcoming as it should have been and that u s officials will make inquiries at the proper time the virus came along and i m not happy and i let them know mr trump said at his daily briefing adding that the pandemic ruined the good faith he had built with china in a trade deal we re not happy this is not a good thing that happened see also trump issues order deferring of some tariffs the administration is looking into two main areas whether china downplayed the potential threat of the virus putting the u s and other nations at a disadvantage and whether the pathogen spread to humans from animals at a wet market in wuhan or whether it escaped perhaps unwittingly from a government laboratory nearby if it was a mistake a mistake is a mistake but if they were knowingly responsible yeah then there should be consequences mr trump said earlier in the weekend i haven t ruled out anything i want to look at the facts as they come in mr trump is pointing fingers at china while facing criticism at home for early stumbles in testing and isolating the virus as the outbreak raced across the globe in late january and february the virus has reached every state in the u s sickening over 740 000 see also great partner trump plays short clip of cuomo praising feds states have been forced to shut down once thriving economies mr trump who faces reelection in november is weighing whether the communist government in beijing should pay a price mr trump revisited the concept repeatedly over the weekend he said the spread could have been stopped in china before it started and it wasn t and the whole world is suffering he has also cast doubt on the death toll reported by china where the virus was first discovered late last year he said china s reported toll of roughly 4 600 is a major undercount and suggested that deaths in china probably exceed the u s total which neared 40 000 on sunday mr trump confirmed that the u s is looking at how the virus began to spread in wuhan a city of 11 million in china s central hubei province it depends was it a mistake that got out of control or was it done deliberately mr trump said i think they were embarrassed i think they knew it was something bad and i think they were embarrassed there are two main theories regarding the origin of the virus that it hopped from its natural reservoir in bats to an intermediate animal which then infected humans at a live market or that it leaked out of a wuhan laboratory where it was being studied scientists say details and samples of the virus from wuhan are needed for developing therapies and vaccines and for responding to future health crises secretary of state mike pompeo said china is blocking access to the wuhan institute of virology which potentially has information about the spread of covid 19 we are still asking the chinese communist party to allow experts to get into that virology lab so that we can determine precisely where this virus began he said on fox business network it s not political this is about science and epidemiology we need to understand what has taken place so that we can reduce the risk to americans in the days and weeks and months ahead and get the global economy back on track china initially agreed to provide virus samples to the united states but later refused to do so beijing also refused to allow u s and international virus and disease specialists to visit wuhan for several weeks after the outbreak which began in december the chinese government formally acknowledged the outbreak in late january further limiting the ability to determine the origin of the virus the chinese foreign ministry dismissed reports that the virus leaked from a wuhan lab it said world health organization officials have repeatedly stated that there is no evidence showing the virus was made in a lab but other foreign leaders including british foreign secretary dominic raab and french president emmanuel macron are echoing u s complaints about china s actions mr macron on thursday ridiculed claims that china s authoritarian government had done a better job dealing with the pandemic let s not be so naive as to say china has been much better at handling this the french leader told britain s financial times in an interview we don t know there are clearly things that have happened that we don t know about congressional republicans are backing mr trump s get tough approach to china rep ron wright of texas and rep chris smith of new jersey filed legislation friday that says americans duped by chinese misinformation over the coronavirus could sue the chinese government in u s courts the bill strips china and any other country that misleads the world health organization of sovereign immunity giving americans the ability to pursue beijing in court mr trump has been unwilling to criticize chinese president xi jinping directly however after a march 27 phone call the president tweeted discussed in great detail the coronavirus that is ravaging large parts of our planet china has been through much has developed a strong understanding of the virus we are working closely together much respect on jan 24 as the virus consumed wuhan he tweeted the united states greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency it will all work out well in particular on behalf of the american people i want to thank president xi pressed at the sunday briefing on why he spoke highly of mr xi at the time the president said he was happy with his trade deal with china but got upset when the virus emerged then we found out about the plague he said in a testy exchange with a cnn reporter former vice president joseph r biden the presumptive democratic nominee for president is highlighting that tweet in an ad that says mr trump fumbled his response to the pandemic the clip also highlights mr biden s calls from a late february debate stage to get u s investigators into china the trump campaign says mr biden is the one who is soft on china and has cited the former vice president s failure to embrace the administration s ban on foreign nationals who had traveled to china within 14 days mr trump imposed the restrictions on jan 31 the virus may have been circulating already or come in from elsewhere in february and march though mr trump s move is widely credited with preventing a deeper problem stephen dinan rowan
