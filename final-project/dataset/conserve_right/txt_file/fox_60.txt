democrats threaten to use subpoena power to release special counsel robert mueller s unredacted report on the russia investigation insight from ben ray luj n assistant speaker of the house this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday april 7 2019 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated bill hemmer host i aposm bill hemmer in for chris wallace house democrats hit a turning point in their investigations of president trump begin videotape hemmer first threats to use subpoena power to release the full mueller report rep jerrold nadler d n y chairman house judiciary committee the committee must see everything hemmer and the move to see the president aposs tax returns donald trump president they aposll speak to my lawyers they aposll speak to the attorney general hemmer as the president himself shifts focus back to a signature campaign issue border security trump the crisis is a direct result of the obstruction by democrats hemmer we aposll discuss the tension between the white house and the democratic majority with white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and we aposll go inside the investigations with assistant speaker of the house ben ray lujan only on fox news sunday plus joe biden former vice president i will be more mindful and respectful of people aposs personal space hemmer joe biden tries to deflect a political crisis biden by the way he gave me permission to touch him hemmer before he even announces biden what aposs the holdup putting everything together man hemmer we aposll ask our sunday panel whether the former vp can weather this storm all right now on fox news sunday end videotape hemmer and hello again from fox news in washington good to happy with us today on this sunday morning there is a new political front in the fight over bob mueller aposs russian investigation house democrats are demanding access to the entire 400 page report also this week investigators are seeking mr trump aposs tax returns as the president pushes his policies over immigration in a moment we aposll speak exclusively with white house chief of staff mick mulvaney but first here aposs a look at where the battle lines have been drawn just this week begin videotape hemmer a day after the house judiciary committee voted to authorize subpoenas for mueller aposs full report chairman jerry nadler called for transparency citing reports that some on mueller aposs team were concerned that barr aposs principal conclusions went too easy on trump nadler it just gives us additional reason to say release the report so we can see it hemmer the president aposs attorney rudy giuliani blasted those reports rudy giuliani attorney to president trump there are a bunch of sneaky unethical leakers and their rabbit democrats who hate the president of the united states hemmer in a rare public statement the justice department pushed back criticism saying every page of the confidential report was marked may contain material perfected under a federal law that protects confidential grand jury information and therefore could not be publicly released house speaker pelosi warning democrats will not give up rep nancy pelosi d calif speaker of the house show us the mueller report show us the tax returns hemmer house ways and means committee chair richard neal sent a formal request to the irs citing a rarely used while getting agency until wednesday to hand over six years of the president aposs tax returns rep richard neal d mass chairman ways and means committee clearly it aposs unlikely that we are going to receive a response immediately but we aposve prepared for the long game here trump they will speak to my lawyers they will speak to the attorney general hemmer a lawyer for the president says granting the request would set a dangerous precedent and in a renewed push on immigration the president visited the border with mexico after backing off a threat to shut it down and a day after unexpectedly pulling nomination of ron vitiello to lead ice where he had been the acting director trump we are going in a different direction ron is a good man but we aposre going in a tougher direction hemmer now the president says he can stop the flow of illegal immigrants with tariffs on mexican cars trump i don apost think we aposll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the united states from mexico at 25 percent will be massive end videotape hemmer joining me now here in washington to talk about all of this white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and mick welcome back to fox news sunday mick mulvaney acting white house chief of staff good morning bill it aposs good to see you hemmer good to see you it aposs been quite a week i want to go into the issues in a moment but just broadly speaking do you believe the dynamic between the trump white house and house democrats went into a new phase this past week mulvaney i think it probably went into a new phrase right after the mueller report came out in the barr summary came out because the democrats really were caught flat footed they really did believe that mueller would find collusion and find obstruction in fact they invest very heavily and that and then to be blindsided like that to find out there aposs no obstruction no collusion i really think they were never expecting it hemmer now you aposre on the tax issue too mulvaney i want and after that we aposll be on something else the democrat party is infested with what we call trump derangement syndrome they still cannot accept the fact that he won like the election and they will do anything they can to try and either undo that or prevent that from happening again go back to the president aposs state of the union speech he said really there aposs a choice here you can either choose to work with me or fight against me and it aposs clear with the democrats have done they have no interest in working with this president on the border on health care and anything they want to fight with the president and they will do it every chance they get hemmer let aposs go to the issues now first on the border as you just mentioned the president gave mexico a one year warning this past week he also calls a crisis why wait a year mulvaney keep in mind i think that word about waiting a year dealt with drugs there aposs a couple of different things he said this week which is we need help right away on the migrant crisis on illegal immigration folks coming across the mexican border we also have another longer term issue with mexico on drugs that i think if you go back and look at his statement he said we need help within the next year on drugs the good news there is that in the last week mexico really has stepped it up for the very first time they are preventing people from coming in on their own southern border down towards guatemala and honduras and they are also accepting more of the folks that cross into the united states back into mexico in fact i know it aposs hard to imagine but again nancy pelosi runs the democrats in congress mexico has done more in the last week to help our illegal immigration crisis than nancy pelosi and democrats in the house it aposs been a pretty good week hemmer as you bring that up the president said this about that on thursday begin video clip trump for the last four days and you actually have covered it to a very minor extent mexico has been capturing people and bringing them back to their countries end video clip hemmer that aposs the argument you aposre making here what changed mulvaney i think they took him seriously i think when the president comes out and says look if you don apost come stop helping us we are serious we will look at closing the border we will look at tariffing your automobiles they recognize that aposs not that aposs not an empty threat for the president of the united states the situation on the border is a crisis we have been talking about that for i guess almost three or four months very few people believed us at the outset i think more and more people now accepting the fact it is a real life crisis i think even the washington post and the new york times acknowledged that for the first time this week it is his number one priority and when he sets out and says look mexico if you don apost help us we will have no choice but to do these things i think mexico pays attention hemmer he also threatened to cut off aid to central american countries is that still a threat today mulvaney absolutely for the same reason this is his number one priority keep in mind dealing with health care is nice dealing with the economy is nice the president aposs first responsibility is to defend the integrity and the safety of the nation and we really do believe and i think again most folks are starting to agree with us now that the situation on the border is a national security crisis hemmer the issue is this broadly speaking families arrive here with children they are willing to turn themselves in the facilities that house them are overloaded and then they are released into the country have the smugglers mick have they beat us at our own policy mulvaney they certainly game the system they aposre not stupid keep in mind these are mexican cartels oftentimes that can reach hundreds if not tens of hundreds of millions of dollars moving people they traffic human beings the goal has been deeper to what you just said it aposs not just about families if an unaccompanied child crosses the border dhs can only hold that child this is a child already separated from the parents by the choice of the family only has to send them to hhs but if hhs doesn apost have room for them dhs cannot keep them cannot send them back to the country they came from there aposs legally nothing that the dhs can do with the children that aposs why we need hemmer but the smugglers know the weather is going to get warmer and now is the time for them to ask i want to get to a lot of things just to cut through on this issue what is the plan to get out of this current crisis mulvaney number one mexico has to continue to do what they are doing by preventing people from coming into mexico and then accepting people that we send number two the northern triangle countries have to prevent their own people from leaving and number three this is a one we don apost get a chance to talk about enough congress must act the laws are what is acting as this giant magnet for these illegal immigrants and congress has to chase those laws change those laws again i think for the first time even democrats are starting to recognize that hemmer on the issue of taxes the president aposs lawyer put out a forceful four page statement this past week it was almost in unison with what the democrats asked for about wednesday about midweek given that statement if you read through it were you expecting this mulvaney you always expect from the from the democrats if they don apost get what they want from us we report they will ask for the taxes if they don apost get what they want they aposll ask for something else so it doesn apost surprise anybody but keep in mind they knew they are not going to get these taxes they know what the law is they know that one of the fundamental principles of the irs is to protect the confidentiality of you and me and everybody else who files taxes they know that they know the terms under law by which the irs can give them documents but a political hit job is not one of those reasons hemmer to be clear you believe democrats will never see the president aposs tax returns mulvaney oh no never nor should they keep in mind that that aposs an issue that was already litigated during the election voters knew the president could have given his tax returns they knew that he didn apost and they elected him anyway which is of course what drives the democrats crazy but they know they aposre not going to get this they just want the attention on the issue because they don apost want to talk to us about policy hemmer but he aposs argued that he aposs under audit has said that for a couple years but even under audit legally you could allow people to see it mulvaney you could always allow people to see it but that aposs not what aposs happening here the democrats are demanding that the irs turn over the documents and that is not going to happen and they know it this is a political stunt by my former colleagues hemmer bill barr and maybe his summary comes out this week maybe it comes out the week following this past march 29th i should say he wrote the following there are no plans to submit the report to the white house or a privilege review has that changed mulvaney we aposve said from the very beginning that mr barr will make these decisions there are laws in place that govern how this special investigation is conducted keep in mind got a lot of attention i think in the press about two weeks ago when all 420 odd members of congress who voted to release the mueller report to the public but if you go and look at what they actually voted on it says voted to release the mueller report pursuant to law that is the same thing the white house has been saying we want bill barr to follow the law period end of story and that aposs what he aposs going to do hemmer here aposs a tweet from the president yesterday morning on saturday he said i have not read the mueller report yet even though i have every right to do so only know the conclusions and on the big one no collusion likewise recommendations made to our great a g who found no obstruction has anyone at the white house made a request to see this report before it goes to congress mulvaney no again mr barr is going to make those decisions hemmer will that change mulvaney anything could change but i mean our position is that mr barr runs this process because that aposs the way the law is and we aposre very interested in following the law hemmer do you want to see it mulvaney i don apost really have much interest in seeing i wasn apost involved with i was over at omb during that process i don apost really have much interest i know what it says and it says no collusion and no obstruction keep in mind if we give the democrats all 400 pages unredacted that aposs not going to be the end of the inquiry and they aposre going to want another thousand pages that went into making that they aposre going to talk to the witnesses themselves this is not about getting to the truth it aposs not about the facts this is a political show by the democrats because they just don apost like the fact crosstalk hemmer just one point on this and then we aposll get to health care because i know you had a big meeting this week at camp david mulvaney and a busy week hemmer the president will he change or do you know if he would like to see the report before it goes to congress mulvaney i think the president has been very consistent mr barr is going to make those decisions and i aposm comfortable with that hemmer ok on obamacare you challenge in the courts last month was that a mistake to take that back to court mulvaney absolutely not keep in mind what we did last week i guess last month goodness gracious time flies is to decide whether or not we were going to agree with about 28 republican attorneys general in the states that said obamacare is unconstitutional the entire law it should not surprise anybody that donald trump decided that yes he thinks that all of obamacare is unconstitutional we had to fire a brief to that end that should come as a surprise to no one what was actually a surprise to us is that when jeff sessions was attorney general he took a different position and said only parts of the law were unconstitutional so no we did the exact right thing we think the court decided properly keep in mind the u s district court has already has already found all of the law to be unconstitutional we just think that was the right decision hemmer you know mitch mcconnell said this week he said he aposs not going to take it up in the senate mulvaney that aposs fine and keep in mind even if they did take up in senate the democrats in the house have absolutely no interest in working with us on this so again it shouldn apost surprise anybody we are not going to get to this before the 20 election that doesn apost mean we shouldn apost be talking about it and we will hemmer will we see a plan before 2020 mulvaney absolutely ph hemmer what happened at camp david mulvaney absolutely we had a great meeting this week we brought all of our health care specialists in mr azar from health and human services seema verma from cms and we started to talk about number one what we aposve already achieved keep in mind we don apost get nearly enough attention i don apost think for what we aposve done with drug prices drug pricing is unmistakably part of health care and drug prices in this country actually came down last year for the first time in 50 years that aposs because donald trump aposs president that aposs part of what health care is we spent the time this week and say ok what have we done what can we talk about that aposs a success what we need to work on going forward we talked about the individual marketplace we talk about how we are protecting medicare we aposre talking about getting drug prices down and i do think you aposll see a plan here fairly shortly hemmer will you see it before the 2020 election mulvaney oh yes we want to run on this we want to we democrats have already keep in mind democrats have already admitted that obamacare doesn apost work that aposs why they aposre out there talking about this sort of amorphous medicare for all they aposre not talking about how great medicare excuse me obamacare is because they know it aposs broken hemmer but as a campaign issue many democrats are running on medicare for all and some would argue let them run on that and allow the you step out of the way and allow the american people to sort through it mulvaney we are firm believers that you can apost beat something with nothing we have republicans have better ideas than democrats we should not be afraid to talk about that hemmer all right lightning round got a minute left ok mulvaney let aposs go hemmer herman cain expressed some reservations about going forward as a federal reserve nominee on friday night it is that nomination still alive mulvaney yes and i think herman will be a great member of the fed hemmer dems 2020 who concerns you the most mulvaney right now none of them goodness gracious it aposs a disaster hemmer when you aposre at camp david your discussions over the weekend crosstalk mulvaney honestly in all fairness bill it never came up we are having fun watching them implode hemmer last question how did joe biden do this last week mulvaney you know i have no idea i think listen the voters are going to decide i laugh a little bit when i look at my democrat friends and they aposre running for president almost like whoever can apologize the most for the most different things is going to win back democrat nomination it aposs almost like they want to make america apologize again and it aposs just a bizarre thing to watch as a republican hemmer i want thank you for coming today we got through all of it mick mulvaney thank you for your time mulvaney it aposs always good to see you hemmer appreciate it nice to see you in a moment here a rising democratic star congressman ben ray lujan joins us to talk about the democrats apos push for the mueller report and the president aposs taxes and the future of his own party that aposs next commercial break hemmer our next guest today helped democrats regain the majority in the house in the 2018 midterms leading to the investigative assault we are now seeing against the president joining us now from santa fe new mexico congressman ben ray lujan the number four democrat in the house and congressman lujan welcome back to fox news sunday rep ben ray lujan d n m good morning and good to be with you today bill hemmer i aposm going to start with the border as i did with mick mulvaney a moment ago six weeks ago you said this wasn apost a crisis do you still believe that lujan look this is not the national security crisis that the president continues to describe there is a humanitarian crisis but it aposs created by president donald trump when you go back to the threats even during the midterms the president was suggesting that there was an immediate national security crisis and he sent troops to the border just to try to distract the american people with the gains that we were going to see in the midterms then we went into a shutdown and the president took the same deal after 35 days of a shutdown that he couldn apost take on day one to prevent that government shutdown and here we go again with the president doubling down with threats to shutdown the mexican border which would have devastated the u s economy devastated the u s auto manufacturers concerns in many other areas including 27 000 workers in mexico as the mueller report was coming out so again i think the president continues to use immigration as a distraction as opposed to trying to work together in a bipartisan basis whether it aposs immigration reform hemmer ok lujan or other important measures that we could be talking about hemmer you aposre describing this as a political charade but let aposs look at the numbers in the past month alone more than 100 000 illegals have been stopped at the border how was that not a crisis lujan there are a number of people who have been turning themselves in to border patrol agents as the law allows in the united states for asylum seekers and so when the department of homeland security is reporting these numbers i don apost believe that they are accurately describing the numbers with a number of people that are turning themselves in the versus those that are being apprehended hemmer ok well here aposs the homeland security secretary for president obama this is what jeh johnson said this past week begin video clip jeh johnson former homeland security secretary by anyone aposs definition by any measure right now we have a crisis at our southern border according to the commissioner of cbp there were 4 000 apprehensions in one day alone this past week end video clip hemmer there it is again and the word again is he wrong lujan well again i would say there is a humanitarian crisis at the border but one that was created by president donald trump with his policies whether it aposs his metering initiatives or other policies that have been put in place by secretary nielsen look separating children from their families at the border is not a humane it aposs not with the united states should be doing and we continue to see this administration engage in those policies all that we are saying as democrats is mr president we want to work together on immigration reform just as you committed to do when you invited all the cameras in and said we could find some common ground i certainly hope the president was sincere in that offering and that we can find a way to work together as democrats and republicans in the house and the senate and this administration hemmer and they would and they would fire back and say congress hasn apost done anything last question on this if you look at the current reality are the smugglers beating us at our own game they are beating our laws and they are beating our system lujan well the united states needs to be working again with mexico and with the northern triangle countries i think the president is threatening to shutdown the border cut off the money from the northern triangle which would only encourage more violence in those countries and encourage more people to flee for their own lives think about why these moms are fleeing with their children they are terrified that they aposre going to be killed murdered or raped what parent wouldn apost do everything they could to protect their child with that being said now the united states can continue to work when it comes to strong policies in the united states and the way that democrats let the initiatives with the investments when it came to border security during the shutdown conversation what democrats did was make investments when it came to our ports of entry and also provided more dollars associated for border officials whether it was customs officials at the southern border or the northern border and also with the water ports we should be talking about homeland security and comprehensively as it pertains to national security in the united states hemmer unfortunately we are not going to settle this debate here today but let me most of the congressional investigations this past week politico framed it the following way it wrote the following in a single day house democrats demanded president trump aposs tax returns for six years move to get a decade worth of his financial records and prepared to issue a subpoena for the full mueller report from the justice department the white house would argue that aposs harassment is that what you aposre doing lujan absolutely not this is not political as our republican colleagues are making it out to be including my friend mr mulvaney who was speaking before me there are authorities under section 6103 with the ways and means committee to be able to get their hands and requests the president aposs tax returns in this case this as an authority that republicans used as recently as 2014 and an authority that was used during times with president nixon president ford as well and so again no other president in modern times has had to have their tax returns requested under 6103 because they aposve all voluntarily shared them just as president trump promised as a candidate that he would share his tax returns after he was elected he promised he would share his taxes to returns with the american people and he aposs refused to do so crosstalk hemmer if i could i just want to interject her mick mulvaney says democrats are never going to see them and you started your answer by saying this is all political however the request crosstalk lujan i did not bill bill i did not say it was political i said it was not political let aposs be clear about that hemmer ok correction noted then however in the request lujan thank you hemmer on behalf of democrats this week they want four years of his tax returns before he was president why is that relevant lujan again the president said he would voluntarily share his tax returns he has refused to do so and congress has used its authority when republicans were in charge back in 2014 it was used under president nixon and president ford and all we aposre saying mr president is share your tax returns as you promised with the american people and let aposs make sure that you aposre following the same rules and laws as everyone else again this is congressional oversight as we are carrying it out hemmer ok let the record show that you did say not political i want to make that fair to you ok lujan i appreciate that bill hemmer his attorney argues you must have a legitimate legislative reason and what is the reason congressman lujan well the laws are being followed under section 6103 under the authorities that are bestowed upon the congress in this case the chairman of the ways and means committee also the same authorities that the chair of the senate finance committee would have so i believe that chairman richie neal and his team have put together what i would say is an ironclad request that has been submitted and is going forward so again we just want to work under the laws that we have under the authorities in this case section 6103 which gives the chairman of the committee full authority to ask for these tax returns and for congress to see them hemmer ok let me go to the barr summary here maybe we get it this week maybe we get it in the first few days after that there was a late friday court decision that came out that ruled grand jury information must remain private now if that aposs the case democrats who want to make that report public and jerry nadler has said as much this past week if that court case stands the democrats just lose that fight lujan look congress has taken action not just democrats bill but republicans as well do you remember as mick mulvaney talked about the vote that took place on the house floor 420 0 democrats and republicans came together to say this report should be made available to the american people that aposs all that we are saying here so no i don apost believe that the court ruling hampers the ability for this report to be made available not just a congress but to the american people and that aposs something that we have been asking for and quite honestly the president even said a few weeks ago that he would make the report available that he supported that to the american people hemmer ok just lujan i don apost know why the president keeps flip flopping on this hemmer i want to get to one more topic just one question on this is there a risk that democrats overplayed their hand that we have watched over the past weeks here lujan well look on the tax returns alone over 50 percent of the american people believe that those that information should be made available to the country there is broad support as well for the special counsel aposs report to be made available to the american people as well so again what we are talking about here is constitutional oversight that the congress has a responsibility to carry out and that aposs all that we are doing here we should work together in a bipartisan basis in the same way the republicans did under president barack obama let aposs work together let aposs make sure that this information is made available to the american people hemmer i have about 30 seconds left here you aposve declared you aposre going to run for senate in new mexico but you helped lead democrats to a majority in 2018 it is also clear that there are fractures within the freshman body in the house have you stopped to think about what you created lujan look i am so encouraged by the work of our new members across america i worked diligently to lead the effort with nancy pelosi the win back the majority in the u s house of representatives where we have policy experts in every area national security experts down to those that have started successful companies and created jobs across the country there aposs a lot of energy and passion and i think we should unleash that energy as we work to deliver for the american people and while i announce that i am running for the united states senate there aposs a lot of work to do over the next two years including making sure that we just not continue to deliver for the american people as house democrats but that we flip the senate in the same way that we delivered the house for the american people and that aposs something that we aposre working on doing hemmer president obama went public over the weekend in a town hall i don apost know if you saw it but what he suggested is that you run the risk of having a circular firing squad when you go against each member what did you think about that comment lujan well i didn apost hear the president aposs town hall but look i think that as a caucus we have family disagreements we are a big caucus we aposre a big tent caucus and so you aposre going to have some disagreements but you have them as a family in the end our values and our principles are the same when we want to talk about how we can deliver for the american people who are still having a hard time even though the economy is doing better there still our families across the country who if they had a 500 emergency there wouldn apost be able to fit that into the family budget for the month and as we aposve also heard from senator bennet out of colorado most recently the concerns associated with wage growth in the country has been stagnant working families like the one i was raised are still having a hard time across the country and that aposs what democrats are committed to delivering hemmer ok lujan lowering health care costs prescription drug prices passing hr 1 moving in a bipartisan way for infrastructure and creating job opportunities across america and we aposve already been able to do that but mitch mcconnell has been standing in in the way of progress in the senate and that aposs another reason why i am running for the u s senate hemmer sir i appreciate your time today thank you and good luck to you congressman lujan from new mexico today lujan thank you bill hemmer please come back thank you in a moment here we aposll bring in our sunday group to talk about the renewed battle over congress getting the full mueller report commercial break hemmer coming up the 2020 democratic candidates staking out their positions as others ponder jumping in begin video clip sen kamala harris d calif presidential candidate america must admit it has a problem of mass incarceration sen elizabeth warren d mass presidential candidate we should get rid of the filibuster rep eric swalwell d calif i aposve made a decision i will announce it shortly end video clip hemmer we aposll ask our sunday panel about the state of the race next commercial break begin video clip trump i aposll rely on the attorney general to make decisions but i will tell you anything that aposs given to them will never be good enough you could give them more the the more documents than they aposve ever seen and it would never be good enough end video clip hemmer president trump lasting democrats for trying to obtain special counsel bob mueller aposs report time now for our sunday group charles hurt from the washington times is here today juan williams fox mews political entities marie harf co host on benson and harf on fox news radio and katie pavlich editor of townhall com good morning to all of you unidentified male good morning unidentified female good morning hemmer how was the green room unidentified female great always fun hemmer it is it is my sense that a new dynamic has been created this past week in the relationship between this white house and house democrats charlie do you see it that way charlie hurt the washington times i think absolutely what we have seen you know and the sad part of that is the fact that you have a lot of very important issues that are on the table and i think and i think the reason that president trump won in 2016 and the reason i feel i think he feels confident about winning re election is that he aposs remaining focused on on those issues that people actually care about viewers watching right now that they care about but here in washington all we aposre talking we aposre talking about irs records we aposre talking about the mueller report we aposre talking about russia all of these things they they really don apost amount to all that much importance i think to regular americans hemmer if he aposs right juan the issues get petrified and we stick on matters like this for the next year juan williams political analyst well i think what aposs interesting about this space and i think you aposre exactly right something has changed i think in the aftermath of the release of the barr letter and the mueller report transition to justice from the special counsel the thought was wow president trump he says he aposs totally exonerated and you can see that people who are trump supporters were anticipating oh there aposs going to be a bump in his approval numbers there hasn apost been or there aposs going to be a victory lap in which a lot of the acrimony the bullying the type that would decrease but in fact he aposs had a very rough week here in washington on just the points that you aposre describing taxes hemmer let me juan williams health care immigration hemmer just to advance the conversation here aposs jerry nadler on the mueller matter from this past wednesday begin video clip rep jerrold nadler d n y house judiciary committee chairman the committee is entitled and must see all the material and make judgments as to what can be redacted for the public release by ourselves end video clip hemmer so just to be clear the argument he aposs making katie is that the committee wants to see everything katie pavlich townhall com editor right hemmer and then they will decide what to make public pavlich based on the political dynamics of washington d c democrats certainly cannot be trusted with seeing all the underlying material democrats don apost want to see everything because they aposre interested in transparency they want to see it so they can then leak information about certain people in trump aposs circle who were simply looked at as part of the mueller investigation but did not have any evidence or were charged with crimes not indicted as a result of the investigation and so no jerry nadler is not entitled to all of the information they want to use it politically while democrats are fighting in 2020 in a primary against each other democrats in washington d c are trying to get as much information and political ammunition as possible to give to the ultimate nominee they aposre doing that through the mueller report i just have to say when it comes to them accusing the white house of not being transparent on the issue of the mueller report the white house has not requested to see the mueller report ahead of time president trump has said he is not going to assert any kind of executive privilege even though he has the right to do so over the information and the special counsel is actually working with barr right now on the redactions they aposre working together to redact information that the public should not see in order to preserve due process and protecting people aposs privacy in this country hemmer speaking of bill barr marie a rare public statement from him on thursday this is how it read every page of the confidential report he put in his statement provided to attorney barr on march 22 was marked may contain material protected under a federal law that protects confidential grand jury information therefore cannot be publicly released so we don apost know what he releases in the end but the law allows the ag broad authority on a lot of these matters marie harf co host benson and harf that aposs true but i think what we aposve seen from the other statement barr made after the letter when he came out and said hey this wasn apost intended to be a summary it sort of seemed like he was doing a little bit of cleanup because his four page letter came out and then the president and his supporters started claiming full exoneration saying they were he was totally cleared on everything including obstruction which isn apost true so i get the sense that william barr was getting a little nervous about how it was being used politically and the more time that goes between that letter and the full mueller report coming out it will appear political and partisan even if it aposs not right even if william barr is is crossing every t and dotting every i look i know charlie aposs laughing here but there are a lot of us who who look if the shoe were on the other foot and it was a democratic attorney general summarizing in four pages a 400 page report into a democratic president you would not accept that and we need to see the full mueller report not for political reasons hurt i aposm not harf but because as an american i actually want to see what happened in 2016 call me crazy cross talk hurt i aposm not accepting anything the full report is going to come out there are going to be but there harf when hurt it aposs going to come out the reason the whole system the whole process seems so politicized is for two years democrats made up this complete lie about collusion and and and you had people like adam schiff running around saying oh i have secret evidence that shows that proves that collusion and none of it happened and and we and obviously and you aposre right harf well we don apost know we haven apost seen it hurt ok ok maybe william barr is completely lying and he he made everything up in that but i aposm i aposm kind of thinking it aposs doubtful i aposm kind of thinking that democrats are sort of holding onto this because they have to but at the end of the day all that stuff is going to come out the courts are going to determine what parts of the grand jury stuff can come out what can apost all these votes that we had this week are all political posturing and that aposs why nobody believes it hemmer trey gowdy told me this week we aposve only seen 50 percent of what russia did in 2016 williams well see i think that aposs the point that the russia hemmer can can may i quickly williams that russia interfered in the election is a base finding out of the mueller report there is no commission by donald trump to say we need to stop this for 2020 hemmer so then we we need to find out what department of homeland security tells you about that i want to talk about these taxes ok the president aposs lawyer came out with a very forceful letter friday afternoon in part it read the following it would be a gross abuse of power for the majority party to use tax returns as a weapon to attack harass and intimidate their political opponents once this pandora aposs box is open the ensuing tit for tat will do lasting damage to our nation so katie where does this end pavlich well look when you ask people if they think the president should release his tax returns they will say yes but whether it aposs an issue they actually care about when it comes to voting is another question president trump was elected in 2016 without releasing his tax returns bernie sanders now is saying that he aposs not sure when he will release his tax returns his wife has had an fbi investigation for bank fraud as a result of of maybe why doesn apost want to release his tax returns the bottom line is should he release them sure should it be would it be more transparent if he did absolutely but whether democrats are asking for tax returns in good faith is the bigger question they aposre not asking for them williams well i think the founding the founding fathers pavlich because of transparency they aposre asking for them because they want to use it williams you can hemmer hang on juan pavlich as a political weapon against the president hemmer go ahead williams i think you aposre maligning people who are in fact pursuing the founding father aposs desire that no foreign government pavlich i aposm not inaudible i just said he should release them williams no because you say democrats to doing this for a political purpose how about they aposre in fact fulfilling their constitutional job which is to hold the executive accountable the emoluments clause put in place by the founding fathers specifically spoke to the idea you don apost want foreign actors controlling or having leverage over this president every president since jimmy carter has released his tax returns pavlich ok but you aposre making an accusation that he aposs been influenced by a foreign entity without any evidence williams i didn apost make an accusation i just said why shouldn apost we know hemmer mick mulvaney told us this show today that democrats will never see the tax returns hurt so hemmer quick charlie hurt if if the president doesn apost he aposs i don apost think he aposs going to release them and from a political standpoint he shouldn apost but the the the point of congress is to oversee the irs it doesn apost have a right to oversight a harf of the president hurt a political not a political agenda going after the president if they the only reason they have a right to do this according to this obscure law is oversight of the irs this is not oversight of the irs this is harassment of the president hemmer here here aposs what democrats here aposs what democrats would argue i just want to play a quick clip here from nancy pelosi this past week listen to her words here begin video clip rep nancy pelosi d calif house speaker this is a question of to us it is inevitable to them it is inconceivable you have to short the distance between the inevitable and inconceivable end video clip hemmer you listen to her words there and that they aposll make the case about the mueller matter and the taxes on both issues last comment on that harf right i think that in 2018 voters said we want more transparency and that aposs what they gave democrats control of the house and asked them to conduct oversight so look their as to katie aposs point voters may not care they may have answered this in 2016 there are some things that are right to do even if voters don apost care and we can apost lose sight of that in washington hemmer a quick time out panel we aposve got to take a break here when we come back joe biden tries to put his controversy behind him are the accusations disqualifying we aposll talk about that when we come back commercial break begin video clip joe biden former vice president sometimes i think president trump is a tragedy in two acts you better wake up this country can apost afford more years of a president looking to settle personal scores trump i don apost see him as a threat i think he aposs only a threat to himself end video clip hemmer a preview of the attacks to come between president trump and joe biden should the former vice president decide to announce a run in 2020 back with the panel now nice to see you all on a sunday that comment from joe biden was on friday that was inside an event when he came outside he talked again with cameras again with cameras and said this begin video clip biden i aposm sorry i didn apost understand more i aposm not sorry for any of my intentions i aposm not sorry for anything that i have ever done i have never been disrespectful intentionally to a man or a woman end video clip hemmer so marie you start how did you do harf i think he handled this pretty well because it was a it was a tough situation when these stories started coming out and people were trying to put them in a me too context when none of the women have said these were sexual allegations and quite frankly i think joe biden knew some of this would be coming he knows that there are other people particularly in the democratic party who don apost want him to run who think he aposs past his prime he had to be prepared for this but the bottom line bill is when you look at democratic voters or voters in general there aposs still a lot of support for joe biden in in the polls democrats know that they aposre still a lot of support for the obama biden eight years that he is going to run that aposs going to be a key part of his platform if he runs i was part of his very successful eight years so look i think he did the right thing by threading the needle and saying everyone should have their personal space respected and i have learned that maybe some of my behavior isn apost appropriate anymore but there is no one i think who aposs ever worked with joe biden who don apost think he aposs empathetic hemmer ok harf and don apost think that he is a decent person hemmer there seem to be harf and that came through this week hemmer there seem to be katie this drip drip drip last week pavlich and he admitted that he thinks that more woman will probably come out with some kind of allegations saying that i aposve met you know thousands of people and taken thousands of photo but he accidentally or maybe purposefully admitted that he was going to run for president we aposve been waiting for him to officially announce he was he was asked if this would change the way he campaigns he said absolutely it will change the way i campaign so he aposs confirming that he aposs getting into the race actually think he didn apost handle this very well and this is why the accusations came out he did the video which was fine but by joking about it during his first public appearance in front of the speech the crowd that he was giving he kind of degraded the sincerity of not the apology but of the explanation of invading people aposs space and moreover it was a huge distraction to what he was actually saying if you listen to the speech that joe biden gave he talked about blue collar workers he talked about making more money for the work that you put into earn he was making a pitch to voters hemmer so you aposre suggesting pavlich that he aposs going to be competing with donald trump for in places like ohio michigan and wisconsin and all of the headlines were about his joke about being able to to hug people because he got permission and it aposs a big distraction for him hemmer you aposre suggesting he minimalize the allegations that came out harf maybe that aposs pavlich he did that he did that and he also he also distracted from inaudible harf inaudible problem for writing the headlines that way hemmer far be it for me to get in between the ladies here but i aposve got something for the gentleman too harf it aposs a tough place bill hemmer i think it may have been the statement of the week wall street journal editorial page this past week mr biden hasn apost event announce whether he aposll run for president but he aposs already being hazed for his past as an insufficiently woke pale male if he can apost win by running as the white guy he is than he ought to retire with his political dignity intact end quote charlie hurt yes you know that aposs a good that aposs a it aposs sort of hard to top that but you know i also have a hard time feeling too sorry for biden because of course this is the democratic party that he created he can apost you know if if if he doesn apost want to have his democratic party holding up crazy standards and and having crazy scandals over what is basically sniffing people aposs hair and and he aposs a space invader which is is i don apost like that i find it very unpleasant but it aposs not like you know trying to liken this to some sort of sexual assault is is insane but it aposs his party and this is what he aposs created which goes to the very heart of the reason why i think he is vulnerable in a general election he aposs been here for 45 years he aposs been part of the washington problem for decades and and whether you love trump or you hate him the one thing that that i think was most appealing for people about trump was the fact that he aposs just not from here and he aposs going to do everything very differently biden will be going back to the old hemmer juan can you top the insufficiently woke male i mean but before you do hurt pale male hemmer pale male yes thank you very much before you do this might have been the tweet of the month i think i think there aposs a new category for that when this went out from the president aposs tweet begin video clip biden i inaudible i hug people i i grab men and women by the shoulders and say you can do this and and whether they aposre women men young old it aposs just the way i aposve always been end video clip hemmer i aposll leave it to you williams well i think you know joe biden responded to that bill by saying oh mr president i see you aposre being so presidential and i think that aposs in part a response to what charlie was saying that yes joe biden aposs been part of washington but i think there are lots of people not only democrats but independents who in a sense want somebody who will be steady not juvenile not bullying not you know up to tricks constantly and creating enemies demonizing people and so i think that there aposs a real appetite for normal at this moment in washington hemmer we shall see if you get that standby group we aposll get a break here in the moment would be democratic presidential hopefuls undaunted by joe biden or other big names now getting in the race the numbers are high they aposre testing the waters we aposll discuss who is still making moves next commercial break begin video clip tim ryan d 2020 presidential candidate flyover states are my states the flyover states are your states and the flyover states are going to start governing in the united states of america again end video clip hemmer that aposs ohio democrat tim ryan announcing he too is running for president joining one of the largest primary field we have ever seen back now with the panel nice to see you all yet again it aposs like triple dose here today isn apost it harf it aposs great hemmer tim ryan is making the case that he could appeal to these trump voters in wisconsin michigan indiana ohio we aposll see if that aposs the case but here aposs what i want to show you in 2016 here were the republican candidates we had 17 look at the names look at the faces so far in 2019 on the democratic side we have 17 look at the names and look at the faces on the screen this is without joe biden this is without eric swalwell from california it aposs without howard schultz to the panel then who do you believe based on that screen so far who may not be on that screen who aposs got the staying power pavlich i think joe biden has the staying power i think that bernie sanders has the staying power because he has the energy of the left on his side and i think pete buttigieg has the staying power because he aposs an outsider he aposs he aposs governed as a mayor in a small town in indiana he has a different message and he aposs authentic whereas other candidates like kirsten gillibrand and elizabeth warren are trying much too hard to try and impress voters who they think need to vote for them to get through the primary hemmer do you agree with that marie harf i actually completely agree with katie i think those three names i would put you know on my list of people that will survive through iowa through new hampshire certainly i would out probably add beto to that because even though he doesn apost have specific policies and some people are criticizing that he has that magic that political magic you can apost teach right he has star power he is getting huge crowds and he aposs raising money in terms of the senate candidates the people that are currently senators that are running i think kamala harris probably of that crew she aposs raising the most money she occupies an interesting place hemmer marie your list is very long here harf no i got five i gave you five hemmer you know winnow down harf i give you five i gave you five hemmer five at the moment pavlich a big field hemmer juan how many do you have harf biden but but look at that we have the most diverse crowd in history which i aposm really proud of we should candidates should look like america should look more like america but of my five i think we aposll be that top contenders four of those are white men which is interesting hemmer got it juan williams i think what aposs interesting to me at this point in looking at both lists that you put up bill is money because it used to be that money was definitive but then after 2016 trump wasn apost the top fundraiser in the republican primaries or the general election and obviously he aposs our president this time around bernie sanders doing very well with donors joe biden is a little struggling as he get up to the line but he will do well beto o aposrourke aposs doing well but i don apost think it aposs going to define right now it aposs a jump ball 2022 for the democrats and i think they aposre searching hemmer charlie hurt well you know clearly if you take some people like tim ryan and and joe biden or or mayor pete that aposs probably the smart route for democrats to take in terms of challenging president trump and taking back those voters that he took from it from the democratic traditional democratic fold the problem is that the the democratic primary is focused on all these crazy issues like supporting open borders the green new deal we aposre about reparations now this is insane stuff that is not going to play well in in regular america that doesn apost williams i think that aposs a republican fantasy that that aposs what we aposre running hurt yes williams i aposll tell you what democrats are talking about hurt the new green deal was something williams they aposre talking about health care they aposre talking about demonizing immigrants unfairly pavlich illegal immigrants williams they aposre talking about a spike in terms of hate crimes anti semitic action in this country under this president charlie nobody is focusing on green new deal hemmer they aposre also talking about medicare for all inaudible harf right well we aposre talking about how to give people health care and i think for most democratic voters and maybe this is my hope that the one litmus test isn apost medicare for all it aposs not the green new deal it aposs who is most able to beat donald trump that has to be the focus for democratic primary voters that aposs why the people i put in that top category right now fit that bill hemmer i aposve got to leave it there sorry charlie thanks marie thank you katie pavlich thank you hemmer thank you juan williams my pleasure hemmer we aposll see you all very soon great panel today pavlich inaudible hemmer thank you and we aposll see you all next su
