gap president obama flies the country in a grand 747 cruises in plush limousines adorned with american flags and speaks from the white house rose garden while his campaign opponent mitt romney flies in a smaller md 83 passenger jet rides in nondescript suvs and makes speeches at factories and strip malls but on wednesday that gap is closed even if just for 90 minutes when voters see the two men stand on the same stage together and go head to head in the first presidential debate of the campaign debates are an equalizer for challengers because there are no office trappings on stage said darrell m west director of governance studies at the brookings institution it is two people answering questions and voters can reach their own impressions without outside filtering top stories postal

averages of polls including those taken in colorado which plays host to wednesday s debate at the university of denver larry j sabato director of the university of virginia center for politics said that he has never known a challenger that didn t long for debates it is the only chance to go toe to toe with the incumbent and look just as presidential as he can mr sabato said that helped sen john f kerry close a gravitas gap in 2004 with incumbent president george w bush who was running as a wartime leader with troops in both afghanistan and iraq mr kerry s camp said after the first debate that being on stage with the president helped elevate the democratic candidate because mr kerry was able to handle the same questions and engage in a back and forth with the president with that experience mr kerry has been helping mr obama prepare for the debates playing the role of mr romney in practice mr romney has tapped ohio sen rob portman a former trade ambassador and white house budget chief under mr bush to play the role of mr obama both mr obama and mr romney have hunkered down over the past couple of days to prepare mr obama in henderson nev and mr romney already in denver but each candidate has managed to squeeze in time away from their practice sessions mr obama whose camp has said he hasn t had as much time to prepare as he would have liked took a tour of the hoover dam and marveled at his guide s revelation that most of the electricity produced goes to power southern california for his part mr romney snagged a burrito bowl with mr portman at a chipotle mexican grill in the outskirts of denver where the company is headquartered on wednesday both candidates will do private walkthroughs of the debate site beforehand then likely lay low until the evening affair 90 minutes in front of the same audience facing the same television cameras and fielding questions from the same moderator in this case pbs newsman jim lehrer debates are the only opportunity voters have to see these candidate mano y mano said mary anne marsh a boston based democratic strategist you don t ever see them together other than in the debates it is one of the only chances for voters to see how their candidate stacks up against the incumbent in that respect mitt romney has an invaluable opportunity mr romney could use the equalizer because the campaign trail is anything but equal all the pomp of the presidency follows mr obama s trips aboard air force one while mr romney s plane dubbed air romney by some reporters has broken down on the tarmac at a virginia airport the md 83 is an old old technology while air force one has all the bells and whistles in it the way that any up to date airplane would said capt richard rick dake a consultant for aero consulting experts who has flown planes for 40 years air force one would be like the park avenue of airplanes and romney is on the motel 6 or take the trappings of major events last month after the assault on the u s compound in libya that left four americans dead mr obama strode out to the rose garden to stand with secretary of state hillary rodham clinton at his side and deliver a statement mr romney meanwhile tossed together a last minute press conference at his jacksonville fla campaign headquarters which is located in strip mall next to a shop called blazin reptiles that bills itself as the city s cleanest and finest exotic pet store mr sabato said that day underscores the built in advantages an incumbent has it is amazing that even when the economy is weak incumbency can carry a president along we are seeing it this fall he said if a president can remain likable some voters will forgive him a lot the jury though is still out on whether the debates will significantly move the needle for either of the candidates some say the debates are less important than in the past because voters are so familiar with the candidates thanks to the 24 hour news cycle and length of the presidential campaign which for mr romney started 18 months ago when he announced at a farm in new hampshire that he would make a second run for the presidency debates are less important this year than in the past for two reasons said h w brands a historian they are old hat and therefore will attract fewer viewers than in the past and both candidates are well known obama by virtue of being president romney from the two dozen republican debates unless one or the other commits a great gaffe these debates are unlikely to change many minds mr brands said copyright 2020 the washington times llc click here for reprint
