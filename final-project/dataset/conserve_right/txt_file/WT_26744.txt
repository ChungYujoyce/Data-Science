er for national battle who in the obama administration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn senate republicans have loaded the nuclear option cannon and say they ve got the ability to fire it but are still debating when or even if they actually pull the trigger as president trump complains about democratic obstruction of his nominees gop leaders say they have enough votes to change the interpretation of the filibuster rules and shorten the amount of delay that can take place but senators said they are holding out hope that democrats will agree to the rules change in a bipartisan fashion negating the need to go nuclear top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director sen james lankford an oklahoma republican leading the push for the change said he has approached democrats but none has been willing to publicly back his plans some have said they envision backing the change in the future but it would have to be starting in 2021 or after they believe they will have ousted mr trump from office which clearly is not rational mr lankford said this is a proposal that i would be comfortable with regardless of who is in the presidency mr lankford s plan which he wrote with rules committee chairman roy blunt would apply to lower level administrative posts and district court judges it would not apply to cabinet level positions nor to appeals court or supreme court picks it wouldn t affect the number of votes needed to end a filibuster which is now just a majority after democrats nuclear option rules change in 2013 but it would reduce the time allowed for debate after a filibuster is defeated under current rules each nominee can be debated for up to 30 hours and democrats have frequently demanded all or most of that time be used meaning that some weeks in the senate are spent on nothing other than confirming four people to posts when democrats controlled the senate in 2013 they struck a deal with the gop to cut the time limits for debate on president barack obama s nominees but that deal expired in 2015 democrats say mr trump s nominees have been uniquely bad and they say it s worth forcing the senate to spend the extra time debating many of them this month democrats attempted a filibuster of william beach nominated to be commissioner of the bureau of labor statistics he was approved 55 44 republicans said they were stunned that they had to face a filibuster and then spend hours debating the labor statistics post few democrats publicly explained their opposition but one who did sen elizabeth warren called mr beach a tool of radical right wing billionaires she also said opposition to mr beach was retaliation for republicans refusing to back several democratic nominees to bipartisan panels before mr beach there was john fleming the deputy assistant secretary of commerce for economic development whose confirmation also required a 30 hour clock to tick this process is being abused everybody knows it mr blunt said on the chamber floor this month but triggering the nuclear option is controversial it involves using a shortcut to change the interpretation of senate rules by a majority vote rather than the two thirds tally that is usually needed to rewrite the chamber s rules or a standing order rules change which likely would take at least 60 votes to clear when democrats used the nuclear option in 2013 it created bad feelings that linger today senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said he has the votes among republicans to pull the trigger and mr lankford agreed with that count but they have set no deadline for themselves democrats are particularly worried that mr trump would be able to get more lower court judges approved more quickly during a recent press conference senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat said he wouldn t entertain working on a rules change until republicans agreed to give home state senators a veto over judicial picks from their state that is known as the blue slip process restore the blue slips and then let s talk about a compromise said mr schumer according to the hill they can go
