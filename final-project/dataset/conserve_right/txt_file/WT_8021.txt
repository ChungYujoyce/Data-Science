coronavirus pandemic after diplomats said it had agreed to compromise language with china that didn t directly mention the world health organization the who is an issue of growing dispute between the world s two major economic powers the u s objection to the security council resolution drafted by france and tunisia reflects rising tensions between washington and beijing and apparent differences

care centers have died of covid 19 in the past three weeks according to data released by the state this week that s nearly double the total reported for the previous two weeks the increase in deaths could be attributed to a significant jump or a backlog of cases being added over the past week said melanie amato a spokeswoman for the state health department since mid april more than 4 300 nursing home residents and staff members have tested positive for the virus the numbers don t tell the entire story of how the virus has devastated nursing homes during the pandemic because the ohio department of health has only released the totals for just the past three weeks before that the state didn t require local health departments to report nursing home deaths linked to the virus so any numbers collected before mid april may not be accurate amato said friday overall the nursing home deaths reported since april 15 account for 40 of all the virus related deaths in ohio since the first
