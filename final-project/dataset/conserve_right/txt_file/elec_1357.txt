runner after raising 18 million in 41 days during the first quarter of the year the most of any candidate o rourke raised 9 4 million in 18 days in dueling rallies town halls and house parties they spoke most of improving health care and affording college tuition top stories coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud you are not going to die from covid 19 other hopefuls fanned out to political hot spots elsewhere with much the same mission gauging early strength in a crowded field and raising enough money to secure a coveted spot in the presidential debates that begin in june republican leaders have relished the jockeying among democrats i d be happy with any of em to be honest the president said of the democratic derby here s a roundup of the crowded democratic campaign iowa democrats know sanders the vermont senator who lost the state and the democratic presidential nomination to hillary clinton in 2016 at two town halls in counties he won during that caucus fight sanders questioners asked most about making health care more affordable over and over people told sanders grim stories about medical bills putting them deeply in debt he empathized at one point putting an arm around a young woman who had begun weeping as she spoke sanders told his audience that he supports medicare for all and a single payer health care system but he didn t get into specifics shannon abel a 28 year old coordinator at a nonprofit organization in muscatine iowa said she still liked what she heard from sanders then again she had only begun seriously paying attention to politics after nearly a year of being ill and seeing the medical bills with an 80 co pay put her family deeply in debt of sanders abel said he knows what it s like to not have money o rourke is calling for a range of educational changes to alleviate college debt including providing free community college and allowing students to potentially eliminate or refinance their debt through public service the cost of higher education and not just tuition is out of reach for so many of our fellow americans o rourke told a crowd gathered for a campaign house party in polk city iowa he said the tens of thousands in debt that students carry when they graduate is a weight that literally sinks them into the ground to solve the problem he offered a number of proposals to help students stop digging the hole and stop taking on debt when they go for a college degree making community college free allowing students to earn an associate degree while they re in high school so they re ready to earn a living wage on day one increase access to union apprenticeships for those already saddled with student loan debt o rourke said he d like to re up the public service student debt forgiveness program a federal program that currently accepts only a fraction of applicants and is eliminated altogether in president donald trump s latest budget proposal if students are willing to work in in demand jobs at places like the department of veterans affairs or willing to teach school or be in a support role in a community that needs your talent and human capital i want to wipe clean your student loan debt at a minimum i want to refinance what you have at a much lower rate sanders says he wants to make college free and pay for it by getting rid of tax havens and lowering taxes for the richest americans that s been received with some skepticism among budget and deficit hawks but to trevor meyers 19 it sounds right meyers like sanders is a democratic socialist the muscatine county resident attends a nearby college and lives at home with his family which owns a farm a sibling he said is five figures in debt from college how is anybody in our society going to get started in life he wondered he liked sanders but said he s going to check out one of o rourke s events too former colorado gov john hickenlooper is discussing gun control and

want those kinds of reforms in south carolina and elsewhere sen michael bennet told reporters in nashua new hampshire that he hopes to be on the move again a few weeks after surgery for prostate cancer i don t think there s any point in dwelling on it said the colorado democrat if it turns out to be worse than i think i ll deal with it then the cancer diagnosis has slowed us down a little bit bennet said when asked about how it would impact him getting on the debate stage for the democratic presidential debates with well over a dozen candidates now running it s obviously slowed down our ability to raise money and at some point it could have an effect on whether we get to the debate stage or not but i think we have a good chance to get there he said and with how he s feeling right now bennet said he s likely to run i mean i didn t pick this particular set of circumstances he said this is not how i would have rolled it out democrats running for president will have to do more than campaign on an anti trump message if they want to take back the white house in 2020 sen elizabeth warren said on saturday if your message is not trump it s not going to work the democratic

take town hall style questions from the two crowds speaking at gibson s bookstore in concord on saturday morning the 37 year old buttigieg said he understands people s difficulty in avoiding the spectacle of politics these days as hard as it is to take our eye off what we see on cable because grotesque things have the quality of drawing your eye and we can t take our eye off that show but the show s not what matters he said what matters is our everyday life he later told voters we ve got to change the channel and that s what we re about associated press writers alexandra jaffe in polk city
