2009 abudushalamu was hiding with his father on the 10th floor of an office tower in urumqi the capital of china s xinjiang region that is home to the turkic uighur ethnic minority by a park he

now live in turkey cut off from friends and family back home analysts say the urumqi riots set in motion the harsh security measures now in place across xinjiang where about 1 million uighurs kazakhs and other muslims are estimated to be held in heavily guarded internment camps former detainees have told the associated press that within they are subject to indoctrination and psychological torture abudushalamu was just 9 years old when the riots took place at the time he knew he was witnessing something terrible but he never imagined where the following years would lead i thought han and uighur people could be at peace he said the camps i never thought that would happen decades of resentment the riots started as a peaceful protest weeks before han workers killed at least two uighur migrants in a brawl at a toy factory in shaoguan an industrial city in china s coastal guangdong province the han workers were angry about the alleged rapes of han women by uighur men though a government investigation later concluded there was no evidence such an assault had taken place images and videos of the brawl quickly circulated among uighurs back in xinjiang including gory scenes of what appeared to be a han chinese man dragging a dead uighur by his hair the videos enraged many uighurs long upset with the han dominated government that took control of their region following the communist revolution in 1949 the litany of complaints was long heavy restrictions on religious education discrimination against college educated uighurs looking for jobs subsidies and benefits for han migrants to settle on lands once owned by uighurs among the most odious were threats from state officials of fines or even jail time if parents didn t send their young unmarried daughters to work in factories in inner china hashar a program that forced farmers to pave roads dig ditches and clear land for crops for the government for no pay fueled further resentment the killed uighur workers had been on a state employment program sent more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers from home for many their deaths crystallized everything that was wrong about beijing s heavy handed interventionist policies and the belittling racism they felt they were subjected to by the han chinese the images spurred urumqi students to organize a protest on july 5 demanding a government investigation demonstrators were stopped by police in the late afternoon and tensions mounted until officers opened fire uighur witnesses say two students present at the protests told ap that they were shot at one recalled that as he turned and ran bullets whizzed by his head and others around him dropped to the ground furious uighurs attacked han civilians on the streets an estimated 200 people were killed stabbed beaten or burned alive in the melees that followed uighurs smashed storefronts overturned cars and buses and set some ablaze the crackdown descends abudushalamu hid with his family for days as mobs of uighurs and han killed each other in cycles of bloody revenge when they stepped outside a few days later the streets were eerily empty abudushalamu said then the police arrived and started shooting two maybe swat team members came after me and shot at me said abudushalamu now 19 the bullet went through right behind my right ear i m lucky i m still alive in the days after the violence on july 5 2009 beijing had sent in thousands of troops to restore order for weeks they fired tear gas raided businesses and swept through uighur neighborhoods to arrest hundreds many of whom were punished with decades in prison the entire region of 20 million people was cut off from the internet for months in an attempt to curtail use of social media normality had returned but xinjiang was never quite the same ethnic divisions hardened han chinese avoided uighur neighborhoods and vice versa many han chinese steered clear of the whole of the region s south home to most of xinjiang s uighurs because they believed it was too dangerous experts say that july 5 and the subsequent crackdown was a turning point from that moment on china took a very hard line position toward the control of religion and the control of minority ethnic groups in the region said nicholas bequelin amnesty international s regional director for east and southeast asia it increased dramatically its security

through a busy market street in urumqi when newly appointed chinese president xi jinping visited xinjiang in 2014 bombs tore through an urumqi train station killing three and injuring 79 in a xinjiang work conference shortly afterward xi called on the state to integrate different ethnicities and remold religion to ward off extremism the more separatists attempt to sabotage our ethnic unity the more we should try to reinforce it state media quoted xi as saying china s ethnicities xi said could and should be united like the seeds of a pomegranate already tight limits on religion culture education and dress tightened even further with restrictions on long beards and headscarves and the detentions of prominent uighur academics and literary figures who were widely considered moderate advocates of traditional uighur culture after a new party secretary was appointed to take control of xinjiang in 2016 thousands began to vanish into a vast network of prison like camps beijing calls them vocational training centers designed to ward off terrorism and root out extremist thoughts but former detainees describe them as indoctrination centers which arbitrarily confine their inmates and subject them to torture and food deprivation that same year abudushalamu s father had taken him to turkey to study at a boarding school and then returned to china the following june he stopped responding to messages and abudushalamu never heard from his father again abudushalamu finally discovered his father s fate last year when an acquaintance in turkey told him he saw his father in an
