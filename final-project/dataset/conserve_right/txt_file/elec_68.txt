source ap photo joe skipper while all eyes were on the nevada caucuses people in super tuesday states started receiving their absentee ballots in places like california voters are encouraged to vote absentee it s been a way to garner greater political involvement and participation adam housley a former correspondent for fox news said he received two ballots one for non party preference npp and one for the libertarian ticket what makes the scenario even more troubling housley said he has never registered as a libertarian congrats california you have sent me two ballots one as a non party preference which i ve been for 20 years and one as a libertarian which i have never registered neither one has many choices other than new taxes being honest and ripping one up makes me wonder tho pic twitter com 6qds0zpx2v in a state with millions of people a small flub here and there is likely to happen but it turns out housley wasn t the only one who received multiple ballots i also got two when i called the elections office they said they were getting lots of calls about that mine was because i switched parties but still i moved to texas in 2012 changed my license but still have a home in ca i still get mail in ballots to vote in ca if i wasn t an honest person i could easily vote in both i didn t get two ballots but my party preference was changed from republican to no preference my son received 2 also followed by a letter which stated they were in error received a ballot for my wife who passed away last october sent it back democrats continually wonder why voter fraud exists there are multiple reasons automatic voter registration when people get a driver s license or identification card they are automatically registered to vote unless they opt out that automatic registration begins when people get their licenses at 16 years old but doesn t go into effect until the person turns 18 how do we know that the state is actually keeping that information safe for a year or two until the individual decides to vote how do we know their party preference has changed in that time frame the push for absentee ballots over the last 10 years there has been a massive push to get voters to utilize absentee ballots this helps ensure people make more informed decisions and vote at their own convenience but along with that convenience comes risk there s no way to verify that the person whose name is on the ballot is the one who actuallyvoted there s no way to know that the right person actually received the ballot and there s nothing keeping thieves from stealing a ballot out of a person s mailbox lack of voter verification when people show up at the polls they re not always required to show their id especially in liberal states like california the poll worker simply asks you for your name and address and off you go again there s no way for them to verify you are who you say you are and that s why people who have passed away are still casting votes from their graves what s taking place in california really isn t all that surprising it just reaffirms the idea that voter rolls need to be purged every year or two people s information needs to be verified and cross referenced before ballots are sent out and ids need to be checked at the polling booth these are simple fixes but they re the very ones that democrats are resistant to alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist twitter fact checks a pair of president trump s tweets update trump responds townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
