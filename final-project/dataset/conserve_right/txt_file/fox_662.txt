to enjoy all the benefits of our website the attack on the international body reveals the core contradiction in the president s geopolitical instincts get the new statesman s morning call email on 7 april amid a global pandemic donald trump returned to familiar territory bashing china and an international institution the whoreally blew it the us presidenttweeted referring to the world health organisation for some reason funded largely by the united states yet very china centric we will be giving that a good look fortunately i rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to china early on why did they give us such a faulty recommendation that evening at his press briefing trump announced that the us would cut funding to the organisation before backtracking and claiming that he said only that he would look at holding funding to the who which he said has historically been biased toward china in one sense the tweet is par for the course for trump he has been critical of china since before taking office and has launched a trade war against the country though he has also repeatedly lauded china s leader xi jinping whom he has previouslyreferred to as a friend and whose handling of the coronavirus outbreak he repeatedly praised this winter trump s criticism of international institutions is also familiar specifically the united nations of which the who is an agency what is more the president s tweet is not entirely wrong though he did not as he has claimed entirely close the border to china he is right that the us pays a far bigger chunk of who costs and wider un humanitarian budget than china does richard gowan un director at crisis group told me via email beijing has tried to become a multilateral leader on the cheap over the last decade using its political clout to gain influence but not making serious investments in bodies like who wfp world food programme or unhcr the united nations high commissioner for refugees moreover gowan writes the who has ducked and weaved to avoid offending china throughout the crisis making it an easy target for trump on 14 january the who tweeted that preliminary investigations have found no clear evidence of human to human transmission of the novel coronavirus more recently a canadian who official appeared to attempt to evade a reporter s questions about whether the organisation would admit taiwan a move opposed by china but in pulling away from international organisations trump is contributing to the very conditions he is now ranting about china is able to step into a position of increased influence in what remains of the multilateral order not despite the us s withdrawal from the world but because of it china for its part has been stepping up its efforts to engage un institutions particularly in light of moves by the us government stepping back from international engagement writes rui zhong an associate in the china program at the wilson centre in washington dc there is an unnecessary contradiction at the heart of trump s attitude to multilateralism on the one hand the administration has retreated from leadership across the un system but then it complains that china is leading instead agrees gowan adding that the us did not lead a multilateral response to covid 19 in the way that the obama administration did during the ebola crisis in 2014 and yet trump is now lamenting that the who is in hock to china that trump is spending his mid pandemic public appearances yelling about china and the who even if that criticism is at least in some part correct will make his china problem worse not better while washington denounces china s manipulation and muzzling of un agencies including the who chinese diplomats are showing up with a concrete vision resources and a compelling narrative writes kristine lee associate fellow with the asia pacific security program at the center for a new american security i do think there needs to be an interrogation of the who s relationship with china given that beijing recently announced a large donation to the organisation but washington s criticism of beijing in the un will ring hollow if it doesn t more fundamentally re engage with these types of international organisations and show commitment to multilateralism that trump spent a press briefing threatening to hold funding suggests this is a condition that will not be met that evening at his press briefing trump announced that the us would cut funding to the organisation before backtracking and claiming that he said only that he would look at holding funding to
