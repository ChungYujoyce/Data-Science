expositor of the 21st century russia is insisting that airstrikes must be coordinated with damascus and tehran china has yet to acknowledge the proposal to participate in the u s led coalition delivered last week by national security adviser susan e rice in this way russia and china are not only facilitating the power and reach of rogue regimes such as syria and iran but are also continuing to solidify their alliance which is actually the leading national security threat to the united states though few noted it until recently russian chinese collaboration has been growing for years tracing back to the 2001 forming of the shanghai cooperation organization which vladimir putin called a reborn version of the warsaw pact in describing his landmark 2013 visit to moscow his first trip abroad as chinese premier xi jinping called it a testimony to the great importance china places on its relations with russia the two sides have had closer strategic coordination on the world stage mr putin agreed russia and china had a true partnership he said indeed these longtime adversaries now work together along economic technological military and political lines russia and china proceed with strategic and tactical clarity and often with mutual support when russia invaded crimea in march china abstained from a vote condemning it in the united nations when the european union proposed new
