only a matter of time before the batteries cause a plane crash the fight over the regulations is an example of how lobbying often works out of sight and taking advantage of relationships institutional knowledge and politics to promote well heeled financial interests and it s become a test of the administration s resolve to place safety first lithium batteries can short circuit and catch fire

two pilots who were killed reported a cargo compartment fire and smoke so thick they couldn t see their cockpit instruments investigators suspect lithium batteries either started the fire or worsened it we take a back seat to no one when it comes to safety has been transportation secretary ray lahood s mantra but michael o moore a professor of economics and international affairs at george
