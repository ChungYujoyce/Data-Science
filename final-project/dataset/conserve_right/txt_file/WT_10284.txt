apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic in the glorious days of saturday night live in the late 1980s and early 1990s comedian kevin nealon achieved critical acclaim as mr subliminal a character who would make normal innocuous statements in his sketches but insert quick sarcastic quips unvarnished truth telling messages intended to offend and amuse in a free country the act brought mr nealon fame and fortune but a similar act in communist china has caused a major national scandal prompting the outraged government to promise the harshest punishments for the offending act bi fujian china s mr subliminal was utterly surprised at being caught in the center of the scandal at issue is an 80 second video clip that has gone viral on china s internet recorded at a private dinner table the clip showed mr bi singing a familiar aria from a mao era revolutionary peking opera called taking tiger mountain by clever strategy a song that glorified the awesomeness and invincibility of the chinese communist party mao zedong and china s troops top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches mr bi who served in the chinese navy for seven years is now the country s most famous tv personality hosting the nation s most popular american idol like singing competition called the avenue of stars and the annual chinese new year tv extravaganza called chunwan arguably the most watched tv program in the world in other words he is a national celebrity on par with ryan seacrest or dick clark the aria mr bi sang at the dinner table begins with the lyric i am a soldier of my worker and peasant brothers to which mr bi added his subliminal sarcastic comment wow i am a soldier when it comes to the line i am here to wipe out all reactionaries mr bi added are you sure you really can defeat your enemy an apparent reference to the national conversation over whether the thoroughly corrupt people s liberation army with so many big tigers caught in stupefying bribery scandals can still fight battles but the most offending part of mr bi s extemporaneous dinner table performance came after the lyric that says leading us forward are the communist party and chairman mao mr bi s subliminal addition described mao as that sob who has inflicted upon us so much pain mr bi was not done another line of the famous song reads wherever the red flag waves dark clouds dissipate and the people in the liberated areas struggle against the landlords and become the masters of the society again referring to the bloody maoist land reform where millions were executed as landlords on the video mr bi is heard adding a heretical commentary what have these landlords done to you to deserve their fate as a military veteran mr bi fires a last parthian shot at the corrupt pla with the aria s conclusion people s army endures suffering together with the people and we have come here to destroy and level the enemy occupied tiger mountain at that point he adds stop boasting with such bs and according to

been hosted by mr bi who was summarily stripped of all hosting roles on april 8 cctv officials said they had received instructions from the senior leadership of the party to severely punish mr bi for the private dinner performance clip that has presumably lampooned the great chairman mao the glorious communist party and the invincible people s liberation army china s massive internet spying and state sponsored rumormongering machine then kicked into high gear spreading politically motivated spin and slander postings by unverifiable online sources quickly asserted that the western woman shown in the video clip is a ukrainian diplomat and the video was shot by a cia operative working at the u s embassy in beijing with the intent to defame socialist china mr bi s private singing act suddenly became an international incident with claims of insidious foreign black hands operating behind the scenes to insult china on april 9 the ukrainian embassy in beijing issued on its official website a
