tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion democrats ten of em took to the debate stage for their third debate on thursday to offer up the best and the brightest and the most of their mostest means of beating donald trump for the white house 2020 and they came up with this the president s a racist the president s a gun loving immigrant hating racist whose gun loving immigrant hating racism has led to mass shootings and killings really top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time let the congratulatory parties for trump s reelection begin now democrats short on policies and long very long on socialist authoritarian all hail the low information voter soundbites ought to compose their concession speeches now here s a sampling of what the best of the democratic party brings we know donald trump s a racist but there s no red badge of courage for calling him that sen cory booker said and from mayor pete buttigieg tossed a softball about trump s wall building project specifically if it were racist anyone who supports this is supporting racism the only people who actually buy into this president s hateful rhetoric around immigrants are people who don t know any he said and this from sen kamala harris on recent mass shootings in america obviously trump didn t pull the trigger but he certainly tweeted the ammunition she said her point that trump s racist and it s his racist views that have stoked racial tensions which in turn have brought about racially based mass shootings as attacks on the president go these aren t exactly stealth julian castro for example bought advertising time in mid august in which he bluntly said president trump you referred to countries as sh holes you urged american congresswomen to go back to where they came from you called immigrants rapists as we saw in el paso americans were killed because you stoked the fire of racists innocent people were shot down because they looked different from you because they looked like me because they looked like my family words have consequences castro made the same point from the abc news debate stage donald trump he said then has a dark heart when it comes to immigrants but here s the thing if democrats are in it to win it if democrats truly want to have a chance at taking back the white house in 2020 they have to focus on something that s bigger than name calling particularly when the name calling is pulled from thin air absent factual basis black unemployment rate falls to a record low cnn wrote just a week before the debate over the weekend the unemployment rate amongst african americans hit a record low to 5 5 which is the lowest rate recorded since the labor department began tracking the progress back in the 1970s black enterprise reported a few days ago women of color are surging into the u s workforce the washington post just reported minorities ages 25 to 54 make up most new hires in workforce cnbc just wrote and back in july the new york times reported this hispanic women have emerged as the biggest job market winners in an economy that has now grown for 121 straight months all that would seem to put a dent in the democrats ongoing accusations of racism against this president yes or another way to ask would a true blue racist pol actually press policies that help minorities logic people think about it all that would also seem to explain just why democrats are so reluctant to go after this president on policy they can t they can t win on that this white house by even some of the trump hating media members own admissions has overseen a massive surge in economic good times a massive surge that has benefitted the very voters democrats count as their bread and butter blacks hispanics women so what s a poor democrat to do cry racism cry foul and accuse this president of the most heinous of crimes including inciting the murders of innocent american citizens the extreme rhetoric may make for good television news drama but in the end the left s cries are based on lies and that certainly won t win democrats the white house in the end trump s reelection team has little to fear cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
