apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic is there a crisis on the southern border here comes a reality check from brandon judd president of the national border patrol council which represents 16 000 border patrol agents as in 2014 we re dealing with an untenable number of unaccompanied minors but unlike in 2014 we re also dealing with adults bringing children into the united states and falsely claiming parental guardianship the first indicator of sex or servitude trafficking we re dealing with the smuggling of dangerous narcotics like opioids and fentanyl which has caused an epidemic and american deaths at unprecedented rates mr judd writes in an op ed for fox news we re dealing with a greater number of people from countries other than mexico el salvador guatemala and honduras and to top it all off we re dealing with a greater number of people illegally crossing the border who have prior criminal records in the united states clearly if the united states was dealing with a border crisis humanitarian or otherwise in 2014 you must agree that we re now dealing with a complete border catastrophe he continues top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches but the evidence gets even more damning politicians and at times the mainstream media would have you believe that the united states border patrol is arresting fewer people today than it did at the height of illegal border crossing arrests in the early to mid 2000s this isn t true it s simply a jedi mind trick meant to make you believe there is nothing to see here mr judd says noting that his officers are on track to arrest more people in fiscal year 2019 than ever before the national emergency is very real and border patrol agents nationwide are grateful to president trump for declaring it a bipartisan crisis was acknowledged in 2014 it is high time democrats republicans and independents acknowledge the current national emergency on our southern border and let the president deal with it effectively

noted during a senate judiciary committee hearing on wednesday this is not a crisis people say i hear absolutely no suggestions from our democratic friends on how to deal with the causes of these problems the texas republican observed no fox news for the democrats the democratic national committee has rejected fox news as a host for upcoming presidential primary debates recent reporting in the new yorker on the inappropriate relationship between president trump his administration and fox news has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates democratic national committee chairman tom perez said in a statement he made his decision despite the fact that fox news has been the most watched cable news network for more than 17 consecutive years consistently besting msnbc and cnn according to nielsen media research fox news defended the prowess of its broadcast teams praising news anchors chris wallace bret baier and martha maccallum for journalistic integrity and professionalism in the minds of many progressives this is a no brainer move fox s prime time talk shows relentlessly demonize democrats and the progressive agenda cnn analyst brian stelter wrote in the aftermath considering chris wallace moderated a presidential debate that seems a little short sighted tweeted john roberts chief white house correspondent for fox news and the sequel to all of this democrats just blocked fox news from holding a debate good then i think i ll do the same thing with the fake news networks and the radical left democrats in
