one last stop in his hometown before flying to tampa for the official nomination to the republican ticket vice presidential pick paul ryan slammed the current white house for putting the nation down a road of debt doubt and decline in an interview with fox news apos bret baier ryan teed up his speech at the republican national convention by stressing that the weather delayed event will nevertheless provide a critical opportunity to draw a contrast with president obama apos s policies the contrast between the president obama plan which has put us down the road of debt doubt and decline versus mitt romney apos s vision and solutions for a better future to get us back to prosperity couldn apos t be clearer ryan said and what we want to do is highlight those contrasts as republican officials announced that the abbreviated convention would be going forward as planned after a one day delay ryan said safety remains the priority and we apos ll have to call how we see it he went on to defend his tax policies preparing for what will likely be an onslaught of democratic attacks when the rival party holds its convention next week ryan rejected the conclusion of a tax policy center study which calculated that mitt romney apos s proposals to reform the tax code would require a tax hike on lower and middle income households obama has continually cited the study on the campaign trail it apos s not an accurate study it apos s actually not a study of the actual romney plan ryan said the tax policy center stated in its analysis that they do not score romney apos s plan directly since certain components of his plan are not specified in sufficient detail pressed to specify which loopholes he and romney are seeking to close the vice presidential candidate declined to elaborate we want to get rid of the corporate welfare the crony capitalism stuff in the tax code ryan said but we want congress to participate in a transparent debate in front of the public eye so we can have a really good debate about how best to broaden the tax base and lower tax rates ryan also made an appeal to supporters of ron paul whom the vice presidential candidate called a friend of mine we see eye to eye on a lot of issues and believe in some limited government ryan told fox news we believe in academic freedom we believe in the founding principles we believe that this is a watershed moment for america whether or not we apos re going to reclaim the american idea or we apos re going to become you know a cradle to the grave welfare state which is where i think the president is taking us ryan addressed the tension with paul supporters after the texas congressman held a counter convention rally in tampa sunday attended by thousands at the rally paul accused the gop establishment of failing the country ryan though noted that he and paul have served together for years in the house and suggested he wasn apos t anticipating any problems so i think in the final analysis ron is clearly going to he and his supporters should be very comfortable with us ryan said at the end of the day it apos s a choice between the president apos s failed leadership the big government that he apos s offering the borrowing that he apos s offering the spending and the regulating that he apos s offering which will give us a stagnant economy a lost generation not just a lost decade and the mitt romney paul ryan plan of reclaiming our founding principles getting back to economic freedom and liberty and reviving this economy monday apos s hometown rally for ryan was an emotional sendoff for the janesville native with 2 000 people gathering in his high school gym to celebrate the biggest political event the city has ever experienced we apos re fifth generation janesville wisconsin natives a visibly moved ryan said to the crowd which featured the atmosphere of a pep rally profoundly colored by hometown pride and it apos s not a unique story it apos s the american story and the reason our family came here and the reason everybody else apos s family came here is because of what this country stands for america apos s not just a piece of geography it apos s an idea baier asked ryan to reflect on the time he almost quit congress quoting an interview he gave stephen hayes of the weekly standard in which he said after we got thumped by pelosi in apos 06 i was just sitting in my tree stand right after that election thinking about you know why am i in congress what am i doing is it really serving a purpose that tree stand is about six miles in that direction ryan responded i can get into my tree stand within about 20 minutes of leaving my house i decided back then i apos m going to do what i think is right i apos m going to move this debate so we can get this country fixed so we don apos t have the kind of european result that we apos re clearly heading toward he continued and what i apos m really pleased to see is that we apos re finally having that adult conversation we need to have in this country if we want to fix this country apos s problems and get us back to prosperity and get people back to work ryan told fox news he thinks about his father who died when he was 16 every day it was one of those moments in a life where you basically have to make a decision whether you sink or swim you know when something like that happens to you it apos s a real punch in the stomach and you have to decide whether you apos re going to get yourself up brush yourself off and dive into life that apos s the decision i made when i was 16 and it apos s made me a stronger person as a result of it and i apos d like to think he apos d be proud of not just what we apos re doing here but of my entire family and and what we apos re doing get all the stories you need to know from the most
