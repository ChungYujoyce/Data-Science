candidate paul ryan hit the stump this weekend with a level of energy that seemed to boost mitt romney s entire campaign giving the presumptive nominee a much needed change in the narrative while adding another high profile fundraiser and campaigner to deploy across the country it got off to an inauspicious start though when mr ryan was first introduced saturday in norfolk va walking down the gangplank of the uss wisconsin with the theme of the movie air force one playing in the background mr romney got a little ahead of himself introducing mr ryan as the next president of the united states top stories purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni you are not going to die from covid 19 cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces mr romney quickly corrected the slip up saying he had been known to make mistakes but i didn t make one with this guy mr ryan showed a clear ability to connect with voters and infuse mr romney s campaign with quite literally a dash of youthful energy at 42 mr ryan is the same age as mr romney s eldest son tagg the two men campaigned together through virginia north carolina and wisconsin with mr ryan introducing himself to the nation showing an easy comfort when greeting supporters and firing up crowds by attacking president obama s policies and talking up his man at the top of the gop ticket he accused mr obama s campaign of going from a 2008 run based on hope and change to one of attack and blame we re not going to fall for it mr ryan told a cheering crowd in high point n c and while mr romney was pilloried earlier in the campaign for casually mentioning that he had a few friends who were nascar team owners mr ryan appeared thrilled just to meet one of the nascar drivers on sunday this is awesome he told a crowd of 10 000 plus at the absolute style furniture company in high point after exchanging high fives with some people on the way to the event i just had a great experience and that is i got to meet darrell waltrip that was pretty cool the mood also got to mr romney whose public persona can come across as a bit staid or square but who was clearly energized by his running mate and the responses from overflow crowds at the weekend rallies i am so happy i am so happy to have my teammate now he told cheering supporters in mooresville n c on sunday when the crowd interrupted mr romney s prepared remarks with chants of u s a u s a the former massachusetts governor went off his script to join in and pump his fist in the air as mr ryan did the same with mr ryan s selection which came earlier in the season than either of the selections in 2008 the republican ticket now has a second weapon to raise funds and to deploy as a major surrogate the way the obama campaign has used vice president joseph r biden we re going to split up more often than not and double our efforts mr ryan said in a joint interview with mr romney on sunday s 60 minutes it was one against two for a while now it s two against two we re going to redouble our efforts and we re going to bring a message to the country here s how you get the country back on track after the weekend with mr romney mr

said any changes wouldn t affect current seniors or those close to retiring what paul ryan and i have talked about is saving medicare is providing people greater choice in medicare making sure it s there for current seniors he said in the interview no changes by the way for current seniors or those nearing retirement but looking for young people down the road and saying we re going to give you a bigger choice in america the nature of this country has been giving people more freedom more choices that s how we make medicare work down the road he said the romney campaign is already grappling with how to square mr ryan s extensive voting record and his budget plans with mr romney s own stances with campaign aides stressing to reporters that mr romney is the top of the ticket mr ryan also marched in tune with mr romney on the matter of tax returns saying on 60 minutes that he had turned over several years of tax returns to the romney campaign as part of the vetting process but that he would publicly release two the same number mr romney has the former massachusetts governor has received pressure to release more senate majority leader harry reid nevada democrat has gone as far as accusing mr romney publicly and without proof of going 10 years without paying any taxes what i hear from people around this country they re not asking where are the tax returns mr ryan said they re asking where the jobs are where s the economic growth those are the issues that matter earlier in the weekend jaunt mr romney and mr ryan again appeared to feed off one another in a marginally successful effort to purchase pies at homemades by suzanne a shop in ashland va which another vice presidential candidate sarah palin also visited on the campaign trail in 2008 mr romney walked to the counter and asked what kind of pies they had blueberry rhubarb no mr romney glanced at the press corps as he was waiting for his apple pecan and chocolate pies urging a woman working behind the counter c mon push through there mr ryan instantly piled on with an odd combination of nerdiness politeness and feigned outrage are they messing with their pie making business here he said you guys are getting in the way of commerce the two already have somewhat of a culinary history they ate hamburgers together when they campaigned earlier this year mr ryan was also in on an april fools day joke when he introduced mr romney rather than vice versa as the next president of the united states to a practically empty room on the other hand crenshaw gymnasium at randolph macon college in ashland was so packed that the two actually hosted an impromptu rally afterward before an estimated 500 to 800 people who could not make it in but were still desperate to catch a glimpse of the 2012 gop ticket standing on two wooden crates the two men were practically doppelgangers in matching outfits of white shirts gray pants and no ties mr romney had taken off the blue and white patterned tie
