partisan witch hunt isn t over congressional democrats worried that the white house would try to get a sneak peek or interfere in the release of the report but a presidential spokeswoman said friday evening they had not seen nor been briefed on the report democrats also ramped up calls for mr mueller to testify on capitol hill about his work which they had at one point believed would lay out a case of collusion between the president s team and russian operatives and later believed would show mr trump engaged in obstruction of the fbi s investigation republicans were confident friday that no such conclusions have been made and they said the best way to put the collusion claims to rest was to make the report public that decision rests with mr barr i am reviewing the report and anticipate that i may be in a position that i may be able to advise you of the special counsel s principal conclusions as soon as this weekend mr barr wrote in a letter to the leaders of the house and senate
