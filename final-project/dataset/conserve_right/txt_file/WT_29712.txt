tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion president trump is growing the defense budget now but even he would agree that will become increasingly difficult as time goes on the population ages and the costs of entitlements and interest on the 20 trillion debt consume ever increasing shares of the federal budget so at some point we ll need to develop principles to guide decisions on what to cut and what to strengthen at the top of the list should be don t spend a dime on anything the military does not say it needs for its mission certainly such a policy is in place given past funding downturns you say not quite earlier this week the house armed services committee proposed in its annual defense funding legislation to purchase 90 f 35 fighter jets 12 more than the pentagon requested this includes 60 for the air force 10 for the marines and 20 for use on aircraft carriers top stories trump withdraws nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time this at a time when the f 35 s moment may have passed the program began in the early 2000s from the premise that all threats were more less the same and interoperability among branches of the service and even with allies that can buy their own versions of the f 35 was king so strong was the view that the plane was the answer to the military s modern fighter jet challenges that dozens were purchased before testing had been completed the results have been devastating the f 35 became in the words of popular mechanics magazine the symbol of everything that s wrong with mammoth defense contracts behind schedule over budget and initially oversold the government accountability office warned the pentagon that producing the plane while it was still being developed would incur tremendous costs as planes had to be retrofitted with the newer equipment and by 2013 the government estimated that 1 7 billion had been spent on retrofitting f 35s as the gao predicted it took 18 years for it even to be declared operational and still only about half the planes are operational on any given day because of mechanical and other problems f 35s are supposed to be good for 8 000 flight hours a recent department of defense report the average service life of the marine version of the plane was as low as 2 100 hours it didn t meet its reliability goals which meant fewer aircraft available for training and several vulnerabilities identified by cybersecurity testing have not been remedied japan suspended use of its f 35s after a member of its air force went missing in april the f 35 air to ground attack systems don t seem to be able to hit their targets the department of defense declared the accuracy of the weapons to be unacceptable to make matters worse the price is going up as lockheed martin scrambles to address the plane s weakness total acquisition costs this year are expected to be 428 4 billion up from 406 2 billion last year a 5 5 percent increase of course the f 35 program is no stranger to cost overruns this can t be blamed on the trump administration president trump promised during his transition to save taxpayers billions of dollars by reforming the program the f 35 program and cost is out of control he tweeted in december 2016 billions of dollars can and will be saved on military and other purchases after january 20th why if the pentagon doesn t want all 90 f 35s if the trump administration considers them a bad deal and if their reliability might have decreased does the ceo of lockheed tell investors if they chose to have an order on f 15 it won t be at the expense of f 35 quantities and that he is hearing that directly from the leadership at the pentagon not just our suspicion but i ve been told directly that quantities won t be reduced that is a good question for the democrats on the house armed services committee why is the ceo so sure a measure the trump administration opposes will receive full funding is this to benefit the mission of defending the country or are other motives at stake brian mcnicoll a freelance writer based in alexandria virginia is a former senior writer for the heritage foundation and former director of communications for the house committee on oversight and governme
