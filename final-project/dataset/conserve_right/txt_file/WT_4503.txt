into the white house as the probe accelerates toward a potential vote to remove the president democratic lawmakers want to hear next week from bolton the hawkish former adviser who openly sparred over the administration s approach to ukraine in particular president donald trump s reliance on his personal attorney rudy giuliani for a back channel operation bolton once derided giuliani s work as a

s former deputy charles kupperman has filed a lawsuit in federal court asking a judge to resolve the question of whether he can be forced to testify since he was a close and frequent adviser to the president any ruling in that case could presumably have an impact on whether bolton will testify a status conference in that case was scheduled for thursday afternoon trump and his republican allies on capitol hill say the entire impeachment inquiry is illegitimate and are unpersuaded by the house resolution formally setting out next steps senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said the format for the impeachment probe denies trump the most basic rights of due process now in its second month the investigation is focused on trump s july phone call with ukraine when he asked president volodymyr zelenskiy to investigate democrats and a potential 2020 political rival joe biden as the white house was withholding military aid ukraine relies on for its defenses democrats contend trump was proposing a quid pro quo arrangement on thursday the investigators are to hear from tim morrison a former top gop aide on capitol hill who served at trump s national security council and was among those likely monitoring the president s call with ukraine late wednesday it was disclosed that morrison was resigning his white house position he has been a central figure in other testimony about

department ukraine experts offered new accounts of trump s reliance on giuliani rather than career diplomats to engage with the east european ally a struggling democracy facing aggression from russia

foreign service officer catherine croft said that during her time at trump s national security council she received multiple phone calls from lobbyist robert livingston a former top republican lawmaker once in line to become house speaker telling her the u s ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch should be fired it was not clear to me at the time or now at whose direction or at whose

associated with george soros she said referring to the american financier who is often the subject of conservative criticism in the u s and europe most democrats are expected to support the formal impeachment investigation resolution thursday even if they don t back impeachment itself saying they are in favor of opening the process with more formal procedures public hearings are expected to begin in mid november a matter of weeks democrats are eager to hear from some top witnesses who have already provided compelling testimony behind closed doors including diplomat william taylor a top ambassador in ukraine and alexander vindman the army officer who testified tuesday that he twice reported to superiors including eisenberg his concerns about trump s actions toward ukraine vindman is willing to testify publicly according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity wednesday to discuss it at trump s hotel in washington during a fundraiser for house republicans and
