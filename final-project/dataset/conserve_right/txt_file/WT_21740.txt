garbage anti semitic tweets and odd musings on the calming effect of the holocaust for months the freshmen have rattled fellow democrats and clashed with party leaders by hurling charges of racism and blaming the u s for provoking terrorism that was of course before president trump tweeted that they could go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came

want to be a black voice we don t need muslims that don t want to be a muslim voice we don t need queers that don t want to be a queer voice she said in a podcast interview in may ms tlaib provided
