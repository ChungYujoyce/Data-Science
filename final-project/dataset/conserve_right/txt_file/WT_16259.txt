included isil is coming here regnery publishing is out with one of the first in depth looks at the greatest terror army ever built isis exposed beheadings slavery and the hellish reality of radical islam is not just an investigative report on the group s hideous atrocities and conquests the book also examines how the islamic state also known as isis or isil is winning over an increasing number of recruits from america s growing muslim population the twin cities somali community has been a virtual conveyor belt for foreign terrorist organizations over the past several years says author erick stakelbeck an investigative reporter for the christian broadcasting network a recognized expert on the jihadi movement mr stakelbeck has produced two previous works on the islamic threat the trilogy including the brotherhood a look at the global muslim brotherhood fraternity and the terrorist next door want a template for america s future look at the islamization of europe where isis is finding more and more followers not the down and out but middle class young people who answer a call to commit mass murder by september 2014 for example as the islamic state claimed huge pieces of territory in syria and iraq and launched a social media call to arms nearly 1 000 french residents had left the country for syria to join up over 100 have returned to france stay tuned isis sees france as a gold mine of potential recruits and is making a concerted effort to woo more french citizens to its ranks mr stakelbeck writes he believes these are great times that radical islam is our generation s war but not president obama s or as the author puts it america fiddles and the world burns we have reached a tipping point in the battle against radical islam mr stakelbeck says future generations will look back on this period in history much as we now look back on the cold war and world war ii and judge us on how we confront the existential challenge of islamic jihadism that has already changed the western way of life in profound ways rowan scarborough banned in asia the u s military pulled out the welcome mat from underneath your inside the ring correspondent who is currently finishing a two week visit to south korea and japan in south korea u s forces korea commander gen curtis scaparrotti turned down several requests for interviews his public affairs chief chris bush then said no other u s military officials would be available to discuss the activities of the 28 000 troops currently deployed on the korean peninsula the blanket rejection of visits interviews and briefings was transmitted in email messages labeled unclassified the lack of openness contrasts sharply with past commanders in south korea who along with senior generals and officers were easily accessible for interviews often on the record or more often on a background basis briefings on u s forces and the threat environment on peninsula and visits to military exercises and facilities also were common no more apparently current press policies are designed to keep news reporters away similarly in japan the public affairs office of the u s forces japan rejected all requests to visit yakota air base and yokosuka naval base a request to see the newly deployed kyogamisaki communications site japan s second high powered missile defense radar site located near the southern city of kyoto also was rejected the pentagon jointly announced the radar the deployment in december with japanese defense ministry suggesting the site is a joint base however japanese sources said japan s military has no role in the radar facility the reasons for the denials also vacillated initially u s forces japan said the site was off limits because other news organizations had requested seeing it then despite more than a month of requests public affairs official said the visit was rejected because they needed more time to arrange the visit one possible explanation is that a visit to the radar site might have upset the pentagon s high priority effort to develop closer military ties to china s people s liberation army a policy that has come under fire in recent months by members of congress who say the exchanges are one sided and have not developed closer ties between the militaries china in october criticized the kyogamisaki radar as destabilizing for the asia pacific region the radar is known as the army navy transportable radar surveillance system or an typ 2 which is used in rapidly detecting missile launches and passing the information to ships or ground defenses that can then fire missile interceptors no explanation was given for why interviews and visits were blocked for the key u s air force hub at yakota and the major naval base at yokosuka u s forces japan public affairs did not respond to an email seeking comment the u s pacific command which is in charge of forces in both countries also did not respond nor did a pentagon spokesman mr bush the u s forces korea spokesman suggested the command was too busy with the ongoing military exercises he also noted that a group of about 40 journalists and former members of congress hosted by the washington times had visited the demilitarized zone the group including this correspondent had a briefing from army col james minnich secretary of the u n command s military armistice commission critics say one key characteristic of obama administration press relations policies has been to try and limit or block information supplied to reporters the administration has been very aggressive in denying information to news outlets by a system that permits avoiding answering questions through phone calls instead officials demand that reporters provide media requests in writing usually through emails in response to the email queries official flacks provide vague non responsive and misleading answers to reporters one staple of public affairs obfuscation process is the frequent use of this classic response off
