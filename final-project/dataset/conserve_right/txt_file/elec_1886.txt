importance of facts a total of 26 times on the debate stage those facts required considerable clarification friday from the white house at one point the vice president claimed we weren apos t told of requests for more diplomatic security in libya a statement that appeared to clash with testimony by state department officials just one day earlier at another point biden appeared to signal a potential shift in policy when he described the president apos s proposed tax hike as affecting people making 1 million and more but white house press secretary jay carney while effusively praising biden apos s feisty performance had to use his briefing friday to clear up those and other statements on both points carney sought at length to explain why biden apos s remarks were being misinterpreted it marked a rather messy postscript to a performance that if nothing else fired up the base in a way president obama did not at last week apos s debate i thought he presented a remarkably strong case for the policies that this president has put in place carney said friday before launching into a string of explanations about the finer details biden apos s comment on libya drew widespread criticism from republicans mitt romney at a campaign rally friday afternoon in virginia asserted that biden had directly contradicted state department testimony biden during thursday apos s debate made the statement in response to criticism from paul ryan about the protection of diplomatic posts in libya in the run up to the sept 11 terror attack well we weren apos t told they wanted more security there we did not know they wanted more security again biden said yet state department officials just one day earlier had acknowledged they knew about and turned down requests for more security carney explained that biden wasn apos t talking about the administration writ large just the white house he was speaking directly for himself and for the president he meant the white house carney said this opened up a new line of questioning on whether obama and biden were ever briefed on the security requests though carney declined to say rather he made clear that decisions on personnel were handled below them at the state department level biden also drew the tsk tsk of fact checkers when he claimed that under obama apos s tax plan the middle class will pay less and people making 1 million or more will begin to contribute slightly more however under the tax plan obama has been promoting for years the threshold for a tax hike would be considerably lower individuals making 200 000 and households making 250 000 or about 2 percent of taxpayers asked whether biden had just indicated a shift in policy carney said absolutely not our position on the bush tax cuts has not changed carney said he said biden was just using the 1 million threshold as an example carney defended biden apos s extreme command of the facts though pointing out that he also referred to other numbers that accurately reflected the president apos s plan at another point in the debate biden did refer to 97 percent of the small businesses in america that make less than 250 000 why is that statistic important because as you know that apos s the 250 000 threshold as he made clear that 97 percent of american businesses do not have taxable income above 250 000 which goes right to the threshold the president has set since he ran for office back in 2007 carney said libya wasn apos t the only foreign policy area where biden left a few open questions on afghanistan he said we are leaving in 2014 period however that seemed to indicate there would be no flexibility to leave some kind of u s presence in the country after that point asked once again to clarify carney said it apos s our policy to withdraw our forces by 2014 but appeared to leave more wiggle room than biden did i think as was the case with iraq there are always conversations about future relations between our country and a country like iraq or with afghanistan but in terms of the forces that are there now and the policy of this president as was the case with iraq we are ending that war in 2014 he said biden made several other statements that raised eyebrows with the romney campaign though the white house did not necessarily address them friday in addition to his comment on the libya security issue the vice president went a step further thursday and placed the blame squarely on the shoulder of the intelligence community for the faulty narrative pushed for more than a week by the administration that the attack was a protest spun out of control that was exactly what we were told by the intelligence community biden said in response former cia chief michael hayden and former homeland security secretary michael chertoff now romney advisers chided biden we were disappointed to see vice president biden blame the intelligence community for the inconsistent and shifting response of the obama administration to the terrorist attacks in benghazi they said in a written statement it is clear that any failure was not on the part of the intelligence community but on the part of white house decision makers who should have listened to and acted on available intelligence blaming those who put their lives on the line is not the kind of leadership this country needs paul ryan wasn apos t without his own fact stretching at one point ryan said iran has enough fissile material for five nuclear bombs however iran isn apos t believed to have produced any of the highly enriched uranium needed to produce even one nuclear weapon let alone five iran would have to enrich uranium at much higher levels to produce a weapon and he appeared to be on his heels when biden noted during the debate that while ryan criticized the stimulus he also sought stimulus aid on behalf of wisconsin constituents biden appeared to stretch too when he hammered republicans over the wars in iraq and afghanistan and other budget busters dating back to the george w bush administration they talk about this great recession if it fell out of the sky like apos oh my goodness where did it come from apos it came from this man voting to put two wars on a credit card to at the same time put a prescription drug benefit on the credit card a trillion dollar tax cut for the very wealthy i was there i voted against them i said no we can apos t afford that biden said in fact biden as senator voted to authorize the use of force in both afghanistan and iraq though he would later speak out against the iraq war and advocate a pared down presence in afghanistan it apos s unclear if he was specifically referring to the wars or to the bush tax rates in his debate comment the associated press contributed to
