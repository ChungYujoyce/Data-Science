national review biden s middle class tax pledge envision a presidential campaign without handshakes rope lines or rallies expose the fraudulent trump russia plot at all levels apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound how important are political conventions way back in january i went through the then 34 seats where a republican incumbent was retiring and concluded that most were in deeply red districts and not likely to flip to democrats pollsters and media organizations are less inclined to conduct surveys of house races both because there s less public interest and because such polling is expensive given that area codes don t always align neatly with congressional district lines moreover many of the house race polls that have been released to the public are sponsored by a partisan firm and a slew of house districts with open seats haven t been polled at all so you should feel free to take the following with as many grains of salt as you like all that said in the districts where we ve seen a poll since summer things generally look pretty good for the gop here s where things stand as of now arizona second district the just completed siena new york times poll of this race found democrat ann kirkpatrick ahead of republican lea marquez peterson by eleven points arizona eighth republican debbie lesko won a special election in april and so this is not technically an open seat race anymore a late september poll put lesko ahead of hiral tipirneni by four points jwplayer jwplayer xtkmeukk 8hr1m1dh div setup displaydescription false playlist https

39th florida s 27th and washington s eighth as bad as expected in california s 49thand michigan s eleventh and worse than expected in arizona s second kansas s second and new jersey s eleventh does this mean the gop is out of the woods when it comes to control of the house not at all polling looks rough for gop incumbents such as mike coffman in colorado kevin yoder in kentucky david young in iowa brian fitzpatrick in pennsylvania and barbara comstock in virginia what s more democratic house candidates have vastly outpaced their republican counterparts in fundraising down the stretch of the cycle which is an ominous sign but if democrats do take back the house in a few weeks it will likely be because they knocked off enough vulnerable republican incumbents in swing districts not because they won a bunch of open seat races in red districts get our conservative analysis delivered right to you no charge 2020 national review newsletters 2020 national review
