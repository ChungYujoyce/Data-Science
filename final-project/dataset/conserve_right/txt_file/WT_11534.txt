compromised sensitive data for navy warships submarines and aircraft carriers the extent of which is still being investigated top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 on wednesday the last member of the spy ring rebecca chiu pleaded guilty to being a chinese agent she is the wife of chi mak a chinese born u s defense contractor and the central figure in the ring who was convicted last month of conspiring to supply sensitive but unclassified defense technology to a chinese intelligence agent identified as pu pei liang a court document made public this week revealed that information involved in the case was extremely sensitive it included data on the navy s advance propulsion system called the quiet electric drive to be used on both warships and submarines one intelligence official said the system can make the huge engines sound like a lexus at idle the document stated that if the information reached china it would allow beijing s military to track u s submarines and surface ships the submarine data were described as extremely sensitive information by virtue of his employment as an electrical engineer with power paragon and its work for the united states navy coconspirator chi had access to plans and other classified and sensitive technical information concerning u s navy warships and submarines some of which constituted defense articles the document stated the people s republic of china sought to obtain technical information about united states navy warships and submarines to assist the prc in its own efforts to develop a so called blue water navy other compromised data included information on the navy s ddx next generation destroyer and u s aircraft carrier programs something china is interested in building joel brenner a senior u s counterintelligence coordinator said in a recent speech that chi mak had admitted he had passed information to the chinese since 1983 and that the technologies compromised included the power distribution technology for the aegis cruiser s radar system this compromise is not small potatoes mr brenner said it shortens by years the technological advantage of the u s navy it degrades the navy s deterrent capability in the taiwan strait and it puts the lives of our sons and daughters in the navy at risk from a purely fiscal point of view it also means the chinese are leveraging the american r d budget your tax dollars and mine in support of their own war fighting capability brain warfare the pentagon and the u s intelligence community are studying ways to better understand the how and why of human behavior to help war fighters deal with insurgencies such as those in iraq likely future conflicts and other global problems said national security specialist john stanton mr stanton has written a paper to be presented at a conference in portugal next week on the new research area called evolutionary cognitive neuroscience ecn a subject that captured his interest after he read lt gen david h petraeus revised army counterinsurgency manual the manual identifies the fact that the u s military needs to learn more about brain behavior relationships in networked social environments studies in the area may produce tools that advance humanity s ability to understand and manage itself he stated on the downside mr stanton warned that the ecn research could lead to the creation of neuroweapons that seek to turn the speed of thought into a weapon or programs that blur the line between human and machine among the potential weapons are non traceable neuroweapons with viral genetic payloads that could be used to disrupt the brain and central nervous system the field could help social scientists get information from prisoners of war during interrogation and could find ways to minimize violence and ethnic conflict and prevent or manage warfare pandemics and poverty gates visit defense secretary robert m gates made a stopover in the central asian nation of kyrgyzstan and said the two nations are expanding military and nonmilitary cooperation that is bad news for moscow and beijing which have been quietly working behind the scenes to have the u s military expelled not just from kyrgyzstan but from other locations in central asia china views the u s military presence as threatening strikes on china during any future conflict russia opposes the u s presence because it views central asia s former soviet republics as its sphere of influence the u s operates an air base at manas in kyrgyzstan which has come under criticism after an air force security officer fatally shot a civilian driving a fuel truck at an entry control point after he thought the truck was a vehicle bomb asked about tensions over the base mr gates said i think what is important for the people of kyrgyzstan to understand is that our use of manas is in support of a larger war on terror in which kyrgyzstan is an ally of virtually every other nation on earth we are all working to try and prevent a resurgence of the taliban in afghanistan and our use of manas is one way in which kyrgyzstan can play a very important and constructive role in cooperation with many other nations just not the united states chinese military and security forces were in kyrgyzstan last week as part of a counterterrorism exercise held as part of the shanghai cooperation organization the grouping of central asian states russia and china that beijing is using to expel u s forces from the region senate hold pentagon officials say sen carl levin michigan democrat and chairman of the senate armed services committee has
