president from office as democrats subpoenas fly the republican effort to exact political pain on those pushing the impeachment probe is just getting started we are making hurt from maine to california for these democrats that want to impeach the president said rick gorka a spokesman for the republican national committee and the trump campaign the national party has drawn up a list of more than 60 target races for the house senate and governor where democrats are running in districts or states carried by trump aiming to make impeachment a central theme in those races the effort highlights how impeachment while perilous to the president can be a political boon to the gop whose voters remain largely steadfast in support of trump house speaker nancy pelosi initially resisted efforts to begin impeachment proceedings because of middling public support for trying to remove trump and a belief it could put moderate democrats in a tough spot republicans contend that despite some movement in national surveys toward support for impeachment there are dozens of democrats who have been made more vulnerable by the impeachment inquiry already the rnc has devoted more than 2 million to an ad buy accusing moderate house democrats of voting with the radicals for endless investigations of president trump and it s promising millions more will follow phase one of the counter

campaign communications director in fighting against that the campaign follows the lead of the president and the white house the rnc is also an excellent partner and we all are working well in concert together david bergstein the democratic national committee s director of battleground state communications said democrats want to make sure voters are well informed of trump s record of broken promises ahead of the 2020 election a distraction campaign won t erase trump s record he s spiked health care costs his tax scam will raise taxes on tens of millions of working families in order to
