matchups between the top democrats vying for the 2020 nomination and trump tightening in october four democrats tested in hypothetical head to head contests with trump among registered voters lead by anywhere from six to 10 percentage points now just two of those candidates hold edges ms sparks advises they are joe biden and sen bernie sanders who lead by five and four percentage points respectively the tighter margins against the president come as favorability ratings appear to be sliding for the top democratic contenders ms sparks writes impeach mess merry impeachmas remains the rallying cry of the moment among democrats the phrase tweeted out by washington post reporter rachael bade became a strategic social media hashtag and then there is merry impeach mess the phrase was coined by family research council president tony perkins who says the mess part belongs to the democrats this entire impeachment charade isn t serious and neither are its advocates think about it this is the first modern impeachment without a scrap of bipartisan support not a single republican voted in favor of the articles and worse for house speaker nancy pelosi multiple democrats voted against them mr perkins notes so when supreme court justice neil gorsuch goes on television and wishes people a merry christmas the left isn t upset about december 25th they re upset about every other day of the year that president trump is moving faith and the freedom of religion forward when you get right down to it liberals don t have many options this impeachment is their last ditch effort to preserve the left s secular domination of the culture and they have everything to lose mr perkins explains the border effect the federation for american immigration reform has revealed a potential effect of immigration on the u s house things could change the presence of all immigrants naturalized citizens legal residents and illegal aliens and their u s born minor children will redistribute 26 seats in the house in 2020 to put this number in perspective changing the party of 21 members of the current congress would flip the majority in the u s house the independent research organization says in a new report of the 26 seats that will be lost 24 are from states that voted for donald trump in 2016 of states that will gain house seats because of immigration 19 seats will go to the solidly democratic states of california new york new jersey massachusetts and illinois texas is the only solidly republican state that gains while florida is a swing state elsewhere ohio will have three fewer seats in 2020 michigan and pennsylvania two fewer seats those states predicted to lose one state each alabama arkansas georgia idaho indiana iowa kentucky louisiana minnesota mississippi missouri north carolina oklahoma rhode island south carolina tennessee utah west virginia and wisconsin meanwhile california will gain 11 seats new york and texas four each florida three new jersey two illinois and massachusetts each gain one additional seat the findings are based on the patterns of new arrivals most of the immigrant populations take up residence in a limited number of states if immigrants were evenly spread throughout the country they would have no impact on the distribution of house seats the research said bookmakers trump s gonna win despite officially being impeached
