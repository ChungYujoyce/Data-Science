apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the trump administration is set to pare desk jobs at the top of the intelligence community invoking the argument that its staffs are too large and duplicative knowledgeable sources say one of the first targets is the office of the director of national intelligence odni where richard grenell the u s ambassador to germany and a favorite of president trump arrived as acting director in february mr grenell has brought in kash patel once a close aide to rep devin nunes california republican mr patel principally wrote the 2018 nunes memo that exposed the fbi s reliance on the discredited christopher steele dossier to justify spying on the trump campaign top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the other focus is a dni satellite office the national counterterrorism center nctc it is a post 9 11 creation that analyzes the global terror threat maintains huge databases on suspects and groups and issues public and secret assessments the nctc now has about 1 000 staffers ten years ago it employed about 500 according to a congressional research service report the odni staff totals between 1 700 and 2 000 the odni says the workforce has stayed steady since its birth in 2005 overseeing 60 billion in annual spending setting strategic policy and serving as the president s chief intelligence adviser it ballooned at inception said daniel hoffman a three decade cia clandestine service veteran and a three time station chief abroad i believe that what the current administration is doing is trying to streamline the dni by reducing the number of people who are there and don t need to be there mr hoffman told the washington times that the odni and the nctc are too large and could be culled to free up more officers and analysts the counterterrorism center he said competes and sometimes duplicates what the cia s office does the odni was supposed to get rid of stovepipes so that information could cross paths among 16 agencies such as the cia the national security agency and fbi counterintelligence but he said the odni over time began duplicating tasks done at other headquarters many of us in the senior ranks believe the dni had become bloated said mr hoffman who practiced his spycraft in the middle east and moscow and it s what happens in bureaucracies it s just too many people and too many jobs the dni was designed to coordinate among the different agencies not duplicate the work of the agencies so there was a lot of mission creep mr hoffman said the coin of the realm within the intelligence world is analysts and clandestine officers we don t have an unlimited number of smart people doing the work he said and when you are bringing them to places like the nctc and dni and ask them to duplicate the work that is being done at cia fbi that s a bad allocation of resources the nctc in particular was doing work that was very much duplicative of what cia s counterterrorism center was doing we don t have enough people in the field mr hoffman does not buy trump allies suspicions that the intelligence community is a nest of the resistance created by liberals to sabotage the president we care about doing the mission he said we didn t have time or care to talk about politics when i was at the cia our work was all about doing our job about stealing secrets recruiting spies the idea there is a deep state or resistance angers me to no end but within trump world including the president there is suspicion that intelligence agencies harbor a number of administration enemies they point to the long trump russia conspiracy probe that featured a number of inaccurate news stories such as supposed communication intercepts between the campaign and kremlin that must have come from u s intelligence and president barack obama s two top spies dni director james r clapper and cia director john o brennan in retirement became paid cable tv analysts on cnn and msnbc respectively they repeatedly hurled allegations at mr trump that he was a committed russian asset but never offered proof special counsel robert mueller found no trump russia election conspiracy his report contained no evidence that mr trump served as a russian asset informant or spy the russia collusion attack on trump consisted largely of a corrupt investigation by anti trump elements of the intelligence community along with countless leaks of false information by the same kinds of people said a gop congressional staffer so it s clear there are a large number of resistance activists in the intelligence agencies who are actively sabotaging the administration they re supposed to be serving that s an absolutely intolerable situation for any president there have been two notable personnel moves since mr grenell took control of the odni mr trump on friday notified congress that he had fired michael atkinson the intelligence community inspector general it was mr atkinson who relayed to congress the whistleblower complaint about mr trump s july phone call with ukraine s president the complaint led to democrats voting to impeach mr trump and senate republicans acquitting him the whistleblower resides in the intelligence community last month mr grenell named lora shiao to head thenational counterterrorism center nctc and claire linkins as its next executive director an odni statement said they are well respected career intelligence officials with deep analytic operational and leadership experience serving in the intelligence community ic and are recognized for their focus and commitment to workforce issues including recruitment development retention and morale under their direction nctc is well postured to lead the counterterrorism mission into the future as cia director secretary of state mike pompeo worked to convince the president that the agency could be his friend in making tough policy decisions he brought in top analysts to brief him and recommended current director gina haspel as his replacement ms haspel and mr trump appear to have a good working relationship the agencies have provided excellent intelligence for two of mr trump s biggest decisions
