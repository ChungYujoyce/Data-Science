candidate joseph r biden and his son hunter as democrats clamor for mr bolton s testimony a top house democrat disclosed wednesday that mr bolton privately urged him in the fall to investigate the administration s removal of u s ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch house foreign affairs committee chairman eliot l engel new york democrat said he spoke with mr bolton by phone sept 23 a few weeks after mr bolton either quit or was fired by mr trump on that call ambassador bolton suggested to me unprompted that the committee look into the recall of ambassador marie yovanovitch mr engel said in a statement he strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal as our top diplomat in kyiv ms yovanovitch was removed from her post in april witnesses testified in the impeachment inquiry because the president and his personal lawyer rudolph w giuliani believed she was impeding their efforts to get the ukrainian government to probe corruption and mr biden mr engel said he was raising the matter now because the president said mr bolton never mentioned any problems about the ukraine situation when he left his job president trump is wrong that john bolton didn t say anything about the trump ukraine scandal at the time the president fired him mr engel said he said something to me mr bolton was the third of the president s four national security advisers to leave the administration in three years his 17 month tenure has come back to haunt mr trump the president made a rare admission wednesday that appointing mr bolton in april 2018 was a mistake mr trump tweeted for a guy who couldn t get approved for the ambassador to the u n years ago couldn t get approved for anything since begged me for a non senate approved job which i gave him despite many saying don t do it sir takes the job mistakenly says libyan model on t v and many more mistakes of judgement gets fired because frankly if i listened to him we would be in world war six by now and goes out and immediately writes a nasty untrue book all classified national security as mr engel noted the president also said that mr bolton didn t mention any concerns about ukraine policy when he left his job on unhappy terms why didn t john bolton complain about this nonsense a long time ago when he was very publicly terminated he said not that it matters nothing mr trump tweeted mr bolton was criticized in 2018 for referring to the libyan model as a template for the denuclearization of north korea u s action pressuring libya to denuclearize led to the country s destabilization and the killing of its leader moammar gadhafi a hawk on iran and north korea mr bolton served as u n ambassador under a recess appointment during the administration of president george w bush he left the post with democrats controlling the senate and his confirmation unlikely the white house and its allies noted wednesday that mr bolton gave an interview in august in which he said mr trump had conducted two friendly phone calls with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky they were very warm and cordial calls mr bolton told radio free europe the success of ukraine maintaining its freedom its system of representative government a free market economy free of corruption and dealing with problems of the donbas eastern ukraine and the crimea are high priorities here obviously and high priorities for the united states as well mr engel the house committee chairman said he didn t disclose his private conversation with mr bolton about the ukraine ambassador at the time but he had informed my investigative colleagues he it s one of the reasons that democrats have been pursuing mr bolton s testimony in the impeachment case ambassador bolton has made clear over the last few months that he has more to say on this issue mr engel said and now that the president has called his credibility into question it s important to set the record straight he said it s telling that of all people john bolton is now the target of right wing ire it underscores just how important it is that the senate subpoena ambassador bolton as a witness the nsc letter indicates that mr bolton s lawyer spoke by phone to nsc officials about his book manuscript on jan 22 ms knight reminded mr cooper that mr bolton had signed a nondisclosure agreement as a condition for gaining access to classified information
