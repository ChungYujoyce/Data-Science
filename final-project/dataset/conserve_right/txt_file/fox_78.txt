inglesby director of the johns hopkins center for health security then gov kevin stitt r oklahoma personal care businesses can reopen for appointments only wallace oklahoma among the first states to

coronavirus we aposll ask our sunday panel about the new test of american resolve and our power player of the week a broadway legend aposs quest to spread joy and hope after his own battle with the coronavirus all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington the u s death toll from the coronavirus now tops 53 000 in just two months that aposs close to the number of all the americans killed in the vietnam war over 19 years now some states like georgia and oklahoma are starting to reopen businesses despite warnings from public health officials that relaxing restrictions too soon could lead to more cases and more deaths but the economic pain is severe with unemployment numbers in this country not seen since the great depression in a moment we aposll speak with the secretary of the treasury steven mnuchin but first let aposs bring in mark meredith with the latest on the debate over when and how to reopen mark mark meredith fox news correspondent chris some governors are easing health restrictions to allow certain businesses to reopen now while others are holding off just a little bit longer and begging people to stay home begin videotape keisha lance bottoms d atlanta mayor what i would say is simply just stay home meredith atlanta aposs mayor is furious georgia governor brian kemp is allowing gyms bowling alleys and barbershops to reopen unidentified female i own a salon in savannah georgia and i am not at all happy with the situation in which we found ourselves meredith health experts fear reopening too soon could lead to more cases and an increased death toll but some americans tell us they aposre not worried unidentified male i would without hesitation visit businesses that are opening in my state and i live in east texas it opens up meredith in oklahoma some businesses began reopening this weekend next friday the state will allow gyms theaters and restaurants to reopen if social distancing is kept

home and staying safe meredith the white house has 5 million people have been tested for the virus so far officials warn as testing increases the number of confirmed cases in the u s will go up mike pence vice president of the united states people should not be discouraged by those numbers we are looking at very positive trends in hospitalization in emergency room entrances meredith but some experts say the availability of testing remains an issue dr carlos del rio emory infectious disease physician we still are not where we need to be interesting meredith forcing governors to make decisions without the data they may need end videotape meredith the president also appears to be cutting back on the daily white house briefings that we aposve come to expect there was only a short one held on friday where the president did not take questions we didn apost have a briefing on saturday we aposll wait to see if we have one later on today chris wallace mark meredith reporting from the white house mark thank you chris wallace fox news sunday anchor and joining us now treasury secretary steven mnuchin who aposs a member of the president aposs coronavirus task force mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday steven mnuchin united states secretary of the treasury thank you chris it aposs good to be back with you wallace president trump says that once the country reopens that we aposre going to see a sharp quick recovery here he is this week begin clip donald trump president of the united states we aposre going to rebuild it and we aposre going to rebuild it better and it aposs going to go faster than people think i built it once i aposll built ph it a second time end clip wallace how sharp a recovery do you see and how soon sir mnuchin well chris i think as we begin to reopen the economy in may and june you aposre going to see the economy really bounce back in july august september and we are putting in a unprecedented amount of fiscal relief into the economy you aposre seeing trillions of dollars that aposs making its way into the economy and i think this is going to have a significant impact wallace but that quick bounce back that you talk about goes against the forecast of most experts take a look at these numbers sir the nonpartisan congressional budget office now projects gdp will shrink by 5 6 percent total this year unemployment will end 2020 they project close to 12 percent and your former company goldman sachs says the global hit will be four times worse than the 2008 great recession question are all those independent experts wrong mnuchin well chris we aposve never seen anything like this this is not the financial crisis this is a scenario where we aposve closed the economy and we aposre going to open the economy so all these models are based upon health assumptions how quickly we reopen so we aposll see my own opinion is again we have unprecedented amount of liquidity in the system we aposre very sympathetic to all the people that are out of work but there is enhanced unemployment there aposs the ppp there aposs direct deposits this is going to put ph a lot of liquidity and as businesses begin to open you aposre going to see demand side of the economy rebound wallace let aposs talk about the ppp the president just signed a bill that congress had passed another 310 billion for the paycheck protection program but the first round i think it was 250 300 billion the sign up for that ran out in 13 days how long do you think this next tranche of 310 billion is going to last and can you guarantee that big corporations for instance like ruth aposs chris that got money the first time around eventually pay it back but did get money won apost even get money this time mnuchin chris i just want to put this in perspective and i want to thank everybody at the sba and the treasury because we launched a brand new program and in an incredibly short period of time and the fact that we ran out of money just goes to show the success of this now let me put this in perspective in the first round over a million companies had workers of 10 people or below and there has been a lot of focus on these bigger companies public companies we came out with new guidelines we made it clear they shouldn apost have applied they aposre paying back the money so i think you aposre going to see this move in the right direction and i think you aposre going to also see in this round the average loan size go down significantly wallace but to my other question which was that the money for the first program lasted less than two weeks how long do you expect this money to last mnuchin chris to me it aposs not a matter of how long it lasts the actually i think the sooner the money is dispersed the better so the first round impacted about 30 million workers i think this round will be about the same that will be close to 50 percent of the private workforce so i actually hope we run out of money quickly so we can get the money into the workers apos pockets and again in this round we aposre making it clear that small businesses have access we aposve signed up a lot of cdfis we aposre signing up more of them so we aposre going to make sure that this is distributed fairly wallace congress is already talking with all the money that aposs already been dispersed it aposs talking about yet another relief bill and one of the big issues there is whether or not to give 500 billion in relief to state and local governments so that they can continue to pay first responders and other workers and to provide services this week senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and new york governor andrew cuomo split sharply about that take a look sir begin clip mitch mcconnell r ky senate majority leader i would certainly be in favor of allowing states to use the bankruptcy route it saves some cities governor andrew cuomo d ny he says maybe the states should declare bankruptcy ok this is one of the really dumb ideas of all time end clip wallace does the president support giving aid hundreds of billion ph dollars to the states and what would the economic effect be if major states like new york and illinois were to declare bankruptcy mnuchin chris i first want to just say i really want to thank the senate and the house for the unprecedented and bipartisan support the bill first passed 96 to o ph and this one was unanimous consent in the senate so my comment on this is this will be something that both the senate and the house debate it will be something that we discuss on a bipartisan basis the president has heard from governors he wants to speak to governors this is something we aposll consider but our focus right now is really on execution and that aposs what we aposre focused on and if we need more money as i aposve said this is a war we aposll win this war if we need to spend more money we will and we aposll only do it with bipartisan support wallace all right let me pick up on that last point because with all of the money that aposs already gone out the national debt will by the end of this year exceed the gross domestic product the total output of the economy it will be over 100 percent of gdp which has always been considered a kind of redline for stable economies how much do you worry about a debt in excess of 100 percent of gdp mnuchin well chris the good news is that interest rates are extremely low so if you look at the portion of the budget that we aposre actually allocating to interest it aposs extremely low and we aposre locking in long term rates to make sure this additional money we aposve locked up for a long period of time overtime that is something we aposre going to need to look at and we aposre going to need to look at overtime how we deal with that issue but right now we aposre in a war and we have to protect american workers and american business and we aposre going to do whatever we need to take to do that wallace in the time we have left i aposd like to do a lightening round i aposve done these with you before quick questions quick answers we see states starting to reopen if they reopen too quickly if we see a spike in cases a second spike how damaging would that be to the economy mnuchin i think we have to balance this in this time with the advent of testing more testing the advent of antibody testing i think we aposre going to be able to monitor this very very carefully wallace will the administration bail out oil companies because as you well know there are some critics who say that yes there are problems that came from the coronavirus and the global drop ph but that a lot of problems of oil companies were of their own making before we ever got into this pandemic mnuchin chris let me be very clear the president has said no bail outs to any companies whether that was airlines or oil companies we will consider again loans to companies in a proper scenario with ph strategic importance but no bail outs no shareholder bail outs wallace and would you consider loans to oil companies mnuchin that we would and we aposre looking at it carefully the secretary of energy and i are studying it and we aposre looking at it very carefully wallace finally some top republicans are talking about going after china to punish them for their failure to be much more transparent at the very start of this pandemic and in fact the attorney general of missouri has already sued china how do you balance on the one hand wanting to hold china accountable to hold them responsible but on the other hand we aposre in the middle of a pandemic we aposre in the middle of a global economic crisis wanting to protect global markets especially global trade mnuchin well for the moment we need to work globally to conquer this virus but the president aposs made very clear he wants to understand what china knew when they knew it and if they knew things that they didn apost turn over that could have stopped this he will hold them accountable wallace so at this point can you see sanctions strong economic action against china mnuchin chris i think you know we never make comments on future sanctions options wallace we aposre going to leave it there secretary mnuchin thank you thanks for your time this week and it aposs always a pleasure to talk with you sir mnuchin thanks great to be back with you chris wallace coming up what factors do states face choosing to relax restrictions early while also trying to keep residents safe we aposll talk with a top public health official that aposs next commercial break wallace as policymakers debate when and how to reopen state economies public health officials continue to warn about the danger of moving too fast joining us now from baltimore dr tom inglesby director of the center for health security at johns hopkins university doctor good to be with you again dr tom inglesby johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health good morning chris wallace where are we with the virus have we reached the peak are we on the downslope of the virus and now that we see the number of deaths over 53 000 almost 54 000 this morning can you give us a sense of the range of how many deaths we may see from this virus overall depending on how careful we are in the in the reopening inglesby yes i would say that we are you know for lack of better words maybe near the end of the beginning of this pandemic in this country we have reached a plateau nationally at this point i mean trends can change over time but at this point we have a plateau in new cases per day unfortunately it aposs a very high plateau we still are seeing about 30 000 new cases of covid 19 every day in the united states and still are seeing something on the order of 2 000 deaths per day so we are not through out of the woods by any means in terms of this pandemic but at least we have reached a kind of a stable number of new infections and the number of people who are dying from this illness wallace if you inglesby and one last point on that wallace and you know crosstalk wallace let me just say at one point we were talking about models 1 million people then it was 100 000 people then it was 60 000 now we aposre already up to 53 000 so give me a sense of the number i understand these are these are predictions but the number of fatalities we might see from this inglesby so i think modelers are pretty reluctant to model way beyond a month or two out from now because of so many variables if we change our social distancing policies and depending on how well states get prepared for the easing into the reopening that could change outcomes quite a bit but the leading models at the moment protect anywhere from 58 000 deaths to 110 000 deaths in the next month in the united states i think no one is really modeling beyond that and really it aposs going to depend on many things that are difficult to wrap up into a single number wallace all right let me ask you one more question trying to foresee the future vice president pence gave a timeline this week for when we aposre going to come out of this here he is begin video clip vice president mike pence if you look at the trends today that i think by memorial day weekend we will largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us end video clip wallace memorial day weekend doctor is that realistic inglesby well at this point if you go state by state you see that about half of the country in half of the country the numbers are still rising day to day and about another third of the country there seems to be a leveling off and only a minority in a minority of the country the numbers are actually coming down day by day and so i i don apost think it aposs likely that we will be at that position by memorial day but even more importantly wherever we are in the epidemic this virus is going to be with us until we have a vaccine so as we ease up on social distancing measures and economies begin to very carefully reopen we are at risk of recurrence or re spikes in the illness in the epidemic so i think everyone needs to be aware that even as we aposre beginning to open up again there is a a clear chance of a rise in cases in states that are doing that wallace let let aposs talk about that because a number of states as you know are beginning to reopen spas salons gyms even restaurants is that safe for people you know you talk about a spot where people are giving massages a salon where people are filing people aposs nails are cutting their hair is that safe for people to be that close at this point if they aposre wearing masks and gloves inglesby i don apost think it aposs going to be possible for anyone to say something is safe you know completely safe at this point because the virus is very transmissible between people and because some people don apost have symptoms at least either in the beginning of the illness or maybe even at all during their illness but we can say some things are safer than others and businesses that have small numbers of people are probably safer than businesses that have very large numbers of people and the closeness of the interaction that also is a factor so if people are going to be closely interacting they should be using personal protective equipment if that aposs available in their state and outdoors will be safer than indoors so there is a range of different there are going to be a range of different risks that businesses face and it aposs important for all businesses now to be trying to understand their risks and making plans for how to diminish the risks as best they can within their own business and their own operations wallace let let me ask you a quick direct question would you feel safe at this point getting a haircut getting a massage if you and the person doing it were both wearing gloves and masks inglesby i think at this point in most places in the country with the rate of illness as it is i i don apost think so there may be some places where community community transmission is so low and testing is so good that we have confidence that the risk is low but i aposd say i would be cautious about doing that at this point wallace you talk about testing i know one of the problems you have with the white house guidelines is that you think they failed to address the issues of testing and contact tracing here is president trump on that this week begin video clip president donald j trump we aposre doing very well on testing we aposve tested far more than anybody else anywhere in the world inaudible go ahead question do you agree with dr fauci that we aposre just not there yet trump no i don apost agree with him on that no i think we aposre doing a great job on testing end video clip wallace we aposre averaging averaging about 150 000 tests a day isn apost that enough inglesby no it aposs not enough and the reason why is because we aposre not testing a lot of the mild and moderate illness that isn apost people who aren apost sick enough to be in the hospital and so all those people are not getting counted and they aren apost necessarily having their contacts traced or told to isolate in their own homes so we aposre missing a lot of the illness in the country until we get that under control we aposre going to continue to have lines of transmission that we can apost see and beyond that many businesses are now really beginning to think about how diagnostics might factor into their reopening plans and we just don apost have diagnostic testing available on large scale for businesses we aposre still focused on diagnosing the sickest people those in nursing homes health care workers which is completely appropriate but they aposre a small fraction of the number of people that we aposre going to need to test to really find all the illness and to get the economy moving in the right direction again wallace i want to squeeze two more questions in here in the time we have left doctor i want to ask you about another white house guideline and that is a steady decline in the number of new cases over the course of two weeks i want to put some stats on the screen oklahoma is coming down from its peak but had a 26 percent increase in new cases in the last week and it went over the course of the last week the numbers jumped from a low of 29 new cases last sunday to over 100 new cases just this past thursday and friday should a state with those kinds of numbers be reopening now inglesby you know i would be very cautious about doing that i think we aposve seen there aposs an example in the papers this morning about a state in japan that reopened quickly in march after a few weeks of low ish numbers and three weeks later rebounded to the point where they have to now close their economy down again so i think it aposs going to be important to really go slowly for those states who do reopen i think it should be done very carefully with a lot of monitoring of both hospitalization rate icu rate death rates so at this point only about five states in the country to my count have had two weeks of decline so only about two weeks in the two states or five states rather in the country have met the gating criteria laid out by the white house wallace i aposve got about a minute left for one final question as you know president trump inglesby yeah wallace has come under fire over the last week or so first for advocating the use of hydroxychloroquine and then later this week this week for talking about the possibility speculating about the possibility of injecting disinfectant here he is on that begin video clip trump i see the disinfectant knocks it out in a minute one minute and is there a way we can do something like that by injection inside or or almost a cleaning end video clip wallace i know you want to stay away from politics and i think it aposs clear that any kind of ingestion of a disinfectant is dangerous but two quick questions one where are you at this point about the use of hydroxychloroquine and two how do we sort through all of the conflicting advice that we get inglesby well to your first question i think the there needs to be more study of hydroxychloroquine two studies that have come out so far have suggested it is possibly more harmful than helpful and possibly dangerous so i don apost think anyone should be taking hydroxychloroquine unless they are in a randomized controlled trial that aposs being carefully studied and the second point is that i think the the most important thing now in terms of medicines and vaccines is to follow where medical leaders and scientific leaders guide us they are doing the studies these studies take time these medicines can actually hurt people so there is a harm that could potentially wallace right inglesby happen if people take medicines that aren apost studied so it aposs important to follow scientists wallace dr inglesby thank you thanks for joining us again and giving us your expert analysis please come back inglesby thanks so much wallace up next as we said several governors are starting to lift some restrictions we aposll talk with oklahoma governor kevin stitt who has started to reopen his state that aposs next commercial break chris wallace fox news host coming up some states move to reopen in phases under certain conditions begin video clip gov kevin stitt r ok our plan to open up and recover safely includes a significant focus on testing and tracing end video clip wallace we aposll ask oklahoma governor kevin stitt about pushback from mayors and health officials in his state next commercial break wallace oklahoma is one of the states trying to get back to business despite concerns reopening too soon could lead to a new surge of coronavirus cases governor kevin stitt joins us now from oklahoma city governor why did you decide to start reopening your state gov kevin stitt r ok well thanks for having me on chris you have to go back and think about why we closed down in the first place you know i aposve issued 15 executive orders since march 15th when i first declared the state of emergency but it was but to build capacity in our hospitals to make sure we didn apost over run our health care system it was to build supply for ppe and it was to flatten the curve the facts in our state are march 30th we had we peaked at hospitalizations with 560 across the state today we have 300 across the state in our hospitals and so we think it aposs time for a measured reopening but i aposve been very clear with oklahomans that coronavirus is still in the united states and it aposs still in oklahoma so we have to continue with the social distancing but we will start taking some measured reopening in a phased measured approach wallace but governor here is the head of your state your state medical association dr george monks let aposs put up his comments on the screen even without widespread testing oklahoma has seen an ongoing growth in the number of cases hospitalizations and deaths in the past week alone he points out the white house guidelines call for a two week downward trajectory in cases and says we are far from this point governor that is the head of your state medical association stitt well i i don apost know exactly who that is but the department of health head in our state is gary cox and we have followed all of the white house guidelines there were four gates that we aposve met and the facts are we have been on a steady decline since march 30th in hospitalizations and we have 300 across our state and that aposs when we decided to have a measured reopening we aposre always going to be data driven in oklahoma we aposre watching it we i have put up 80 different mobile test sites across the state we currently ranked 25th in the nation in number of testing and it is time for a measured reopening but i also told oklahomans that we aposll be data driven we aposll continue to watch the trends and if the percentage of tests start increasing or hospitalizations start increasing that we aposll kick back one of those phases and we can obviously reserve the rights to back up if we need to but we believe it aposs the time to have a measured reopening wallace well in fact the reopening started two days ago when under your order spas and nail salons and barbershops could reopen do you have any sense of how many in fact did reopen on friday stitt well you aposve got to realize that and i gave that you know certain communities could start with a phase one yesterday on the 24th or two days ago on the 24th by appointment only these are barbershops these are folks like in midwest city that have been in business for 50 years and next friday on may 1st is when where going to have a limited reopening for churches if they if they follow social distancing and have every other pew some in restaurant dining we aposre going to spread the tables out six feet apart mask up do temperature testing so we have a list of guidance for those restaurants that want to start opening and again we aposre going to be data driven but i aposm i aposm we will not make decisions in oklahoma what we aposre seeing on television or what we aposre seeing happening in other states and the facts are we aposve gone from 560 hospitalized people on march 30th today we have 300 across the state we built capacity we now have 4 600 hospital beds for covid related patients wallace right stitt and that was the whole objective when we got here on march 15th and we started this executive orders was to build capacity in our hospitals because we understand that covid is still here we aposre people are still going to get it but oklahomans are safe and and and we aposre ready for a measured reopening wallace well i want to ask you about about the measured reopening there aposs nobody who wants to reopen a country more than president trump but he said this week that he aposs concerned about some of these places that that do up close personal services like spas like salons like barbershops that it may just be too close here he is here aposs the president begin video clip donald trump president of the united states i love those people that use all of those things the spas and the beauty parlors and barbershops tattoo parlors i love them but they can wait a little bit longer just a little bit not much because safety has to predominate end video clip wallace governor is president trump wrong stitt of course of course safety is number one and the two guiding principles that i told oklahomans we aposre going to use to through this whole process was the health and safety of oklahomans number one and then mitigate the loss to our economy and get our workers back working as quickly as possible we aposre data driven i can apost speak to what aposs happening in other states but in my state we aposre seeing the trending go down our testing is going up our tracing we put 80 000 80 different testing sites up we aposve tested over 55 000 folks our positive tests right now are 6 3 percent and again 300 hospitalized cases across the state with a capacity for 4 600 we think it aposs a it aposs a reasonable time to reopen wallace right stitt and you could always play monday morning quarterback and say hey let aposs wait until we have 100 folks in the hospital in oklahoma or 50 or zero but i just don apost think that aposs practical so we aposve done what we set out to do on march 15th wallace governor stitt yes sir wallace yes well let me just ask you one last question because we aposre running out of time localities under oklahoma rules can ignore your order and keep their stay at home directives but the mayors of a number of the big cities say reluctantly they are going to reopen because they say since you aposve opened up the state they if if the town next door has reopened and they can apost protect their their residence anyway here is the mayor of norman oklahoma begin video clip mayor breea clark d norman oklahoma we don apost have that testing capacity right now and so it aposs very very dangerous to open without it we need to get to a position where we are proactive not just reactive and then opening businesses where it aposs sustained close personal contact is very dangerous end video clip wallace mayor i mean governor i aposve got about a minute left mayors say that you aposre pitting cities against each other in fact one of them called it oklahoma aposs version of the hunger games stitt well you know i aposve got a great relationship with the mayors across the state and these are tough decisions and i know they aposre concerned about their citizens as well i aposm putting guidance for the whole state because as you know but i aposve never been heavy handed with the mayors in different locations i aposve let them make decisions based on their communities but i aposm thinking about all 4 million oklahomans i aposm giving guidance if a restaurant doesn apost feel like they aposre ready to reopen they don apost have to wallace right stitt if you don apost feel like it aposs time to go by appointment only to a barbershop you don apost have to but we think it aposs a it aposs time and we can always back up or we can extend these phases wallace governor stitt thank you thank you for taking time out on this very busy weekend to talk with us stitt thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss some of america aposs adversaries taking provocative actions in the midst of this global pandemic commercial break begin video clip unidentified male you aposre the president and people tuning into these briefings they want to get information and guidance and want to know what to do they aposre not looking for rumors donald trump president of the united states hey look look i aposm the president and you aposre fake news end video clip wallace president trump igniting a storm of controversy this week when he suggested the coronavirus might be vulnerable to injections of disinfectant and it aposs time now for our sunday group cofounder of the federalist ben domenech katie pavlich editor of townhall com and mo elleithee of georgetown university aposs institute of politics and public service ben there are reports this weekend that president trump is going to cut back on the number of white house briefings and cut back on his appearances at them do you think that aposs smart do you think these briefings have begun to backfire politically on the president ben domenech co founder the federalist i think that it does make sense to cut back a little bit on these briefings as much as we do get some information out of them and many times we aposve seen them just go off the rails and back and forth in battles between the president and those in the press but i think that what we really need at this moment is seriousness and we need more seriousness from these briefings just given your interview with oklahoma aposs governor right now i think that a lot of people are still operating under some false premises about the kind of challenges that we aposre facing the idea that we aposre going to ramp up mass testing that we aposre going to have it in a conference of level very shortly the idea that a vaccine is going to come within the next few months as opposed to 12 to 18 or even more and that something that i think we need to start wrestling with not just at the gubernatorial level but at the presidential level as well giving some of this tough talk to the american people about the trade offs and the risks we aposre going to face wallace let me pick up on that with you mo do you think there aposs too much happy talk coming out about where we are as a country and how long the virus is going to be with us mo elleithee fox news contributor well i think it depends who we aposre talking to and we aposve seen that time and time again we aposve even seen that in these white house briefings where if you listen to the medical experts they you aposre not getting a lot of happy talk from them you aposre getting a lot of sobering talk from them whereas you here the political leaders when they aposre at the podium and they aposre trying to to be a little bit more aspirational i think in best case scenarios look i think the briefings have gone off the rails and i think which is too bad because we do need them we do need to hear from our leaders we need to hear from our public health professionals i hope that the white house continue the briefings but maybe puts more of the spotlight on dr fauci on dr birx on the public health professionals bring in relevant policymakers when they aposre translating the public health situation into what we aposre doing and maybe a little bit less of the self congratulatory tone that we aposve seen help derail some of these things in the past wallace katie then there aposs the question of how fast to reopen the country which has become one of the big questions and a lot of people i think it aposs fairly to say were surprised this week because the president has really talked up reopening the country the cure can apost be worse than the than the illness but when it came to brain kemp the governor of georgia who reopened on friday a number of things particularly personal care businesses the president took him to task katie pavlich fox news contributor right which i think proves that this is not just political for president trump he aposs listening to people who are around him on the white house coronavirus task force who are talking about the health implications of this but it aposs not that the president is just berating governor brian kemp for for no reason i mean the white house did put out a series of phases that they believe that states and local governments should take to meet the criteria of making sure that the cure is not worse than the disease and on the topic of the briefings and whether we continue to go forward with them and the federal government aposs response you know we are in another phase here now with the economic fallout of what is going on and states and local governments this has really move to their arena and they are the ones who are going to have to make decisions for their localities moving forward unemployment is a major problem for state governments around the country they had to deal with that and they aposre also hospital consequences and consequences for long term instability in terms of mental health addiction for these local jurisdictions that they are weighing as a risk to opening up the economy as this virus continues wallace i want to switch subjects on all of you now because there has been a growing sense that other foreign countries adversaries are taking advantage of the of the pandemic to try to probe for u s weaknesses after iranian gunboats got pretty close to some u s navy ships in the persian gulf this week president trump issued this order begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we aposre not going to stand for it so if they do that that aposs putting our ships in danger and our great crews and sailors in danger i aposm not going to let that happen and they will they aposll shoot them out of the water end video clip wallace ben u s officials called iran aposs actions with these gun boats dangerous and provocative domenech well i think we aposre going to continue to see a lot of america aposs enemies around the world engage in this kind of dangerous and provocative action as they test basically american resolve in the midst of a number of different distractions not just the pandemic but the economic lockdown as well i think one area in particular to keep an eye on is the behavior of china in the past couple of weeks as it relates to hong kong they have locked up a number of human rights demonstrators people who were engaged last fall in all types of protests against the government in beijing we aposre going to continue to see regimes around the world behave in ways that they know that they can maybe get away with when america is distracted wallace yes i want to pick up on china with you katie because secretary of state pompeo took off he aposs he aposs been on a campaign of trying to call china to account but this week he talked about china aposs bullying which includes not only what aposs going on in hong kong also pressure they aposre putting on taiwan and also seeming to expand their authority and control over the south china sea what do we do about china katie pavlich well china is very clearly taking an advantage of a situation that they unleashed on the world whether it aposs geopolitically economically or militarily they aposve been hoarding personal protective equipment they aposre being aggressive in the south china sea and geopolitically they are quote joe nating ph personal protective equipment that is faulty to a number of european countries that is then in return had to be returned because it does not work properly the way that you deal with china i aposve talked to a couple of senators actually this week on background they have said that they do have legislation in the works to bring back manufacturing of pharmaceuticals and incentivizing big companies to bring their businesses back from china and some types of deregulation so that it aposs easier for american companies to function and produce in america than it is to function in china china is not sorry about what they have done and they are taking every advantage of the current situation to advance their goals long term wallace and i aposve got about 45 seconds left mo the same question i asked secretary mnuchin how do you balance on the one hand holding china to account with on the other hand we aposre in the middle of a global economic crisis might not be the best time to being involved with sanctions or trade wars with china elleithee no i think this does show a little bit of the weakness of the administration aposs approach to china up till now focusing all in on the trade battles but not really having a holistic response on national security this is a time when we do need to hold them accountable but we do need their help we need to work together and we aposre just not equipped to do that right now wallace thank you panel i threw
