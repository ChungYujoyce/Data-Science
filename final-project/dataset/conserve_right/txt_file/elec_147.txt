choice between diabetes and terminal cancer an awful affliction versus a fatal one but at times like this it is useful to remember that many things are beyond the control of the person occupying the oval office some of which are welcome the chief source of alarm today is that one of these two will have many opportunities to interfere with our lives liberty and pursuit of happiness but in many ways citizens are gaining control rather than losing it on election day voters in four states will decide on medical use of marijuana better yet five including california will decide whether to allow um nonmedical use four states and the district of columbia have already legalized recreational cannabis the trend is in keeping with a public that has decided adults should be free to decide for themselves whether to use pot to treat pain or illness or to get high a gallup poll last year found that 58 percent of americans support full legalization up from 36 percent a decade ago none of this affects the federal ban which will remain in place but both hillary clinton and donald trump have indicated they would let states do as they please their acceptance of change is also on display with regard to same sex marriage the supreme court granted it constitutional protection in 2015 but supreme court rulings sometimes inflame rather than quell controversy not this time at the beginning of barack obama s presidency just 40 percent of americans supported same sex marriage obama not among them today 61 percent do the next president will have to contend with a public that is weary of fighting costly wars that don t directly advance our national security clinton whose record has been biased toward military action got surprisingly little attention a few weeks ago when she steered conspicuously the other way we are not putting ground troops into iraq ever again and we re not putting ground troops into syria she declared we re going to defeat isis without committing american ground troops during the debate trump faulted her for making public her plan to fight the islamic state but not for rejecting the use of ground forces though vague on his own plan he stresses his fictitious claim that he opposed the iraq war before it began and he says i am going to have very few troops on the ground fiscal realities will the limit the ambitions of the next president the profligacy of the past mandates frugality in the future it will not be easy to find money for the new ventures the candidates have in mind by 2022 nearly every dollar of revenue the u s collects will have been committed before congress even takes a vote according to an analysis by eugene steuerle of the urban institute the wall street journal reported with more and more federal spending on autopilot there is almost no discretion or flexibility to act to address new challenges without having to renege on past promises to the public says mr steuerle a treasury official in the reagan administration the swollen federal debt will discourage extravagance trump s fiscal plan which the bipartisan committee for a responsible federal budget says would add more than 5 trillion to the debt would have trouble getting through congress clinton plans to pay for almost all her new spending with tax increases which might also be dead on arrival at capitol hill a 2013 poll found that only 20 percent of americans favor a combination of more government services and higher taxes the space for personal freedom has expanded in some significant realms all but two states now have legal gambling ride hailing services like uber and lyft enable urbanites to move about more conveniently and less expensively life is getting better in ways that even a terrible president is not likely to ruin infant mortality has fallen violent crime is only half as common as it was in the early 1990s and teens are less likely to drink alcohol use other drugs and get pregnant if the wrong candidate wins a lot of americans will yearn for an option that is not on the ballot sweet meteor of death 2016 which would end our misery by wiping out the human race but even with trump or clinton in the white house there will still be reasons to go on living copyright 2016 by creators syndicate inc next california passes law that could make getting any autographed book or art in the state very difficult updated

presidency can be handed to its rightful heir rand paul don t worry we ll be fine i promise pay attention to meee the troll explained anybody can earn 450 daily you can earn from 9000 14000 a month or even more if you work as a full time job it s easy just follow instructions on this page read it carefully from start to finish it s a flexible job but a good eaning opportunity go to this site home tab for more detail http tinyurl com h3mergo yay we ll get to smoke pot but we ll be disarmed not exactly the old school definition of free men oh and that shit about the deficit constraing spending nice one you must already be high to think that ll happen that s some tasty soma someone will be disarmed perhaps but i predict a lot of new criminals if the second amendment gets crushed it s funny how perspective works i can imagine this world compared to what it could be if people were more economically and socially free and it s depressing hell the status quo minus the drug war and the mic would be a huge level up and even for the brave little socialists out there when your big problem s the fact that the us isn t exactly like your favorite euro nation then truly that s a first world white person problem it would be nice to see the drug war end in my lifetime it would be nice to see the idea of 15 50 tax brackets rejected as an unnecessary crime against humanity i have some hope for the former it is incredible how much economic progress is still being made despite not because of like hillary thinks government intervention maybe i m weird i would 100 vote for a measure authorizing recreational use of marijuana though i don t use it myself but the whole medical marijuana panacea thing is so outrageous that i m not inclined to vote for it i agree with you on that which probably does make us weird in this crowd the swollen federal debt will discourage extravagance citation needed by 2022 nearly every dollar of revenue the u s collects will have been committed before congress even takes a vote so we can safely abolish congress saving lots of money in salaries and pensions drop in the ocean journey of a thousand miles the election as a choice between diabetes and terminal cancer an awful affliction versus a fatal one sorry reason but as bad as trump is hillary is still terminal cancer there s more to life than who is sitting in the oval office unpossible tony says this is the most importantest election ever and the fate of the world literally hangs in the balance and tony would never lie or be stupidly wrong right thanks rich i d forgotten how much i like the little icelandic elf cranks up the sugar cubes oh my lord johnson is a fucking moron talk about reinforcing narratives chris matthews didn t acquit himself well either apparently thinking canada and mexico are continents well how many foreign leaders would be good libertarians given the general trend of politics quick name one you really admire i can name several leaders but i m not sure i want to attach my name to them you d probably get a flippant sarcastic answer from me at best i must be the drugs really and as time has passed he has confirmed my initial suspicions that he doesnt take the process seriosuly have you seen he tv spot with weld vote for us because c monnnnn i am not the un secretary general but along with him i can at least name several and a very easy low hanging fruit answer would be bibi because if nothing else he is fiercely defensive of his country s national interests any one of the continents any country name one foreign leader that your respect and look up to anybody host chris matthews pushed during the event the correct answer that i respect and look up to none also johnson is a fucking moron but i d rather have a fucking moron as president who at least somewhat understands the concept of personal freedom and liberty than a fucking moron who thinks that my business is somehow any of there s it was a bit of journalistic trickery since either he a indicates respect for a world leader who will invariably be a shitbag looking like a tool b list some leaders and say they suck thus creating a narrative of being undiplomatic or c be diplomatic and say nothing thus creating the narrative that he can t list a world leader about the only way to come out ahead would be to turn it around openly acknowledge that you see the trick then ask matthews which world leaders he likes and make it multiple choice so you can show you do know them speaking of fucking morons imagining chris matthews could be seen as acquitting himself well pretty much ever please note my insult is aimed at chris matthews in case that s not crystal clear the chief source of alarm today is that one of these two will have many opportunities to interfere with our lives liberty and pursuit of happiness it s not a fear that they ll have many it s a fear that they ll have unlimited opportunities sometimes i m hopeful this will be just another election we ll have an opportunity to undo in four years other times i fear this may be the last election the republic ever sees and then sometimes i despair that 2012 was already the last gasp when hillary is declared the winner and the vote fraud is so plain that it can t be ignored and trump refuses to accept the rigged results and he s backed by the mob who is going to have any sort of moral authority to declare what the outcome shall be you ve got comey on capitol hill telling congress to eat shit and congress is eating shit because they can t even pass a simple resolution to make him stop telling them to eat shit does anybody think either comey or congress is speaking with any sort of authority which must be respected they re useless the whole lot of them so s who s running the circus whoever s got the balls to step up and say they re the boss and the muscle to make it stick which is how a dictator runs a banana republic not how a people run a real republic but even with trump or clinton in the white house there will still be reasons to go on living i ll stick with gary johnson even though you didn t mention him it s optimism that the federal budget apparatus is so huge and bloated and so much of the rule of law we live under has been handed over to the bureaucracy that the president is so restricted that they can be terrible candidates and it s not a problem libertarian moment pathetic life will go on but when 60 of it is taxed debased and regulated and it is on the down stroke to slavery one has to ask if it s worth it but there ll be weed so again pathetic we re at this critical stage in our history and we get this from reason life will go on but coming here won t be a part of it but both hillary clinton and donald trump have indicated they would let states do as they please it doesn t matter what they do what matters is what will attorney general chris christie or whatever statist fuckstick hillary appoints do i m still working on the assumption that that was the deal that got christie to drop out of the race and endorse trump just imagine attorney general chris christie and secretary of homeland security rudy giuliani vomit we are not putting ground troops into iraq ever again and we re not putting ground troops into syria she declared we re going to defeat isis without committing american ground troops i ll try and pretend to be shocked when president clinton orders the deployment of 10 000 troops to iraq syria to fight isis and while they re at it topple assad fiscal realities will the limit the ambitions of the next president the profligacy of the past mandates frugality in the future it will not be easy to find money for the new ventures the candidates have in mind oh i get it now this is a comedy piece i thought maybe it was supposed to be serious until i got to this line that one had me rotflmao trump or clinton in the white house there will still be reasons to go on living trump win any crazy schemes will be definitely challenged by democrats in congress and possibly challenged by repubs clinton win all her crazy schemes will not be challenged by democrats in congress and probably will not be challenged by repubs how few reasons we will have to go on living if hitlary wins re beyond the presidency reasons to go on living there s more to life than who is sitting in the oval office the main reason to keep on living whether it is laurel or hardy gets into office is to watch the comedy routine one of them is going to perform on election day voters in five states including california will decide whether to allow nonmedical use of marijuana yeah that s a law to vote for but we re also going to asked whether we want to ban fucking grocery bags really nice post thanks for sharing with us start working at
