including the associated press petitioned a judge to release search warrants related to the fbi raid of cohen s office and hotel room last year it was amid that litigation and at the behest of a federal judge that prosecutors revealed in a court filing this week that they had closed their investigation into the campaign finance violations cohen committed when he arranged payments to silence two women who claimed they had extramarital affairs with trump that probe begun in 2017 turned up evidence that trump himself was aware of the payments despite his initial public claims to know nothing about them including a recording in which trump can be heard speaking to cohen about efforts to buy the continued silence of karen mcdougal a playboy model prosecutors went as far as saying in court filings that trump directed cohen to make the payments though they referred to him in court filings as individual 1 not by name the u s house oversight committee on friday asked prosecutors to produce documents and evidence in the case saying they wanted to get to the bottom of the decision to charge cohen but no one else the committee is seeking to determine whether the internal department

mayor bill de blasio a democrat now running for president after an investigation into alleged campaign finance violations i find it odd they haven t made clear what happened here matthew miller a former justice department spokesman during the obama administration said of the justice department s decision not to say anything publicly about the end of the cohen investigation they ve set up this system in which the president is treated differently than anyone else in the country miller said given that they publicly named the president as having directed a crime it makes no sense for them to
