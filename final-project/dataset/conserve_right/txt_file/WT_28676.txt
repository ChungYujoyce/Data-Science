nomination of chuck canterbury for atf director oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens mnuchin said trump officials learned over the weekend that chinese officials were trying to go back on some of the language that had been negotiated in 10 earlier rounds of talks the u s officials said that at 12 01 a m eastern time friday the administration will raise the tariffs from 10 to 25 president donald trump had announced those plans via twitter on sunday expressing frustration with the pace of negotiations the hit list includes such varied products as baseball gloves vacuum cleaners and burglar alarms the reiteration monday of the president s threat from high level trump officials reinforced the administration s determination to put beijing on the defensive by threatening to raise taxes on chinese imports trump is throwing down a challenge to beijing agree to sweeping changes in china s government dominated economic model or suffer the consequences the unexpected ultimatum shook up financial markets which had expected the world s two biggest economies to resolve a yearlong standoff over trade perhaps by the end of the week it s a significant change in the president s tone said timothy keeler a partner at the law firm mayer brown and former chief of staff for the u s trade representative office it certainly increases the possibility that you ll have no deal for weeks trump administration officials had been suggesting that the u s and chinese negotiators were making steady progress suddenly on sunday trump said he had

forcing foreign firms to hand over technology in exchange for access to the chinese market and unfairly subsidizing chinese firms at the expense of foreign competitors the trump administration has imposed 10 tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports and 25 tariffs on another 50 billion the chinese have retaliated by targeting 110 billion in u s imports global stock markets sank monday on trump s tweetstorm but shares in the united states regained some of the lost ground on news that chinese officials were planning to go ahead with this week s meetings in washington still the chinese government did not provide details on exactly when talks would resume and who would be on china s negotiating team u s officials said they expected that china s delegation would be led again by vice premier liu he a confidante of chinese president xi jinping beijing is wrestling with an internal conflict it is eager to end a trade fight that has battered chinese exporters but it doesn t want to look like it s bowing to the trump administration s demands for far reaching concessions trump s threat makes going ahead with talks very difficult politically for xi s government said jake parker vice president of the u s china business council he said the chinese public might view this as a capitulation if beijing reached an agreement before trump s friday deadline the conflict is testing how
