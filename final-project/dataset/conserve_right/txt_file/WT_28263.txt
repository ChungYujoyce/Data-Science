tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn tokyo ap with their second summit fast approaching speculation is growing that u s president donald trump may try to persuade north korean leader kim jong un to commit to denuclearization by giving him something he wants more than almost anything else an announcement of peace and an end to the korean war such an announcement could make history it would be right in line with trump s opposition to forever wars and coming more than six decades after the fighting essentially ended it just seems like common sense but if not done carefully it could open up a whole new set of problems for washington top stories bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens here s why switching the focus of the ongoing talks between pyongyang and washington from denuclearization to peace would be a risky move and why it might be exactly what kim wants when the two leaders meet in hanoi on feb 27 28 the standoff the korean peninsula was divided at the 38th parallel after world war ii with the u s claiming a zone of influence in the south and the soviet union in the north within five years the two koreas were at war though the shooting stopped in 1953 the conflict ended with an armistice essentially a cease fire signed by north korea china and the 17 nation u s led united nations command that was supposed to be replaced by a formal peace treaty but both sides instead settled ever deeper into cold war hostilities marked by occasional outbreaks of violence the conflict in korea is technically america s longest war north korea which saw all of its major cities and most of its infrastructure destroyed by u s bombers during the war blames what it sees as washington s unrelenting hostility over the past 70 years as ample justification for its nuclear weapons and long range missiles it claims they are purely for self defense the u s on the other hand maintains a heavy military presence in south korea to counter what it says is the north s intention to invade and assimilate the south it has also implemented a long standing policy of ostracizing the north and backing economic sanctions trump escalated the effort to squeeze the north with a maximum pressure strategy that remains in force a combination of that strategy and the north s repeated tests of missiles believed capable of delivering its nuclear weapons to the u s mainland are what brought the two countries to the negotiating table why kim wants a treaty getting a formal peace treaty has been high on the wish list of every north korean leader starting with kim jong un s grandfather kim il sung a peace treaty would bring international recognition probably at least some easing of trade sanctions and a likely reduction in the number of u s troops south of the demilitarized zone if done right it would be a huge boost to kim s reputation at home and abroad and of course to the cause of peace on the korean peninsula at a time when pyongyang says it is trying to shift scarce resources away from defense so that it can boost its standard of living and modernize its economy with a greater emphasis on science and technology washington has a lot to gain too trump has said he would welcome a north korea that is more focused on trade and economic growth stability on the peninsula is good for south korea s economy and probably for japan s as well though trump hasn t stressed human rights eased tensions could create the space needed for the north to loosen its controls over political and individual freedoms but it s naive to expect north korea to suddenly change its ways according to a recent estimate it has over the past year continued to expand its nuclear stockpile and even as it has stepped up its diplomatic overtures to the outside world pyongyang has doubled down internally on demanding loyalty to its totalitarian system peace or appeasement after his first summit with kim in singapore last june trump declared the nuclear threat was over he isn t saying that anymore trump made no mention of the word denuclearization during his state of the union address instead he called his effort a historic push for peace on the korean peninsula and stressed that kim hasn t conducted any recent nuclear or missile tests and has released americans who had been jailed in the north and returned the remains of dozens of americans killed in the war kim meanwhile has good reason to want to turn his summits with trump into peace talks the biggest win for the north would be to get a peace declaration while quietly abandoning denuclearization altogether or by agreeing to production caps or other measures that would limit but not eliminate its nuclear arsenal simply having a summit without a clear commitment to denuclearization goes a long way toward establishing him as the leader of a de facto nuclear state unless washington is willing to accept him as such that will only make future talks all the more difficult the u s has however continued to take a hard line in lower level negotiations leading up to the summit stephen biegun trump s new point man on north korea stressed in a recent speech that as a prerequisite for peace washington wants a complete understanding of the full extent of the north korean weapons of mass destruction missile programs expert access and monitoring of key sites and ultimately the removal and destruction of stockpiles of fissile material weapons missiles launchers and other weapons of mass destruction the question is whether trump will similarly challenge kim or choose an easier and splashier but less substantive declaration of peace talk vs treaty if he chose to do so trump could unilaterally announce the end of the korean war it would be great tv but it wouldn t necessarily mean all that much trump can t by himself conclude an actual peace treaty china and possibly a representative of the u n command would have to be involved south korea would naturally want to be at the table the u s senate would have to ratify whatever they came up with back in 1993 the administration of president bill clinton reached a familiar sounding agreement with pyongyang to achieve peace and security on a nuclear free korean peninsula the next year the two sides vowed to reduce barriers to trade and investment open a liaison office in the other s capital and make progress toward upgrading bilateral relations to the ambassadorial level in 2000 clinton and kim s father kim jong il added a promise of respect for each other s sovereignty and non interference in each other s internal affairs but by 2002 george w bush was back to calling the north part of an axis of evil in 2006 north korea tested its first nuclear device the lesson whatever grand proclamations are made establishing real peace will go well beyond just another trump and kim summit but it could be a star
