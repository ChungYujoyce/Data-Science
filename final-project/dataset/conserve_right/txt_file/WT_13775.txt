civilian aircraft operations to beijing based superior aviation beijing co ltd for 1 79 billion sixty percent of superior is owned by a private entity entirely owned by mr cheng and his wife the other 40 percent is held by an economic development company controlled by the beijing municipal government questions loom about what will happen to workers and facilities in wichita superior says it has no plans to relocate or terminate any manufacturing facilities or product lines but union officials say such talk has to be backed up with solid guarantees most of the workers fears stem from the fact
