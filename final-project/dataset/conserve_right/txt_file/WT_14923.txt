 be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion prior to being elected president richard nixon built his political career on being a staunch opponent of communism he had run for congress in 1946 on an anti communist platform exposed senior state department official alger hiss as a top level spy for the soviet union and as vice president debated soviet premier nikita khrushchev on the merits of capitalism versus marxism in the famous kitchen debate of 1959 that principled position gave him the unimpeachable credibility to visit communist china as president in 1972 which led to the famous rapprochement with the united states that changed the world similarly donald trump catapulted to the front of the republican primary pack after making common sense and long overdue comments about illegal immigration and the damage it does to the american worker and broader economy our cultural fabric and the rule of law top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century when mexico sends its people they re not sending their best he said in his june 2015 presidential announcement speech they re not sending you they re sending people that have lots of problems and they re bringing those problems with us they re bringing drugs they re bringing crime they re rapists and some i assume are good people holy hell then broke loose because he spoke the truth in brutally honest if indelicate terms you aren t supposed to do that in modern day america where every place is a candyland safe space of rainbows and puppies mr trump s raw analysis of the catastrophic consequences of unchecked illegal immigration helped to win him the republican nomination and ultimately earned him an invitation to speak with mexican president enrique pena nieto in mexico mr trump s unwillingness to back down in the face of the jackbooted word and policy police made his visit and his major address on the subject so critically important just as mr nixon was the only leader who had the anti communist credentials to open relations with beijing mr trump is the only one who could go to mexico speak hard truths to the mexican president to his face then return to arizona to detail a specific plan to end the chaos if elected mr trump vowed to halt illegal immigration build a wall on the southern border deport violent criminal aliens on day one end sanctuary cities and the jobs benefits magnet renegotiate bad trade deals deny amnesty impose extreme vetting of those coming from regions compromised by islamic terror and other dangerous ideologies and embrace a skills based legal immigration policy ambitious given the forces on the right and the left opposed to such a comprehensive america first approach sure but nobody has ever accused mr trump of being unambitious perhaps the most important thing mr trump accomplished both in mexico and in his speech is that he shattered two previously accepted premises one that non citizens have a right to enter and stay in the country and two that once here we owe them proactive resolution to the non citizens who would like to enter the country mr trump stated a common sense legal truth they have no right to be here and we are under no obligation to let anyone in america s immigration laws do not exist for compassion or empathy as lovely as those sentiments are they exist to serve america s national interests and that s what he intends to enforce to the millions of illegal immigrants already here mr trump turned the accepted premise that we owe them resolution for violating the law on its head we will no longer allow the country to be held hostage to the desired future votes of these people that kind of political extortion will end with his election those here illegally will get neither the vote nor amnesty nor citizenship if they want a positive change to their status they must leave the country and return legally that s constitutional resolution by offering a rational defense of a rational policy that commands majority support mr trump changed the nature of the race he not only mastered the coveted optics of looking presidential on the international stage he gave a bold detailed unapologetic speech grounded in american interests and in protecting the american people in the most dramatic moment of his address he put a face on the darkest side of illegal immigration by inviting several angel moms parents who have lost children to violent illegal aliens to join him onstage it was a powerful emotional scene which illuminated his case better than the pointed statistics those moms are the statistics mr nixon s visit to china shook the world mr trump s visit to mexico may end up having a similar effect following their bilateral meeting mr nieto acknowledged that trade deals like nafta could be renegotiated and the border addressed differently if mr trump the nominee is already changing foreign governments tunes imagine what mr trump the president will be able to accomplish monica crowley is editor of online opinion at the washing
