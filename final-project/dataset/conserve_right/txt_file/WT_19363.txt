apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion robert mueller just wants to feel the love again his press clippings have faded and life hasn t been the same for the man choking on rectitude and righteousness not since he turned in his account of the vain pursuit of donald trump and the russians after more than two years trying to find the president in bed with vladimir putin he didn t even find the bed after months of anticipation of the gift from the righteous santa all the democrats got in their stockings were two or three lumps of coal the democrats turned on santa with a vengeance what expectant democrats thought was rectitude turned out to be betrayal nobody likes to have his feelings hurt after weeks of brooding mr mueller finally emerged from hiding to give a valedictory speech nine minutes and counting to say goodbye to the justice department he packed up his pens legal pads and what was left of a family size box of bicarbonate of soda and did his duty boiled down it was something like hey guys can t you take a joke he meant to do something to erase the results of the 2016 election he really did but a man of rectitude must be guided by the principles of fairness top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore gavin newsom first responders first ones laid off unless california gets federal covid 19 funds it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of an actual charge particularly since so far as mr mueller was able to figure out there was no crime he clearly thinks the president ought to be put in the dock but somebody else has to do the job he was paid to do mr mueller wouldn t do anything like a hanging of course but he might stand in the shade of the hanging tree and clap his hands mr mueller and his team of crack investigators are said to have been frustrated by a lack of public and congressional understanding of just how justice and the justice department actually work he couldn t run the unicorn to ground but it wasn t his fault justice department guidelines say a president can t be indicted that s work for the house of representatives and it s called impeachment so just to be fair mr mueller wants everybody to know that he couldn t have indicted the president even if he had wanted to but because he s a stand up guy he won t say whether he would have if he could have he did say the russians he indicted for piddling offenses they will never have to answer to because they re already back home in russia are innocent until proved guilty if anybody wants to think the president is guilty until proved innocent well it s a free country and everybody is free to think what they want to the report mr mueller turned in shows that he found no evidence of a conspiracy to collude with anybody about anything and if he were the righteous stand up guy he wants everybody to think he is he would have said so loud and clear but then he would never feel the love again the righteous stand up guy left it to william p barr the attorney general to decide whether mr mueller s evidence would support an impeachment prosecution for obstruction this was the decision that mr mueller should have made but righteous stand up guys sometimes have to get someone else to do their work mr mueller s grudging conclusion that he and his crack investigators found no evidence of presidential collusion with the russians to cook the 2016 election left the democrats with nowhere to go but to the proposition that the president tried to obstruct mr mueller the righteous stand up guy took a powder on that too mr mueller s report makes clear that nothing was obstructed not the fbi counter intelligence probe the wall street journal observes and not his own no witnesses were interfered with and mr mueller was allowed to issue nearly 500 search and seizure warrants and interview anyone he wanted including anyone in the white house nancy pelosi is entitled to feel the love or at least appreciation for trying to keep her cowboys from driving the campaign wagon off the cliff the democrats have a chance nothing like hillary s slam dunk but a chance to take back the white house next year and the cowboys obviously prefer the entertainment of an impeachment frenzy to the hard work of winning an election such a frenzy would be right up donald trump s street with 24 7 tweetstorms and new sensations in every round the clock news cycle the democrats can impeach but that s only the half of it the needed majority would never convict mrs pelosi understands that and further understands that a failed impeachment would guarantee four more years of the man the democrats live to hate wesley pruden is editor in chief emeritus of
