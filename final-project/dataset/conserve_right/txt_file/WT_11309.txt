apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic berlin germany s relationship with china has grown so close that berlin now calls it special but the coziness has some germans concerned about chancellor angela merkel s refusal to bring up human rights with asia s biggest power what we heard from chinese officials was basically that she s fallen into line said hans kundnani an analyst at the european council for foreign relations in london referring to mrs merkel she understands china more she knows where the red lines are and she doesn t cross them mrs merkel has made six visits to china since taking office in 2005 and has easy access to communist party decision makers because of the increasing depth and breadth of the consultations between the countries german officials said before a trip last week to china where she met with premier wen jiabao and his likely successor li keqiang the senior vice premier top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias evangelist who built global ministry dies at 74 dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed germany is the only country with whom china holds comparable government talks on this scale said a german official who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to talk to reporters the special relation is a result of several factors relating to economic power trade and business practices germany has been the most successful country economically since the financial crisis in 2008 said horst lochel an economics professor at the frankfurt school of finance and management the chinese think that germany can inject a certain amount of stability into the eurozone and that it has a crucial role in deciding what direction the eurozone will take besides propping up the eurozone of 17 european nations that use the euro currency the chinese german relationship is grounded in mutual self interest analysts say trade between the two nations has boomed in recent years china is now germany s second biggest supplier and its fifth biggest customer trade between the two nations jumped 11 percent last year germany also has expertise in producing the high end manufactured goods that are in demand in china german business representatives say german goods fit with what s needed in china right now machines and plant building firms are right up there along with small to medium sized mechanics firms said ilja nothnagel a foreign trade specialist at the german chamber of commerce and industry in berlin and because people in china like to show off that they ve made it china is one of the most important export markets for german cars chinese investment in germany also has shown a rapid upturn chinese companies are buying into increasingly more small to medium sized german companies the backbone of the german economy economists say chinese investors have been lured into the market by the successful small family owned companies that employ the bulk of german workers they re looking around the world for small niche market leaders that expand their knowledge of business in other countries where they believe that they can buy know how said peter englisch an analyst with the consulting company ernst young germans and chinese also share a similar approach to money matters the germans are a very cautious lot who tally up everything and have to think over a purchase three times before they buy it and that s perhaps a little bit similar in china said mr lochel who spent nearly a decade in china germany also thinks china may do more than britain or the united states to shore up the euro and ease the euro crisis chinese government investments are unknown but in the past china propped up southern european debtors taking losses on greek bonds german officials say still in her rush to cozy up to china mrs merkel has underplayed human rights concerns critics say she still talks occasionally about human rights but the chinese officials and analysts we talked to suggested that was for domestic media consumption but they didn t take it too seriously mr kundnani said the german government insisted that mrs merkel is committed to human rights in china questions of human rights and social development are always on the agenda said a government official who asked not to be identified because he was not permitted to be quoted by name the intensity of those discussions has not changed the close relationship between the chancellor and the prime minister has even led to a situation where all questions are put on the agenda and discussed german opposition lawmakers say that other human rights matters including political prisoners should have been tackled with the chinese government during last week s visit human rights was a minor issue in her trip said tom koenigs chairman of the german parliament s human rights committee we cannot stop exchanging views on human rights it s a question of face saving he said the chinese are always very fond of face saving issues for us it is a face saving issue that we keep our values sumi somaskanda in berli
