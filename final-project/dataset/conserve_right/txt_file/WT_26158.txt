michael cohen an act the president decried as a politically motivated witch hunt for reasons never explained publicly the justice department decided berman should recuse himself from supervising that investigation putting it in the hands of his hand picked top deputy robert khuzami since then though berman has taken a direct hand in other investigations that have angered trump this month berman s office subpoenaed trump s inaugural committee for a wide range of documents as part of an investigation into various potential crimes including possible illegal contributions from foreigners to

charge of the seemingly widening cohen probe trump called the story fake news mary jo white an independent appointed by president bill clinton to a stint as u s attorney in manhattan from 1993 to 2002 said she spoke to berman last week and he was upset at the newspaper s characterization of him he is concerned anybody would even think for a moment he is anything but totally independent white said any time any of us have our integrity impugned it s upsetting and it s so off and wrong in his case mimi rocah who left the southern district as a prosecutor two months before berman arrived said she believes some people were initially skeptical about anyone appointed u s attorney by trump but rocah now a criminal justice fellow at pace university law school said berman has earned the trust of the
