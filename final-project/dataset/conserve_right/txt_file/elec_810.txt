extremely liberal state democrats apos hopes of retaking congress in november and mounting a national challenge to president trump apos s agenda hang in the balance meanwhile as ballots continue to be counted in several key house races in california and seven other states with primaries tuesday trump said in a may tweet that cox will make california great again rallying the state apos s conservative base around the businessman and saying he could solve california apos s high crime high tax problems this is only the first step to turning around this state and taking back california for all californians cox told supporters in san diego fox news also projects that sen dianne feinstein will place first in the state apos s jungle primary a widely expected result she will likely face ultra progressive state sen kevin de leon in november who delivered remarks early wednesday strongly suggesting that he will be the runner up this is only the first step to turning around this state and taking back california for all californians the state apos s key house races though are still too close to call the winners and losers in california apos s most competitive races could take days to sort out given the state apos s unique election laws there were some results in from the house races early wednesday republican rep mimi walters easily advanced to the november election in her orange county district that has been targeted by democrats the second spot remained up for grabs and to the north house intelligence committee chairman devin nunes a republican qualified for the general election ballot as well nunes is a polarizing figure in national politics given his support for trump in one of the many investigations into russian meddling in the 2016 election democrats need to flip 23 republican controlled to retake the house from the gop in november out of california apos s 53 house seats republicans hold 14 and seven of those gop held districts backed hillary clinton in 2016 that makes the golden state center stage for what democrats are hoping is a major anti trump wave in november in several races either republicans or democrats face the very real prospect of being denied a place on the ballot in the general election calif judge in sex assault case faces recall vote that apos s because of california apos s nonpartisan open jungle primary system which advances the top two vote getting candidates to the general election regardless of their party affiliation the risk is particularly high for democrats who are riding a wave of anti trump enthusiasm in california so many democrats are running in three of the house races that they might split the vote to such an extent that two republicans end up with the most ballots that result would lock democrats out of competing in the general election in some of the most vulnerable republican districts a kind of embarrassing political own goal that would highlight the quirks and perils of california apos s unique primary procedure seven other states held primaries on tuesday including new jersey alabama mississippi new mexico south dakota iowa and montana click here for results from those key races calif gubernatorial candidate gavin newsom is projected to finish in one of the top spots in the state s jungle primary ap more on california apos s closest races the governor apos s race newsom a liberal establishment democrat who previously served as mayor of san francisco will win one of the two spots in the jungle primary and therefore will advance to the november ballot fox news can project republican businessman cox will face him but newsom is the clear favorite in november apos s statewide contest given california apos s overwhelmingly liberal electorate some democrats cried foul earlier this month after newsom ran ads that reminded voters of cox apos s connections with trump and the nra saying the frontrunner was implicitly trying to rally conservatives to the polls to ensure cox beat villaraigosa for the second spot on the ballot the house races one of the most hotly contested races is in the 48th congressional district which includes newport beach and laguna beach hillary clinton narrowly won the district in 2016 republican rep dana rohrabacher who has held the safe seat without serious challenge for decades faces eight democrats and fierce competition from gop rivalscott baugh so many democrats are running for the seat that none may end up getting the votes needed to appear on the ballot in november watch is dana rohrabacher being groomed as a russian agent tucker takes on liberal hysteria a similar situation might play out in california apos s 49th district where a broad array of candidates is vying for the seat vacated by retiring gop rep darrell issa eight republican candidates are in the running along with four democrats who are neck and neck the sheer number of entrants in the race could lock out either the gop or the democrats in november hillary clinton also won here in 2016 by a margin of a little over seven points another closely watched race was the effort by four democrats to unseat incumbent republican rep walters in the 45th district in orange county which no democrat has ever represented but that also supported clinton in 2016 walters voted to repeal obamacare which has become a hot button issue in the increasingly liberal district on tuesday walters easily advanced to the november election the second spot remains up for grabs important gop held seats with incumbents facing challenges are the 50th district where rep duncan hunter is under investigation for misuse of campaign funds the 10th district held by rep jeff denham the 21st district where hillary clinton won convincingly that is currently occupied bydavid valadao and the 25th district where rep steve knight is facing several challengers ed royce who was first elected to congress in 1992 and chairs the house foreign affairs committee announced his retirement earlier this year he will vacate his 39th district seat and several republican and democratic candidates are competing to replace him that setup again raises the
