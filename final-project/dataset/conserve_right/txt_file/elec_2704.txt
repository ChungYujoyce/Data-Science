calls for a commission to study the gold standard to the inclusion of a guest worker program plank the emerging republican party platform offers what is perhaps the most cohesive statement on where the diverse and difficult to corral conservative movement stands this year apos s platform won apos t be formally approved until the start of the republican national convention next week in tampa but it apos s already generating headlines as conservative groups who apos ve been pushing for one plank or another declare victory after having won a mention and as democrats pick over the language for examples of what they bill as an extreme ideology amid the chatter some republicans note the document is largely meaningless mitt romney is not bound to implement any of it if elected president it apos s a vision document not a party constitution new jersey gov chris christie the convention keynote speaker told wnyc earlier this week that most republicans probably don apos t know what apos s in the platform nor do they care i don apos t really care about the platform and i don apos t think most republicans care about the platform he said the planks though do matter to the groups who apos ve fought for them moves this week to include two provisions one to create a commission studying the gold standard and another calling for an audit of the federal reserve were hailed in some corners of the party the still active campaign site for ron paul who has made the gold standard and fed scrutiny a centerpiece of his calls for monetary reform highlighted coverage of the provisions the nonprofit american principles project likewise praised the republican platform committee apos s commitment to the stability and constitutional integrity to our national currency reflecting the reality that none of this is binding app chairman sean fieler said now it is up to our leaders to follow through and make the platform a reality the platform reportedly also includes some tough language on illegal immigration at a time when several republican led states are battling the federal government in court over the right to enforce illegal immigration laws according to the los angeles times kansas secretary of state kris kobach fought to include provisions calling for a border fence and the withholding of federal funds from sanctuary cities kobach helped draft the arizona immigration law and is a romney adviser he apos s also the attorney in the lawsuit filed thursday by immigration agents against homeland security secretary janet napolitano over the policy giving some illegal immigrants a deportation reprieve the gop platform though includes some conciliatory language on the immigration issue supporting a guest worker program giving temporary worker status to those who don apos t have green cards something the 2008 platform did not contain though gop leaders like former president george w bush have expressed backing for it in the past brad bailey co founder of immigration reform group the texas immigration solution hailed the unprecedented move saying it echoes language in the texas gop platform the immigration debate inside the gop has changed he said in a statement a guest worker plan is an important component of addressing the immigration crisis it is time that we apply our free market approaches to the immigration problem by putting a priority on securing the border and listening to the needs of american business owners and american farmers meanwhile the platform serves as a goldmine for democratic operatives coincidentally the rnc moved to approve language on abortion this week just as the controversy over rep todd akin apos s legitimate rape remarks boiled up the republican missouri congressman and senate candidate had suggested that women can fend off pregnancy in cases of legitimate rape as he argued against any exception for rape when it comes to opposition to abortion the republican party then finalized language expressing its opposition to abortion without including an exception for rape it apos s similar to language the party has approved in the past and the nominee is on record supporting exceptions for rape but democrats used it all the same to link the broader gop with akin apos s comments the obama campaign accused republicans of having just passed the akin amendment in a year that has shown us no shortage of republican candidates trying to prove themselves more extreme than the other on issues affecting women apos s health republicans have finally hit rock bottom democratic national committee
