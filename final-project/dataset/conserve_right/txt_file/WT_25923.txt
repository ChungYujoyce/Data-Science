costly infrastructure package with mr trump perhaps the best hope for a big bipartisan jobs bill this year on monday the u s chamber of commerce and the afl cio announced a rare business labor coalition in support of raising the federal gas tax to help pay for infrastructure spending the move could give the initiative bipartisan momentum in congress not seen since 2013 when business and labor joined forces in an ultimately unsuccessful push for immigration reform mrs pelosi and mr schumer will arrive at the white house with a big and bold list of liberal demands on higher spending and climate change regulations but partisan hostility in washington has only increased since the partial government shutdown ended in january and special counsel robert mueller released a report this month on his russia investigation that turned up no campaign collusion democrats on several house committees now waging investigations into the president and his business empire are issuing subpoenas for officials testimony and seeking his tax returns mr trump is vowing to fight them on every single issue all the way to the supreme court the border crisis has only worsened with more than 420 000 illegal crossings of the southern border so far this fiscal year white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said monday that the increasing pace of illegal immigration should convince democrats how wrong they were in december about the wall now the members of the democrat party hopefully are seeing exactly what the president s been talking about and will have a new willingness to

presidency mrs pelosi and mr schumer said democrats want to expand the infrastructure spending wish list to truly be a gamechanger for the american people we should go beyond transportation and into broadband water energy schools housing and other initiatives they wrote we must also invest in resiliency and risk mitigation of our current infrastructure to deal with climate change they also asked the president how he would pay for such a plan mr trump has proposed 200 billion in his fiscal 2020 budget for infrastructure saying it would encourage more private investment of up to 1 trillion to cover the nation s needs the u s chamber of commerce and the afl cio joined forces monday in calling for an increase in the federal gas tax to help pay for infrastructure rebuilding the tax 18 4 cents per gallon on gas and 24 4 cents on diesel was last raised in 1993 the chamber said hiking the federal fuel tax by 25 cents per gallon over five years would generate 394 billion in a decade but mr schumer reportedly won t support raising the gas tax unless mr trump repeals part of the 2017 tax cuts that gave the biggest relief to corporations chamber of commerce executive vice president neil bradley said trying to religitate other fights isn t going to help us get to a solution this is a historic opportunity if we can just resolve the financing option mr bradley said everyone just needs to have the political courage to come out and do it we have to provide real money and not gimmicks mr trump has considered a major infrastructure package since the earliest days of his presidency but faces some opposition in the republican party because of growing deficits white house economic adviser larry kudlow said the president will not bring a proposal for an infrastructure bill to tuesday s meeting we re going slowly on this mr kudlow said we would like this to be bipartisan we would like to work with them and come up with something both sides can agree to it s an important topic in their letter mr schumer and mrs pelosi said an infrastructure spending bill must prioritize clean energy and climate change the two areas are likely nonstarters for mr trump who has prided himself on boosting u s production of fossil fuels and has mocked hillary clinton s reliance on windmill generated power america s unmet infrastructure needs are massive and a bipartisan infrastructure package must meet those needs with substantial new and real revenue the democrats wrote to the president we look forward to hearing your ideas on how to pay for this package to ensure that it is big and bold enough to meet our country s needs democrats reintroduced a house resolution monday saying that most of the money for infrastructure should come from the government instead of private revenue and urging lawmakers not to repeal environmental protections it pointed out that the american society of civil engineers estimates there is a 2 trillion shortfall to modernize the nation s infrastructure over the next decade but the measure doesn t spell out how to pay for a rebuilding plan national association of manufacturers president and ceo jay timmons said u s spending on infrastructure is only one third of what it was in 1960 he said any serious legislation must fix the highway trust fund through various user fees and be transformational in its scope so that manufacturers and the country are positioned for future success that s why manufacturers are calling for at least 1 trillion in much needed new investment mr timmons said millions of jobs and our nation s competitiveness are at stake and it is time for our elected leaders to act tom trotter an official with the afl cio said a recent study found that urban u s commuters waste 97 hours per year stuck in traffic and burn about 3 1 billion gallons of fuel while idling nobody likes raising gas taxes mr trotter said we want to get something done mr trump supports streamlining the permitting process for construction projects
