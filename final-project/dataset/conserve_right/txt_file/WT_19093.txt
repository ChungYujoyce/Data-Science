apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic united nations ap two years ago donald trump used the spotlight of the annual u n conclave of world leaders to insult north korea s leader rocket man and threaten his nation with annihilation last year trump basked in the glow of diplomacy that suggested a genuine chance for detente with the north a surreal notion in a corner of the world that has been in a technical state of war since the 1950s this year top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time north korea warranted no more than a passing mention in trump s address and aside from his hints to reporters of another possible summit with leader kim jong un the issue has been largely overshadowed by other standoffs and scandals iran for instance and talk of trump s impeachment the north for its part is reportedly sending only an ambassador not its foreign minister to take the general assembly stage monday well after most world leaders have gone home the shift from dramatic threats to high stakes diplomacy to virtual afterthought at the united nations reflects the strange muddled state of affairs on the korean peninsula north korea is still making threats in its state media it s still conducting banned weapons tests as it looks to put pressure on the united states ahead of any resumption of stalled nuclear talks but the threats aren t particularly salty at least by north korea s vivid standards and the weapons being tested are meant to target south korea and japan not the u s mainland something trump has repeatedly mentioned while downplaying the tests the low key approach by washington and pyongyang at the united nations may reflect a diplomatic waiting game as the two sides jockey for position ahead of any resumed talks it certainly looks like neither side wants to stir the pot said vipin narang a north korea expert at mit he is optimistic that lower level nuclear talks could start soon because of a recent break in weapons tests trump s firing of his hawkish national security adviser john bolton and the u s president s need for a win as lawmakers pursue impeachment north korea he said wants to do a deal with trump rather than navigate a more hawkish democratic administration should trump lose the 2020 presidential election incentives align on both sides narang said that makes me think the low key mention of north korea and the emphasis on iran was designed to keep the window wide open for working level talks the relative silence on the north korea nuclear standoff is all the more striking because it has played such a key part in recent u n general assemblies in 2017 trump arrived for the gathering as pyongyang was making a run of increasingly powerful weapons tests that put the north closer than ever to backing up its claim to be a full fledged nuclear power those tests and trump s belligerent reaction had some fearing war standing at the u n podium that year trump belittled kim jong un as rocket man and threatened to totally destroy his country the north s top diplomat later said that a trump tweet that kim jong un won t be around much longer amounted to a declaration of war after south korea s president used the 2018 winter olympics in the south to reach out to kim an astonishing run of diplomacy took hold and trump and kim made history with a meeting in singapore in june of that year that first summit was criticized because trump and kim issued a vague statement about a nuclear free peninsula without describing when and how it would occur still at the u n meetings in late september trump touted the wonderful relationship with kim and noted that missiles and rockets are no longer flying from north korea north korean foreign minister ri yong ho urged the united states to keep moving past what he called seven decades of entrenched hostility the second trump kim summit which happened early this year in hanoi ended in failure as trump balked at north korean demands for sanctions relief in return for what was seen as too little movement on nuclear disarmament hopes rose again when the leaders met again in june at the koreas tense border but north korea then turned to repeated short range weapons tests which brings us to this year s general assembly and the north s uncharacteristic vanishing act part of it might be that there s simply less to talk about this year mintaro oba a former u s diplomat specializing in the koreas said u s north korea diplomacy has been sputtering along without any huge achievements to highlight and president trump has no desire to go in the opposite direction and return to fire and fury bombast trump oba said may have missed an opportunity at the united nations the north koreans are masters of shaping the public narrative and putting the burden of action on the united states he said president trump had a chance to flip the script by making some sort of creative proposal to advance u s north korea talks from the podium thus very publicly putting the onus on north korea to either accept the proposal or suggest another way instead oba said trump stuck to the same old talking points and the end result is that north korea remains fully in control of the timing and the public narrative surrounding diplomacy heading toward the end of year foster klug ap s news director for the koreas japan australia and the south pacific has
