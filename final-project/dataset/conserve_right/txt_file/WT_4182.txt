apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic plains ga ap the pilgrims arrive early and from all over gathering hours before daybreak in an old pecan grove that surrounds a country church they come they say for a dose of simple decency and devotion wrapped up in a bible lesson the teacher is the 39th president of the united states jimmy carter nearly four decades after he left office and despite a body that s failing after 95 years the nation s oldest ever ex president still teaches sunday school roughly twice a month at maranatha baptist church in his tiny hometown of plains in southwest georgia his message is unfailingly about jesus not himself top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk the church has only 30 or so members but as many as 450 people attend any week carter teaches about 200 people fill the sanctuary with pale green walls and stained glass windows and others gather in side rooms where the lesson is shown on tvs it s nearly impossible to separate even an ex president from politics and some come because they re democrats who recall voting for carter when he was elected in 1976 almost uniformly they re dismayed by the tone of president donald trump and his republican administration but trump has only been in office since 2017 and carter has been drawing crowds for years those who attended carter s most recent lesson on nov 3 said they just wanted to be in the presence of someone who seems kind humble and godly despite having been a world leader he s a role model and an inspiration for both of us both in public service and in faith said visitor doug kluth he and his wife ramona drove 2 400 miles 3 862 kilometers round trip from their home in columbus nebraska to see carter in person john and sarah dyer packed their four daughters ages 2 through 12 into their honda pilot for the 1 700 mile 2 736 kilometer round trip to plains from suburban chicago to see a man who was once on top of the world choose to spend his twilight years lifting the world higher was inspirational to my family and i john dyer wrote to the church s pastor in a letter shared with the associated press carter faced mockery for his southern baptist faith in 1976 when he said in a playboy magazine interview that he was guilty of adultery in his heart because he lusted after women the soul baring sentiment paralleled jesus words in the sermon on the mount but it came across as odd and narrow minded to many these days with a twice divorced president who curses in public and once said he d never asked god for forgiveness carter s approach to life with his wife of 73 years rosalynn by his side seems especially appealing to fans they say they admire carter s work to eradicate disease and monitor elections worldwide the time he has spent helping build homes as a volunteer with habitat for humanity and his advocacy for food programs and rural health care in his home county many were touched by photos of a bruised but smiling carter performing volunteer work after he fell and hit his head in october so they flock to plains any week maranatha baptist posts on its website or facebook page that carter plans to teach fray and susan carter of russellville alabama slept overnight in their car in the church parking lot to get a front row view as carter taught on his first sunday back after falling and breaking his pelvis in october as recently as last year carter would stand during his 45 minute lesson but he now uses an electric lift chair at the front of the sanctuary as a concession to age he breaks into that familiar smile when he raises the seat so he can see the crowd over a wooden lectern a cross made by carter a longtime woodworker adorns the choir loft he also made the wooden offering plates which bear his initials on the bottom carter s lesson this day was on his belief in life after death he ended the same way he always does by challenging class members to do one nice thing for somebody over the next month that s what i think would make america a better country it would make you a better person right and a better christian carter said well that s the essence of my sunday school lesson not anything fancy to it just some personal things to think about visitors that day included people from multiple u s states plus venezuela and ecuador rarely a week goes by without someone from overseas in the crowd said the rev tony lowden carter s pastor the church was formed in 1977 from a split when another church refused to accept blacks as members lowden was hired in march as maranatha s first black pastor on any given sunday lowden said the congregation is a mix of everything it s a melting pot of people who are looking for faith and looking for something that they can believe in lowden said after a cancer diagnosis in 2015 and three falls this year it s unclear how much longer carter can continue to teach but lowden said he s welcome as long as he s able the crowd on the first sunday in november included chet mulholland an evangelical christian from wisconsin and joey and sabrina fretwell faithful churchgoers from conservative mississippi in the heart of the deep south the couple s daughter attended a trump rally in tupelo mississippi just two days before they drove to plains to see carter sabrina fretwell 46 doesn t really remember carter s presidency but she recalls hours spent listening to her grandparents talk about carter when she was a girl that s one reason she wanted to see the former president she said to somehow honor that time i remember that warm feeling of sitting and listening to their conversations and not being old enough to grab what they were talking about but knowing it was still important to them and knowing they admired the things he was doing she said
