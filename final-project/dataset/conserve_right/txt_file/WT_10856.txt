scott morrison s promises to mitigate the national security risks posed by china s expanding regional ambitions they are also keenly aware of the ever tightening interdependency that ties even australia s agricultural heartland to chinese markets so when in his final days as treasurer mr morrison cited extrajudicial directions from a foreign government to nix chinese tech giant huawei s

seem largely inconsequential australia he said is in no place to be making any demands in a vastly unequal relationship the chinese see it for what it is i m sure mr sampson genest said china knows

pistachios prior to that the chinese didn t recognize a pecan nut he said within two or three years they were buying 20 25 percent of the global crop changing the rules to make the cross cultural
