saying he believes he can unify a fractured nation he s just a down home man jones said i trust him the associated press called the missouri race at poll closing before any results were released

american voters the ap also called mississippi for biden at poll closing things didn t always go smoothly at election sites across missouri a polling place in st louis had to relocate after a man who had just voted backed his vehicle into the building and went back inside and knocked over equipment st louis county had polling site equipment problems the mayor of kansas city reported trouble with his own ballot no one was hurt in the incident in st louis and the man was taken into custody but it took nearly an hour before voters could be redirected to another polling place the city s election director gary stoff said i don t think there was anything about his voting at least he didn t give any indication that caused him to explode the way he did stoff said right now we really don t know why election day got off to a rough start in st louis county missouri s most populous county when the electronic poll books used to check people in had trouble syncing with the county s system the problem was compounded with some poll workers failed to switch to a manual system to print ballots the problems were apparently resolved within the first hour but some voters turned away in frustration without casting ballots stream estimated that at least 50 of the county s roughly 400 polling sites were impacted they got flustered said st louis county election director rick stream voters left they had to go to work that s on us we should have had everything working properly kansas city mayor quinton lucas said he struggled to vote at his polling site because workers couldn t find his name on the voter registration list he said it turned out that his name had been entered backwards with his last name listed as his first name missouri michigan and mississippi where biden

name partly because of his ideas for expanding health care coverage there is a shot with him of something that is different that is much more hopeful than what we have now sanders said whoever wins the democratic nomination could face an uphill battle to carry missouri in november against trump the last democrat to carry missouri was president bill clinton in 1996 barack obama narrowly lost in missouri in 2008 but the state has turned decidedly republican since then mitt romney carried missouri by 9 percentage points in 2012 and trump won the state by 19 percentage points on the way to
