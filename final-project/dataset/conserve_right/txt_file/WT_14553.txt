apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic shenzhen china ap china s quietest multibillion dollar chinese success story began when a former soldier founded a company in the 1980s to sell imported phone switches as sales rose huawei technologies co invested to develop its own products a radical step for a private company in the first decade of china s reforms to open its economy but it paid off today huawei has grown into a major equipment supplier to phone carriers across asia europe and africa with 28 billion in sales last year and 110 000 employees now this giant the public has barely heard of wants to become a consumer and business brand moving into markets dominated by apple inc and cisco systems inc it is marketing its own mobile phones and tablet computer and is expanding in

sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey the consumer market and especially the mid range is something we certainly will get into with our own brand said song liuping a huawei vice president in an interview at its tree lined research campus in this southern chinese city bordering hong kong in a country known as a cheap anonymous factory huawei is a leader of an emerging group of chinese companies that are creating brand name technology in fields from telecoms to clean energy to medical equipment and starting to compete with western industry leaders the newcomers can draw on a low cost chinese talent pool of engineers and scientists and support from a communist leadership that is pushing to transform this nation of farmers and factory workers into a creator of profitable technologies chinese companies are climbing the technology ladder faster than japan and south korea did in past decades said oded shenkar a professor at ohio state university s fisher college of business who studies chinese companies in 10 to 15 years china could be where south korea is now as far as having a number of global champions shenkar said rising chinese competition could hamper hopes by the united states and other western governments to spur growth and create jobs by boosting high tech exports huawei has graduated from selling sturdy low cost gear to developing countries in asia and africa to supplying top global carriers that is adding to pressure on nokia siemens networks cisco sweden s ericsson ab and france s alcatel lucent sa many view huawei as their main competitor over the next few years said mark koh an analyst for frost sullivan in an e mail huawei has grown at explosive speed but has to cope with complaints it copied rivals products and suspicions it is controlled by the communist party or is a front for china s military in february a u s government security panel rejected its purchase of a california computer company 3leaf systems huawei denies it is a security threat and invited washington to investigate it after the failure of the 3leaf acquisition the company was founded in 1987 by ren zhengfei a former military engineer and one of china s most enigmatic business figures in a society where founders of internet retail and other companies far smaller than huawei are celebrities ren never appears in public or talks to reporters forbes magazine estimated his wealth last year at 1 1 billion huawei says it is owned by its employees but has released few details about who controls it fueling questions abroad the place where they have the greatest trouble is the west where they face a lot of suspicion about their origins it s clearly a handicap said tarun khanna a professor at harvard business school ren started the company after his engineering unit was disbanded and he left the army according to huawei s february statement he started with 21 000 yuan 5 500 at the time from his savings and a deal to sell phone switches supplied by a hong kong company demand boomed as chinese carriers upgraded decrepit equipment at the start of reforms that would ignite china s economic boom song said huawei got into developing its own products almost by accident launching a research arm only after its hong kong supplier was acquired by a state owned company in 1990 early gear targeted rural chinese phone companies and included a switching unit in 1994 marketed as mouse proof for carriers that suffered from gnawed cables our main goal was survival song said huawei spent a decade selling in china s countryside and developing countries in asia and africa then moving into chinese cities it made its first sale in europe in 2004 to a dutch mobile phone carrier today huawei works with 45 of the 50 biggest phone carriers on the consumer front huawei s latest gadget is the mifi a portable wireless modem the size of a deck of cards that creates a local area network for a half dozen laptop computers as it expands in the u s huawei is also looking at opportunities in fields from finance and government to health transportation and smart grid management of power networks the company s research and development staff has grown to 50 000 people and research spending is set at about 10 percent of sales or 2 5 billion last year it operates 12 joint development centers with partners including vodafone group deutsche telekom japan s ntt docomo and egypt s etisalat and has research ventures with microsoft corp ibm corp and others its corporate campus is a cluster of sleek glass and steel buildings on a 325 acre 130 hectare campus with an artificial lake a training center where new employees spend six months was designed by star architect norman foster they re generally a pretty impressive story said duncan clark managing director of bda china ltd a beijing research firm who has followed the company for a decade some people in the united states see them as a creature of the government but that s unfair because if you look at how they ve grown it s almost despite the government not because of them he said they get export credits and other things but it s wrong to dismiss them as a knockoff shop or a product of the army in contrast to major chinese state owned companies which do most of their business in china and benefit from monopolies and other official favors huawei says it made 70 percent of its sales abroad last year in another break with tradition huawei also looks abroad for senior managers its chief technology officer was recruited from bt in 2009 the former cto of canada s nortel networks corp was hired last year to run research and development in north america you have chinese people based in sweden and western people based in shenzhen it s become a very globalized process said richard brennan a californian who has worked for huawei since 2007 and is deputy director of industrial standards other chinese companies also are starting to make a name for themselves as technology creators mindray medical international ltd also based in shenzhen competes with general electric co and germany s siemens ag to sell x ray machines and other medical devices in the united states and europe zte corp a huawei rival also based in shenzhen sells switching equipment mobile phone base stations and handsets shenzhen s success as a center for technology and finance has propelled its growth from a fishing village of about 30 000 people in 1980 before it was declared china s first special economic zone into a skyscraper filled metropolis of more than 14 million beijing urgently wants to nurture more such innovators to reduce reliance on foreign technology and create higher paid jobs it has promised grants tax breaks and other support to promote strategic industries including clean energy environmental and information technology biotech and high end manufacturing some of its tactics have irritated its trading partners the government is pressing global companies to hand over wind power computer encryption and other technologies as the price of market access business groups complain beijing s efforts to nurture local suppliers by favoring them in government purchases of computers and other technology violates the spirit of its free trade commitments chinese officials respond to some of the criticism by pointing out that u s european and japanese companies also receive tax breaks export subsidies and other help from their governments song the huawei vice president rejected suggestions its success is based on government support he said it comes instead from market driven decisions and a corporate culture that motivates employees with stock and quick promotions huawei s february statement said some customers receive financing from china s state owned banks but song said that while it gets some government grants huawei pays for most of its research out of its own sales in the 1980s there were hundreds of state owned companies in the telecoms industry with huawei but they did not survive he said if the state or military connection were the key to success
