by john stossel august 22 2012 i wanted to like paul ryan before he was nationally known rep ryan visited me at abc and we went to lunch he was terrific he was a rare politician one who actually cared about america s coming debt crisis and the unfairness of entitlements he even talked about f a hayek s the road to serfdom if only more politicians thought that way but then the housing bubble burst ryan voted for tarp then he voted for the auto bailout who is this guy i thought he believed in markets at fox when i got my own tv show i asked him about that i voted for tarp because i believed we were going to fall into a deflationary spiral the economy was going to collapse the purpose of voting for that auto bill was to prevent the auto companies from getting tarp dollars now tarp has become this revolving government slush fund never was intended but in your ideal world should government have bailed out the auto company no whew i wish he had voted against those bills but the political class was in near panic and ryan is a politician it s a reason i don t like politicians but at least ryan speaks against bailouts now we re reaching a tipping point in this country where a majority of americans are getting their benefits and livelihoods from the federal government why does this put us on a road to serfdom because we re moving from a society where the goal of government is not to equalize opportunity but to equalize the results of our lives the more we ask government to do for us the more government can take from us government is doing so much in our lives that we have less freedom to govern ourselves i like hearing a politician say that i told ryan that i fear that most americans don t understand economics and actually prefer a government that takes care of us no i think people believe in the american idea that our rights don t come from government and so we do not want a government where they give us our rights and redistribute regulate and ration our rights hope he s right in 2008 ryan proposed a roadmap for the future a budget plan that would slow the growth of government it was timid it wouldn t eliminate the education department or other useless government agencies and wouldn t balance the budget for decades yet even republicans said his plan was too radical newt gingrich called it right wing social engineering last year i invited ryan back on my show to talk about that by then the needle had moved ryan s roadmap helped change the discussion many republicans woke up newt apologized for his comment the republican study committee proposed bigger cuts now said ryan i would call my plan mild i was trying to get consensus we ve moved the center of gravity we ve taken on what they call the third rail these entitlement programs which are the big drivers of our debt we showed the country that there is a different way to go and that we can get back toward limited government economic freedom and i feel pretty good where we are and how we brought this conversation forward he should feel good for 50 years the needle did not move at all americans accepted the growth of the welfare state now more understand we have one more opportunity in this country it is not too late to revive and reapply the american idea but there will come a point where that moment might pass us countries can get off the road to serfdom canada did it and prospered because of it it won t be easy for america but if we do it paul ryan deserves much of the credit what i ve learned in southern wisconsin is that people are ready to be talked to like adults not like children and they know we re in a debt crisis hope he s right john stossel is the host of stossel which airs thursdays on fox business network at 9 pm et he s the author of no they can t why government fails but individuals succeed more info here copyright 2012 creators syndicate inc author archive more tweets
