because outbreak and pandemic and any of a dozen high stakes words accompany dispatches about the deadly novel coronavirus it s not surprising nor ill advised that the news media and financial markets respond with alarm to covid 19 still the critical response leaves scientists environmental advocates and long view money managers imploring where s the impetus for moving on policy change and market driven fixes solutions to store carbon for instance to limit a future environmental health crisis one on par with or even greater than a coronavirus follow the latest news coronavirus for one thing the public may feel compelled to only respond to what s in front of them americans are seeing coverage of the virus across multiple media platforms in a consistent manner which is bringing awareness and driving public concern write monica medina and miro korenha of our daily planet on the other hand you ve probably seen very little coverage that the national oceanic and atmospheric administration predicts this year s flooding in the midwest could rival last year s catastrophic floods that claimed lives and also helped spread disease to livestock and people according to a recent study by the organization media matters news shows on the major networks aired only 238 minutes of climate crisis coverage in 2019 which was actually up from 2018 significantly but as a whole still made up only 0 7 of overall nightly broadcasts and the sunday morning news shows it is true that climate change and its response appear in specialized media and occasionally crack the lineup of mainstream coverage

weekend reads what corporate insiders are doing as the coronavirus spreads and the stock market tanks but wiggins stresses contrastingly climate change is predominantly a future threat but there is a

change response if politicians make the electorates life more difficult it reduces their chances of being re elected even if the imposition of discomfort now is designed to deliver incalculable
