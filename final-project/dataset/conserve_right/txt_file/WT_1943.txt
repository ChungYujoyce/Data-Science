apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic journalists can squawk all they want about the glories of the impeachment process claiming it s a notable showcase for the u s political system not everyone agrees with this one clinical forensic psychologist in fact says the collective well being of all americans is now at stake as the endless legal proceedings and nonstop media coverage rumbles on president trump s impeachment has in general increased the negative effect of our country s mental state first we see an individual that has not been allowed due process when he was impeached in the house many americans dislike the justice system and feel that many people are not allowed due process and this is just a big example of that john huber chairman of the texas based nonprofit mainstream mental health tells inside the beltway second many who are happy the president has not been allowed due process have allowed their anger to grow directing it at anyone who even asks about due process or mentions some sort of defense of the president third this has brought most individuals to believe that anyone who does not think as they do are personally attacking them and not just opening the floor for conversation mr huber observes top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk ultimately this has shut down discussion in the u s damaging the one thing that has made america the best country to be a part of and that is the ability to share ideas even when not everyone agrees with those ideas to avoid conflict many people are now withholding opinions and beliefs in fear of retribution for speaking their minds this is a dangerous place to be as a country he says but hope springs eternal perhaps i do believe that we will shift back to a more open discourse as we move forward humans are resilient and given enough time will overcome just like when elvis presley was first seen on national tv it was said he would destroy the american way we survived elvis we will survive this mr huber adds corrupted and manipulated uh oh the media is catching some blame when it comes to the ultimate destruction of planet earth no really as it does each year the bulletin of the atomic scientists has moved its symbolic doomsday clock a little closer to midnight which would in theory suggest that armageddon is just around the corner the organization says we are 100 seconds away from ultimate destruction due to climate change hypersonic missiles and other catastrophic things including the realm of journalism civilization ending nuclear war whether started by design blunder or simple miscommunication is a genuine possibility climate change that could devastate the planet is undeniably happening and for a variety of reasons that include a corrupted and manipulated media environment democratic governments and other institutions that should be working to address these threats have failed to rise to the challenge the organization noted in a public statement well at least we re 100 seconds away from the big kaboom rather than say 30 seconds an astonishing new york times headline trump acts like a politician that s not an impeachable offense notes a new york times headline heralding an opinion piece by josh blackman a constitutional law professor at the south texas college of law in houston receiving a political benefit does not transform an otherwise legal action like requesting an investigation into an abuse of power he explains impeachment a tidy summation every one of the 63 million americans who voted

with the economy booming blue collar wages up and workers prospering whatever you think of his bombast trump has been meticulous in keeping his promises to the american people she says noting that
