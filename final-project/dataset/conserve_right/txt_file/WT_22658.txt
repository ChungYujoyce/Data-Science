apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic detroit ap elizabeth warren launched her first tour of michigan as a democratic presidential candidate on tuesday with a proposal to boost domestic manufacturing including the creation of a cabinet level department charged with creating and defending american jobs the department of economic development she would create would replace the department of commerce and consolidate several agencies including the small business administration and the patent and trademark office she s also pledging to more actively manage american currency focus more on promoting exports and require companies that get federal research money to keep related production in the u s she d spend 20 billion on apprenticeship programs and invest 2 trillion in environmentally friendly manufacturing the massachusetts senator who launched her 2020 white house bid in february is billing her latest plan as part of a broader economic patriotism agenda the measures are the latest in a series of ambitious policy proposals that have become a trademark of her campaign top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey as warren visits detroit and lansing her economic proposals are aimed squarely at midwesterners who have watched millions of manufacturing jobs disappear in recent decades and who powered president donald trump to victory in 2016 after he promised to defend their interests those giant corporations they may not care about american workers but i do and i m willing to fight for it she told several hundred people tuesday at a detroit job training facility you want to be an american company then make a contribution to running this country warren told the crowd that america s economic plan for too long has been to do whatever giant corporations want criticizing companies such as levi strauss and general electric that she says portray themselves as american but produce most of their products overseas it s unclear how warren would turn some of her most costly policies into reality especially if democrats don t win back control of the senate in next year s elections the last time congress approved a significant new cabinet level department was 2002 when the department of homeland security was created and the 2 trillion price tag of warren s clean energy manufacturing plan would prompt plenty of republican critics that plank of her agenda is directly tied to the green new deal a framework for dramatically cutting the nation s dependence on fossil fuels that s championed by rising liberal star rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y warren would pay for her three part green research manufacturing and exporting program with proceeds from her proposed new tax on corporate profits and by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and rolling back some provisions of the gop s 2017 tax law an independent analysis from moody s projects that it would add 700 billion to the nation s budget

driver of the problems american workers face from our trade agreements to our tax code we have encouraged companies to invest abroad ship jobs overseas and keep wages low warren wrote in an online post announcing her plan in my administration we will stop making excuses while biden praised the green new deal on tuesday his climate proposal falls short of some of its targets asked about biden s plan and whether any democratic presidential nominee should work toward the green new deal framework warren wouldn t comment repeatedly saying only i haven t seen his ideas trump won michigan by fewer than 11 000 votes in 2016 alongside narrow victories in wisconsin and pennsylvania that handed him the white house however the gop stumbled in the midwest in 2018 as democrats took back the michigan
