aposll ask our sunday panel if the president aposs continued focus on the caravan is the right strategy for republicans plus as the world watches tuesday aposs results secretary of state mike pompeo joins us to discuss crippling new sanctions on iran and whether we can keep doing business with saudi arabia all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again today from fox news headquarters in new york the 2018 midterm campaign has finally reached the end game at stake whether republicans will hold onto control of congress should one or both chambers flip democrats will be able to block much of president trump aposs agenda and launch investigations into his administration but if the gop keeps its majorities in the house and the senate that would buck traditional losses for the president aposs party in the first midterm well then mr trump will be in a more commanding position than ever we begin our coverage of the battle for congress two days out with peter doocy on the campaign trail in hialeah florida peter peter doocy fox news correspondent good morning chris democrats believe they have built the biggest battlefield for the house in a decade and party leaders say it aposs about to pay off begin videotape rep nancy pelosi d calif house minority leader we will win doocy democratic challengers everywhere are sticking to a single focus health care abby finkenauer d ia u s congressional candidate one week to prove we are in iowa that steps up for our neighbors with pre existing conditions doocy vulnerable republicans believe that if there aposs one issue that helps them hold the house it aposs the strong economy rep david young r ia keeping the economy going trade is a big part of that doocy a critical constituency in the battle for the house women rep cathy mcmorris rodgers r wash i do see some falling off among the college educated women doocy president trump is more outwardly optimistic trump it looks like we aposre doing okay in the house we are going to have to see doocy the senate map is tougher for democrats especially the ten depending seats in states trump won sen joe manchin d w va what really comes down to is who do you trust doocy a huge focus for republican senate hopefuls immigration sen ted cruz r texas you mean the people of texas want a wall you mean the people of texas want to stop the caravan doocy president trump has made repeated visits to red states with democratic senators for sizable rallies trump hello montana i said i was coming back and i aposm back doocy rallies some of those democrats are trying to laugh off sen claire mccaskill d mo he aposs been here so often he must be building a golf course end videotape doocy millions of people in places like florida have already voted so republican senate candidate rick scott is out here taking orders and asking for votes before tuesday chris wallace peter doocy reporting from florida peter thanks for that joining me now maryland senator chris van hollen who leads the democrats apos effort to take back control of the senate senator this was always going to be a tough year for democrats you aposre defending 26 seats this year in the midterms while republicans only have nine senate seats up and 10 senate democrats are running in states president trump won in 2016 many by 20 or 30 points so realistically don apost republicans have a better chance of not only holding a majority but adding to it than you do of flipping the senate sen chris van hollen d md democratic senatorial campaign committee chairman well chris you aposre absolutely right this is the toughest political map any one party has faced in 60 years and if you were to have asked people year and a half ago where we would be you would not even be asking the question about whether or not we have a path to a senate democratic majority the answer is we do have a path it is a very narrow path as you indicate but the fact that we are as competitive as we are is a real testament to our senators and our candidates who have always said that their north star is standing up for the people of their state so that aposs the first and foremost priority and that aposs what they aposve been doing wallace all right so give me your two best chances to pick off republican senate seats where are they and in fact isn apost at least one of your democratic senators heitkamp in north dakota isn apost she in trouble van hollen well first of all never count out heidi heitkamp people did that six years ago when she was 10 points behind she won that race she aposs less than ten points behind right now that aposs a lesson everybody has learned don apost her out in terms of the republican seats that are very competitive right now nevada arizona tennessee texas mississippi may go to a special runoff and the reason is that you aposve got republicans running in the states who have betrayed their voters primarily on the issue that is the top of mind for voters on the country which is health care issues and taking away protections for people who have pre existing health conditions wallace president trump is hitting democrats hard in these final days on immigration and the caravan headed up through mexico here he is on the campaign trail begin video clip donald trump president of the united states a democrat victory on election day would be a bright flashing invitation to traffickers smugglers drug dealers and gang members all over the world come on in end video clip wallace and the president ran a controversial ad this week about a mexican who was deported twice came back into this country and then shot and killed two california police officers here aposs a bit of the presidents clip political ad plays wallace senator i aposm sure you don apost like the tone but isn apost it working republicans in red states say immigration is now a top issue van hollen i don apost think it aposs working chris because what the president is doing is driving away the independent voters and swing voters and a lot of moderate republican voters in these swing states look the president says lots of outrageous and untrue things and there aposs another example right there the reality is democrats are for strong border security we aposre against open borders we are also against separating parents and their children and it was pretty outrageous for the president to suggest the other day that the united states military would fire on unarmed people and that the military had to tell the president that aposs not what we do that aposs not what the united states military does but the real thing going on here chris is an effort to change the national conversation from what people wake up every day thinking about which are there economic circumstances and primarily uncertainty over health care costs and the fact that republicans for the last two years have tried to eliminate protections for people with pre existing conditions that remains the top issue on voters apos mind despite all the president aposs efforts wallace well you talk about the economy and then you segue into health care but let aposs talk about the economy because republicans have a have a pretty good story to tell there let aposs put up the numbers 250 000 jobs created in this last jobs report for october unemployment at 3 7 percent wage growth the highest since 2009 isn apost that a strong economic record for republicans to run on van hollen well chris i think voters know that the economy was on this upward trajectory long before president trump was sworn in we saw growing job growth lower unemployment and interestingly when you look at real wages real wage growth was stronger in the last term of the obama administration then in this term so far of the trump administration that aposs because even as wages have gone up so have costs like the cost of health care so for most americans out there they are actually not seeing their real wages keep pace and in fact they were keeping pace at a faster rate under the obama administration that is why people are focused on this issue of health care and the uncertainty that the republican plan to eliminate protections will bring wallace i aposve got 15 seconds left yes or no are you going to take the senate back van hollen we have too many close races chris and you know it aposs all about turnout here aposs what i would say the early vote in states like nevada and arizona has been very strong it does appear young voters are coming out and it looks like the president aposs effort to distract voters from the real issues they care about like health care and like the republican efforts to take away protections for pre existing conditions is not working wallace senator van hollen thank you thanks for taking time from the campaign trail to talk with us sir van hollen good to be with you chris thanks wallace now let aposs turn to north carolina senator thom tillis vice chair of the senate republican campaign effort so senator let me start with you where i ended with van hollen are you going to hold onto the senate on tuesday night if so what aposs your new majority going to be and give me your two best shots and picking off democratic seats sen thom tillis r n c national republican senatorial committee vice chair we aposre not only going to hold a majority i think we aposre going to add to it i believe that states like north dakota indiana missouri are all trending in a positive direction our incumbents are doing very well there may be a special election in mississippi that will take another three weeks to sort out but i aposm also confident that we aposll have a republican coming back in that state the map looks very good to us in about five or six different states and senator van hollen knows that they aposve got a tough call and i think we are going to come out successful on tuesday wallace as i discussed with the senator van hollen president trump this last few weeks has been making immigration and the caravan coming up from mexico his top issue here he was earlier this week talking about a possible confrontation between the migrants and the thousands of soldiers he is sending to the southern border here aposs the president begin video clip trump they want to throw rocks at our military our military fights back we aposre going to consider and i told them consider it a rifle when they throw rocks like they did at the mexico military and police i say consider it a rifle end video clip wallace now the president walked out back on friday saying he was talking about making arrests of the migrants not shooting them but no concerns on your part about the president aposs rhetoric and some of the actions he aposs taking on the southern border potentially turning off independents and moderate republicans tillis well what the american people need to know that our men and women in uniform are some of the most disciplined trained professionals in the history of warfare they aposre going to treat those members of the caravan with respect but the president is right that we have to secure the border and i think that putting troops down there to make it very clear that we want people who have a legitimate claim to asylum to come through the process and get that asylum granted this caravan is not the way to do it and i think the american people are concerned with it you can see the change in the rhetoric on the part of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle from well just let them across the border to now discussing the president aposs tactics i believe that the president is right and doing everything he can to stop the illegal crossings wallace senator republicans have a great story to tell in the economy but the president doesn apost seem especially focused on that here he is at a rally on friday begin video clip trump we have the greatest economy in the history of our country but sometimes that aposs not as exciting to talk about the economy right end video clip wallace in reaction a top aide to republicans speaker paul ryan tweeted this almost plaintively we are going to spend all day and weekend talking about the strong economy right and republican congressman ryan costello who aposs retiring accuses the president of political malpractice question are you sure that focusing on immigration over the economy is really the right strategy the best strategy for republicans tillis well i think people are taking 30 second sound bites i was at a rally here in charlotte a week ago and the president spent a good portion of his speech talking about 7 million jobs created one of the strongest and fastest growing economies we aposve seen in decades record unemployment for african american community for the hispanic community he aposs spending a lot of his time on that but when you have to boil it down to 15 or 30 sound bites they aposre going to pick the piece that seems like he is not talking about that let me tell you about something else he also spends a lot of time on the stump talking about how we have to protect pre existing conditions and it aposs a false narrative for democrats to come in and say if you like republicans we are going to take that away we are doing everything we can including myself i filed a bill to make sure that we protect pre existing conditions if people look at the totality of an hour hour and 15 minute long speech you aposre going to see the president spent the bulk of the time talking about reduce regulations increase jobs reduce unemployment better stature against nato taking north korea and taking china to task on their bad behaviors all that comes out in his speech wallace well you have taken us directly in the direction i wanted to go which is health care which democrats are making their top issue and here is former president obama on the campaign trail this week begin video clip barack obama former president when i was president republicans voted more than a dozen times to get rid of protections for people with pre existing conditions last year they fell one vote short one vote if they win back this tuesday they will finally succeed end video clip wallace senator the fact is that the repeal and replace bill with republicans pushed repeatedly significantly reduced protections for people with pre existing conditions tillis well chris that aposs actually one of the reasons why i think it was a courageous vote the first thing we have to do is take out the underpinnings of the affordable care act so that we can put a health care policy in place that aposs sustainable what senator van hollen failed to mention about rising premiums over the past few years is that we aposve significantly reduced the rate of growth and one of the reasons why that growth has spiraled over the years because of the affordable care act we want to replace the affordable care act with a program that will work that will provide people who have pre existing conditions with health care that will allow young adults under the age of 26 to be on their parents health care policies but something that will work because if we continue down this path we aposre going to have a health care crisis not only among those who are serviced by the affordable care act but the broader health care market in this country is headed for disaster if we don apost recognize we aposve got to fix it wallace but senator and i aposve only got about 30 seconds here i don apost want to get too deeply in the weeds but repeal and replace bill would have allowed states to get waivers for obamacare and take people with pre existing conditions and put them in risk pools where they would have to pay a higher premium and your bill yes it says we are going to cover everybody with pre existing conditions but we aposre not necessarily going to cover the condition that they have that aposs pre existing so yes we aposll cover people who have cancer but we won apost necessarily their insurance won apost cover cancer treatment tillis even even if some states opted not to cover not covering the way we would want them to i think they would get unelected very quickly this is a very popular policy with the american people which is exactly where the democrats are trying to create this false narrative that people in washington and the statehouses want to take it away i simply don apost see any path either on the basis of good policy or good politics so people with pre existing conditions are going to get covered and our republican majority that we aposre going to secure next week is going to work to that end wallace senator tillis thank you thanks for your time tillis thank you chris wallace and we aposll be following how the world turns on tuesday night tillis it aposll be a great night wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the battle for control of the congress with just two days to go plus what would you like to ask the panel about president trump aposs efforts to fire up his base just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip trump we aposre the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the united states for 85 years with all of those benefits we have about 5 008 we will go up anywhere between ten and 15 000 military personnel on top of border patrol ice and everybody else at the border end video clip wallace president trump upping the ante for how he aposll stop that migrant caravan coming from mexico talking about sending more troops to the border changing asylum laws and even ending birthright citizenship and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams co host of henson and harf on fox news radio marie harf and gop strategist karl rove well karl let me start with you is immigration the best issue for this president to be pushing in the midterms to try to hold onto control of both the senate and the house karl rove former bush white house adviser well on friday gallup found that 80 percent of the american people thought the economy was extremely important excuse me health care and 78 percent found that the economy and immigration were extremely important so these three issues are all sort of stuck right there immigration helps only if the democrats screw it up for example sinema in arizona and mccaskill in missouri both support the president sending troops to the border on the other hand in tennessee i saw a poll in tennessee 62 percent of tennesseans are concerned about it 27 percent are not bredesen the democratic nominee said this is not a problem and he thereby created a problem for himself in texas ted cruz is beating up robert francis o aposrourke over the issue wallace i love it he keeps saying robert francis o aposrourke because you hate to say beto o aposrourke rove no it aposs beto beto wallace ok rove beto o aposrourke i aposll say as you like i aposll use wallace i kind of like it it aposs nice rove so rafael cruz is beating up robert francis o aposrourke on the issue of immigration because o aposrourke refuses to say that he opposes those caravans coming across the border and apparently his campaign provided financial support to the caravan which may be in violation of u s law but anyway where the democrats screw it up it aposs a problem for em wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from mike peterson why aren apost republicans driving home the message on the economy brit hume fox news senior political analyst i aposll tell you why wallace pardon hume i aposll tell you why wallace well i was going to ask marie but you can definitely marie harf former state department spokesperson go for it wallace you know what go ahead harf yes hume anger disappointment outrage are much more powerful vote motivators than satisfaction people are no doubt satisfied with the economy unless you can scare them successfully into believing that all the good things that have happened in the economy will be taken away if your opponent wins you may well be better off trying to motivate voters by talking about something that they aposre angry about wallace do you agree with that i mean we always hear peace and prosperity clinton apos92 it aposs the economy stupid i guess i aposm just surprised and yes the president does mention it harf yes wallace the focus on immigration to the exclusion to some degree of the economy harf well i think it aposs an open question whether the trump 2016 playbook that he aposs now sort of using us as his closing argument will actually work when he aposs not on the ballot when there aposs a lot of independents and women who have had two years to get really angry about his rhetoric and when he doesn apost have hillary as a foil i think that this closing argument based on immigration chris will may help them keep a narrow set of senate seats but i think it definitely hurts when you aposre talking about the house when you aposre talking about the swing districts and let aposs not forget the tax cuts are still not pulling very well many people in states and districts that the republicans need to keep the tax cuts are popular the tariffs are popular so i don apost know whether the closing argument that trump is using will work if it does it will be in a narrow set of places and i do not think it will keep the house for the republicans i actually think it will help deliver the house to the democrats wallace the first midterm election after a new president is historically tough for the party of the new president let aposs put up some numbers since world war ii the president aposs party loses an average of 28 seats in the house in the first midterm and between two and three seats in the senate juan how do you think president trump is doing in trying to break that historic tradition juan williams fox news political analyst well i think the one advantage she has is that he has had an unerring base here and that base is about 40 percent of the vote people who approve of his presidency and when it comes to republicans he aposs up to 80 to 90 percent of republicans backing from i think it aposs become the party of trump so what he aposs done chris in this cycle and you can look at this travel itinerary over the last few days you can see he aposs going to red states and he aposs trying to excite red from voters and that aposs where the immigration method comes in that aposs where he thinks that message has tremendous impact it does not as marie was saying have tremendous impact though with a lot of the white female voters especially in the suburban areas that are so critical in terms of the house races i think you will see a difference there and on a larger scale i think if you look at the advertising over the last few days almost none of it has to do with the economy which is kind of shocking because as you pointed out the economy is doing fairly well why wouldn apost republicans be running on it instead you see the republican senate and house candidates actually following the president aposs lead and going with the immigration red meat culture war issue and again it might work with the base but it doesn apost work with independents wallace let me just say the one person in this panel who has actually helped elect a president and did it twice is shaking his head i want to ask you this specific question though because this is the conventional wisdom out there it aposs going to help in red states electing republican senators it aposs going to hurt in the house races especially in suburban districts with better educated people and with suburban women true or false rove false again it matters how it gets handled is it going to help in some congressional districts yes the president is going to west virginia three which is a battleground district it aposs going to help there is he going to illinois six peter roskam no but peter roskam wants to make the final issue the economy and his stewardship of the economy his stewardship what he has done as a congressman to make a good economy i think the white house has been very adroit and how it aposs deployed the president as it comes down to the final stages here let aposs be clear no campaign this is not a campaign in these individual states dominated by the issues i aposm not seeing candidates in nevada or arizona or missouri or north dakota or indiana running one kind of ad they are running different kinds of ads that appeal to their individual states and they tend to be more about the economy and judges than they tend to be crosstalk williams what you see is the ad the democrats are running are consistent in terms of message discipline on health care the president can apost even go to arizona can apost go to nevada rove he aposs been to both states williams no but he aposs not going there i aposm talking about now the spreads crosstalk wallace wait gentlemen i aposve got about a minute left here and i want to ask the guru one more question early voting we are seeing these historically high numbers as of friday 28 million people had voted early question is it that people are more enthused and intense is it just because there aposs more early voting and more opportunity than there used to be and to the degree and you can apost get me into the weeds here because i aposve got a minute left no but here is it showing a trend rove yes bigger almost everywhere thirty seven states voted early and it is we are going to have the biggest turn out in midterms since 1966 and it aposs roughly between like in arizona 53 percent of the 2016 turnout florida 68 percent of the turnout wallace so what aposs the reason and who aposs it helping rove well part of it is it is getting to be easier and people are falling into the habit but the main driver is people are wildly enthusiastic about coming out and voting and republicans are doing surprisingly well in arizona a 7 9 percent advantage of the turnout in a state that they won last time around by three and a half points florida a 2 8 percent swing towards republicans and early voting in a state they won by 1 2 percent nevada a 1 85 percent swing to republicans in a state they lost by 2 45 last time around wallace i am so glad we did not get into the weeds but that was great and it aposs very interesting because you always wonder one last quick question is this people voting who would have voted on election day anyway and they are just transferring or is this new voters rove we don apost know but in some places there is evidence that it is episodic that there are episodic midterm voters and my sense is if you got this big in the early voting we aposre going to see a lot of people who tend not to vote in midterms show up wallace ok we have to take a little break here we aposll see you all a little later up next the white house is re imposing sanctions on iran as it pulls out of the nuclear deal but some hardliners say president trump is not being tough enough on tehran we aposll talk live with the secretary of state mike pompeo next commercial break wallace coming up the trump administration re imposes economic sanctions on iran lifted by president obama as part of the nuclear deal begin video clip donald trump president of the united states we now have in place that toughest ever sanctions on a corrupt regime in iran end video clip wallace we aposll ask secretary of state mike pompeo what it means for u s relations in the region next commercial break wallace the trump administration has announced the remaining sanctions that were lifted as part of a 2015 iran nuclear deal will be re imposed on monday one day before the midterms president trump drove home the point friday when he tweeted this photo with the word sanctions are coming a nod to game of thrones joining me now live from the state department secretary of state mike pompeo mr secretary welcome back to fox news sunday mike pompeo secretary of state good morning chris great to be with you today wallace your re imposing as we said all u s sanctions on iran but you aposre giving exemptions to eight countries to allow them to keep buying oil from tehran question why pompeo well chris the sanctions that will be re imposed tomorrow are the toughest sanctions ever put in place on the islamic republic of iran they aposre aimed at a singular purpose denying the world aposs largest state sponsor of terrorists the capacity to do things like they did this past couple weeks attempted assassination campaign in the heart of europe these sanctions have already had an enormous impact we aposve already reduced iranian crude oil experts by over a million barrels per day that number will fall farther there aposs a handful of places were countries that have that have already made significant reductions in their crude oil exports need a little bit more time to get to zero and we aposre going to provide that to them wallace is it true that your giving exemptions to two of iran aposs biggest customers namely india and china and do you have a firm commitment that within six months they will stop all oil purchases because there are a lot of experts who believe that india and china are never going to stop buying oil from iran pompeo there are a lot of experts chris that said president trump aposs policy wouldn apost have any impact because it was just the united states and other countries weren apost participating and in fact we have built an enormous coalition to keep this world safe and to deny iran money i am very confident that the sanctions that will be re imposed this monday not only the crude oil sanctions that the financial sanctions that are being put in place by the treasury department and over 600 designations of individuals and companies in iran will have the intended effect to alter the iranian regime aposs behavior that aposs our expectation it aposs the reason for president trump aposs policy wallace but specifically sir do you have a firm commitment from india and china that they will stop all oil purchases from iran in six months pompeo chris watch what we do watch as we aposve already taken more crude oil off the market than any time in previous history watch the efforts that president trump aposs policies have achieved we aposve done all of this too chris while making sure that american consumers don apost suffer we aposve bot brent crude at about the same price it was back in may when the president announced the withdrawal from the jcpoa that aposs important for american consumers and the march to zero continues wallace you aposre talking about how effective these re imposition of sanctions are but as you well know there are some people who are criticizing the sanctions you aposre re imposing and saying they aposre not tough enough and let me put this up on the screen republican senators republican senators cruz cotton and rubio plan to introduce legislation to cut off iranian banks from the global financial network known as swift and a group called united against nuclear iran tweeted this about your sanctions whatever happened to maximum pressure they caved big time mr secretary your response pompeo chris the president aposs policy of maximum pressure will be fully in place come tomorrow watch the iranians that aposs who really understands the importance and the impact of the effort that we aposre undertaking the rial has fallen to 140 000 rial to the dollar and has had an enormous impact already and we are working diligently to make sure we support the iranian people and that we direct our activity towards ensuring that the islamic republic of iran aposs maligned behavior is changed that aposs the goal that aposs the mission and that aposs what we will achieve on behalf of the president wallace but but how do you respond for instance to the senators were are saying look we should have cut them off from swift which is this big financial clearinghouse pompeo yes chris chris chris chris the the iranian banks that engage in sanctionable behavior will be sanctioned by the department of treasury period full stop wallace i i understand what you aposre saying on the other hand you aposve got pompeo well good that aposs great chris wallace well if i if i may sir you aposve got senator cotton senator cruz senator rubio they aposre they aposre pretty knowledgeable on the subject they aposre not persuaded pompeo chris i worked with senator cotton we are the two individuals that discovered the side deals now almost three years ago to the jcpoa these secret side deals i aposve been at this a long time no one aposs going to argue that secretary pompeo isn apost tough on iran and no one is going to argue that president trump isn apost doing the same wallace meanwhile let aposs turn to another one of your hot spots you aposre dealing with north korea is now threatening to resume its nuclear buildup because they say that the u s has not matched them in offering concessions in this case lifting economic sanctions they say that they aposve made concessions and the trump administration has not followed suit pompeo chris i aposll be meeting this week in new york city with my counterpart kim yong chol we aposll have a good opportunity to continue the denuclearization discussions that were set out just a few months back it seems like a long time ago in news world but it was just this past june when president trump and chairman kim met and set us on the path that we aposre on today we haven apost had any missile tests there have been no nuclear test we aposve had the returns of american remains these are all good steps we aposre continuing to negotiate with the north koreans to achieve what president trump set out the full denuclearization verified by the united states of the korean peninsula and then a brighter future for the north korean people wallace but but to follow up specifically how what aposs your reaction to the foreign ministry of north korea saying threatening that they are going to resume nuclear activity what one your reaction to that and two is there any possibility that to get them to stop that that the u s will change its policy and start offering concessions on a kind of tit for tat basis a phased effort by both countries pompeo chris i aposm not worried about rhetoric we aposve seen this as we go through negotiations stray voltage happens to be all around us we aposre very focused we know with whom we aposre negotiating we know what their positions are and president trump aposs made his position very clear no economic relief until we have achieved our ultimate objective wallace let aposs turn to saudi arabia you met with saudi crown prince muhammad bin salman about three weeks ago about the death of jamal khashoggi and here aposs what you said after your meeting with the crown prince begin video clip pompeo he told me they were going to conduct a thorough complete transparent investigation they made a commitment too to hold anyone connected to any wrongdoing that may be found accountable for that whether they are a senior officer or official end video clip wallace but since then i don apost have to tell you the saudi story has kept changing do you now think that the saudi crown prince lied both to you and to president trump with what he told you back then based on all the evidence that you have gotten sense including the tapes that cia director gina haspel has heard do you now believe that this was a premeditated hit by the saudi royal family against khashoggi pompeo well chris the saudis have acknowledged that this was a premeditated attack the facts that we aposre finding still are unfolding we aposre still working diligently on that we talk with folks from turkey from saudi arabia nearly every day to continue those efforts we aposve begun to hold some officials accountable we aposve revoked visas from 16 individuals that we have been able to identify so far that were in fact connected to that we aposll continue to do that and as i said that day when i return we will hold all of those responsible for the murder of jamal khashoggi accountable and we will do that chris at the same time while ensuring that the strategic relationship between the united states and the kingdom of saudi arabia one that has a great impact on the issue we just spoke about the capacity to deny the world aposs largest state sponsor of terror the ability to threaten america and israel we will continue to work to maintain that important strategic relationship while holding accountable those responsible for this atrocious death wallace meanwhile you and defense secretary mattis this week called for negotiations and a cease fire within 30 days between the u s backed saudi forces and the rebels that are fighting in a in a war inside yemen there are reports that up to 16 000 yemeni civilians have been killed in this conflict and that around 14 million yemenis are now on the brink if not already in famine conditions two questions first of all are you comfortable with the role that the u s has played in backing saudi arabia in this effort in yemen and secondly if the humanitarian crisis is so urgent why allow this to continue for another month sir pompeo chris we we did make a statement this week secretary mattis and i frankly it aposs nothing new we have been urging all the parties to come to the table and recognize that that there aposs no military victory that could be achieved in yemen we aposve asked the iranians to do that too chris much of the harm that aposs taking place there comes from the fact that the iranians continue to supply weapons and missiles to the houthi rebels that are fighting there in saudi arabia they are responsible for the starvation in yemen as well we want all the parties under martin griffiths of the u n to come to the table negotiate a solution that ends the very difficult tragic situation that aposs taking place in yemen today wallace secretary pompeo thank you thanks for your time pompeo thank you chris wallace it aposs always good to talk with you sir pompeo thank you sir have a good day wallace when we come back where are we on making nuclear deals with iran and north korea we aposll ask our sunday group when they return next commercial break begin video clip trump sanctions start on iran they aposre very serious sanctions they aposre very big they aposll be elevated from there but as you know sanctions are starting on iran and you know iran is taking a very big hit end video clip wallace president trump determined to bring iran to its knees and to negotiate a tougher nuclear deal than the obama administration did in 2015 and we aposre back now with the panel well marie you worked hard as a spokesperson for john kerry to try to make that deal with iran in 2015 now president trump and let aposs put it up on the screen has tweeted out this in game of thrones style sanctions are coming your reaction to the tweet and to the policy marie harf fox news analyst well sanctions are a very useful tool they aposre not a joke and i i obviously don apost like this sort of diplo tainment ph that the president seems to engage in with many countries i don apost like the tweet but setting the tweet aside these are not the toughest sanctions ever imposed on iran because the united nations and the security council will not re impose sanctions these are only u s unilateral sanctions because they do not like the president aposs rhetoric and they haven apost seen that he has a concrete plan in place to actually have negotiations to get a better deal the rest of the world does not support the president so u s unilateral sanctions can only do so much and we heard secretary pompeo could not say that china and india had committed to reducing their oil i think the president is very good at tearing up international agreements whether it aposs iran or paris or the tpp but he has not shown yet that he can actually undertake serious negotiations to rebuild them and that aposs what the rest of the world doesn apost support him right now wallace brit brit hume fox news senior political analyst it isn apost really quite necessary for the rest of the world to like the policy the rest of the world is confronted with a choice they can continue to do business as they have with the united states or they can continue to do business with iran for most countries that aposs a very easy choice even if you don apost like it the united states is by far the big the big dog on the on the scene here and if you choose not to do business with the united states and with its banking system and the rest of it your economy is going to suffer and iran aposs of course is suffering terribly wallace but but some but some european countries are all saying somehow they aposre going to be able to do both that they aposre going to carve out some kind of special financial channel so that yes they can do business with the u s but yes they can also continue because they support the iran nuclear deal hume they may they may say that let aposs see them do it i didn apost used to believe this chris i used to think that the united states without the international cooperation and a united front could not effectively damage a country aposs economy through sanctions i think i was wrong about that i think they can and i and i give president trump and his team credit for understanding that we are by far the big kid on the block wallace juan the iran nuclear deal i think we would all agree even marie and her former boss john kerry was far from perfect it allowed iran after a number of years to resume its program it didn apost stop iran from pursuing and banking terrorism around the world but at the same time that we have pulled out of that agreement as imperfect as it is we are struggling to get any agreement with north korea juan williams fox news political analyst well i think that aposs the big point of contrast chris is that we had a deal with iran as imperfect as you describe it but one which stopped them for developing nukes they were of course still sponsoring terrorism as you point out but stopped them from developing nukes we cannot get the same deal so far with the north koreans and i think this is a point of great concern because the criticism of president trump is that he has no real foreign policy expertise no experience and that saber rattling bombastic talks game of thrones tweets do nothing but harden the hardliners strengthening the hardliners inside iran while weakening the moderate revolutionary forces that we need to engage wallace karl i want you i aposm going to give you a two for you can respond to juan i also want you to talk about saudi arabia because it is clear now that saudi arabia and the crown prince have clearly lied to us about their involvement and premeditation in killing jamal khashoggi the president though feels that our relationship and you could hear secretary pompeo say it our relationship with the saudis is too valuable to simply cut off is he right karl rove fox news contributor well first let me deal with iran look whether it aposs deliberate or not the administration has stumbled into a very good policy the iranian currency has lost two thirds of its value there aposs a deep divide between european companies in the european union with with a major company saying we aposre not doing business in iran part of that is because of the administration aposs sanctions part of it is because once they got in there they found that it is a command and control economy in which the bureaucrats are making bad decisions where resources are being diverted to the revolutionary guard and where there are some structural weaknesses in the economy that make it a very unattractive market as brit said they aposd rather do business with us than with a stumbling third world country that aposs going down down down down down so i you know i thought frankly exempting the major countries there aposs a youthful ambiguity to it what did the administration want to do it wanted to damage the iranian economy not the world economy it didn apost want to have a spike in global energy prices that would hurt the u s and advantage russia and so they aposre doing it i think reasonably adeptly wallace ok and how about the way we aposre balancing our interests in saudi arabia rove well look again i think they aposre they aposre they are in the middle of a very difficult situation and managing it adequately but let aposs not let aposs not be kid ourselves the lead the new leader of saudi arabia i think has damaged himself on the world stage sure we have 16 people that they aposve now identified as having been involved in this atrocious horrendous murder and yet who believes that at the end of the day mohammad bin salam was not involved in this decision how we how saudi arabia maintains its place on the world stage with a leader who is so damaged and whose credibility is so undermined is beyond me williams but karl you say manage adequately that the united states the trump administration is managing this adequately rove i think they are doing an excellent job on it frankly look look williams karl i think we have a standard our values you and i obviously disagree on so much politically we don apost disagree about killing people wallace just just disagree on it very quickly because you aposve got ten seconds rove well look look the question i agree this do you blow up the entire relationship over this or do you try and manage this so that you maintain a relationship while williams karl we have to stand for what we believe in as americans rove let me finish wallace no no rove let me finish by standing for those values wallace you know what let aposs continue this in the commercial thank you panel see you next sunday up next big names go door to door looking for votes on the trail commercial break wallace as one of the most intense midterm elections ever reaches the end game both sides are desperate for any advantage president
