to enjoy all the benefits of our website the us assassination of iranian general qasem soleimani has lit atinderbox in the middle east until wounded pride is replaced by soberstrategy in washington and tehran the world is braced for further conflict the confrontation between the united states and iran presents itself as a study in escalation both countries are trapped in a pattern of action and reaction far removed from the issues that define the current state of affairs in the middle east according to this narrative a tat is bound to be promptly followed by a tit each strike more severe than the one before the expectation is now one of punch and counterpunch eventually leading to all out war unless one side accepts a loss of face and withdraws for both the us and iran war is an absurd proposition there are limits to the damage that iran can inflict on the us and the us could not cope with an occupation of iran but the respective foreign policy regimes in washington and tehran combined with the heightened invectives of their respective leaderships means that any war would be the result of pride detached from strategic calculus and a fear of weakness taking precedence over the pursuit of interests the fear of being perceived as weak has become a central preoccupation for the white house yet while donald trump s twitter feed is a cascade of military threats and hard talk in practice he has usually shown restraint despite the iranians shooting down an american drone over the strait of hormuz in june 2019 and allegedly attacking a saudi aramco oil facility later that year trump refused to authorise retaliatory airstrikes so tepid was his response that tehran was emboldened they saw trump as something of a paper tiger big on boasts but short on action this perception may help explain why iran underestimated the risks associated with the latest outbreak of violence this began in late december 2019 when a rocket attack apparently launched by the iranian backed hezbollah militia on a us airbase in iraq killed one american contractor and injured four us service personnel the us responded by bombing bases in iraq and syria killing 25 pro iranian militia fighters whose supporters then staged a mob attack on the us embassy in baghdad trump responded on twitter warning that iran would pay a very big price for any lives lost or damage incurred at any of our facilities the iranian supreme leader ayatollah khamenei replied with his own tweet taunting trump you can t do anything this was followed on 3 january 2020 by the drone strike against qasem soleimani and abu mahdi al muhandis an iraqi politician and military commander at baghdad airport the assassination of soleimani represents an especially perilous action on the part of the us the 62 year old general who was head of the elite quds force of iran s revolutionary guard corps is widely considered to have been the most powerful figure in iran after khamenei and one of the most significant operatives transforming the middle east as the man spearheading iran s expanding influence across the region overseeing its proxy forces from lebanon to iraq as well as its global clandestine operations soleimani stood at the heart of the country s hegemonic aspirations khameneipromised a forceful revenge while trump threatened to blow up 52 targets including cultural sites in iran referring to the number of diplomatic hostages seized by the iranians in 1979 at the american embassy in tehran in an interview with cnn hossein dehghan khamenei s military adviser then threatened that no american military staff no american political centre no american military base no american vessel will be safe iran s choice of response was not simple they had justbeen given lesson in how much the americans know about the plans and movements of their leadership including those of its top spymaster as well as the dangers of complacency and lax security it is possible that by being so brazen in his movements soleimani had started to believe his own myth of invulnerability if a big counter attack by iran was now foiled that would double their sense of humiliation they also had to assess how prepared they really were for large scale american retaliation a more restrained or less bloody response such as a cyber attack or an operation conducted well away from the middle east by hard to trace iranian agents or a strike against us allied assets in the region that leaves american personnel unharmed would be sufficiently ambiguous to complicate american plans for a response in the end they went to the modest end of the scale a missile strike as promised directed against american personnel and materiel at two us bases in iraq which in the end caused minimal damage the iranians must now hope that trump will refrain from a devastating response there are also obvious advantages in keeping the americans guessing the assassination of soleimani was not part of any broader strategy and so there were no plans in place to follow it up or to deal with the fallout no prior preparations had been made to tackle iranian anger so us forces across the middle east have had little choice but to hunker down and wait on iran s response unsure of when and where a counter attack may come us led forces fighting islamic state is have had to suspend operations while they concentrate on protecting themselves against iranian reprisals the iraqi government is currently drawing up a timetable for american forces to depart the country after parliament voted for their expulsion although when tempers subside it may try to retain us on ground support as a counter weight to iran and to help the fight against is but the killing of the is leader abu bakr al baghdadi in october 2019 will look less impressive should is now have the opportunity to regroup in iraq trump wanted to use the defeat of is to extract us forces from the region but now he must insist that they stay because it will look weak to be pushed out googletag cmd push function googletag display 1x3 another major consequence of soleimani s death is that iran no longer considers itself fully bound by the nuclear deal negotiated by president obama and his european allies in 2015 the iranian regime may now expand uranium enrichment even if it has not abandoned the deal altogether or suspended inspection provisions given that the whole sorry sequence of events began in may 2018 when trump decided to abandon the deal to get a better one this is a dangerous move iranians will see recent events as strengthening the case for their own nuclear weapons in order to lift the economic sanctions trump reimposed on iran in 2018 it was required not only to reinforce existing commitments to abandon its nuclear programme but to end support for its proxies including hezbollah in lebanon hamas in gaza shia militias in iraq houthi rebels in yemen and the taliban in afghanistan all forces under iran s command were to withdraw from syria and threats to saudi arabia the uae and israel were to cease in short it was a demand to undo soleimani s life work and a warning that the iranian economy would be severely weakened until this was done iran would not accede to these demands yet the economic coercion was effective aggravated by iran s internal corruption and mismanagement despite soleimani s best efforts the regime came under pressure as last year thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the deteriorating standards of living throughout the middle east including in iraq and lebanon similar popular uprisings also challenged iranian sponsored brutality many of those who are engaged in these protests will be thrilled to see the back of soleimani and hope that without his talents tehran will struggle to impose its will in the future for the moment however the dominant mood in iran and iraq is anti americanism even washington s staunchest allies in the region and those who once cheer led trump s iran policy are calling for restraint and de escalation saudi arabia is actively looking for ways to mediate between iran and the us and israel is keeping its distance describing the assassination of soleimani as part of a purely us iranian fight in europe britain france and germany which were given no prior warning of the american strike on soleimani have refused to renounce the nuclear deal as the trump administration prepares for whatever comes next it does so without the enthusiastic support of allies they have lost confidence in trump s judgement as he impulsively lurches from passivity to belligerence us allies in europe will be relieved that trump has taken the opportunity to avoid further escalation despite iran mounting an attack that would in other circumstances be considered a major provocation european states will also have noted washington s request to harden their stance against iran and join the us in abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal so whole both the us and iran have demonstrated that mindless escalation can be halted and even reversed the bad news is that nothing has been settled politically there has certainly been no de escalation in policy or rhetoric it would be optimistic to imagine this process being thrown into reverse in the near future by some imaginative diplomacy but it would help for the moment if policy could be driven in both tehran and washington by sober reflection rather than wounded pride lawrence freedman is emeritus professor of war studies at king s college

britain france and germany which were given no prior warning of the american strike on soleimani have refused to renounce the nuclear deal as the trump administration prepares for whatever comes next it does so without the enthusiastic support of allies they have lost confidence in trump s judgement as he impulsively lurches from passivity to belligerence us allies in europe will be relieved that trump has taken the opportunity to avoid further escalation despite iran mounting an attack that would in other circumstances be considered a major provocation european states will also have noted washington s request to harden their stance against iran and join the us in abandoning the 2015 nuclear deal so whole both the us and iran have demonstrated that mindless escalation can be halted and even reversed the bad news is that nothing has been settled politically there has certainly been no de escalation in policy or rhetoric it would be optimistic to imagine this process being thrown into reverse in the near future by some imaginative diplomacy but it would help for the moment if policy could be driven in both tehran and washington by sober reflection rather than wounded pride lawrence freedman is emeritus professor of war studies at king s college london the assassination of soleimani represents an especially perilous action on the part of the us the 62 year old general who was head of the elite quds force of iran s revolutionary guard corps is widely considered to have been the most powerful figure in iran after khamenei and one of the most significant operatives transforming the middle east as the man spearheading iran s expanding influence across the region overseeing its proxy forces from lebanon to iraq as well as its global clandestine operations soleimani stood at the heart of the country s hegemonic aspirations khameneipromised a forceful revenge while trump threatened to blow up 52 targets including cultural sites in iran referring to the number of diplomatic hostages seized by the iranians in 1979 at the american embassy in tehran in an interview with cnn hossein dehghan khamenei s military adviser then threatened that no american military staff no american political centre no american military base no american vessel will be safe iran s choice of response was not simple they had justbeen given lesson in how much the americans know about the plans and movements of their leadership including those of its top spymaster as well as the dangers of complacency and lax security it is possible that by being so brazen in his movements soleimani had started to believe his own myth of invulnerability if a big counter attack by iran was now foiled that would double their sense of humiliation they also had to assess how prepared they really were for large scale american retaliation a more restrained or less bloody response such as a cyber attack or an operation conducted well away from the middle east by hard to trace iranian agents or a strike against us allied assets in the region that leaves american personnel unharmed would be sufficiently ambiguous to complicate american plans for a response in the end they went to the modest end of the scale a missile strike as promised directed against american personnel and materiel at two us bases in iraq which in the end caused minimal damage the iranians must now hope that trump will refrain from a devastating response there are also obvious advantages in keeping the americans guessing the assassination of soleimani was not part of any broader strategy and so there were no plans in place to follow it up or to deal with the fallout no prior preparations had been made to tackle iranian anger so us forces across the middle east have had little choice but to hunker down and wait on iran s response unsure of when and where a counter attack may come us led forces fighting islamic state is have had to suspend operations while they concentrate on protecting themselves against iranian reprisals the iraqi government is currently drawing up a timetable for american forces to depart the country after parliament voted for their expulsion although when tempers subside it may try to retain us on ground support as a counter weight to iran and to help the fight against is but the killing of the is leader abu bakr al baghdadi in october 2019 will look less impressive should is now have the opportunity to regroup in iraq trump wanted to use the defeat of is to extract us forces from the region but now he must insist that they stay because it will look weak to be pushed out googletag cmd push function googletag display 1x3 another major consequence of soleimani s death is that iran no longer considers itself fully bound by the nuclear deal negotiated by president obama and his european allies in 2015 the iranian regime may now expand uranium enrichment even if it has not abandoned the deal altogether or suspended inspection provisions given that the whole sorry sequence of events began in may 2018 when trump decided to abandon the deal to get a better one this is a dangerous move iranians will see recent events as strengthening the case for their own nuclear weapons in order to lift the economic sanctions trump reimposed on iran in 2018 it was required not only to reinforce existing commitments to abandon its nuclear programme but to end support for its proxies including hezbollah in lebanon hamas in gaza shia militias in iraq houthi rebels in yemen and the taliban in afghanistan all forces under iran s command were to withdraw from syria and threats to saudi arabia the uae and israel were to cease in short it was a demand to undo soleimani s life work and a warning that the iranian economy would be severely weakened until this was done iran would not accede to these demands yet the economic coercion was effective aggravated by iran s internal corruption and mismanagement despite soleimani s best efforts the regime came under pressure as last year thousands of people took to the streets to protest against the deteriorating standards of living throughout the middle east including in iraq and lebanon similar popular uprisings also challenged iranian sponsored brutality many of those who are engaged in these protests will be thrilled to see the back of soleimani and hope that without his talents
