apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap democratic house speaker nancy pelosi invited president donald trump to testify in front of investigators in the house impeachment inquiry ahead of a week that will see several key witnesses appear publicly pushing back against accusations from the president that the process has been stacked against him pelosi said trump is welcome to appear or answer questions in writing if he chooses if he has information that is exculpatory that means ex taking away culpable blame then we look forward to seeing it she said in an interview that aired sunday on cbs s face the nation trump could come right before the committee and talk speak all the truth that he wants if he wants she said top stories sex at birth hungary bans people from

senate democratic leader chuck schumer echoed that suggestion if donald trump doesn t agree with what he s hearing doesn t like what he s hearing he shouldn t tweet he should come to the committee and testify under oath and he should allow all those around him to come to the committee and testify under oath schumer told reporters he said the white house s insistence on blocking witnesses from cooperating begs the question what is he hiding the comments come as the house intelligence committee prepares for a second week of public hearings as part of its inquiry including with the man who is arguably the most important witness gordon sondland trump s ambassador to the european union is among the only people interviewed to date who had direct conversations with the president about the situation because the white house has blocked others from cooperating with what they dismiss as a sham investigation and testimony suggests he was intimately involved in discussions that are at the heart of the investigation into whether trump held up u s military aid to ukraine to try to pressure the county s president to announce an investigation into democrats including former vice president joe biden a leading 2020 candidate and his son hunter multiple witnesses overheard a phone call in which trump and sondland reportedly discussed efforts to push for the investigations in private testimony to impeachment investigators made public saturday tim morrison a former national security council aide and longtime republican defense hawk said sondland told him he was discussing ukraine matters directly with trump morrison said sondland and trump had spoken approximately five times between july 15 and sept 11 the weeks that 391 million in u s assistance was withheld from ukraine before it was released and he recounted that sondland told a top ukrainian official in a meeting that the vital u s military assistance might be freed up if the country s top prosecutor would go to the mike and announce that he was opening the burisma investigation burisma is the gas company that hired hunter biden morrison s testimony contradicted much of what sondland told congressional investigators during his own closed door deposition which the ambassador later amended trump has said he has no recollection of the overheard call and has suggested he barely knew sondland a wealthy donor to his 2016 campaign but democrats are hoping he sheds new light on the discussions i m not going to try to prejudge his testimony rep jim himes d conn said on fox news sunday but he suggested it was not lost on ambassador sondland what happened to the president s close associate roger stone for lying to congress to michael cohen for lying to congress my guess is that ambassador sondland is going to do his level best to tell the truth because otherwise he may have a very unpleasant legal future in front of him the committee will also be interviewing a long list of others on tuesday they ll hear from morrison along with jennifer williams an aide to vice president mike pence alexander vindman the director for european affairs at the national security council and kurt volker the former u s special envoy to ukraine on wednesday the committee will hear from sondland in addition to laura cooper a deputy assistant secretary of defense and david hale a state department official and on thursday fiona hill a former top nsc staffer for europe and russia will appear trump meanwhile continued to tweet and retweet a steady stream of commentary from supporters as he bashed the crazed do nothing democrats for turning impeachment into a routine partisan weapon that is very bad for our country and not what the founders had in mind he wrote he also tweeted a doctored video exchange between rep adam schiff the democratic chairman of the intelligence committee and republican rep jim jordan in which schiff said he did not know the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint triggered the inquiry the clip has been altered to show schiff wearing a referee s uniform and loudly blowing a whistle in her cbs interview pelosi vowed to protect the whistleblower whom trump has said should be forced to come forward despite longstanding whistleblower protections i will make sure he does not intimidate the whistleblower pelosi said trump has been under fire for his treatment of one of the witnesses the former ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch whom trump criticized by tweet as she was testifying last week that attack prompted accusations of witness intimidation from democrats and even some criticism from republicans who have been largely united in their defense of trump i think along with most people i find the president s tweet generally unfortunate said ohio republican rep mike turner on cnn s state of the union still he insisted that tweets were certainly not impeachable and it s certainly not criminal and it s certainly not witness intimidation even if yovanovitch said she felt intimidated by the attacks rep chris stewart r utah said trump communicates in ways that sometimes i wouldn t but dismissed the significance of the attacks if your basis for impeachment is going to include a tweet that shows how weak the evidence for that impeachment is he said on abc s this week and the backlash didn t stop trump from lashing out at yet another witness this time pence aide williams he directed her in a sunday tweet to meet with the other never trumpers who i don t know mostly never even heard of work out a better presidential atta
