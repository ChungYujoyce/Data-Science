apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic hong kong ap trump signs pepe the frog graffiti and british and american flags have become a common sight at hong kong s anti government protests and an unsettling one to longtime democracy activists on the left beijing has seized on the images to portray the movement as a coddled westernized middle class incited by foreign organizations and governments to rebel against the world s largest communist country china why does the american flag appear at every violent scene in hong kong state broadcaster cctv asked top stories hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender many of hong kong s hardcore protesters are working class construction workers and hairstylists battling an establishment government dominated by business interests and real estate tycoons some wave u s and other flags to appeal to the rest of the world for support but a small group of followers of far right activist horace chin regularly join the long running protests drawing the glare of television cameras with big banners reading president trump please liberate hong kong for liberals chin is a pariah hijacking the demonstrations it s really disappointing to see people try to drive a wedge between hong kong people and the chinese people in this way said wilfred chan a founding member of lausan a leftist collective that seeks to build international solidarity with the hong kong protests this is a mistake there is little though that they can do about it protesters have vowed to avoid the internal divisions of the pro democracy umbrella movement in 2014 demonstrators refrain from criticizing each other s tactics or politics to stay focused on what unites them opposition to the communist government in beijing and the ruling establishment in hong kong the protests are not your traditional left or right movement said avery ng chairman of the league of social democrats a left wing political party this is a broad spectrum movement against a totalitarian government but basic disagreements bubble beneath the surface what do the protests stand for who are they for and who are they against how do you save a city caught in a growing confrontation between the u s and china when four far right ukrainian activists flew into hong kong and posed for pictures with protesters some chinese state media played up what they said was the protest movement s true colors ukrainian neo nazis exposed colluding with hong kong rioters trumpeted a headline in the global times a nationalistic state owned newspaper hong kong s left leaning activists feel caught in the middle the right wing imagery is misleading they said fearing it feeds into beijing s narrative and harms the movement the protests started in june to oppose a bill that would have allowed the city to extradite suspected criminals to china and rapidly snowballed into a full blown defense of the city s semi autonomy under beijing s rule chan founder of lausan treks the world to seek support from grassroots organizers he sees a common struggle between demonstrators in chile kashmir bolivia and puerto rico saying their struggles stem from the same root governments that lie to their own people we have to think beyond trying to appease elites far away he said when it comes to the question of hong kong s autonomy i think that neither china nor the united states

aids he said in a december tweet where s your cocktail therapy shock therapies for communist china in 2011 chin published an influential book on the hong kong city state his supporters admire him for being one of the first to outline a concrete strategy to preserve the city s identity and traditional chinese heritage from china s all controlling communist party his language though veers into the bombastic angering many with anti china rhetoric that some call racist the expressions of people like chin and attacks by bands of hardcore protesters targeting mainland chinese connected businesses and shoppers allow beijing to tar the whole movement as being bigoted critics say cedric a 30 year old former construction worker turned front liner is somewhat indifferent towards trump whom he calls just a businessman nor does he think the hong kong human rights and democracy act passed by congress as a rebuke to beijing and hong kong s leadership has had much impact so far cedric who like most protesters didn t give his last name out of fear of arrest rejects political labels calling himself just a hong kong citizen like many in the movement he embraces pepe the frog as a protest symbol unaware of its association with far right extremists in the u s some of his friends have been arrested and he now lives in hiding nursing a shoulder injured in clashes with riot police as the protests march on cedric hopes that more people across the globe will support the hong kong cause including chinese on the mainland we won t reject support from people of any country or race because we know those people value freedom and democracy he said ng the head of the far left party sees the chinese government as the common enemy of both hong kong and ordinary chinese his left wing yet anti beijing

worker rights he saw on the ground the chinese communist party is the most anti communist party in the world he said what they are operating is authoritarian state capitalism ng sees the appeals of

whatever path that they may think to help the cause associa
