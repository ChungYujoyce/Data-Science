apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic kyiv ukraine ap more than two months before the phone call that launched the impeachment inquiry into president trump ukraine s newly elected leader was already worried about pressure from the u s president to investigate his democratic rival joseph r biden volodymyr zelensky gathered a small group of advisers on may 7 in kyiv for a meeting that was supposed to be about his nation s energy needs instead the group spent most of the three hour discussion talking about how to navigate the insistence from trump and his personal lawyer rudolph w giuliani for a probe and how to avoid becoming entangled in the american elections according to three people familiar with the details of the meeting they spoke to the associated press on the condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue which has roiled u s ukrainian relations top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state the meeting came before zelensky was inaugurated but about two weeks after trump called to offer his congratulations on the night of the ukrainian leader s april 21 election the full details of what the two leaders discussed in that easter sunday phone call have never been publicly disclosed and it is not clear whether trump explicitly asked for an investigation of the bidens the three people s recollections differ on whether zelensky specifically cited that first call with trump as the source of his unease but their accounts all show the ukrainian president elect was wary of trump s push for an investigation into the former vice president and his son hunter s business dealings either way the newly elected leader of a country wedged between russia and the u s aligned nato democracies knew early on that vital

foreign policy test came not from his enemy russia but rather from the country s most important ally the united states the may 7 meeting included two of his top aides andriy yermak and andriy bogdan

comment on whether trump demanded an investigation in the april 21 call the white house has offered only a bare bones public readout on the april call saying trump urged zelensky and the ukrainian people to implement reforms increase prosperity and root out corruption in the intervening months trump and his proxies have frequently used the word corruption to reference the monthslong efforts to get the ukrainians to investigate democrats trump has said he would release a transcript of the first call but the white house had no comment wednesday on when or if that might happen after news broke that a white house whistleblower had filed a complaint about his july 25 call with zelensky trump said the conversation was perfect and that he had asked his ukrainian counterpart to do whatever he can in terms of corruption because the corruption is massive during the call trump asked zelensky for a favor requesting an investigation into a conspiracy theory related to a democratic computer server hacked during the 2016 election campaign trump also pushed zelensiy to investigate biden and his son trump then advised zelensky that giuliani and attorney general william p barr would be contacting him about the request according to a summary of the called released by the white house within days giuliani flew to madrid to meet privately with yermak zelensky s aide who was in the may 7 meeting trump has denied that an investigation of biden was a condition for releasing military aid as a quid pro quo but on tuesday the senior u s diplomat in ukraine at the time ambassador william taylor starkly contradicted the president saying that trump had demanded that everything zelensky wanted including the aid and a white house meeting was conditional on a public vow that he would open an investigation taylor also detailed multiple previously undisclosed diplomatic interactions between trump s envoys and senior ukrainian officials in which the president s demand to investigate the
