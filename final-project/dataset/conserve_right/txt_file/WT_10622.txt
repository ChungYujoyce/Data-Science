apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic a 5 month old toddler who is arguably china s no 2 diplomat to the united states makes her first public appearance this weekend starting saturday the public is invited to visit bao bao the smithsonian national zoo s giant panda cub even if she s not awake for her audience she s sleeping 20 hours or more a day animal keeper marty dearie said it s very possible that s all you ll see you ll get to watch a sleeping cub but she s still very cute photos take a bow bao bao the national zoo s new panda poses for the cameras fans have had only the streamed images from two online cameras to satisfy their cuteness quota since bao bao s birth in august since then the squealing pink creature no bigger than a stick of butter has transformed into what animal keepers call a little ball of cuteness bao bao tips the scales at 16 9 pounds and her body is covered in a thick black and white fur coat which keepers said helps cushion her if she tumbles while exploring her den like any other toddler bao bao is learning how to walk and explore her surroundings she waddles pigeon toed around her inside enclosure that she shares with mom mei xiang and slowly and carefully scales low ledges you gasp when she falls off a rock but if she s only 17 or 18 pounds that s an awful lot of fur there said rosalyn jones a friends of the national zoo member who got a sneak peak at bao bao last weekend she s just adorable bao bao also is being trained to trust her keepers we re training her to orient toward us said brandie smith senior curator and curator of giant pandas we want to make sure she sees us as nothing but positive this training will make it easier for checkups and hopefully one day testing for a pregnancy china is very hands on ms smith said bao bao eventually will make her way to china to fulfill a contractual agreement we want to be positive because humans will always be a part of her life ms smith said giant pandas are endangered with about 1 600 living in central china s mountain forests according to zoo officials about 300 reside in zoos and breeding around the world mostly in china a total of 14 giant pandas are housed at four u s zoos including the national zoo all of the giant pandas on display in the u s are on loan from china s government before a zoo is loaned any pandas it must demonstrate that it has the resources for research that can help the animals in the wild and in captivity bao bao the daughter of the zoo s resident pandas tian tian and mei xiang was born aug 23 a second stillborn cub was recovered by zoo staff a day later bao bao received her name on dec 1 100 days after her birth per chinese tradition the name means precious or treasure and received the most public votes among five suggested names bao bao has big paw prints to fill her elder brother tai shan was born in 2005 and quickly became one of the most famous and popular residents of the district tai shan was born after officials tried unsuccessfully for decades to mate washington s first pair of pandas during 20 years together at the zoo hsing hsing and ling ling produced five cubs but none of them survived tai shan was so popular that the zoo extended his two year residency by an additional three years smithsonian institution figures show that in 2005 1 8 million people visited the zoo compared with 2 6 million visitors after tai shan went on display in 2006 mei xiang gave birth in 2012 but the cub died a week later from underdeveloped lungs and liver damage animal keeper laurie thompson said bao bao has explored only her inside enclosure but crews are cub proofing the outside yard to make sure she can t get anywhere she s not supposed to she s building up muscle learning how to climb ms smith said the management of the cubs has changed between tai shan and bao bao we used to be more direct ms smith said we d keep mom outside longer i don t really like that so we ve given mei xiang more choices now than with tai shan she seems to like to spend more time inside than outside keepers credit mei xiang as a good mother who knows when it s nursing time but allows her cub to explore at the beginning the cub takes up all her time and resources ms thompson said but as bao bao has grown mei xiang has been comfortable leaving her cub for periods of time so she can eat when bao bao needs to be nursed mei xiang will pick her up mr dearie said she s a good mother what s tricky however is that bao bao now is drinking only milk making treat giving tricky because anything she could want she can get from her mother she s mouthing at bamboo ms smith said she is getting tastes of apple juice but calories come from mom keepers agreed that the panda house s newest addition is an easy going resident she s really laid back so far ms thompson said she doesn t mind us picking her up sporting a keep calm and panda on t shirt beneath her coat cyndi anderson said she had become interested in giant pandas after watching tai shan on the panda cams i was really really excited said the reston resident adding that she set two alarms so she could wake up and stand in line at 5 a m mei xiang is
