apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion in the minds of republicans truth tellers and um sane people rep adam schiff isn t just one of the villains in an ongoing leftist fueled democrat pressed impeachment sham he s the liar liar pants on fire guy who s taken his bloviating lying self from the house into the senate to orchestrate another theatrical performance of get trump any which way you can but with so many members of the media carrying his water for him he s proving unstoppable it s one thing for pundits and opinion writers on the left to discard the old he said she said type of reporting and rather than present both sides in context simply go with the one that best personally suits top stories ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time but journalists correspondents so called investigative watchdogs are supposed to do better they re supposed to be unbiased and well honest they re showing more as a schiff s best friend adam schiff might be the most underestimated politician california has produced tweeted greg miller a pulitzer prize winning national security correspondent for the washington post many in gop dismiss him as bland partisan but the way he has handled impeachment will leave a mark on history exceeding nearly all contemporaries tingles anyone that s a reference to chris matthews of msnbc who once said on live air that he felt this thrill going up my leg while listening to barack obama speak only matthews wasn t a supposed nonpartisan national security correspondent miller ostensibly is and to suggest schiff may bring down the curtains of history in some sort of hallowed glory isn t just eyebrow raising it s water carrying just for the record let s recount some of schiff s lies schiff deceived about his office s discussions with the whistleblower schiff deceived when he said the impeachable evidence against this president was irrefutable uncontested schiff deceived when he took house witness testimony that was based on presumptions and second and thirdhand hearsay and presented them as fact and firsthand accounts of the president s conversations and motives my gosh schiff deceived and continues to deceive so much the internet overflows with headlines about his many many deceptions schiff s shifty timeline the wall street journal wrote in october about schiff s account of the whistleblower adam schiff s drive to impeach trump based on opinions deception and illusions not facts wrote impeachment author gregg jarrett in an opinion piece on fox news also in october a normal court would reject a dishonest prosecutor like adam schiff the new york post wrote a week ago schiff may have mischaracterized lev parnas evidence documents show politico wrote just a day ago on that last politico s congressional reporter not opinion writer melanie zanona wrote house intelligence chairman adam schiff appears to have mischaracterized a text message exchange between two players in the ukraine saga according to documents obtained by politico a possible error the gop will likely criticize as another example of the democrats rushed effort to impeach president donald trump that s a diplomatic way of saying once again schiff has been caught lying perhaps he wouldn t get away with it so frequently if the media weren t so complicit or fawning or defensive of democrats and knee jerk hateful of trump the trump war room account offered a thread of responses to the democrats ukraine evidence tweeted phillip bump national correspondent for the washington post every tweet in the thread was wrong or misleading on surface sounds tame enough right except bump s tweeted comment came in reference to a linked piece he included in the twitter post titled analysis as house democrats lay out their case trump s campaign and white house offer a different narrative and guess who wrote that analysis bump the media deception is this bump wrote an analysis that took bits and pieces of impeachment testimony and in particular of schiff statements and framed them as proof positive of trump s guilt he analyzed and offered opinion then he basically tweeted his own opinion of trump war room s lies as fact the outrage is bump is a correspondent for the washington post not an opinion writer he s supposed to be unbiased he s supposed to remain above the opinion fray instead he jumped right in it and hold on here s where the deception gets really deep started a massive wave of social media reaction bump s tweet was then retweeted by the likes of chris hayes msnbc host and some of his 2 million followers along with hundreds of bump s own followers along with hundreds of those followers who then weighed in with comments about this white house s misleading ways is the msm just now figuring out that this admin has one gear lie all the time is the play wrote one beneath bump s tweet pay attention ladies and gentlemen this is a classic textbook case of how opinion becomes fact onequick tweet at a time that s how impeachable offenses turn into whatever the democrats want them to be david sanger national security correspondent for the new york times and a cnn contributor and peter baker chief white house correspondent for the new york times and an msnbc analyst meanwhile had twitter words of criticism for sen martha mcsally after she shut down questions from cnn s manu raju on new evidence for the impeachment trial in the senate by calling him a liberal hack baker tweeted apparently daring to ask a straightforward question of a senator makes a reporter a liberal hack sanger retweeted that message and added his own not only was the question perfectly appropriate it was the obvious thing to ask someone who had just sworn an oath to be an impartial judge of the evidence this didn t sound like someone preparing for quiet thoughtful deliberation of the evidence ok but these tweets don t seem like expressions that supposedly unbiased national security and white house journalists would make rather they re quite the aid and assistance for schiff and his band of merry anti trump managers who are trying to make the case for more witnesses more documents more testimony in the senate why are they making that case they re trying to drag out the process and distract from the fact that impeachable offenses are nonexistent they re trying to pretend that the american people deserve to hear from all the witnesses and see all the documents they re trying to pretend the house didn t just present these witnesses and documents and distract from the fact that they re only trying to shove onto the senate the witnesses and documents that didn t meet their own smell test for house presentation they re trying to pretend that those who stonewall witness testimony and documents presentations are simply covering up for trump so certainly assuredly questions about new evidence to be presented in the senate impeachment trial against trump are yes indeed partisan hack attacks aimed at advancing the democrats deceptions baker and sanger supposed unbiased journalists didn t have to further this false democratic ploy they could ve kept their supposedly unbiased journalist opinions to themselves and let the commentary writers make the case but today s media doesn t leave the bias on the opinion pages any more more examples maggie haberman the white house correspondent for the new york times and a cnn analyst has obviously thrown in for michael bloomberg over trump tweeting above a linked story of the ex mayor s financial fundraising abilities bloomberg also is trolling trump in ways that no candidate has in five years and is making clear he isn t afraid of him for five years trump mostly dictated terms his rivals responded to that s not this here comes bloomberg hear him roar the only thing missing from haberman s post is the triumphant take that trump at the end of the tweet joe lockhart meanwhile cnn s media analyst tweeted out a whole faked impeachment conversation between republican senators that furthered the democratic narrative and hit hard albeit deceptively at trump only to then follow with another tweet that read ok maybe i made up the convo conservation but you know that s exactly what they re gop senators thinking there are more examples many more the theme though is this democrats set trump in their impeachment sights before he was even inaugurated just because trump s not committed any impeachable offenses doesn t mean impeachment s off the table and here s the sad reality with media like the new york times the washington post cnn and more the concept of impeachable offenses the truths of impeachable offenses don t really matter at all adam schiff no matter how many lies is the hero in the
