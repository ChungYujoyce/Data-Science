apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic wall street suffered through its worst day of the year thursday bringing investors down from the sugar high they have enjoyed this year as the markets topped milestone after milestone the dow jones industrial average plummeted for the second consecutive day thursday at one point tumbling by more than 360 points or nearly 2 4 percent to close at 14 758 32 one day after the federal reserve hinted that it may soon tighten the monetary spigot disappointing news on china s latest manufacturing statistics contributed to trader pessimism as well a day earlier the dow dropped more than 200 points or 1 3 percent making the total from wednesday and thursday about 560 points or just shy of 4 percent top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free

time the broader s p 500 index meanwhile tumbled below the 1 600 mark closing at 1 588 19 down more than 40 points or 2 5 percent on the day while the tech heavy nasdaq fell more than 78 points or 2 percent to 3 364 64 federal reserve chairman ben s bernanke on wednesday suggested that the fed may start winding down its stimulus program because the markets are strong enough that they no longer need the government s help the fed has been spending 85 billion each month investing in treasurys and u s equities to keep the economy afloat and it has worked the unemployment rate has shrunk to 7 6 percent from 8 1 percent when the buying program started in september greg mcbride senior financial analyst at bankrate com said this has fueled the record run on wall street it just goes to show that the market has been on a sugar high from fed stimulus and reality is beginning to set in said greg mcbride senior financial analyst at bankrate com paul edelstein u s economist at ihs agreed that the fed is responsible for wall street s success this year but it s predicated on the fed staying the course until things get better on their own he said the fed expects the unemployment rate to continue to decline to about 7 2 percent by the end of the year which would justify pulling back but neither mr edelstein nor mr mcbride thinks this will happen unemployment is still high at 7 6 percent household income is stagnant and revenue growth is hard to come by for companies mr mcbride said this is not an economy that s hitting the cover off the baseball by any means he said those are not the type of market fundamentals that would justify a market that s up double digits year to date so without the fed s backing the markets are bound to take a tumble analysts say i think the fed has been very supportive of the economy mr edelstein said one of the reasons that the economy has done so well this year is because of the fed s support so if the fed withdraws that support i become much less optimistic investors received further bad news from china the world s second largest economy where the manufacturing sector may have contracted in june according to a report hsbc s monthly purchasing managers index dropped to a reading of 48 3 down from 49 6 in may that s a nine month low and any number less than 50 indicates a contraction in the industry but mr edelstein said china s struggles won t affect the u s as much as the fed s plans could everyone is worried that a slowdown in china will affect the rest of the world particularly in the u s he said my view is that the slowdown in the u s and europe will impact china that s what we re seeing now it might have been a bad a couple of days for wall street but it could be worse on sept 29 2008 during the height of the great recession

aug 8 and 519 83 on aug 10 despite the recent fall the u s markets remain up strongly for the year to date before the fed s announcement wednesday wall street was up about 15 percent from the beginning of the year the dow was trading nearly 17 percent higher than where it started in january and the s p was up nearly 16 percent from that point the nasdaq was up more than 12 percent the markets have hit numerous milestones this year the dow started the year at 13 104 30 and it took only a month for the benchmark index to hit the 14 000 mark on feb 1 a milestone that quickly became old news as records continued to fall on may 3 the dow broke through the 15 000 mark before closing at 14 973 96 four days later it closed above the plateau for the first time at 15 056 20 since then
