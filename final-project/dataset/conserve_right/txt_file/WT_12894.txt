apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic china missile sales newly released classified documents reveal china s continued violations of the missile technology control regime mtcr with sales of missiles and parts to iran syria and pakistan a sept 18 2009 state department cable on the issue was prepared for an international meeting of the mtcr that year in rio de janeiro the mtcr is an informal association of 34 states that seeks to limit exports of missiles with ranges greater than 185 miles and warheads heavier than 1 000 pounds top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey sent under secretary of state hillary rodham clinton s signature the cable included a report on chinese missile proliferation that on three occasions referred to a lack of political will by china to stop missile transfers chinese authorities and firms fail to conduct sufficient evaluations of missile applicable transactions or to take steps to know their customers the report said several cables labelled secret were made public on monday by the anti secrecy site wikileaks showing chinese violations or circumventions of the accord other firms that are aware of the vulnerabilities in china s export control system take steps to conceal sensitive transactions and avoid detection including by adopting new names and falsifying shipping documentation additionally some firms may take advantage of government connections to skirt chinese regulations the cable said among the violations were sales to iran by china s dalian sunny industries also known as limmt sales of ballistic missile goods to syria and transfers by shanghai technical by products international corp to iran of ballistic missile items sanctions were imposed on two chinese firms in 2009 limmt for sales of graphite tungsten gyroscopes and accelerometers and bellamax for steel alloys gyroscopes and ball bearings chinese authorities apparently do not control missile exports because of too much reliance on foreign tips and a reluctance to impose catch all controls the cable said one chinese official was quoted as saying such controls are not meant to catch everything another chinese official was quoted as warning u s officials to back off pressuring beijing because china s business is its own business john tkacik a former state department intelligence specialist said claims that beijing lacked political will to halt missile proliferation is absurd in fact the chinese government is aiding and abetting the proliferation he said mr tkacik said the cables reveal that chinese diplomats lied to u s embassy officials in beijing they told the embassy that companies had been closed down yet our intelligence collection shows those companies continue to function unimpeded he said the report concluded that until china addresses the persistent shortfalls in its export control enforcement ballistic missile programs in countries of concern probably will continue to seek and receive mtcr controlled items from chinese firms a second cable from 2009 said iran uses automotive factories as a procurement cover for its missile programs something mr tkacik said is highlighted by the 2007 deal between china s chery automobile to set up a factory in iran to make cars stating that commodities are intended for automobile manufacturing allows iran a means of purchasing a variety of dual use goods particularly specialty metals and industrial machine tools which could have utility in the automobile sector but which also often are diverted to support its missile production and development efforts the second cable on missile trends stated a third cable said north korea developed its missile industry with critically needed parts from foreign suppliers most commonly china based given their proximity and access to technology that would be beneficial to north korea s missile program china has been violating the mtcr for decades and first sold df 11 short range missiles to pakistan while claiming it followed mtcr guidelines the df 11 sales were covered up by u s intelligence agencies during the clinton administration to prevent the imposition of sanctions under u s law cia arms proliferation analyst gordon oehler exposed the cover up after he was forced into retirement for refusing to go along pla missile deception people s liberation army gen chen bingde chief of the general staff spoke publicly for the first time this week about china s new aircraft carrier killing anti ship ballistic missile the df 21d and played down its development gen chen said during a press conference monday that the missile was discussed during talks with joint chiefs chairman adm mike mullen he claimed the missile is still under research and development process it is not equipped yet gen chen then sought to minimize the significance of a missile the pentagon has called a game changing area denial weapon designed to keep u s ships out of asian waters hitting a ship at sea with a ballistic missile requires precise accuracy even though if in the future we are successful in research and development of this kind of weapons system it will be a system for defense he said his statements contradict those of adm robert willard commander of u s forces in the pacific who said in december that the df 21d was in the early stages of deployment after extensive testing gen chen next criticized the pentagon for spending so much money on the military asking if it wasn t placing too much pressure on the taxpayers during the recession if u s could reduce a bit military spending to spend more on the improvement of livelihood of the american people and also do more good things for world people wouldn t it be a better scenario gen chen said echoing similar calls from liberal left congressional democrats and other progressives to further play down china s military gen chen said we are aware of the fact that what we lack most is the capability of long distance power projection a defense official said gen chen is on the leading edge of a new pla propaganda campaign what the pentagon calls denial and deception gen chen s comments were likely intended to prompt a re evaluation of china s df 21d by u s intelligence agencies that studies have shown were chronically wrong or had underestimated china s military for at least the past two decades caused in part by accepting disinformation aimed at fooling analysts according to the official fact or fiction ellen tauscher undersecretary of state for arms control and international security reacted harshly to a report in this space june 16 on the draft missile defense agreement with the russians that was rejected by the white house amid concerns it would limit u s missile defenses ms tauscher was asked about the inside the ring report following a speech in london and told the questioner the report was fiction the draft tauscher agreement the white house rejected included four elements including two noncontroversial provisions on confidence building and transparency the two show stoppers were provisions moscow likely would view as legally binding limits on pointing interceptors at russia and other limits on numbers and capabilities of missile defenses confirmation of the scrapped june agreement that was prepared for signing by president obama at the group of eight summit in deauville france came from an unlikely source russian foreign minister sergey lavrov ms tauscher s main missile defense interlocutor mr lavrov told russia s state run rossiya 24 television on july 7 that during the deauville summit we discussed at the suggestion of the americans the possibility of adopting a statement in which instructions would be given regarding a number of important issues that need to be settled prior to practical cooperation on missile defense but then at the request of americans their own initiative was recalled well things like this do happen asked if she would like to revise and extend her remarks in light of the russian minister s statement a state department official said what ms tauscher really meant by fiction were assertions that she was working on an agreeme
