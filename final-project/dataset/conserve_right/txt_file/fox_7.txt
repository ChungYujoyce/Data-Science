in the senate dick durbin and republican senator dr bill cassidy and our power player of the week flying high for the blue angels unidentified male boy is it sweet when we put all that together and get that synergy and you feel that fuzz wallace all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again on this memorial day weekend from fox news in washington president trump is back at the white house arriving late last night after a largely successful nine day trip to the middle east and europe but he returns to a spreading scandal about links between the kremlin and some of his current and former advisors and to a domestic agenda that stalled in congress we ll get to all of that this hour but we begin with terror that suicide bombing at a concert in manchester england that killed 22 just the first of four savage attacks this week around the world joining us now the man in charge of keeping america safe the secretary of homeland security general john kelly mr secretary welcome to fox news sunday before we get to terror let me ask you about the hot story in washington now these revelations about jared kushner trying to set up a back channel to the kremlin through the soviet and the russian ambassador your reaction to that is there anything improper with that kelly well i don apost know if it aposs true or not i know it s being it aposs being reported in the press wallace it has been confirmed to me the conversation took place kelly ok then i would just tell you chris that i think any channel of communications back or otherwise with a country like russia is a good thing i mean multiple ways to communicate back and forth is a good thing with a country i think and particularly a country that s like russia so it doesn t it doesn apost bother me i mean you just have to assume obviously that what you re getting is may or may not be true they may be working you but that aposs the whole point i mean that communication goes into the white house as a data point in terms of discussion so i don apost see the big deal wallace let me you say you don apost see a big deal kelly no i think any time you have channels of communication with a country particularly one like russia i wouldn t criticize it wallace but you talked about a data point into the white house this is during the transition kelly right wallace these were private officials kelly right wallace we have one president at a time does that make a difference kelly you know i mean obviously during the transition period the people in transition the incoming trump administration is not in a position to do anything to inhibit with the obama administration literally days before they transitioned out so again as they begin to build relationships there aposs nothing wrong with that as they begin to build their own situational awareness with russia in this case i don apost see an issue here wallace ok let aposs turn to your day job what aposs the latest on the manchester bombing have they rolled up the network that was supporting the bombers and what have you learned from this plot that will help you better protect the u s homeland kelly i mean i don apost know what the actually the better way to put it i can apost comment on whether they finish their investigations or roll you know completed rolling up on the network that we re dealing with but i would just say that this is yes i ve said it many times it really is a generational struggle this is one tragedy in line with dozens of other tragedies in the world i mean last week you had manchester you had egypt you had indonesia you had the philippines all isis inspired or isis controlled terrorist attack wallace was there something different about this network and the way this was pulled off that says to you gee we aposve got to up our game kelly well it s this kind of in my view there aposs kind of three types of terrorist attacks the most sophisticated that we look at that is against aviation that aposs the hardest to do but it aposs the biggest payoff for these people then you have kind of the middle of the road one which i think this one was it s a network it aposs hard to do you have to construct a bomb and all and then you have kind of the low end where i mean just as tragic but you have people running people over in trucks that kind of thing but this is just the way terrorism is today and i think it will be around for many many years to come you know the good news is those officials in the united kingdom europe around the world are relentless they are just as relentless in terms of trying to prevent these things as the terrorists aren apost trying to create them the good news is for our country we have not had an outside the united states terrorist attacks since 9 11 and that goes to the issue of those that fight our away game that s dod nsa cia and those that fight the home game that s dhs fbi local law enforcement wallace let me pick up on this because part of the story this week was the leak of information about the bomber and the bombing that made its way into the u s media and that set off this exchange begin video clip theresa may british prime minister i made clear to president trump that the intelligence that is shared between our law enforcement agencies must remain secure rex tillerson secretary of state we take full responsibility for that and we obviously regret that that happened end video clip wallace how was this kind of sensitive information leaked to the new york times and general why is it that whether it aposs politics or terror our intelligence agencies our law enforcement agencies can apost keep a secret kelly it aposs outrageous when i call immediately after the attack i called my counterpart in u k offered my condolences by the way the third time i ve offered her amber rudd my condolences in 120 days that aposs how frequent this kind of these terrorist attacks are happening anyways she rightfully and very graciously accepted the condolences and leaned into me on this leak it aposs outrageous i don apost know why people do it it jeopardizes not only investigations it puts people aposs lives in jeopardy i don apost why people do it but they do and that aposs the world we live in wallace let aposs get to what you aposre going to try to do to protect the homeland there are a lot of crowded events in the summer concerts sporting events how do you harden these soft targets like this concert and do you have new thoughts because this person didn apost get into the event he was outside the event what do you do about parameters kelly we one of the great things about america there aposs many great things but we are a free and open society and in many and i wouldn apost change that at all but that aposs also one of our vulnerabilities people can live their lives day in and day out privacy issues all of that it aposs a good thing it s what america is all about but as i say that is a vulnerability the good news is to all americans i mean the good news is that local state law enforcement today not to even go down the issue of the fbi dhs it aposs in their dna now to harden we are just about as hard as we can be i don apost know if there aposs a way to prevent these kinds of things in the kind of society we live in wallace let me pick up on that because i want to play a clip of your testimony before congress this week here it is begin video clip kelly it aposs everywhere and that s you know that aposs the nature of this threat that we are dealing with as horrible as manchester was my expectation is we re going to see a lot more of that kind of attack end video clip wallace a lot more of that kind of attack here in the u s kelly i think we re relatively we have no specific we have threats all the time but no right now specific threat but that goes to the fact that we are over here and not over there the fact is that it aposs the caliphate is being destroyed that is syria and iraq there are large numbers of returning fighters western europe and you know in many cases like this guy that did this thing in manchester he s a citizen of the u k in this case he s a passport holder i don apost if the u k had any idea that he was outside that he was in libya but i think he s also traveled to other points the point is they have a real threat and it aposs growing it s metastasized as fighters come back from the caliphate to be i believe to be more of this kind of thing the good news is all decent people all decent governments and it doesn apost matter whether we are politically close to them or not all governments for the most part are sharing tremendous amounts of information passport type information aviation travel information but you know people like this are below the radar wallace i want to pick up on aviation because you are in the process of making some big decisions on aviation and i want to do a lightning round quick questions quick answers are you going to ban laptops from the cabin on all international flights both into and out of the u s kelly i might that aposs a quick answer wallace yes well expand a little bit kelly well there s a real threat numerous threats against aviation that aposs really the thing that they are obsessed with the terrorists the idea of knocking down an airplane in flight particularly if it s a u s carrier particularly if it aposs full of mostly u s folks people it aposs real you know that i implemented i think on the 21st of march a restriction on large electronic devices in the cabins from ten points of origin wallace right but there was talk as you say about all international flights both into and out of the u s when you say you might when are you going to make that decision and what s going to determine it kelly inaudible follow the intelligence the very very good news is that we are working incredibly close with friends and partners around the world we aposre going to and in the process of defining this but we are going to raise the bar for generally speaking aviation security much higher than it is now so and there s new technologies down the road not too far down the road that we will rely on but it is a real sophisticated threat and i will reserve that decision until we see where it aposs going wallace another lightning round question i do need a quick answer here because we re running of time the tsa is testing tighter screening of carry ons and the idea that people who bring their carry ons are going to have to unpack them and put food in one bin and electronics in the another bin and paper in another bin are you going to spread that nationwide and what s that going to do to the screening lines kelly yes i mean the reason we ve done tsa of course works for me the reason we aposve done that is because of people trying to avoid the 25 or 50 or whatever it is to check a bag are now stuffing your carry on bags to the point of you know well they can apost get any more in there so the more you stuff in there the less the tsa professionals that are looking at what aposs in those bags through the monitors they can apost tell what aposs in the bags anymore so if you put wallace so are you going to do that nationwide kelly we might and likely will wallace soon kelly well what we re doing now is working out the tactics techniques and procedures if you will in a few airports to find out exactly how to do that with the least amount of inconvenience to the traveler wallace a couple final questions i want to ask about the travel ban the fourth circuit court of appeals issued a ruling this week continuing the stay on president trump aposs revised travel ban and i want to put up the chief judge called it the revised travel ban an executive order that in text speaks with vague words of national security but in context drips with religious intolerance animus and discrimination mr secretary judge after judge has said that this is a muslim man that violates the constitution kelly they are dead wrong wallace well i mean you say that but they are the ones who were kelly they are wrong remember the seven now six countries these were the same countries identified by the obama administration that we should be extra cautious about and backed up you know by the united states congress that aposs where those seven countries came from the fact is that in those countries we have very little ability to actually verify vet the people that are coming out of those countries so what the president and it aposs not a travel ban remember it s the travel pause what the president said for 90 days we were going to pause in terms of people from those countries coming to the united states that would give me time to look at additional vetting to see wallace ok i want to pick up on that and why you re even talking about the travel ban because i want to put some numbers on take a look at this the first executive order that was issued on january 27th banned citizens from seven nations from entering the u s for 90 days suspended the refugee program for 120 days as you say a pause while you set up an extreme vetting program it aposs now been 121 days since that first order so why don apost you have the program in place kelly we are actually implementing it the irony here is had it stood we would have had the 90 days to study we re not even studying what would be procedures because we are enjoined and can apost do that in the meantime wallace you can apost study extreme vetting kelly no we re the irony again is we can apost study it but i m just guessing and implementing but we are going to find implement ways to determine who this an individual is and remember most of these countries have no passports they have no police they have no intelligence many of the countries in question don apost even have a u s embassy there to help us vet the u n will tell you it aposs almost impossible to vet these people from these countries because there are no passports and all the rest of it we have to figure out a way to determine who they are and why they come into the united states otherwise we re guessing and this president and john kelly doesn apost want to guess when it comes to national security and protection of the u s population wallace secretary kelly thank you thanks for sharing part of your holiday weekend with us kelly absolutely thanks wallace up next new reports that jared kushner attempted to set up a back channel between russia and the trump transition we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss the expanding russia probe plus what would you like to ask the panel about the continuous leaks in washington just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip hillary clinton d former presidential candidate we were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice end video clip wallace hillary clinton talking about richard nixon in her commencement speech at wellesley college but clearly taking a shot at president trump by the way nixon resigned before he was actually impeached and it aposs time now for our sunday group the head of heritage action for america michael needham charles lane of the washington post gerald seib from the wall street journal and national security council staffer gillian turner and just to catch you up president trump returns home to reports that his son in law jared kushner met with the russian ambassador to the u s sergey kislyak in december and that they discussed setting up a secret secure channel between the trump transition and the kremlin that communications link reportedly to be based in a russian diplomatic facility in russia a source close to the trump administration tells me the conversation did take place but he says it was the ambassador who proposed the back channel not kushner so the russian military could talk with trump advisors about the situation in syria and the source points out that the secure link was never set up so with that as a preface gerry your reaction to the kushner story and how does this complicate the already complicated investigation of links between the kremlin and the trump transition gerald f seib the wall street journal well look i mean back channels are not unusual they are not unprecedented this one might have seemed perfectly innocent two problems though with it one is this happened during the transition it seems to violate as you suggested earlier in the show the only one president at a time rule and the second one is it s russia after a campaign in which the russian connection to the campaign the russian interference in the campaign was a big issue and i think the fact that it was at a time when people were looking for whether there were going to be signs of special favors for russia as a result of help they might have given president trump then president elect trump during the campaign that aposs what makes this a big story is the context of the conversation as much as the actual content wallace michael i want to ask you one whether it aposs a big story and secondly about the talk we are hearing that is just rampant in washington today about major changes in the white house that they re going to set up a rapid response operation to deal with all the incoming leaks that the president has hired at least one criminal defense lawyer and may be process of hiring a team and the staff is urging the president to let the lawyers vet his tweets i mean it really does sound like they re going on a war footing on this michael needham ceo heritage action for america yes i don apost know if it aposs a major story there are several investigations going on they probably should be allowed to work their course it aposs kind of exhausting reading some of these new stories and trying to figure out what did you read three weeks ago that s just being recycled versus what new i think it aposs smart for the administration to try to put this stuff to the side have you know a team that looks at these issues and another team that looks at a lot of real policy issues which are closer to the american people you have the most conservative exciting budget that aposs come out in a decade wallace we re going to get to the agenda in the next segment crosstalk wallace i mean at the very least it seems dumb needham clearly the optics of these are awful and i think that especially when you have people who are new to the political system coming in and getting advice from a guy in mike flynn who probably didn apost show the best judgment through a lot of this you know dumb might be a good word for it i don t know you know i think kushner said a couple of weeks ago that he was happy to participate with the senate investigation he said he s happy to participate with this investigation you are at a disadvantage when you are the focus of an investigation and your lawyers are saying don apost participate don apost comment and everyone else in the country seems more than eager to talk about it so i think a little prudence in keeping our mouth shut while we let the investigations play out is probably fair and we ll see what comes up in them wallace you talk about the fact that they aposre all the stories and sometimes it aposs hard to remember what you aposve heard this week and what you heard last week and this gets to the question of leaks i asked our staff to put together let aposs put it up on the screen a list of the headlines from just the last two weeks this is just sunday two weeks ago until today and as you can see there aposs been a torrent of disclosures from intelligence and law enforcement officials gillian as somebody who worked in the government have you ever seen anything like this and you know the conservatives talk about a deep state that there are people embedded in law enforcement and embedded in the intelligence community that are trying to bring this president down it sure seems like it aposs true gillian turner former white house national security council so to me on the question of leaks it seems that without a doubt leaks of information today are the number one threat to u s national security interest across the globe and i think for evidence of that we need look no further than the very public reprimand we the united states had to endure from britain earlier this week in the wake of the manchester attacks a reminder that the british u s intelligence cooperation relationship is one of the closest that has ever existed and in my lifetime in government and policy i have not seen something so public so public a risk ph crosstalk wallace most of these leaks aren t about national security they are about trump aposs political security turner yes and so this gets to the question of the deep state so i m somebody who likes to push back against the narrative having been a civil servant in the government again in the national security community is different than the political community the rest of the policy community but i will say that from i have seen and experienced it does not exist there is not this liberal wallace how do you define this turner there isn t a liberal core of people put it this way chris for a hard fact more than 50 percent of the federal workforce today is made up of people that joined the government prior to president bush aposs tenure in office so the idea that these are obama holdovers is simply not true it aposs not the case i think that when we talk about why individuals leak information the explanations are as varied as human beings psychology so for example a lot of things we are seeing leaked about the president are probably being leaked by his senior staff to hurt one another that aposs not unique to the trump administration wallace we ask you for questions for the panel and we got some different reactions in this question of leaks adri ane sent us on facebook do whistleblowers hold a vital role in the health of a democracy holding those in power to accountability but chuck coo had a different take simple question if our intelligence agencies are as good as advertised why can apost they find the leakers chuck how do you answer both of them about leaks charles lane the washington post well as a member of the press and is a believer in the role of the media and holding government accountable i m not going to come out against leaks because you know for all the leaks that may cause this or that official trouble there aposs going to be another one that does play an important role in accountability but going back to what gillian said i think part of the reason that these leaks are flowing so uncontrollably to the viewer s question is the factional struggle within this administration you know we have this famous dispute between bannon and kushner that supposedly was papered over but i wouldn apost be surprised if you know those were present two currents to put it politely within the white house that are trying to get bad stories out about one another and this goes to your point about the staff shakeup and so on and so forth you can shake up the staff all you want but if man at the top is not laying out a clear and consistent line is not himself modeling behavior for example by not blowing an israeli source in a meeting with a foreign government that sets the tone that this stuff is not really on then it will continue needham i take your point about the responsibility of the press and how leaks play into as it requires a responsible press also that when james fallows of the atlantic today put side by side the washington post in the new york times and how they treat i think it was three unnamed sources in the white house talking about jared kushner and his desire to be here and stay here this is not an urgent story this is not something that s getting out there i don apost think you see in the press the times and the washington post the way they are playing this kind of using leakers to try to unearth the truth and taking two months like crosstalk wallace we need to needham it s kind of getting ridiculous wallace we need to because we re going to run out of time let me simply say we aposre just receiving information it s people who had sworn oftentimes taken legal oaths not to divulge the information they are the ones putting it out we re just the recipients all right we have to take a break here we ll see you a little later when we come back senators dick durbin and bill cassidy is the president aposs agenda both his new budget and the new effort to repeal and replace obamacare in trouble commercial break wallace coming up president trump releases his budget begin video clip donald trump president of the united states my administration is laying a foundation to build a future of economic prosperity and achieve american greatness end video clip wallace but does it have any chance of getting through congress two key senators join us next commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway of the indianapolis motor speedway home to this weekend aposs indianapolis 500 back from his first foreign trip president trump aposs focus will now shift to his domestic agenda his new budget and a bill to repeal and replace obamacare joining us to discuss the president aposs priorities from springfield illinois the senate s number two democrat dick durbin and here in washington louisiana senator and doctor bill cassidy who s on both the senate finance and health committees well senators before we get to the trump agenda i ve got to ask you about the big story in washington this weekend the jared kushner story discussions about setting up a possible back channel with russia senator durbin what aposs wrong with that sen dick durbin d illinois the bottom line of course is we now have a special counsel in bob mueller i have the highest level of confidence in him and i hope that he will follow all the evidence all the leads and all the suggestions and i m sure he will wallace do you have any specific comment about the kushner conversation and whether or je should keep his security clearance durbin well of course not i mean this is a rumor at this point and whether it is something that should be followed up on i ll trust bob mueller aposs judgment wallace senator cassidy are you troubled by this sen bill cassidy r louisiana i agree with dick s assessment and i ll say when you speak to folks back home voters across the nation they re more concerned about their climbing health care premiums and the need to have jobs with better wages and better benefits this will play out we will know eventually right now americans need help with their premiums wallace well you know what then gentlemen let aposs switch to health care and the congressional budget office non partisan released its score of the house bill this week and let aposs put the numbers up on the screen it would reduce the deficit 119 billion over ten years but 23 million more people would be uninsured by 2026 the cost of insurance according to the cbo for a 64 year old earning 27 000 a year would increase from 1 700 a year under obamacare to more than 13 000 under the gop bill here aposs what senate democratic leader chuck schumer said this week begin video clip sen chuck schumer d ny minority leader unless you re a healthy millionaire trumpcare is a nightmare this report ought to be the final nail in the coffin of the republican effort to sabotage our health care system end video clip wallace senator cassidy is schumer right cassidy so the senate will write its own bill and it shouldn apost be the final coffin because right now there aposs families sitting around their kitchen table they re play 20 000 30 000 and 40 000 a year for premiums and there aposs about to be a 40 percent increase in many states in these premiums cassidy collins a bill i ve introduced with susan collins we have four co sponsors wallace yes we re going to get into that in a cassidy but that said actually would would would meet that family s needs and i think it should be a place we go and those families are asking us to address those issues wallace so so what would you say to americans how should they regard the house bill cassidy the house product the senate will have its own product we will go to conference but i think the senate product i aposm hopeful will be more likely to address their needs wallace senator durbin i know what you re going to say and the cbo certainly indicates there are problem with repeal and replace but obamacare has its own problems you heard senator cassidy mentioned some of them blue cross blue shield of kansas city just announced this week that it has lost 100 million through 2016 and that it is going to pull out of exchanges that means that in 25 counties in western missouri they may have no insurer at all doesn t something have to be done dramatically durbin well it should be but first we ought to have an administration that supports our health care system what the trump administration has done since day one is to find ways to cut off support for our current health care system lack of advertising for example to bring new people on board so we have larger insurance pools and lower premiums we have to have an effort made to sustain the current system while we repair it we shouldn t be sabotaging it wallace wait wait wait wait senator durbin but let s look at the bottom line here what the republicans wallace senator durbin let me just point out when blue cross blue shield of kansas city says they ve lost 100 million in 2016 you can apost blame that on trump he wasn apost president durbin no of course it is not a situation where the system we have is perfect and it isn apost i voted for it and it needs to be repaired and i think bill cassidy and susan collins are at least willing to sit down in a constructive fashion and deal with that bill and i have had conversations about that i aposm sorry that the two of them are not in the room with the 13 apostles that senator mcconnell s chosen to come up with the republicans plan i wish bill and susan were in there wallace all right let let let me bring senator cassidy back because let aposs talk about the collins susan collins the republican senator from maine and cassidy plan and here are some of the highlights of that plan keep most obamacare taxes to pay for a replacement instead of an individual mandate that would end auto enroll people in insurance so they have to opt out not opt in and let states keep most of obamacare if they want senator it aposs a very interesting plan but i don apost have to tell you there are some of your more conservative colleagues in the senate who are never going to go for this because they re cassidy that s wallace i mean they re already upset that they say the house plane leaves too much of obamacare in place you aposre leaving more of it in place cassidy a couple things it is the conservative solution the conservative thinks the power should return to individuals and to states we do that the power that obamacare gave took from states we give back and you can apost say you re a conservative and we believe in states rights and then tell states what they can apost do if a blue state wishes to do a blue thing god bless them and as regard to taxes it isn apost so much that we have to keep these taxes as a fiscal conservative i do think we need to pay for things we have to balance our budget we just say those taxes should be addressed in comprehensive tax reform not piecemealed beforehand i will repeat the cassidy collins plan is the conservative solution wallace but have you gotten any buy in and let me just take a few names from ted cruz from rand paul from mike lee and what are the chances honestly that the senate won apost pass anything that this health care reform is going to die cassidy i can apost speak for those senators you listed i will say that between aside from susan and i there s four other republicans who support it now what would really be wallace that s six you need 44 more cassidy but of all the plants out there we re the one that have the most support and there are others who are very much interested but i ll also say to my friend dick durbin if we had democrats involved because we do allow a blue state to do a blue thing that s states rights that if they can t if we had 25 democrats and 40 republicans it wouldn apost be a republican plan it wouldn apost be a democratic plan it would be an american plan wallace ok let me quickly because i want to get to the budget briefly but but real quickly senator durbin any democratic buy in durbin as long as we take repeal off the table there are a lot of democrats who want to bring a chair to the table i aposm one of them let s sit down together with bill cassidy and susan collins i don apost agree with their many aspects of their start up plan but it aposs a good faith effort to do two things reduce the cost of health insurance and expand the reach of health insurance that should be our national goal wallace all right now there aposs the trump budget that was released this week and let aposs go through some of the highlights of that here are some of the key increases in spending for the military increase by 10 1 percent border security by 6 8 percent but epa is cut 31 4 percent the state department by 29 1 percent and nih the national institutes of health by 18 2 percent here aposs how trump budget director mick mulvaney explained it begin video clip mick mulvaney director office of management and budget compassion needs to be on both sides of that equation yes you have to have compassion for folks who are receiving the federal funds but also you have to have compassion for the folks who are paying it end video clip wallace senator durbin i know you re going to bash the trump budget but but don apost we have to cut spending at some point are we just going to keep piling up the national debt durbin well that aposs a very very important question that you asked chris but the question is where you cut it and how you cut i do not believe you make america great again by cutting medical research to the lowest level in 12 years i don apost think you make america great again by saying to working families it aposs now more expensive for your kids to borrow money for student loans you certainly don apost make us a great nation by cutting back in infrastructure all those three things are in the trump budget so if we re going to have priorities let aposs look at the things that are important for building jobs and opportunity in the future wallace senator cassidy how dead i know it aposs dead but how dead is the trump budget cassidy so class typically in fact always the senate and the house write their own budget but it does reflect the president aposs goals i actually agree with those goals but would take a different approach let s speak of medicaid which under their budget is cut medicaid is unsustainable both for states and for the federal government it has to be reformed but as a physician who worked with medicaid patients i know that benefit has to also be preserved i aposve actually worked on legislation that would bend the cost curve at the same time reform it so that states would not go bankrupt trying to continue their medicaid program wallace but cassidy we have elements of that in the cassidy collins plan we share the goal we just have a different way to get there wallace but just real quickly though i know you re concerned about the gulf coast and louisiana are you ok with cutting epa you re a doctor are you ok with these kinds of big cuts in nih cassidy again i think the best way to control future health care spending is to find that cure for alzheimer aposs i agree with the goal i have a different approach if we find a cure for alzheimer s which postpones or heals then those folks are not taking a trillion dollars out of our economy with their illness rather they are contributing that capital is used for something else we can actually get at this in a different light wallace senator cassidy senator durbin i want to thank you both for coming in and thank you for your time especially in this holiday weekend cassidy thank you wallace up next president trump wraps up his first foreign trip but his troubles here at home haven apost gone away our panel comes back to discuss both commercial break begin video clip trump we made extraordinary gains on this historic trip to advance the security and prosperity of the united states our friends and our allies end video clip wallace president trump at the end of his first foreign trip giving himself good reviews which is what presidents always do and we re back now with the panel gillian how do you think the president did on this trip and why do you think he seemed to get along so much better with the leaders in the middle east than he did with our allies in europe turner so i really divide the trip into two parts conceptually it s helpful so the first is really going around and touching on major worlds the world s major three religions excuse me chris christianity judaism and islam and i think that that part of the trip went relatively well we had some pushback from the media about certain protocol optics like you know like what was donning the heads of melania and ivanka trump that aposs fine i think the second part of the trip was really nato focused and there the president s speech actually got a lot of criticism but i think for the first time the administration cabinet wide is actually striking the right tone on nato by which i mean they re focusing on recommitting themselves to the importance of the alliance and they backtracked or progressed however you want to phrase it on the the idea that it aposs become obsolete which is a good thing for everyone at the same time they re encouraging the member nations to contribute 2 percent gdp which at this time remember this was part of the president s campaign platform so i think he aposs got a mandate from the american people to push for that and it aposs something he aposs doing i think it aposs a nice balance wallace we should point out that the first part of the trip especially the saudi part of the trip was largely organized by jared kushner and people who support him say he was talking to all of those saudi leaders and helping and sunni muslim leaders during the transition and that aposs one of the reasons it was such a success chuck what struck you about these nine days lane i have to say the chilly atmospherics of the europe portion of the trip in contrast to the warmth the abundant good feeling that was on display in saudi arabia between the president and the royal family of saudi arabia that that contrast i think spoke volumes it aposs true that he aposs the president got a lot of criticism for not uttering the words i personally support article five the mutual defense guarantee in nato wallace attack on one is an attack on all lane correct but the reason for another president with another history who had run a different campaign that wouldn apost be an issue the europeans feel very embattled and nervous with respect to the trump administration he supported brexit he openly spoke warmly about marine le pen he s called nato obsolete and they were looking for some the kind of reassurance that he gave the saudis and they didn apost get it and i think that will have repercussions going forward wallace let aposs talk about the domestic side because the president returns to a congress that is addley ph divided about repeal and replace and has already both republicans and democrats rejected his budget that we were just talking about with the two senators michael some senate republicans are talking about just giving up on health care and moving straight tax reform needham it would be a mistake i mean the american health care system is collapsing under obamacare but part of the reason that this agenda is so complicated and that we need a real sense of urgency on both the white house and the congress about health care tax reform the budget the debt limit all this stuff that s coming up and how it fits together is that for seven years the republican party has told itself a lie that we are all united on wanting the same ends that we all want to repeal obamacare it s about what the replace is and what you actually have is you have very legitimate and heartfelt disagreement within the party about what the best path forward is some conservatives who want to focus on title one regulations bill cassidy who has his plan the tuesday group in the house which is more of a force wallace more moderate needham the moderate group kind of a force for the status quo i think the healthiest thing that s happened in the last couple of months is that in the house for the first time leadership and the members themselves acknowledge that there are real differences of policy in this party this isn apost good guys and bad guys it isn t disagreements about tactics they sat down for a couple of weeks they understood where they were coming from and they came up with a coalition form of government that said you know what let aposs let the state decides if they want to wave out of obamacare that aposs fine for some of them and others don t wallace but but needham that aposs the model that needs that needs to happen going forward to bring them together wallace but but the problem of course with that as you just heard from bill cassidy is he s saying they re basically going to put that over the side maybe they ll take a little bit out of it but they re going to write their own bill gerry is it possible that we could get to the end of 2017 this year and that a republican controlled congress republican control of the house and the senate will not have passed a single major trump legislative initiative and if so what does that mean for prospects for republicans in the 2018 midterms seib well it is first of all it is possible because we re staring down the path here of no easy wins you know no big easy wins by the way there aposs one other that you shouldn apost forget which is by the fall this congress has to raise the debt ceiling which everybody hates to do and and wallace you ve also got to fund the government seib you have to fund the government have to raise the debt ceiling they re going to have to get republican votes conservatives hate raising the debt ceiling everybody hates raising the debt ceiling that has to happen as well so you have a whole series of tough or unpleasant choices before the congress my guess is that in the end i think a republican congress will figure out a way to get together and get some of these things done even in a truncated form because it s too heavy a lift to go through an entire year in full control of the government and not have anything to show for it wallace you think they pass tax health care reform or do you think they re going to end up eventually realizing you had mitch mcconnell say i don apost see how we get to 50 seib yes wallace which is not the kind of thing he openly says do you think that they could just punt on that and go to tax reform seib i think they could easily walk past health and go to tax reform i mitch mcconnell s a smart guy he s not going to move down a path unless he knows there s success at the end of that path and if he doesn apost you know that aposs because there is no way to get 50 votes plus one i do think tax reform is something that republicans really want to do they ve come to washington to cut taxes they re not going to walk out of this town i think in december without having given that at least a really good try wallace michael needham yes no i think you know they need to do both and all of these things are intertwined at some point they have to sit down and look at these various points the debt limit spending tax reform health care and define which wings of the party which different factions within the parties will get what wins where and once they do that they ll get some the other thing that has to be considered this week is is the paris accords paris climate treaty and what makes that so complicated i think for the president is it s non binding i think he s actually going to come out this week and pull out the paris accords he made an explicit promise on the campaign trail he s somebody who likes to keep his promises and second the united states shouldn apost stay in a treaty just because it aposs non binding if we don t intend on participating we should pull out i think the president will do that wallace all right we have to leave here thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the blue angels flying high and inspiring pride commercial break wallace soldiers placing flags by the 230 000 grave markers at arlington national cemetery pride professionalism precision those are the watchwords of this military unit and on this special weekend that unit is our power player of the week begin videotape ryan bernacchi blue angels commanding officer we re focused on that very precise control of the airplane and flying it to the very best of your ability and you re thinking out ahead ok what aposs next and what aposs next and what s next wallace voice over ryan bernacchi is commander of the blue angels the navy aposs precision flight squadron he aposs in the number one jet leading his team through intricate maneuvers at up to 700 miles per hour with the planes sometimes just 18 inches apart the blue angels were in the area to perform at the u s naval academy and we got to go inside their operation wallace on camera is there a lot of talking going on while you re up in the air bernacchi there is a lot of talking as the leader i m calling acadence ph for every every turn every pull every power change and we re just going to turn left it aposs as simple as coming left and on that go all six sticks will move in unison coming further left a little pull inaudible and when all that gets going we call it we call it fuzz it gets fuzzy because it will it will just take on this rhythm you re feeling the fuzz chris yes wallace i aposm feeling the fuzz bernacchi yes it s something it s it s it aposs crisp but it aposs it s electric wallace voice over admiral chester nimitz started the blue angels in 1946 with f 6 hellcat prop planes to keep up interest in naval aviation after world war ii now they fly f 18 hornets in dozens of shows each year for more than 11 million spectators from a cloudy naval academy to a crystal clear san francisco bay bernacchi i always was going to be a pilot wallace on camera why bernacchi the blue angels wallace voice over bernacchi used to go with his dad to shows in the bay area every summer bernacchi i was that kid and i wanted to fly wallace now he has a nickname bernacchi they call the flight leader boss wingmen will talk to me and hey boss you know and that s the way it it works and then we we do it on the ground as well wallace at the end of the show the blue angels do a maneuver called a loop break cross all six planes headed straight up then in six different directions and then back to the center point bernacchi at about 800 knots of closure so just under 1 000 miles an hour and boy is it is it sweet when we put all that together that that synergy and you feel that fuzz and you get it you get it going and and that aposs really really it aposs it s sweet but it aposs very very intense wallace bernacchi who s flown combat over iraq and afghanistan compares it to operating off an aircraft carrier and he says that aposs the mission of the blue angels to represent their fellow service members who are on the front lines bernacchi it aposs about the navy marine corps they re forward deployed they re they re providing us with our freedom and that s the real work we makes people feel something and and it aposs that pride it aposs the pride this country has in our sailors and
