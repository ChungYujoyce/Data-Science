apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic flournoy in beijing at the recent u s chinese defense talks in beijing the subject of the pentagon s new air sea battle concept a program to counter china s growing anti access and area denial weapons was not discussed michele flournoy undersecretary of defense for policy told reporters in beijing on dec 8 that there was no mention of the secret defense program in asia during her talks with chinese military officials called the defense consultative talks top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches we did discuss the u s posture changes particularly in australia ms flournoy said that was a very straightforward discussion where i had the chance to explain those moves in some detail and to also put them in the context of the intent of our broader policy which is really to continue to invest in our alliance with australia to build the interoperability between our two forces but also to contribute to the stability of the region and reassuring partners in the region the obama administration announced that it was sending several thousand marines to a base on the northern tip of australia strategically located near the contentious south china sea that beijing has claimed as its driveway in southeast asia the lack of mention of the air sea battle concept highlights the secretive nature of the plan which has been under development for several years it is aimed at better coordinating air force and navy forces in the pacific the marines were added to the concept and the army also wants a role possibly for missile defense and cyberwarfare chinese military officials criticized u s arms sales to taiwan during the talks ms flournoy said she defended the arms sales as enhancing efforts to bridge differences between taiwan and the mainland ms flournoy who announced after the trip that she will be stepping down next year said she thought china s briefing on a defense white paper during the talks was a good example of transparency by the secretive chinese military the annual white paper however is viewed by analysts as a vague statement of china s defense goals and provides few details of chinese strategic and military intentions reflecting the sentiments of many sinophile policymakers in the administration ms flournoy appeared to spend a great deal of time in her talks trying to play down the major u s military buildup in asia to counter china s military buildup and insisting to her counterparts that the united states does not view china as an enemy during a meeting with reporters in beijing after the talks she was asked about china s new aircraft carrier which underwent its second round of sea trials recently she dismissed the development as anticipated for a while ms flournoy also played down the statement made by chinese president hu jintao during her visit that the chinese navy should prepare for war i would be very flattered if president hu s comments were directed at this visit but i doubt that s the case she said asked whether the u s posture pivot toward asia announced last month was discussed ms flournoy said the question did come up and we assured gen ma xiaotian and his delegation that the u s does not seek to contain china we do not view china as an adversary that these posture changes were first and foremost about strengthening our alliance with australia other u s defense officials said the air sea battle concept is directed squarely at developing force and alliances that will counter china s growing arsenal of asymmetric warfare arsenal anti satellite weapons anti ship missiles cyberwarfare capabilities and other weapons missile data sharing curbed congress this week approved language in the fiscal 2012 defense authorization bill that will restrict the obama administration from sharing sensitive missile data with russia section 1244 of the conference report approved by house and senate members monday night bans all sharing of classified u s ballistic missile defense data with russia unless the administration notifies congress 60 days in advance the legislation reflects congressional concerns that missile defense talks with moscow will result in the compromise of velocity data for the pentagon s standard missile 3 interceptor known as the sm 3 michael mcfaul the u s ambassador designate to russia confirmed to the senate a report that first appeared in this space that the administration is considering providing moscow with classified velocity technical data on the sm 3 the heart of the pentagon s current missile defense program the data would be offered as a way to try to allay russian fears that u s defenses planned for europe could be used against russian missiles the proposed advance notification to congress requires a detailed description of the classified ballistic missile defense information to be shared the provision also requires an explanation of the national security interest that the administration is disclosing and whether moscow will reciprocate by giving data on its mostly nuclear tipped strategic missile defenses the bill also would require a certification that adequate measures would be in place to prevent the data from leaking or being transferred to third parties the legislation also would require an analysis of the risks to u s missile defense capabilities if the information is shared or transferred to an unauthorized third party the legislation followed an alert by u s security officials to congress that arms control officials were thinking about sharing classified sm 3 data they said doing so would compromise the missile by revealing to potential adversaries sensitive technical parameters that could be used to defeat the missile or to develop ballistic missiles that can outfly it russia s past transfer of military technology to china and iran also is a concern the 669 5 billion bill provides 554 billion for defense and 115 billion for overseas operations the white house initially opposed detainee provisions of the legislation and threatened to veto it but on wednesday reversed itself saying the bill will no longer impinge on intelligence gathering or efforts to stop terrorists a vote was expected in both houses wednesday night other provisions would require new reports on north korea s military foreign missile threats russia s nuclear forces and china s cyberwarfare capabilities new york times protest six retired military analysts have written a joint letter to editors of the new york times protesting a 2008 story about them that won the pulitzer prize the story strongly implied that the retired officers who served as commentators on television and radio had received financial favors from the pentagon the times article also implied that the pentagon program of providing special briefings to retired military officers or rmas as they are called was illegal and violated rules against propaganda the pentagon inspector general last month released its investigation into the program and concluded for the second time that the briefings violated no rule or instruction it said there is no evidence that the analysts received financial favors the government accountability office also found that the pentagon briefings in the donald h rumsfeld era were proper it is a terrible injustice to the bush administration former secretary of defense donald rumsfeld and the military and intelligence agencies we know and love to smear us as the new york times did the analysts said in their letter if the new york times had any shame which perforce it does not they d publicly apologize to those of us who participated in the rma program and were slandered by their fairy tale among the signers are
