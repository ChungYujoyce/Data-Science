thirds of the electorate think the country is on the wrong track what do you do attack relentlessly paint your opponent as extremist volatile clueless unfit dangerous indeed hillary clinton s latest national ad featuring major republican politicians echoing that indictment of donald trump ends thus unfit dangerous even for republicans that was the theme of clinton s famous alt right speech and of much of her 100 million worth of ads problem is it s not working over the last month trump s new team led by kellyanne conway has worked single mindedly to blunt that line of attack on the theory that if he can just cross the threshold of acceptability he wins in an act of brazen rebranding they set out to endow him with stature and empathy stature was acquired in mexico whose president inexplicably gave trump the opportunity to stand on the world stage with a national leader and more than hold his own it s the same stature booster senator barack obama pulled off when he stood with
