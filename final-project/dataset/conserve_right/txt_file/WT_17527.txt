apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion north korean strongman kim jong un s latest visit to beijing last week cannot obscure the fact that china once the primary conduit between washington and pyongyang is at risk of being largely left on the outside the white house has eroded china s leverage by establishing a direct telephone link a virtual hotline to mr kim in fact president donald trump by directly engaging pyongyang over a nuclear and peace deal has effectively cut out the middleman china beijing which values north korea as a strategic buffer against the u s military presence in south korea has reason to be suspicious of mr kim s overtures to america and the trump administration s direct dealings with pyongyang at the center of mr trump s north korea diplomacy is an effort to marginalize china s regional role top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed north korea is china s only formal military ally a 1961 friendship treaty obligates china and north korea to aid each other if attacked but as bilateral relations soured since mr kim assumed power in late 2011 chinese analysts criticized the pact as outdated today beijing fears being sidelined in its own strategic backyard it is apprehensive that just as it turned against the soviet union after the nixon kissinger opening in the early 1970s its estranged ally north korea could similarly switch allegiances mr kim however seems more interested in achieving a limited goal rebalancing his foreign policy by mending fences with the u s so as to lessen north korea s economic and security reliance on its millennial rival china the path to north korea s denuclearization promises to be long and difficult however the trump administration by bypassing beijing and establishing direct links with pyongyang has heightened china s worries mr trump s critics however have claimed that his epochal summit with mr kim was a diplomatic windfall for china they have also accused mr trump of making major concessions in exchange for securing vague commitments with no clear timelines the only concession mr trump made suspension of u s war games with south korea as a gesture of good faith is easily reversible if negotiations do not yield progress regular military training has not been halted to mr trump s credit he has correctly described as very provocative the u s led war games which with live fire drills simulate a full scale invasion of north korea every spring critics are upset that he has lifted the pretense that these war games are routine military exercises and defensive in nature to be sure in what became known as the freeze for freeze formula beijing last september proposed the suspension of the u s war games in exchange for a north korean moratorium on nuclear and missile testing it was mr kim however who undermined the chinese proposal by unilaterally declaring a test moratorium in april without any reciprocal u s concession under barack obama washington helped end myanmar s international isolation with the u s president paying a historic visit to that county in 2012 a trip that led to myanmar cutting its dependence on china now mr trump is encouraging another isolated china dependent state north korea to end its international pariah status north korea is resource rich like myanmar north korea however is armed with potent nuclear and missile capabilities north korea is also a homogenous and regimented society in contrast to ethnically diverse myanmar the seat of the world s longest raging civil war mr trump is right that at this stage transforming the u s north korea relationship matters more than denuclearization if the west encourages mr kim s efforts to modernize the north korean economy just as it aided china s economic rise it will help to moderate pyongyang s behavior economic engagement can achieve a lot more than economic sanctions which counterproductively accelerated north korea s nuclear and missile advances instead of helping north korea to escape from china s clutches u s policy under mr trump s predecessors helped beijing to play the north korea card against america and its regional allies japan and south korea beijing also sought to string the trump led u s along on north korea until washington established direct contact with pyongyang alarmed by washington s diplomatic outreach to pyongyang china s xi jinping has hosted mr kim three times in the past three months mr xi and mr trump as they brace for a trade conflict are both wooing mr kim but mr trump s diplomacy and direct link have given mr kim who has bristled at his country s dependence on china and beijing s backing of united nations sanctions against north korea new leverage with mr xi on bilateral issues even before mr trump took office a shift in america s north korea policy had become imperative with the sanctions only approach proving a conspicuous failure by encouraging pyongyang to rapidly advance its nuclear and missile capabilities mr trump s sanctions with engagement policy has sought to address that imperative by seizing on pyongyang s desire to unlock frozen ties with america and by exploiting the growing strains in the china north korea ties the new policy has initiated a process that even if it does not clear the path to north korean disarmament is likely to undermine long term chinese interests indeed by constricting china s regional leverage and role mr trump s direct diplomacy promises to positively change northeast asian geopolitics brahma chellaney is a geostrategist and the
