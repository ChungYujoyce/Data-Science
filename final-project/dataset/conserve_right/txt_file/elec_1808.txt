dear fellow americans i write to you as the broken and sinful man that i am redeemed only through the divine mercy grace and forgiveness of god i pray that my personal shortcomings or perhaps my obscure connection to your life will not detract from my sincere message at this time in our nation s history when america seems so hopelessly divided where should we turn for hope does our government offer hope does our current president inspire hope does our political affiliation or a particular candidate provide hope no hope comes from god the creator of all things it always has in 1787 at the constitutional convention in philadelphia 81 year old ben franklin proposed prayer as the way to unify the divided assembly the representatives fought for more than a month and seemed destined to fail in drafting the constitution of the united states photo credit ap finally franklin nobly reasoned and identified a clear obstacle to their success googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 franklin s modest suggestion now vexes today s intellectual elitists self loathing americans and revisionist historians of course none of them can black out the irrefutable effort of one of the most remarkable americans of all time though formal customs obstructed franklin s motion during the convention the representatives ultimately relinquished their pride and rose above their differences in the wake of franklin s proposal incredibly some americans still believe that the longest ongoing constitution in world history stems from some random cosmic accident that they believe started an intricately complex world but many of us recognize that this amazing document seems more likely to have been inspired by the divine wisdom of god which our founding fathers indubiltably pursued in fact on april 9 1789 the first constitutional congress the men who wrote the first amendment implemented franklin s prayer proposal with the sagacious wisdom of ben franklin in mind i pray that you see the truth regarding hope and will choose to share this message with our conservative politicians now aspiring to become our next president let them hear our voices and our prayers let us set aside our own foolish pride and selfish desires in doing so we can encourage our leaders to do the same before the stable of talented conservative candidates begin to tear each other down and obsess over one another s flaws versus addressing their own let s encourage them to unite in god perhaps they could hold a 2015 conservative prayer convention to identify the best presidential candidate or the top two among them perhaps they could even broker a potential cabinet essentially electing a dream team of the most qualified patriots photo credit shutterstock let s encourage them to put america first not themselves or their own ambitions let s plead with them to humble themselves implore them to pray together for god s guidance they could decide among themselves who they would support by voting for one of their opponents within their circle through prayer and trusting in god they could surely arrive at a unified consensus franklin s suggestion would also test each candidate s character certainly the candidates who stand for america could humble themselves and work together for our nation those who prefer to paddle alone would reveal themselves for what they are perhaps individuals simply lacking faith or belief in god or bonafide narcissists tarnished by political ambitions which does america need moral leaders or political opportunists imagine a coalition with ted cruz rand paul bobby jindal ben carson mike pense carly fiorina sarah palin chris christie paul ryan stephen forbes ron paul mike huckabee and others presenting to us their top two candidates derived from humbly seeking god s guidance perhaps thomas sowell could even agree to chair the convention as an honest broker talk about hope inspired by god all of us can help the motion catch fire promote franklin s modest idea across social media contact a candidate encourage them to come together in prayer in fact townhall com writer matt barber offered his own version of a 1787 suggestion last week he called for a conservative gop summit and noted that what i would call the franklin like proposal is out there louisiana gov bobby jindal has even given it an amen if one of our candidates would courageously step forward and push the propasal what would that tell us about that candidate what would we learn about the other candidates by their responses what might poll numbers reflect shouldn t we back moral and humble candidates who have the wisdom and confidence to pursue god s guidance we are all in this together unfortuantely not every american is paddling with us some are obsessed with making america just another miserable socialist nation franklin noted during his speech is america not once again facing grave dangers the birth of our great nation sprang from brave individuals who had an intolerance for immorality and injustice they were forced to worship a mortal king and compelled to pay taxes without representation what immoralities and injustices are we being forced to tolerate today what are america s values our forefathers chose to unite and as franklin reminds us they sought and received god s favor they accomplished the unimaginable in defeating the daunting british empire and america has gone on to conquer the wickedness of slavery that continues to plague other nations america s freedom comes from god providing hope to our allies and stirring rage among our enemies as we struggle to find humble and selfless leaders to restore america s most noble values let us not forget our powerful friend if we will humble ourselves in united prayer we too can accomplish the unimaginable a former marine corps officer and a recovering high school english teacher lee culpepper is a christian husband writer and mentor read and share other
