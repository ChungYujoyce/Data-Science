ael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion during special counsel robert mueller s investigation his legal dream team tried to make a secondary case that donald trump also obstructed efforts to prove trump russian collusion president trump was said to have advised his lawyers and other subordinates past and present not to cooperate fully with the mueller investigation yet the special counsel did not pursue any actionable cases of egregious interference by the white house indeed mr mueller would never have concluded his 35 million 22 month investigation had he not enjoyed cooperation from the white house top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey white house employees were questioned freely by the special counsel documents were released when the special counsel s exhaustive investigation into purported trump russia collusion found no such crime the fallback claim of obstruction arose mr trump allegedly wanted to curtail mr mueller s parameters of inquiry into something that was proven not to be a crime mr mueller found no grounds for a criminal referral on obstruction of justice but he repeatedly hinted that mr trump had thought about obstructing the non crime of collusion in the ukrainian melodrama mr trump is accused of the thought crime of considering the withholding of military assistance unless ukraine investigated possible ukrainian tampering in the 2016 u s presidential election and also former vice president joe biden s intervention in ukrainian politics on behalf of his son mr biden had bragged at a council on foreign relations conference that his threats to withhold non military assistance to ukraine led to the dismissal of a prosecutor viktor shokin it turns out mr shokin may have been considering an investigation of the energy company where hunter biden mr biden s son had been given a lucrative position on the board of directors two questions arise from hours of impeachment inquiry testimony before the house intelligence committee one did mr trump cut off military assistance prompting the compliant ukrainians to launch investigations to ensure that endangered military aid was not curtailed two did mr trump reverse prior u s foreign policy by cutting off military assistance thus threatening the security of ukraine regarding question no 1 military assistance was delivered to ukraine after a delay ukrainian president volodymyr zelenskiy never announced investigations of the bidens or election tampering in response to question no 2 the obama administration s policy was to deny significant military assistance to ukraine even non military aid was apparently leveraged by mr biden to force the ukrainians to fire a prosecutor whose role in looking into hunter biden s company is still murky in other words mr trump is accused of thinking about cutting off aid as a lever to force ukrainian investigations yet the prior administration never extended significant military aid and threatened to cancel non military aid over a bothersome prosecutor that disconnect prompts another question is thinking about cutting off military aid to ukraine a greater crime than declining to provide ukraine with significant military aid mr trump is also accused of the thought crime of contemplating bribery critics allege that mr trump wanted ukraine to do him a favor of inestimable value by launching those investigations mr trump supposedly used the gifting power of the u s government to obtain a personal political benefit to his 2020 presidential candidacy but that premise is shaky on a number of grounds mr trump did not receive any such investigatory help from ukraine yet even if ukraine had announced the investigations that mr trump had sought the fact that joe biden chose to run for president in 2020 does not exempt him from government scrutiny of his suspect behavior with regard to ukraine when he was vice president both democrats and republicans seem to agree that corruption is endemic in ukraine and demands constant vigilance as a condition for foreign aid moreover the public did not learn about the bad optics of the bidens in ukraine from trump pressured ukrainian leaks instead mr biden publicly bragged of his own clout in strong arming the ukrainians and ostensibly about how tough he would be as a future president any benefit to mr trump of showcasing mr biden s bad behavior came not from thinking about pressuring ukraine but from mr biden s own braggadocio joe biden not donald trump smeared joe biden s reputation mr trump has been accused of thought crimes not actual crimes mr trump can be indiscreet even crude in his speech but alleged bad thoughts are not crimes at least not outside george orwell s dystopian
