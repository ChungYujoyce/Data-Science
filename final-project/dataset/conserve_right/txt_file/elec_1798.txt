 tampa fl governor mitt romney accepted his party s nomination for the presidency of the united states of america tonight telling rnc delegates that voters face a clear choice in november his remarks focused on his broad executive experience in both the private and public sectors and the future he envisions for america the basic message here s who i am here s where i come from and what i ve done here are my values here s the current state of the union and here are my solutions please join me like paul ryan last night romney drew contrasts with his opponent but his criticisms generally seemed less barbed his was a tone of disappointment not anger though he leads in most polls on voters top three issues the economy jobs and the debt the same surveys also show the gop nominee suffering from a modest to large gender gap and a likeability deficit romney deliberately and aggressively took direct aim at both vulnerabilities this evening he described the strong women who have surrounded him throughout his life and public career he went heavily biographical seizing his chance to finally tell his story unfiltered by attack ads and rich guy stereotypes some passages were beautiful my mom and dad gave their kids the greatest gift of all the gift of unconditional love they cared deeply about who we would be and much less about what we would do unconditional love is a gift that ann and i have tried to pass on to our sons and now to our grandchildren all the laws and legislation in the world will never heal this world like the loving hearts and arms of mothers and fathers if every child could drift to sleep feeling wrapped in the love of their family and god s love this world would be a far more gentle and better place mom and dad were married 64 years and if you wondered what their secret was you could have asked the local florist because every day dad gave mom a rose which he put on her bedside table that s how she found out what happened on the day my father died she went looking for him because that morning there was no rose i grew up in detroit in love with cars and wanted to be a car guy like my dad but by the time i was out of school i realized that i had to go out on my own that if i stayed around michigan in the same business i d never really know if i was getting a break because of my dad i wanted to go someplace new and prove myself those weren t the easiest of days too many long hours and weekends working five young sons who seemed to have this need to re enact a different world war every night but if you ask ann and i what we d give to break up just one more fight between the boys or wake up in the morning and discover a pile of kids asleep in our room well every mom and dad knows the answer to that those days were toughest on ann of course she was heroic five boys with our families a long way away i had to travel a lot for my job then and i d call and try to offer support but every mom knows that doesn t help get the homework done or the kids out the door to school i knew that her job as a mom was harder than mine and i knew without question that her job as a mom was a lot more important than mine and as america sawtuesday night ann would have succeeded at anything she wanted to his subsequent discussion of bain and its many successes signaled that team romney is prepared to go on offense over the candidate s time in the private sector obama s been pounding away all summer distorting romney s record voters are now hearing the other side of that story on policy romney pledged to compartmentalize the myriad distractions of washington and unlike president obama focus intensely on what so many americans need so desperately today jobs romney outlined his now familiar five point plan for reducing unemployment pledged to repeal obamacare affirmed the value of life and religious freedom then delivered the line of the night president obama promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans and heal the planet laughter my promise is to help you and your family this statement drove a stake through the self reverential vacuity of 2008 s hope and change mania and underlined the difficult reality of our nation s current position while assuring americans that a president romney understands how to prioritize and get to work the nominee closed on an uplifting note asking the american people to rally to his cause and build a better future wednesday night was more electric no question about it tonight felt more serious the freaky deaky yet mesmerizing clint eastwood performance notwithstanding marco rubio was sensational he always delivers and makes it look easy a rare talent rubio s message was moving and perfect for the moment this nation is exceptional there s a critical job to be done and mitt romney is the man with the skills and experience to accomplish it the nominee s speech was not flashy or overly dramatic but that s not romney he needed to soften and define his personal image draw clear differences between himself and the president he s challenging convince americans that he s prepared to lead and appear credible and presidential he accomplished these tasks success alabama secretary
