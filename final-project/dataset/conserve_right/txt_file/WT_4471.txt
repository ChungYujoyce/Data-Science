the capitol monday and appropriations is the central thing the new long sought trade agreement with mexico and canada would give both trump and pelosi his top adversary a major accomplishment despite the turmoil of his likely impeachment asked why she would give trump a win pelosi said why wouldn t we pelosi spoke monday night at a wall st journal event the new trade pact would replace the 25 year old north american free trade agreement which eliminated most tariffs and other trade barriers involving the united states mexico and canada critics including trump labor unions and many democratic

back and forth closely monitored by democratic labor allies such as the afl cio have brought the two sides together pelosi is a longtime free trade advocate and supported the original nafta in 1994 trump has accused pelosi of being incapable of passing the agreement because she is too wrapped up in impeachment the original nafta badly divided democrats but the new pact is more protectionist and labor friendly and pelosi is confident it won t divide the party though some liberal activists took to social media to carp at the agreement you don t have to have unanimity you just have to have consensus pelosi said once we go down that path we ll be ok democrats from swing districts have agitated for finishing the accord in part to demonstrate some accomplishments for their majority by ratifying the agreement congress could lift uncertainty over the future of u s commerce with its no 2 canada and no 3 mexico trading partners last year and perhaps give the u s economy a modest boost u s farmers are especially eager to make sure their exports to canada and mexico continue uninterrupted canadian prime minister justin trudeau spoke on the phone with trump on monday about the progress being made trudeau s office said they will stay in touch through the final stages of the negotiations u s trade representative robert lighthizer last year negotiated the replacement agreement with canada and mexico but the new usmca accord required congressional approval and input from top democrats like pelosi and ways and means committee chairman richard neal of massachusetts who have been engaged in lengthy detailed negotiations over enforcement provisions and other technical details republicans leaders and lawmakers have agitated for months for the accord but pelosi has painstakingly worked to bring labor on board democrats see the pact as significantly better than nafta and an endorsement by afl cio president richard trumka could be the key to winning significant democratic support the pact contains provisions designed to nudge manufacturing back to the united states for example it requires that 40 to 45 of cars eventually be made in countries that pay autoworkers at least 16 an hour that is in the united states and canada and not in mexico the trade pact picked up some momentum after mexico in april passed a labor law overhaul required by usmca the reforms are meant to make it easier for mexican workers to form independent unions and bargain for better pay and working conditions narrowing the gap with the united states mexico ratified usmca in june and has budgeted more money later this year to provide the resources needed for enforcing the agreement associated press writers peter orsi in mex
