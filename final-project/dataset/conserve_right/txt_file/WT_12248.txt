apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic beijing a territorial flare up between china and japan intensified tuesday as two beijing sent patrol ships arrived near disputed east china sea islands in a show of anger over tokyo s purchase of the largely barren outcroppings from their private owners the china marine surveillance has drawn up a plan to safeguard china s sovereignty of the islands and the ships were sent to assert those claims said the chinese government s official news agency xinhua the marine agency is a paramilitary force whose ships are often lightly armed the rocky islands known as senkaku to japanese and diaoyu to chinese have been the focus of recurring spats between the countries and also are claimed by taiwan the china japan dispute has been heating up in recent

peacefully and stably public broadcaster nhk said the government and the family signed a deal tuesday the central government does not plan to develop the islands several experts interpreted the move as an attempt to block the plan by tokyo gov shintaro ishihara which could have raised tensions further ishihara also had said he hoped to visit the islands in october ishihara put the national government in a very difficult spot he pushed them into doing this now said sheila smith a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations in washington but she said this was a good outcome that should be seen as an attempt by tokyo to sideline ishihara japan cannot afford to let the dispute hinder its vital ties with china its top trading partner she said smith said tokyo needs to be able to work through different problems with beijing in order to make sure the economic interdependence between those two countries continues to serve both nations needs beijing however responded with fury the determination and the will of the chinese government and military to safeguard their territorial integrity are firm chinese defense ministry spokesman geng yansheng said in a statement we are closely monitoring the development of the situation and reserve the right to take necessary measures japan has claimed the islands since 1895 the u s took jurisdiction after world war ii and turned them over to japan in 1972 but beijing sees the purchase as an affront to its claims and its past calls for negotiations carlyle thayer an expert on regional security at the university of new south wales in australia said the sending of the chinese patrol boats ups the stakes it s a tit for tat response because china is extremely sensitive about sovereignty matters he said japan s coast guard said it has not taken any special measures in response to the chinese patrol boats although it continues to monitor the situation thayer said the chinese boats would likely stop short of entering the 12 nautical miles around the islands that are considered territorial waters and administered by japan japan has a pretty robust navy a very strong and active professional coast guard what is possible are the kinds of confrontations like occurred at scarborough shoal a disputed reef where chinese and philippine boats faced off earlier this year it s all posturing it s a game of who blinks first thayer said beijing s anger has been accompanied by heated reporting in china s state media reactions to japanese actions are sometimes overstated in china and a commentator in the people s liberation army daily the main newspaper of china s military called japan s move the most blatant challenge to china s sovereignty since the end of world war ii china on tuesday also started broadcasting a daily marine weather report for the islands about a dozen protesters gathered outside the japanese embassy in beijing chanting japan get out of china a car drove slowly toward the embassy s well guarded gate but did not make a serious attempt to ram it and was stopped by uniformed and plainclothes police xinhua reported that people had also taken to the streets to protest in two cities in the south and east a number of people waved placards and the chinese flag and shouted defend the diaoyu islands outside the japanese consulate general in southern guangzhou xinhua said about 200 people marched in weihai in shandong province singing the national anthem it said taiwan s foreign ministry also lodged a strong protest to japan it called the island purchase an extremely unfriendly move that not only harms the longtime cooperation between taiwan and japan but will also aggravate regional tensions in east asia top japanese government officials maintain that the flare up hasn t affected official ties with china although deputy prime minister katsuya okada acknowledged that emotions on both sides were being fanned by activists prime minister yoshihiko noda met only briefly with chinese president hu jintao on the sidelines of this past weekend s asia pacific economic cooperation summit in vladivostok russia and japanese news reports said noda emphasized the importance of dealing with the island dispute from a broad perspective china also has announced coordinates marking out the waters off the diaoyu islands that it considers its territory apparently for the first time after doing so earlier for the mainland and other islands the coordinates are another step along with recent announcements of china s intention to use law enforcement vessels to defend its sovereignty claim said stephanie kleine ahlbrandt northeast asia project director for the international crisis group it s primarily about being seen as taking action to pave the way for further actions to assert china s sovereignty she said in tokyo gov ishihara renewed his calls for the islands to be developed for future use by fishermen it appears that the matter is decided he told reporters they say they won t do anything but china s leaders are still criticizing the plan ishihara said he was freezing the 1 4 billion yen 18 million donated toward his purchase plan for the islands and would only release the funds to the government once it was clear whether a port or other facilities would be built he also suggested that japan cooperate with the philippines and vietnam which also have disputes with china in the south china sea we shouldn t see this as an issue that only concerns japan he said foster reported from tokyo associated
