after two years of ominous suspicion 30 million dollars endless warrants and subpoenas dishonest media hysteria and too many wrecked reputations and lives special counsel robert mueller found that neither trump nor his associates colluded with russia to steal the 2016 election and determined that no further investigation on obstruction of justice was warranted and the department of justice concurred even some of the president s fiercest enemies were forced to concede that the mueller report was a complete vindication of the president and his team top stories sex at birth hungary bans

coronavirus aid the resistance lived by the mueller and they ve died by the mueller they are now however too deeply invested in their mission to destroy president trump to permit anything above all the truth to change their course they ve already moved the goalposts again to keep the investigations going what they have done explaining the 2016 election results with the malicious trump russia collusion lie goes way beyond sore loser syndrome it was in fact an attempted coup to remove the duly elected president by weaponizing some of the most fearsome arms of the u s government and the conspirators enjoyed an invaluable constant assist from their media wingmen the entire russia conspiracy orchestrated by high ranking figures in the obama administration hillary clinton campaign and broader leftist network was designed to undermine and then destroy the crass interloper who posed an immediate existential threat to all of them they had to crush him before he could crush them it was also designed to provide maximum distraction away from their potential crimes a multi year special counsel investigation of a sitting president for something that never happened would grant the actual plotters enough time to cover their tracks and run out the clock on various statutes of limitations so they could escape prosecution ensuring that these corrupt players don t slip justice is critical to rightfully restoring mr trump s presidency and the integrity of the doj fbi and other institutions which may be implicated that means investigating everyone who carried out the treacherous acts which they ve been desperately trying to bury actual russian collusion mrs clinton s campaign and the democratic national committee enlisted a left wing opposition research firm fusion gps which hired a former british spy and rabid trump hater christopher steele who sought dirt on mr trump from shadowy russian contacts among others mr steele then compiled a phony dossier on mr trump based on the unsubstantiated uncorroborated nonsense from those sources and helped to pass it off to pivotal figures in the obama administration and friendlies in the media with the lies teed up these figures weaponized them including using them to secure warrants to spy on the trump campaign from the foreign intelligence surveillance court which was not told that the evidence was a pack of political smears derived at least in part from russian sources the use of individuals stefan halper joseph mifsud with known ties to foreign intelligence to target trump associates raises questions about the role of john brennan if a cia director had a hand in domestic political spying it would constitute epic illegality at the highest levels the obama administration wiretapped american citizens including political opponents illegally unmasked gen michael flynn and leaked his name to the press later the former fbi director and his deputy andrew mccabe appear to have set flynn up in an interview with trump hating now fired fbi official peter strzok the late 2015 early 2016 origins of the russian hoax including the original doj fbi probe documents and later the revised mueller scope memo written by deputy attorney general rod rosenstein which authorized the special counsel fishing expedition the corrupt handling of the clinton email server case by the doj and fbi the broader criminal leaks of selective information to journalists who were more than willing to serve as tools of the conspiracy all of this and more cries out for a thorough going investigation fortunately attorney general william barr views his top priority as restoring institutional trust by sanitizing the doj and fbi of their rampant politicization and corruption that means launching a blue ribbon investigation to go wherever the facts may lead among those who may want to put their attorneys on speed dial former attorney general loretta lynch mr comey mr mccabe former acting attorney general sally yates mr strzok former doj lawyer lisa page doj official bruce ohr and his fusion gps employee wife nellie mr brennan former national security adviser susan rice former u n ambassador samantha power former nsc adviser ben rhodes and former director of national intelligence james clapper and then there are the two previously sacred cows at the top former president barack obama and mrs clinton as i first wrote in february 2018 high ranking officials and other major players in those agencies which obama oversaw are increasingly embroiled in the growing scandal given the tight control obama exercised over every part of his administration and agenda the idea that any of these appointees and loyalists freelanced their activities without at least his tacit approval or that of his white house strains credulity indeed this investigation should be conducted expeditiously before applicable statutes of limitations expire if any of these individuals have committed crimes but are permitted to skate because of endless mueller doj stalling the damage to the country will be exponentially worse it s time to fight fire with fire we deserve answers to the sinister fraud perpetrated upon the legitimate president his voters our institutions and the country writ large we must pursue these public enemies with the same tireless vigor they deployed to target mr trump their malignant lie has been exposed now the consequences must begin monica crowley is a columnist for the washing
