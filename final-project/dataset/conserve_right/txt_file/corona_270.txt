national review transgender student s bathroom access case returns to court apparently democrats really are worried about an economic rebound trump s grotesque tweets sessions says trump s anger over russiagate recusal is not all unjustified but stands by decision brexit architect cummings defends decision to travel amid lockdown nrplus member article j onah goldberg wrote a book arguing that we live in part under a tyranny of clich s and one of the most shopworn of clich s the cure is worse than the disease is at the moment at the forefront of our public discourse millions of lives and untold trillions in wealth and income may be saved or lost as the result of public policies shaped by that clich in the matter of the coronavirus epidemic and our response to it the question is the cure worse than the disease is almost useless because it asks us to judge one discrete thing we know against a half dozen critical things we do not know what we know right now is that the u s economy and the world economy which nationalists note matters quite a bit to our own national prosperity is cratering while the coronavirus still is spreading this seems from the point of view of right this moment intolerable or unsustainable in the antiseptic language of american journalism but is it intolerable it seems intolerable because it is very painful and because it is very painful right now as individuals and more important as a polity we suffer from what is sometimes known as present bias meaning that we assign more weight and relevance to things we are experiencing right now if you were in possession of a crystal ball that could tell you the future with absolute reliability and you learned that departing from our current course of action would produce both public health and economic effects that would be much much worse than what we are experiencing right this moment then the conditions prevailing at right this moment would not be judged intolerable at all they would be considered relatively desirable relative not to the recent past or to our best hopes for the future but relative to a much worse outcome in the same way we go to doctors and pay them great sums of money to do things to us that would seem intolerable if not for our knowledge that these horrifying experiences chemotherapy for example prevent something far worse if you were just being forced to undergo chemotherapy with no context you would believe that you were being tortured by evil men not treated by men who wish you well if you were subjected to the rigors of military training and military life with no explanation you would think you were being abused not that your apparent tormentors were trying to save your life what we know is that there is economic pain in the present and that this is associated with what is at best an imperfect prophylactic strategy against the coronavirus what we do not know makes for a longer list these problems are present in most political decision making albeit usually with lower stakes we generally misunderstand the relevant questions or as often we misrepresent the question for example advocates of higher minimum wages will sometimes point to a time and a place in which a higher minimum wage has been imposed and unemployment either decreased or at least failed to increase and then they will say this shows that increasing the minimum wage does not increase unemployment but the relevant comparison is not between the labor market before the minimum wage increase and the labor market after the minimum wage increase it is between the labor market before the minimum wage increase and the future labor market that would have existed without the minimum wage increase it may be that a market with 4 percent unemployment before the minimum wage increase held steady after a 50 percent increase in the minimum wage it also may be the case that without that hike in the minimum wage the unemployment rate would have dropped to 3 percent or to 2 percent this is the right question but it is a question that is of no political value because it cannot be answered with any confidence people in politics are people in the business of pretending that they have simple answers to complex questions they are not in the business of frankly admitting that they do not know what the actual results of their policies are or even what they were and that they have no way of knowing and so we must approach the clich of the moment is the cure worse than the disease with a degree of humility and with a high degree of caution about the incentives that shape the decisions of political actors the authorities in beijing tried to cover up the facts of the coronavirus epidemic for reasons of narrow political self interest they did not wish to create a crisis that would undermine the economy president trump made rosy pronouncements about the epidemic in its early days contradicting some of his most intelligent advisers for precisely the same reason it is worth keeping in mind that the administration s efforts to prevent a stock market selloff were entirely unsuccessful and that the president s optimistic public health pronouncements did not come to pass which is to say the effort to stave off present economic pain in the face of some notional future public health crisis prevented neither the economic pain nor the public health crisis it would be a bitter thing to repeat such a mistake in such a short period of time when adolf hitler was making war on the united kingdom and europe the question that commanded the attention of the american people was whether they could trust president franklin roosevelt to make the right decision for the right reason and the conclusion a great many of them reached was no antiwar sentiment was by no means restricted to cranks and anti semites such as charles lindbergh so intense and widespread was hostility to entering the war that the republican nominee interventionist wendell willkie felt the need to court if only halfheartedly the isolationists while president roosevelt himself was obliged on the eve of the 1940 election to declare your boys are not going to be sent into any foreign wars we will not send our army navy or air forces to fight in foreign lands except in case of attack the japanese attack on pearl harbor rendered that promise moot things might have gone differently patrick j buchanan has one vision of what might have been and philip roth had another the problem for the united states is that there is unlikely to be a coronavirus pearl harbor a dramatic clarifying event that points clearly toward the necessary course of action what we have is donald trump nancy pelosi and mitch mcconnell meditating upon a half understood clich and trying to answer unanswerable questions and trying to do so with one eye on the icu and the other on the unemployment office get our conservative analysis delivered right to you
