from rich lowry writing in national review everyone knew that christie was going to come after rubio hard and yet rubio let himself get steamrolled he either got rattled by the assault or thought he was sticking to his message by bringing it back to the point that obama s intentions not his lack of experience accounts for the disasters of his administration of course rubio only validated christie s attack on him by seeming so relentlessly scripted the moment already has dominated the post debate discussion and will continue to do so the clips of rubio saying the same thing is just irresistible to tv producers what rubio needed to do more than anything in that moment was show that he could stand up to christie there is obviously a risk to rubio that the exchange will now change the narrative of his candidacy and if he underperforms in new hampshire and can t finish significantly higherthan kasich christie and bush it will be an inflection point for his campaign on the other hand there s always the chance that the pundits will obsess on the moment more than voters rubio was strong the rest of the debate trump was clearly under informed as usual he lost control of himself a couple of times and jeb zinged him on eminent domain otherwise he kept his head down and besides jeb no one hit him in fact cruz went out of his way not to follow up on his harsh critiques of him from earlier in the week perhaps gravity is dragging trump down anyway but there was nothing in this debate that would particularly hurt him and i imagine his robustly pro police answer was a winner cruz had a rough first 15 minutes ducking donald and trying to extricate himself from the carson controversy a little awkwardly but he was good throughout if not very memorable besides the powerful personal answer on drug addiction he presumably wants trump not rubio to win new hampshire and in that respect had to be very pleased how the night went read the rest of the article here politicsgop new hampshire debatenational reviewnew hampshirenew hampshire 2016 presidential primaryrich lowry please let us know if you re having issues with commenting copyright 2020 breitbart
