 indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic dharmsala india the question looms over this raggedy hillside town a place where ancient mysticism constantly brushes against the realities of modern geopolitics the monks who fled across the himalayas ask it quietly as do the exile politicians even the angry young activists are careful how they raise the issue but as the man at the center of the tibetan exile movement approaches his 75th birthday the question has become inescapable what happens after the dalai lama dies top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches the issue echoes far from dharmsala the dalai lama s home since he fled tibet after a failed 1959 uprising against chinese rule implications range from policy decisions in beijing to widespread fears within tibet and among its 150 000 exiles that their struggle for autonomy may collapse with the death of their icon it is something the dalai lama himself thinks about all the time when i pass away when i die of course there will be a setback very serious setback the dalai lama said quietly in a recent interview in his private hilltop compound speaking in his often tangled english his words spilled out in bursts and he could veer suddenly between resignation and determination but then this younger generation will carry this on there is no question that younger generation however isn t so sure right now we are under his holiness leadership said tenzin norlha a 29 year old tibetan genetics researcher in dharmsala her face creased with worry although the dalai lama is thought to be in reasonable health he has struggled with a series of ailments in recent years and turns 75 in july after he passes away then what will we see who can take care of us as his holiness has done it is hard to exaggerate the hold that the dalai lama like his predecessors over the centuries has over tibetans to them he is a king the leader of tibetan buddhism and the embodiment of compassion he is the presence the holder of the white lotus the absolute wisdom the ocean his presence often reduces his followers to speechless weeping for nearly 500 years the tradition has continued with each dalai lama reincarnated after his death into the body of a tibetan boy but with tibet s leadership in exile and an aging dalai lama tibetan history is at a precipice once the dalai lama dies the whole exile structure is going to be under enormous pressure said robbie barnett a tibet scholar at columbia university possible aftershocks include a rival dalai lama anointed inside china still home to about 5 4 million tibetans squabbling among various buddhist sects a plunge in donations infighting in the exile government and a drop in interest among wealthy foreign supporters and young activists in many ways the dalai lama is a man who could be undone by his own charisma behind the monk s robes he might look like a midwestern 1960s retiree with a buzz haircut oversized glasses maroon polyester socks and orthopedic shoes but decades of visitors have talked about his ability to make intense personal connections he laughs loudly and slaps playfully at people he barely knows his most fervent western supporters revere him as a mystical amalgam of nelson mandela and yoda and his wealthy and powerful allies range from actor richard gere to house speaker nancy pelosi he will be a hard man to supersede the tibetan government is now standing on the strength of one man said jamyang norbu a writer who once fought for the small long disbanded tibetan guerrilla army he is one of the most outspoken intellectuals favoring complete tibetan independence as opposed to the limited autonomy the dalai lama now demands mr norbu worries about the personality cult that surrounds the dalai lama and the way his godlike status can make it difficult for dissenting voices to be heard in many ways i am loyal to him but it s difficult to have an independent point of view in the exile community he said from his tennessee home the dalai lama the 14th in the line of reincarnations at times has insisted that his reincarnation would be born in exile at times also said the tradition could end with his death he has talked about dividing his power with his reincarnation carrying on spiritual duties while someone else perhaps someone he appoints takes up the leadership of the exile movement he regularly meets with high ranking monks to discuss his succession the group includes the karmapa a 24 year old monk known for his daring escape from china and appreciation of playstation war games many observers think he is being groomed to take on more power in public the dalai lama often treats the issue lightly his advisers are hoping my life may remain infinite he said laughing but he is clearly sending up trial balloons gauging what his followers will accept after he dies as always beijing s potential reactions are weighed there s a fear that unless we can strengthen the exile government before his holiness passes away the chinese will make a strong attempt to control his reincarnation process mr norbu said china has left little doubt that it intends to be deeply involved in the dalai lama s succession ridiculing his scenarios and insisting that religious law requires that the reincarnation be born in a tibetan area under chinese control this means a government led by fierce atheists may soon be trying to steer an ancient mystical process using monks loyal to beijing to install a china approved successor the dalai lama shrugs at the idea this is very possible he said adding that no one will be fooled one dalai lama is official one dalai lama is dalai lama of the tibetan heart such a move would echo beijing s tactics with the panchen lama one of the leading figures in tibetan buddhism in 1995 when the dalai lama named a boy as the reincarnated panchen lama that boy disappeared and has not been seen since another boy backed by beijing was soon named the official reincarnation though he has little support among tibetans it was different in 1938 when after a series of mystical signs a tibetan boy named lhamo dhondrub was announced at age 3 to be the reincarnation of the 13th dalai lama the new dalai lama was enthroned in a feudal himalayan kingdom that had remained deeply isolated until well into the 20th century it was a place where indentured servitude was common where telephones were nearly unknown and where in the 1930s a politician was sentenced by the tibetan government to having his eyeballs removed for trying to use black magic to kill a rival the dalai lama found himself jousting with china while he was still a teenager in 1950 when he was 15 chinese soldiers invaded tibet nine years later as talks with beijing collapsed and a tibetan uprising was crushed the dalai lama fled with a few supporters across the mountains into india over the past half century the once feudal king has become a master of the modern world he is an ascetic buddhist monk long accustomed to celebrities who want to prostrate themselves before him he travels and lectures constantly he has raised tens of millions of dollars for the tibetan cause supporting everything from orphanages to a soccer team he has become an international symbol of peace in beijing though he s something different a jackal wearing a monk s robe one china appointed tibetan official said a demon said another beijing accuses the dalai lama of being a splittist who is secretly plotting tibet s complete independence from china tibetan exile leaders and independent human rights observers meanwhile say china is systematically stripping tibet of its heritage ethnic han chinese are pouring into the region while beijing has arrested generations of political activists and oversees a vast military and intelligence network that reaches into nearly every village and monastery while the dalai lama still advocates talks with china the discussions have limped along for years he has few other choices so far dialogue failed but that does not mean in future no possibility he said in the dharmsala interview he insists one minute that change is at hand but then says he is always disappointed eventually all these hopes disappear today increasing numbers of tibetans are putting their hopes in a new generation of political leaders in 2011 tibetans will choose the exile government s next prime minister an election widely seen as the most democratic yet for the exiles reflecting the constant tug here between tradition and modernity exile politicians have long tried to do what they think the dalai lama wants while the dalai lama says politicians need to make their own decisions in a way it s like saying who will be our next leader said tenzin choeying of the activist group students for a free tibet without mentioning his holiness this is a way of addressing the issue of his death he insists the movement will succeed one day people say we re dreamers but the same thing might have been said about indians who wanted independence from england in the 1890s that pervading sense of hope is perhaps the strangest thing about dharmsala this town of tibetans and wandering hippies with its astrologers crystal shops and enough yoga masters to form a small but exceedingly limber army the dalai lama despite his occasional lapses into pessimism is hopeful that things will improve in tibet the activists are also hopeful even the state oracle is hopeful the oracle is an avuncular 52 year old monk named thupten ngodup who during trances is said to be able to communicate with the spirit world and look into the future he is a powerful political and spiritual adviser to the tibetan exile government and the dalai lama mr ngodup who fled tibet as a child has no doubt that he ll return perhaps my hope might sound a little stupid he said in his monastery office but in this century the era of dictatorship
