focus on ending american overseas entanglements one of his key campaign promises but his goal of swift withdrawals in syria iraq and afghanistan have been stymied by concerns from u s officials and american allies about the dangerous voids that would remain as he faces an impeachment inquiry at home trump has appeared more focused on making good on his political pledges even at the risk of sending a troubling signal to american allies abroad key republican leaders in congress appeared taken aback by the move house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif said monday in an appearance on fox friends that he had not spoken with trump about the decision and had concerns i want to make sure we keep our word for those who fight with us and help us he said adding that if you make a

monday morning writing in all caps that we will fight where it is to our benefit and only fight to win in december trump announced he was withdrawing american troops from syria but was met with widespread condemnation for abandoning kurdish allies to the turkish assault the announcement prompted the resignation in protest of then defense secretary jim mattis and a coordinated effort by then national security adviser john bolton to try to protect the kurds since january u s officials have tried to broker the creation of a safe zone in northern syria to provide a security buffer between the turkish military and kurdish forces but turkey has repeatedly objected to its slow implementation the white house announcement sunday came a day after erdogan offered the strongest warning yet of a unilateral military operation into northeastern syria as the turkish military has been dispatching units and defense equipment to its border with the area we have given all kinds of warning regarding the area east of the euphrates to the relevant parties we have acted with enough patience erdogan said the kurdish led syrian democratic forces threatened to respond forcefully to any turkish incursion we will not hesitate to turn any unprovoked attack by turkey into an all out war on the entire border to defend ourselves and our people sdf spokesman mustafa bali tweeted saturday a kurdish official speaking on condition of anonymity because he s not authorized to brief reporters said monday they expect a limited turkish operation and are still working to ascertain what will

in northeastern syria where they have been working with turkish troops to an unspecified out of the way location there have been u s troops around manbij the official added that if turkey goes ahead with the incursion into syria it is expected to trigger a large combat response from the sdf and u s troops will almost certainly withdraw completely from syria the official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations u s defense leaders have long known that america would not get into an all out war with turkey a nato ally but that has been stalled until now by aggressive negotiations by the u s urging turkey against invading the official said senior leaders never believed that the u s would go to war to save the kurds but just hoped to put off that scenario the official said u s leaders have spoken with the sdf and that the group which has long fought alongside the u s against is is disappointed and angry mattis and other pentagon leaders had worried that withdrawal would lead to a resurgence of is in the country particularly if the sdf abandon the prisons holding the fighters to battle turkey the white house statement sunday said turkey will take
