trying to use this summit indirectly to put pressure on north korea top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century north korean tensions concern about north korea s belligerence is as high as ever with inexperienced kim jong un taking the leadership role late last year and pyongyang s announcement that it will launch a satellite into space in mid april on a long range rocket the obama administration which had just reached an agreement with north korea to suspend nuclear tests uranium enrichment and long range missile launches in exchange for food aid has called the launch announcement highly provocative both japan and the u s said a launch using ballistic missile technology would violate u n security council resolutions south korean foreign minister kim sung hwan said there are other international forums particularly six party talks for dealing with north korea but he said the discussion on nuclear security in seoul should send a message to pyongyang that the international community supports peace on the korean peninsula north korea has labeled the summit an unsavory burlesque that is intended to justify an atomic attack a broader focus the white house insists that the summit in north korea s backyard will focus on a host of international nuclear proliferation issues although pyongyang s absence will demonstrate its decision to continue its nuclear program despite severe international sanctions the nuclear security summit is not about north korea danny russell told reporters tuesday it is about the challenges of securing fissile material it s about the commitment of the participating nations to honor their pledges and their commitments and it s about the emerging role of the republic of korea as a significant contributor to the global good north korea will be the odd man out the international community also is grappling with the immediate threat of how to resolve peacefully the subject of iran s nuclear ambitions and the summit will also provide an opportunity for mr obama to continue to push for more international pressure on syrian president bashar assad earlier this week russia and china joined the u n security council in voicing support for arab league envoy kofi anna s bid to end violence that has brought syria to the brink of war russia and china have twice vetoed resolutions condemning mr assad s assault on demonstrators

visit his third to south korea for a sunday photo op trip to the demilitarized zone separating the two countries every u s president since ronald reagan has visited the dmz mr obama didn t venture there during his first two trips the visit itself is a demonstration of the president s gratitude for the service of the americans on the peninsula and his personal investment in this alliance and his personal commitment to the security of the republic of korea ben rhodes a white house national security adviser told reporters ahead of the trip the host s big stage against that backdrop south korea president lee myung bak will host the summit that serves as the final international highlight of his five year term which ends next february mr lee has made south korea s emerging international prominence a focus of his administration and has maintained a close relationship with mr obama it s clearly another feather in the cap of a south korean president who talked about global korea said victor cha former director of asian affairs on the national security council under the second president bush he hosted the g 20 won the bid for the 2018 winter olympics and now is hosting the nuclear summit they are three very clear benchmarks for his view that korea should be more global and should not simply be wrapped around the axle about north korea mr cha chairman of the korea program at the center for strategic and international studies said mr lee s success on the international stage stands in contrast to his status as a lame duck leader at home generally his reputation and the reputation of korea internationally is quite high mr cha said unfortunately within korea it s the complete opposite he gets no credit for any of this stuff and he s terribly unpopular inside of his country fukushima s impact while the summit s focus is preventing terrorists from getting their hands on nuclear weapons the nuclear disaster in fukushima japan also looms large over the conference it
