 of the trump legal team weighs in on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday july 16 2017 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news host i m chris wallace new revelations about a meeting between trump family members and russian operatives shake washington just as the senate gets ready for a make or break vote on health care begin videotape donald trump president of the united states my son is a wonderful young man he took a meeting with a russian lawyer most people would aposve taken that meeting rep nancy pelosi d cali minority leader that s just an arrogant disregard for what is ethical wallace voice over we ll discuss how donald jr aposs meeting affects the potential case against the president with jay sekulow a member of the trump legal team then republicans make changes to their health care bill but some in the party say it aposs still not enough sen rand paul r kentucky i can apost vote for something that doesn apost repeal obamacare and doesn apost fix it wallace we ll ask senator rand paul one of the biggest critics of the bill what more needs to be done to finally replace obamacare on camera plus senate republicans put off a vote this week as one of their own deals with his own health issue voice over we ll ask our sunday panel what happens if the gop fails to keep a major promise all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace and hello again from fox news in washington first some breaking news senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has put off that big health care about this week while senator john mccain recovers from surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye we ll have much more on the effort to repeal and replace obamacare a little later first our top story for months donald trump and his team have tried to put questions about links to russian interference in the election behind them but that is now much tougher with a stream of revelations about a meeting donald trump jr and other campaign officials held with russian operatives last summer expecting to get damaging information about hillary clinton how does this affect the credibility of the trump white house and what does it mean for at least four investigations into possible collisions joining me now is jay sekulow a member of the president aposs legal team jay since the story first broke about possible links between the trump campaign and russia the president and his team have repeatedly dismissed this as a hoax and fake news here are a few examples begin video clip donald trump jr son of president trump it aposs disgusting it aposs so phony that exactly goes to show you what the dnc and what the clinton camp will do they will lie and do anything to win president trump i have nothing to do with russia and even for anything what do i have to do with russia wallace was there any contact in any way between trump or his associates and the kremlin or cutouts they had mike pence vice president of the united state of course not why would there be any contacts between the campaign president trump the entire thing has been a witch hunt and there is no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign but i can only speak for myself and the russians zero end video clip wallace jay do you now acknowledge that all of those denials are at the very least suspect jay sekulow trump legal team no you ve got to put them in context of what the president said and exactly what took place here chris i think it aposs important to put the framework here how did we end up with a special counsel here aposs how the former fbi director was the fbi director at the time james comey had a series of meetings with the president of the united states in those meetings he took notes he put them on his government computer put them in his government desk and when he was terminated from position which you would ph acknowledge that the president had the authority to do he gave them to a friend of his to leak to the press so conversations he had with the president of the united states crosstalk wallace jay i m aware of the history but this doesn apost have anything to do with my question which is whether or not whether or not there were contacts crosstalk sekulow chris it has everything wallace can you answer the question does this sekulow i m going to answer your question i am and you aposre going to let me answer it so i m going to finish what i was saying wallace it depends on how long we re going to take to get there sekulow not long chris he leaked the information for one purpose and one purpose only to his friend and he said to get a special counsel and the special counsel is appointed so the entire premise upon which this entire investigation has been based was based on illegally leaked information including conversation with the president the president of the united states and today it aposs announced that james comey has signed a book deal where he aposs going to discuss all this you tell me you think that aposs ok wallace i m not asking about any of that i m asking about crosstalk wallace wait a minute jay you said let me let you finish now let me finish the question i m asking you is very simple the president his vice president his son repeatedly denied any contacts with the russians given what we aposve learned this week about the contact between a number of top campaign officials including the president aposs son are all those denials that that aposs just fake news and a hoax are those suspect sekulow i just answer the question on why the president aposs statements have been clear on what this was involving in his view and i gave you just now the analysis on how in fact this investigation started wallace but that s not the question i asked but let s go if we can crosstalk sekulow chris let aposs not go through that again it was the question you asked crosstalk wallace no it wasn apost the question you the question i asked you jay is whether or not the denials are suspect i didn apost ask you about james comey sekulow i do not think the denials are suspect i do not think the denial by the president of the united states is suspect at all wallace here aposs the email exchange in june of 2016 between don jr setting up the meeting between don jr and the russians rob goldstone writes the crown prosecutor of russia met with his father aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate hillary and her dealings with russia and would be very useful to your father this is obviously very high level and sensitive information that is part of russia and its government support for mr trump don jr responds if that s what you say if it aposs what to say i love it especially later in the summer doesn apost that contradict the denial of any contact between the trump campaign and the russians sekulow i mean what it states was that there was going to be a meeting you said the russians this was a lawyer who was russian that was this was a lawyer who ended being was russian and what took place at that meeting and it aposs been well reported and you reported this as well the discussions involving the magnitsky act and russian adoptions it was quickly ended it was in the middle of a campaign and look this idea that it may have involved opposition research which never materialized evidently the fact is you know that the ukrainians at the very same time or working with the dnc and the clinton campaign to get what opposition research on donald trump and his associates wallace but sekulow so everybody aposs acting as if ok go ahead wallace well what i was going to say is doesn apost it indicate you say well it was a meeting about adoption we ll get to that in a moment sekulow yes wallace but he fact of the matter is the reason that don jr went into that room and jared kushner went into that room and paul manafort went into that room was not to talk about adoption it s because they had been promised sekulow right wallace they ve been promised by rob goldstone that there would be information as part of the russian government aposs effort to tip the election to president trump sekulow yes and of course nothing in that meeting that would have taken place even if it was about the topic of an opposition research paper from a russian lawyer is a legal or a violation of the law and by the way i m not the only lawyer and you know this chris most lawyers many i would say a vast majority of lawyers that you ve interviewed and others have interviewed on your network and other networks have acknowledged that the meeting itself and those proposed discussion would not have been a violation of the law wallace but the point is it does show intent willingness perhaps not actual collusion because apparently and in fact none of us know what really went on to the meeting but assuming that at least on that point everybody is telling the truth doesn apost it show intent and willingness on the part of don jr and jared and paul manafort to collude with the russians and let me just point out natalia veselnitskaya was not just some russian off the street she had close ties to people in the kremlin sekulow well number one if it was the discussion was going to be about if it was going to be about russian opposition research that a russian lawyer had the fact is those goes on you know that goes on the campaigns all the time opposition research is a big part of campaigning i just gave you the example crosstalk wallace it doesn apost go on with russians all the time jay sekulow well now but look this was here s what happened first of all nothing happened there d be no exchange of information but in and of itself that meeting the relevancy of the differential that you just put forward the relevancy of whether it was a russian lawyer or other individuals that donald trump jr knew the fact is what took place during that meeting even on the basis of the emails as donald trump jr laid them out were not violations of the statutes so when you talk about russian collusion colluding to do what what colluding to violate what law wallace well let aposs talk about the legality of the meeting sekulow yes wallace the u s code and let aposs put it up sekulow yes wallace bars a foreign national of giving money or quote thing of value in connection with an election and it bars anyone from soliciting such assistance sekulow right wallace wasn apost the trump campaign in agreeing to that meeting not talking about what happened but what they thought when they went into that meeting wasn apost it soliciting something of value which was the kremlin as they believed it the kremlin s effort to tip the election to donald trump sekulow well number one they didn apost solicit the meeting and you know that by reviewing the emails the meeting wallace but they agreed to it and crosstalk wallace they agreed to it and in fact donald trump said i love it and he agreed to the meeting on the 25th floor of trump tower sekulow the opposition research if it would have materialized is not a thing of value there aposs never been a case that has said that opposition research is a thing of value and by the way there s been fec lawyers federal election commission lawyers that have talked about that as well so i think chris you don apost conflate i don apost think it aposs appropriate to conflate the exact transition as it was laid out in those emails which was not a solicitation by the trump campaign to get information it was an offer of opposition research compare that to what took place with the ukrainians and the dnc where they were working in collusion with each other or when the dnc was leaking to one of the other networks the questions that they were going to ask during the debates so everyone aposs acting as if there aposs this massive collusion statute that only applies here the fact is there is no collusion statute period wallace well there are a couple of points here and one of them is that you seem to be sliding over the fact that this wasn apost cnn that was given questions to hillary clinton this was according to the offer that was being made by rob goldstone this was the kremlin a hostile power offering information christopher wray the president aposs own fbi director nominee saw it this way take a look begin video clip christopher wray fbi director nominee to the members of this committee any threat or effort to interfere with our elections from any nation state or any non state actor is the kind of thing the fbi would want to know end video clip wallace he is not saying any actual sekulow right wallace interference he is saying any offer is something the fbi would want to know would you agree that donald jr and jared and paul manafort should have notified the fbi sekulow here s what this is what chris wray just said he would investigate any type of involvement of interference the president of the united states has said precisely the same thing he said that on multiple occasions you could go back and check the record on this the president said to james comey if satellites were doing something remember that whole statement but here what do you have what took place between what we know took place was not a violation of the law there aposs not a violation of the law the question is russia s other engagement on a global scale as directed to the united states that aposs being investigated i and the president has asked vladimir putin himself about that talk to him about that on multiple occasions when they were just at the g20 so this idea that this that what chris wray said is somehow inconsistent with what the president said i think is a false narrative it aposs not true wallace in our sekulow they are not inconsistent statements yes go ahead wallace you began this interview by going after james comey for leaking information for writing a book sekulow yes yes wallace in our last interview last month you were sharply critical of james comey and i want to play some of that for you begin video clip sekulow i can apost discuss that and i would not discuss that with you unlike james comey who leaks information to the press i actually respect the attorney client privilege apparently he did not end video clip wallace jay you said that a couple of times and that interview let me ask you with the attorney client privilege exists between the president and the fbi director sekulow well there aposs the presidential executive privileges and there s the deliberative privilege so there s two privileges that acquire there wallace there s no attorney you would agree there aposs no attorney client privilege sekulow well james comey is an attorney but in the case of his conversation crosstalk wallace but he aposs not acting as an attorney he is acting as fbi director sekulow right but you crosstalk wallace he doesn apost work as the personal attorney for the president sekulow no of course not wallace well ok so that s sekulow but he has he held it chris i want to be clear he has an executive privilege no one denies that there was a privilege that existed between the president of the united states and james comey and james comey willfully without the consent of the white house or the president released information that was covered by that privilege wallace but he doesn t the point sekulow that aposs illegal wallace the point i m trying to make jay that when you suggest that james comey violated attorney client privilege that really misunderstands the role of the fbi director he aposs not the president aposs private lawyer sekulow chris i have the attorney client privilege and that was the context of what i said i have the attorney client privilege unlike james comey i respect the attorney client privilege as james comey should have respected the executive privilege and the deliberative privilege that he waved which he had no authority to do in order to get evidently a special counsel and a book deal wallace one final question well he got the book deal because he got fired by the president who s sekulow do you think ok do you think it aposs ok that in the book deal according to the press reports that he aposs going to go into details on his conversations with the president do you think that aposs good do you think that aposs ok wallace i asked the questions you answer them jay let me ask you sekulow you won apost answer that one ok go ahead go ahead wallace let me ask you one final question and i hope you can answer this who aposs paying you and all of the outside lawyers sekulow so i am retained by the main law firm that aposs involved in the representation of the president and that is the kasowitz firm i m retained of counsel so our billing that i would do for this kind of case goes to his firm and they pay us wallace yes but you aposre kind of ducking the question who aposs paying them sekulow no no i don t crosstalk wallace obviously marc kasowitz is paying you who s paying them sekulow that situation is between mr kasowitz s firm and whoever is paying whatever entities paying them we are sub paid by the we re just of counsel so i can apost give you i m not in privity of contract as we say in the law with a person or the organization that aposs paying for bills to the kasowitz firm wallace do you know if president trump is personally paying for his private legal defense because the reason i ask is sekulow i don t know wallace there s talk that the campaign committee is paying there is talk about an effort to have the rnc pay sekulow yes wallace so this is an issue sekulow yes but that s none of those would be illegal or outside the norm i mean that happens in these cases i can t answer your question because i don t know wallace i m just trying to get an answer sekulow yes well i don t i m not in privity of contract as we say with the party that s responsible for the actual payment of the bill i m just of counsel to the kasowitz firm for the purposes of this case wallace well jay i think it went better than last time and you know we re going to still keep trying to get this sekulow well i don apost mind a good joust a good joust is all right even early in the morning wallace jay thank you thanks for your time this sunday sekulow thank you chris i appreciate it wallace up next we ll bring in our sunday group to discuss whether the don jr meeting is more fake news or the first hard evidence this is a real scandal commercial break begin video clip trump jr i m more than happy to be transparent and i m more than happy to cooperate with everyone sean hannity fox news host so as far as you know as far this is incident is concerned this is all of it trump jr this is everything this is everything end video clip wallace donald trump jr telling sean hannity he had disclosed the full story about his meeting with a russian lawyer that was three days before we learned there was someone else in the room with reported links to soviet intelligence and it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume dr ezekiel emanuel one of the architects of obamacare and author of the new book prescription for the future julie pace washington bureau chief of the associated press and the head of heritage action for america michael needham well julie how badly does the white house officials in the white house think all the revelations this week about the don jr meeting how badly has a damage their effort to sideline this whole thing as fake news julie pace washington bureau chief the associated press well in terms of sidelining it i think this does a lot of damage and when you talk to white house officials after the first couple of revelations about this meeting there was a change you could tell that they knew that this was more serious they knew that this was going to be harder to talk their way out of for a couple reasons one we aposre talking with the president aposs son two we aposre talking about actual emails that say in black and white that they were told this was part of a russian government to help trump and three the president s son then released those emails himself so it wasn t anonymous sources it wasn apost something that could blame on the intelligence agencies and say it was coming from disgruntled officers i do think the overall strategy from the white house as you saw from the president aposs lawyer is going to be to fight back to try to say that even though you see these emails even though you know this meeting happen there was nothing there and to continue to deny that there is any there is any reason for any of these committees and the mueller investigation to continue wallace i get i have an understanding that there really is a lot of disarray that these legal teams particularly the legal team for don jr and the legal team for jared are at cross purposes as to how to handle this that nobody in the white house feels they can coordinate because if they do talk to the outside lawyers they re going to end up being called to testify before the committee and i also understand that there is growing concern about the kind of dual role of jared and ivanka are they top officials are they family are they in particularly in jared aposs case potential subjects of an investigation this becomes very very hard for a white house to manage pace this is really complicated internally because you have people who have interests that are starting to diverge who are all working in the white house who are related to the president and they have their own legal teams and these legal teams are looking out for the client and if your client is jared kushner that is your top priority not the president of the united states despite the fact that jared kushner is married to the president aposs daughter don jr he s going to have a legal team that is going to be focused on his interest and frankly a lot of people in the white house think the president aposs legal team has not been doing the president a great service at this point wallace here aposs how president trump defended the donald jr meeting this week begin video clip trump it aposs called opposition research or even research into your opponent i ve had many people i have only been in politics for two years but i ve had many people call up oh gee we have information on this factor or this person or frankly hillary that aposs very standard in politics end video clip wallace brit does that explanation fly and as a veteran as i am of a lot of washington scandals that we have covered how damaging do you think this week s revelations were brit hume fox news senior political analyst the revelations are damaging in one particular sense which is it means that there aposs no end in sight for this firestorm and once you have as julie was explaining and you were pointing out all these people getting lawyers and preparing to testify and all the rest of it the burden on the white house is enormous there was already a burden on this white house to fight these allegations whether they add up to anything illegal is a separate matter from what i m talking about i m talking about the political consequence of this which is very serious because it means that this is the atmosphere in which this administration and this white house is going to have to operate going forward and then it begins to matter chris about how well staff the white house is how will staff the administration is and all the rest of it an administration and white house can become paralyzed by this kind of thing and that that among other things is one of the dangers faced here the explanation the president gave just isn apost sufficient dr ezekiel emanuel fox news contributor chris it is worth noting that this isn apost the first time russia has tried to influence american elections it goes back to the 1960s and we ve had multiple cases where they tried to actually influence the kennedy versus nixon al gore versus bush and every time they aposve approached some other candidates they aposve spurned it or turned it over to the fbi so the notion that the president says this is opposition research and everyone does it it s not true people do have standards there are rules of engagement and getting a foreign government to try to give you dirty information is something that the american political system hitherto has not permitted so that notion is wrong wallace let me just pick up on that one point we ll get back to it in a second with michael because i think it s fair to say you have been generally supportive of president trump but doesn apost this set of emails and the fact that this meeting here are the people who were in the meeting don jr jared kushner then campaign chairman paul manafort and the russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya doesn apost the email exchange and the fact that those three trump officials showed up at the meeting show at least an intent a willingness to collude michael needham ceo heritage action for america well there was a willingness to accept opposition research from a foreign agent and that s something that should be concerning i thought it was interesting i agree with what zeke said except he conveniently left out ted kennedy in 1983 try to work with the russians to defeat ronald reagan which in no way justifies anybody working with the russians right now to get opposition research but i think that s what it shows i think that s why all americans recognizing that russia is a foreign actor a hostile foreign actor are supportive of these investigations and the country deserves to see what comes out of the investigation the challenge that those of us who care about policy phase is how with all of this going on to get the necessary attention as we ll talk in the second panel about health care and taxes and other issues but clearly these are investigations that need to go on and are going on and we look forward to seeing the results wallace since you re a panelist i m not going to call your dr emanuel i m going to call you zeke emanuel that s fine wallace how far as a committed democrat are you prepared to go because i mean we aren t going to talk in specifics but are you willing to see the country paralyzed for the next year are you willing if and i repeat if more information comes out to see the president impeached how far do we need to go on this emanuel well we have democracy is at stake here in america having our biggest enemy russia come in and try to meddle and change our election that is the bedrock of democracy that is the most important thing i do not want to see this country paralyzed but i do not want to see our democracy undermined by having the president of the united states colluding and his officials colluding with russia and remember there are you know when people go into government they actually have to abide by the laws here and one of the laws is you can apost get anything of value whether money or other things of value from a foreign country wallace let me just bring emanuel opposition research is true it aposs of value it may not be dollar value wallace well i was going to say you heard what jay sekulow had to say about that no response to zeke needham i mean he aposs grandstanding we should allow the investigation to play out we should look at what happens when the investigation plays out and then we should have a discussion right now the you know emotion that was just displayed was nice but it aposs grandstanding until the facts come out emanuel democracy is a very fragile thing we have seen in other countries turkey is a very good example of how someone can win an election and totally undermine democracy by taking down judicial independence the press and reelection crosstalk wallace let me just say grandstanding has gone before on this panel you have 15 seconds hume i have a hunch here that american democracy has survived this effort and we don apost really know how far it went we don apost know whether it had any real noticeable impact on election or any of that and it seems to me to become kind of overwrought about the fact that our democracy is in peril because of all this is a little premature at least wallace panel we have to take a break here we ll see you all a little later up next senate republicans struggle to hold a crucial vote on health care but does the bill do enough to repeal and replace obamacare one of the plan aposs biggest critics senator rand paul joins us next commercial break wallace coming up senate republicans continue to make changes to their health care bill but some in the party still aren apost happy begin video clip sen rand paul r kentucky unfortunately the new plan actually doesn apost repeal obamacare that promise to repeal obamacare not to continue obamacare end video clip wallace senator rand paul joins us next commercial break wallace a look outside the beltway at trump national golf club in bedminster new jersey where the world aposs top female golfers are competing in today aposs final round of the u s women aposs open well last night senate majority leader mitch mcconnell put off consideration of health care legislation this week after it was announced that senator john mccain had surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye republicans are struggling to pass a revised bill which some say still doesn apost go far enough to repeal and replace obamacare joining me know one of the biggest critics senator rand paul senator let aposs start with the bottom line whenever it comes up whenever senator mccain is in good health and comes back does senator senate majority leader mcconnell have the votes to pass this revised bill paul you know i don apost think right now he does and the the real problem we have is you know we won four elections on repealing obamacare but this bill keeps most of the obamacare taxes keeps most of the regulations keeps most of the subsidies and create something that republicans have never been before and that s a giant insurance bailout superfund that aposs not a republican idea to give taxpayer money to a private industry that already makes 15 billion in profit wallace so if this bill does not pass what happens paul well you know what i aposve suggested to the president and i talked to the president again you know when he was in paris just this last weekend or i guess on friday and i ve told him i think we can still if you know if this comes to an impasse i think of the president comes jumps into the fray and says look guys you promised to repeal it let aposs just repeal what we can agree to and then we can continue to try to fix replace or whatever has to happen afterwards but the one thing we should do is try to repeal as many of the taxes as many of the regulations and as many of the mandates as we possibly can i still think the entire 52 of us could get together on a more narrow clean repeal and i think it still can be done wallace now this isn t change of heart because back in january you said that you had told the president and he agreed with you that you needed to repeal and replace at the same time paul well you know it aposs interesting that it aposs not i aposm still for replace it aposs just my definition of replace is a lot different than some of the big government republicans my idea always was to replace it with freedom legalize choice legalize inexpensive insurance allow people to join associations to buy their insurance i aposm still for all of those and i think those could actually be part of clean repeal in fact most of the ideas i aposve had on letting people join groups to buy their insurance you know letting the plumber and his wife join a large group like the chamber of commerce those ideas are actually welcomed by virtually every republican that passed in the house of representatives unanimously wallace here aposs what president trump says in his weekly address this weekend about the merits of the current new revised bill begin video clip donald trump president of the united states the senate health care bill stops the obamacare disaster expand choice and drives down cost end video clip wallace is the president wrong senator paul you know i would caution about overselling what aposs going to happen i aposve been involved with health care for 20 years as a physician it was in terrible shape before obamacare it got worse under obamacare and i predict that the fundamental flaw of obamacare will remain with the republican plan and this is a big reason why i can apost support it the fundamental flaw is that mandates on insurance cause prices to rise and young healthy people then say hey i ll just wait until i get sick and the insurance pool gets sicker and sicker it s called adverse selection we also call it the death spiral the republican plan admits that it will continue if they just say hey guys we re going to subsidize it we re going to dump billions of dollars into the insurance companies and say please charge less and try to counteract the death spiral but the republican plan doesn apost fix the death spiral of obamacare it simply subsidizes it wallace yes i understand and i think everybody would agree that this bill does not repeal obamacare it does not fix all of the problems with it but here is why conservatives say it is still worth supporting it is they contend the most significant medicaid reform ever it turns an open ended entitlement into a block grant for states compare the current law it cuts medicaid spending 772 billion by 2026 are you willing senator to see all of that go down the drain paul i think that some of the medicaid reform is probably good slowing down the rate of growth is what they do to medicaid they don apost actually cut so i think that aposs the wrong term to use but they do slow down the rate of growth it a lot of the slow down rate of growth doesn apost kick in till years seven eight nine and ten and i ve seen the way things work in washington and the sad thing is we do these 10 year plans that kind of remind me of the soviet s five year agricultural plans they re kind of a fiction we do the things in the first two or three four or five years and then by the time we get to seven or eight or year nine there s a new congress maybe those are democrats and then the whole medicaid reform goes out the window but the bottom line is i aposm not willing to trade medicaid reform for an insurance company bailout an insurance company entitlement they call it a temporary stabilization fund of nearly 200 billion it aposs never going away because they do not fix the death spiral of obamacare the death spiral of obamacare will remain with the republican plan and that s ask i just can apost support it as it aposs written wallace now you say that given the balance of power and the and the way the votes are lining up that you d like to see a straight repeal at this point and then try to fix it later your republican colleagues say one there are not 51 votes for a straight repeal and two if you do that and then you as you say try to fix it later then because it s not going to be part of budget reconciliation you re going to need 60 votes you re going to have to work with democrats and you re going to end up with a lot of stuff that aposs even more liberal paul well there is a way we can do it we do a more narrow clean cleaner repeal but we can also at the same time put forward a bill that has some of the big ticket spending items that conservatives object to i will vote against that but there are many bills that all the democrats always vote for if it has government spending on it democrats vote for it so there aposs a chance we could take the things that i object to on the repeal bill that aren t repeal that are big government spending put them in a bill the democrats typically vote for one is called schip it s a reaffirmation of like medicaid for children it will be a big spending bill and if they want to spend billions on bailing out the insurance company they could do that with democrats because in all likelihood democrats will vote for that conservatives will vote against an insurance bailout but we d have a clean repeal and then we d have a spending bill they can actually be advanced simultaneously really on the same day moderates would get what they want which is more debt for the country and more spending conservatives will get what we want a clean repeal which is really the only thing we promised in the election and we promised it over and over again so it kind of annoys me that republicans are going back on their word to repeal obamacare wallace let s do a lightning rod quick questions quick answers because there are a number of ideas as it looks like the senate republicans may be deadlocked on what can be done to try to break the logjam first of all ted cruz has gotten a measure put into the bill that says that insurers can put out skinnier what they call skinnier cheaper plans fewer benefits for healthy people as long as they put out one at least one plan that all has all of the health benefits required by obamacare what aposs wrong with that paul i aposm for more choice so in general i aposve been supportive of the cruz amendment however the cruz amendment will still be in the context of having the fundamental flaw of obamacare which are all these mandates so adverse selection will continue even with the cruz amendment and some have argued it would be made worse cruz himself says oh you know what we re going to have to increase government subsidies to insurance companies to stabilize prices well that s just not a very republican idea to have taxpayer money going to a private industry the insurance companies make 15 billion a year so i aposm generally for the idea of the amendment because it gives more freedom but it aposs in the context of a bill that still has the fundamental flaw still retains the death spiral of obamacare so ultimately i won apost work and i tell people they don t people don t republicans don apost understand this when they pass this they are going to completely own health care and people are have been unhappy with health care ever since i aposve been in medicine one because of the large sort of bullying way that we re treated by insurance companies deny everything you know my family alone we fight tooth and nail to get our insurance company to cover anything i aposm like the rest of america we re frustrated with insurance companies charging us through the roof and then not paying for the stuff that we need when we go to the doctor wallace senator senator let me just explain again the idea of the lightning round is quick questions and quick answers so let me let me ask you one other paul that was a quick one wallace let me ask you one other quick one which was that senators cassidy and graham are now saying go the federalism route and let each side each state decide what they want here it is begin video clip sen lindsey graham r south carolina we re going to take that 500 billion and through some kind of formula give it to the state and say the following if you want to repair obamacare you can repair it if you want to replace it you can replace it end video clip wallace briefly what aposs wrong with that paul well the problem is is obamacare was a trillion dollar tax increase if you tell me it aposs federalism to increase taxes by a trillion dollars collective in washington and then send them back to be spent by the states that aposs not really federalism federalism would be devolving the power and the size and scope of the federal government to the states and i aposm all for that but i think their proposal with i don apost know exactly what it is as far as what we ll do with the regulations does it wipe out all the regulations of obamacare what happens to the regulation so i i it sounds like a nonstarter wallace i think it s up to the states let me ask you one let me ask you one last question i aposve got 30 seconds left for this one some of your colleagues say look you re if this goes down you aposre going to end up with obamacare because this is it it aposs either this or obamacare you d rather keep obamacare paul i think that the current system is terrible the death spiral of obamacare is unwinding the whole system and it will continue to unwind but i don apost think republican should put their name on this keep part of obamacare and then we re going to be blamed for the rest of the unwinding of obamacare it aposs a really bad political strategy and it s not going to fix the problem wallace senator paul thank you thanks for joining us paul thank you wallace and we ll watch what happens on the hill when it finally does come to a vote and it aposs always a pleasure to talk with you sir paul thank you wallace up next we ll bring back our sunday group to handicap republican chances to repeal and replace obamacare plus what would you like to ask the panel about the gop s revised health care bill just go to facebook or twitter foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air commercial break begin video clip preset but i m sitting waiting for that bill to come to my desk i hope that they do it they aposve been promising it for years mitch has to pull it off he aposs working very hard he aposs got to pull it off end video clip wallace president trump putting the onus on senate republican leaders to fulfill one of his major campaign promise to repeal obamacare and we re back now with the panel julie i ve got to say i was struck by the president saying that he s sitting there at his desk waiting for the bill to come there i know he aposs made a few calls but this sure seems different from ronald reagan or bill clinton actively lobbying bringing people in i mean am i wrong or is pace you re not wrong there there is not a lot of hands on effort happening by the president certainly on the details of the legislation he s made a couple of phone calls he has done a few interviews where he s talked about this but when it comes to the actual policy details in this legislation it aposs a hands off strategy but frankly republicans are not that upset about it they actually would prefer that he not start meddling with the details on this what they would like to see him do though is try to use the bully pulpit that he does have the audience that he does have on twitter to sell the bill they see him do this sometime and be pretty off message he s talked about trying to put more money in the bill which is not exactly a republican argument he has talked about you know trash the house bill which he was was so in favor of wallace said it was mean pace said it was mean so what republicans would like is for him to stay out of the policy details but try to at least sell this to the american people wallace brit we may be surprised but i think you would agree that whenever this bill does come up for a vote probably not this week but maybe next week or the week after that passing it is a bit of a long shot and i guess my question is how come hume well i would look at it a little bit differently chris it seems to me that you remember when the first version of this measure came out wallace right hume and about a dozen or so senators made it plain they they couldn apost vote for it so it goes back for a little rehab and it comes out again and we have we re down to where two or three republicans get it that doesn apost mean all the rest of them who were for who were against it before will vote for it but it suggests to me that considerable progress has been made and that the republican leadership in the senate is now quite close to where they can pass the bill so when it gets down to it the question you asked rand paul at the end of your interview with him is a question every republican senator is going to have to face and that is to say any when it gets down to it are you going to cast a vote the effective of which is to leave obamacare fully in place and you know remember when those house members all resisted the first version of the house bill and they all went home i think they thought they were going to be heroes they weren apost and the result was was fairly minor changes that bill ultimately passed i think there aposs a significant chance that will happen here as well wallace in the time that we have left i want to try to drill down into the relative merits of the current system versus the revised senate bill and here s what president trump had to say this weekend begin video clip trump we are very very close to ending this health care nightmare we are so close the legislation working its way through congress provides the choice and control people want the affordability they need and the quality they deserve in health care end video clip wallace zeke i want to get you into a debate with your policy counterpart here michael needham and and i aposm going to let you go first is the president wrong when it comes to the question of obamacare versus the current senate bill why is obamacare better emanuel well the current senate bill will throw 22 million people off of insurance and wallace but we don apost know that that was the the emanuel it will look it aposs going to throw at least over 15 million because that aposs the medicaid part so it aposs going to throw something like 22 million people off of insurance second it totally undermines the insurance marketplace with the cruz amendment it actually makes the bill worse because the adverse selection rand paul was talking about will be even worse health wallace that that that says that healthy people can buy cheap plans sick people have to go for the full plan emanuel and basically it undermines the freedom of cancer patients that i take care of because they will not be able to afford any health insurance given the cruz proposal and all wallace but what about the subsidies that are in the cruz emanuel they re not any everyone knows they re inefficiently distributed and they re nowhere near enough and the third point i would make is 45 billion for opioid care over ten years may sound like a lot of people to people but it aposs the president aposs own commission says they need over 220 billion so it s 20 percent so you ve got high insurance undermining of the insurance market and you don apost solve the opioid crisis it aposs a terrible bill wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook on the new revised senate republican bill from marc hall who writes repeal the aca affordable care act as promised do not fix repeal it outright what is wrong with the free market and patient choice just like we have in auto insurance michael how do you answer marc and how do you answer zeke on this question of whether the revised bill is better or worse than the current system needham yes i mean mark s exactly actually right the problem when you talk to people in the senate is there s probably at this point only 15 or 20 votes in the senate for full repeal of obamacare for seven years the republican party promised full repeal of obamacare we need to move towards a patient centered free market plan this bill doesn t do it and it s because unfortunately the republican party wasn apost serious about repeal and that aposs a tragedy and it means that the wallace is it so are you saying that we should leave obamacare in place or we should we go for this needham no i think this bill is the first step in a process of repealing obamacare wallace and why is zeke wrong needham zeke s wrong because zeke s doing what a lot of people in washington d c do and he aposs playing baseline games and he s looking at these things the cbo said 23 million people would be in the individual markets because of the employer mandate the individual mandate it turns out there s only ten when the cbo scores this they assume that magically it aposs a bill from 10 million people in the individual market up to 16 million people before they even do some scoring and so he aposs playing games on that side on the medicaid expansion this bill emanuel wait a second wait hold on the medicaid expansion is real taking 800 billion out of medicaid is not going to expand the number of people who are covered needham inaudible emanuel and the second point i would make is there is no freedom in this bill for people who have pre existing conditions this completely removes the promise to them that if you have a pre existing condition you can have affordable insurance wallace ok michael needham so the problem is zeke s point is that this bill actually keeps all the not all it takes away what was created by dr emanuel and others which was an incentive in medicaid to insure able bodied people for states who have more able bodied people rather than more vulnerable populations like the disabled it takes away that dis incentive but it actually keeps the federal subsidy for the medicaid expansion population and so zeke s not being entirely fair on that point hume and and remember this chris the triumph of obamacare is this coverage for pre existing conditions which basically defeats the whole idea of insurance which is for example in the automobile insurance market if you could wait till you had a wreck and then buy insurance and have the repairs cover that aposs comparable to what we aposre doing here emanuel but brit if i have cancer hume let me finish hold on let me finish can i please finish wallace we ve got 90 second ph hume the idea of insurance is that you purchase it to guard against risks and things that may occur in the future it aposs not that you purchase the coverage after you re already sick emanuel but if hume so that so once once that idea is gone obamacare is essential it remains wallace you ve got you ve got 20 seconds emanuel if i have cancer through no fault of my own i didn t hit a car i need to have insurance to cover me this bill does nothing for those people it only makes the price of their insurance ever higher cancer patients and patients with multiple sclerosis alzheimer aposs disease get completely wallace gentlemen emanuel written out of coverage by this bill wallace we are we are not going to settle this and guess what we don apost have to because we re going to have more time to talk about it but let aposs bring you all back and have the conversation thank you panel see you next sunday up next our power player of the week the man behind donald trump aposs tweets commercial break wallace remember when president trump took office and people wondered whether he would give up twitter well as we told you back in february that was never a question for the president and one trusted aide here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape dan scavino white house director of social media just directly reaching out to what we call the trump train out there the movement and delivering your message directly to the american people wallace voice over dan scavino is describing his job as white house director of social media getting donald trump aposs message out unfiltered by the press or anyone else when the president took office there was some question whether he would keep tweeting trump let me ask you should i keep a twitter going are not keep it going wallace and why not mr trump now has 113 million followers on eight different white house and personal platforms wallace on camera how important is that that it aposs his authentic voice reaching directly to the supporters scavino it aposs very important it is him speaking his mind as president of the united states of america wallace voice over scavino spends his day near the president scavino he ll start speaking and tweet which i know is a tweet and that we will simply send it out he aposs been called the hemingway of twitter many times with 140 characters there s so many times that he ll give me a message when we re traveling or in the office and it stops at 139 characters wallace of course that s during working hours then there are the tweets the president types himself early in the morning or late at night scavino i get a little bing as we like to say and i get the tweet and then i ll take that tweet and amplify it onto instagram as well as his facebook account wallace this is the trump facebook page filled with official announcements presidential musings and behind the scenes video that scavino takes wallace on camera as he s dictating a tweet either in the campaign or now as president have you ever said to him maybe not scavino there s been times but not too often but i aposve always believed in and being with the man from day one is let trump be trump trump did anybody ever hear of dan he aposs become quite famous in social media wallace voice over scavino was a mini celebrity on the campaign trail as one of candidate trump s inner circle but he goes back a lot longer than that they met when scavino was 16 working at a country club in suburban new york scavino often when he would come up i would either for ph caddy or clean his clubs upon departure of the golf course and he said to me he said you re going to work for me one day wallace he ended up running a trump golf course but was about to start his own social media business when he heard the boss might run for president wallace on camera do you ever think to yourself dan scavino 16 year old caddy assistant to the president scavino it aposs overwhelming it aposs surreal but we re here and we re here to serve the american people wallace voice over now scavino spend more time around donald trump than almost any member of his staff in a relationship that s close to family scavino he knows i aposm there for him he knows i have his back everything we aposve been through nobody is taking more incoming than donald j trump and to be with him in the foxhole and it s just just being here in the white house when everybody said and i can
