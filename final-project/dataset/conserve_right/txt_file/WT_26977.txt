on the mueller report march 25 the justice department s special counsel finishes his work and delivers a report its public release is essential not just to the presidency but to democracy attorney general william barr has finally answered the two biggest questions that have dominated u s politics for more than two years did president donald trump and his campaign conspire with russia to influence the 2016 election and did the president try to obstruct a probe into that very question mr barr s answers no and no it ought to come as good news to americans regardless of their feelings about mr trump that mr barr and the justice department s special counsel robert mueller agree that the president was not in cahoots with a hostile foreign power however the many questions about the president and about our electoral system are by no means resolved it s essential now that mr barr provide congress and the public the full report for two key reasons first americans must see the facts underlying those conclusions it s important to know how and why mr mueller decided there was no cooperation or coordination with russia and perhaps even more vital to see the evidence and lack of it on the question of obstruction of justice president trump s bombastic claim of complete and total exoneration is of course false mr mueller s report offered no such thing stating according to mr barr that while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime it also does not exonerate him rather mr barr a recent appointee of mr trump s who has a broad view of presidential authority and immunity concluded the evidence does not meet the high legal standard for prosecution the standard is quite different in the court of public opinion in which mr trump s political fate may ultimately be decided and in congress where the many questions about his official political and private business behavior are being investigated the second reason to release the full report is to help congress figure out what changes in law could lessen the likelihood of a repeat of the foreign interference in u s elections the mueller report affirms what the u s intelligence community has found that the russian government used disinformation and social media operations to sow social discord and hacked and then leaked emails from hillary clinton s campaign and democratic party organizations all to influence the presidential race it falls on congress to consider what vulnerabilities and weaknesses exist in the realms of politics elections cybersecurity and the internet that might be dealt with through legislation or regulation to say that our democracy hinges on this is no overstatement it s hard of course to imagine a law that could immunize americans from propaganda and other forms of disinformation especially in a republic that so fiercely protects free speech that in the end requires an informed citizenry the release of mr mueller s report unfiltered by either mr trump and his allies or by his critics would be an excellent step toward that goal online https bit ly 2hgxjg7 the rome sentinel on alzheimer s disease march 23 the mysteries of alzheimer s disease and other neurodegenerative afflictions have been notoriously difficult to solve despite hundreds of millions of dollars worth of research little progress has been made in finding a treatment for these diseases which harvard researchers predict will affect as many as 1 in 5 americans by 2030 but recently two research teams one from cedars sinai medical center in los angeles and the other from the salk institute in san diego published findings that have opened a window for advancements in treating these horrific diseases the team from cedars sinai found that transplanting the bone marrow of young laboratory mice into old mice prevented cognitive decline in the old mice preserving their memory and learning abilities according to the report the research supports an emerging model that attributes cognitive decline in part to aging of blood cells which are produced in bone marrow at the salk institute meanwhile researchers found that the californian herb yerba santa produces a natural compound sterubin that has neuroprotective qualities like the bone marrow transplant procedure sterubin was tested on mice and it was found that the mice s nerve cells a vulnerable target of neurodegenerative illness were protected from damage there are reasons to be skeptical of the findings perhaps the most significant hang up is that mice are of course not human and oftentimes treatments that work on mice in the lab do not translate to humans so there is a long way to go before either of these discoveries can be seen as a bonafide treatment for neurodegenerative disease but the progress on finding any treatments for these devastating afflictions has been so slow that any step forward should be applauded it remains to be seen if the findings from cedars sinai and the salk institute will help humans stem the tide of neurodegeneration but one thing is for sure we will never find the key to treating these diseases unless researchers remain persistent working to help humanity and tackle our most vexing challenges online https bit ly 2ubm3rz the auburn citizen on vaccinations in new york state march 21 legislation that would mandate vaccinations for new york schoolchildren is a commonsense idea that should become law this year state law currently requires measles mumps and rubella vaccinations along with immunizations for diptheria hepatitis b and poliomyelitis but students don t need to be vaccinated if their parents ask for a religious exemption we certainly support religious freedom in new york and beyond but students spend so much time together in close quarters that it just isn t safe to allow any potentially contagious children into the mix and a re emergence of measles and mumps cases is a perfect illustration of why a strong public school vaccinate policy is so important another problem is that some parents are choosing to skip vaccinations for their children after reading false claims that immunizations can cause conditions such as autism measles mumps and other diseases are more than a nuisance they can cause death and debilitating conditions that can last a lifetime and even children who have been immunized can bring a virus home from school and infect an infant too young to have yet been immunized pursuing a higher rate of vaccinations is the best way to prevent outbreaks of preventable diseases and because vaccines for students have the potential to save lives and prevent suffering new york would be foolish to fail to make it mandatory online https bit ly 2futcjl the wall street journal on

secretary of state mike pompeo called his russian counterpart monday after russian air force planes carrying about 100 troops arrived in caracas saturday the continued insertion of russian military

russia to cease its unconstructive behavior and join other nations that want a better future for venezuela this isn t ukraine next to russia or syria in the middle east this russian military provocation is in america s backyard and the trump administration will have to do more in response than issue statements or phone calls of disapproval the maduro regime s fortress socialism is
