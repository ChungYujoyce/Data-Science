apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion if you were planning to cast a presidential vote this november in order to restore dignity to the white house or install a statesmanlike temperament in the oval office you might wish to reconsider your interest in joe biden we say this for two reasons first with his decisive primary victories over bernie sanders in michigan and elsewhere mr biden becomes the likely democratic nominee democrats clearly want to beat donald trump and have settled on mr biden as the temperamental anti trump most likely to accomplish the mission but is he that s our second reason which we raise in recognition of an incident that took place on the eve of the michigan vote and which the media have chosen largely to ignore while touring a construction site and speaking to unionized workers mr biden was asked by one young man how he planned to appeal to union workers who are gun enthusiasts while you are actively trying to diminish our second amendment rights and take away our guns it was an entirely reasonable question and asked politely at best mr biden s positions on gun control have been contradictory at worst as his questioner pointed out mr biden has pledged to put beto o rourke who really does call for gun confiscation in charge of gun control if elected president top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed bill clinton slams trump era tribalism in message to 2020 grads our democracy is at risk hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey but mr biden s immediate response was startling you re full of he declared and as a nervous campaign worker sought to end the encounter mr biden turned on her in ill disguised fury shush and went on to berate his questioner for another minute as the cameras rolled what worries us about this curious encounter is not the technical minutiae of gun control legislation which some journalists might usefully ask about but mr biden s temperament if two weeks ago mr biden had exploded in unprovoked rage it would have been regrettable but perhaps understandable the campaign of the 77 year old three time aspirant for the presidency was then universally regarded as hopeless but by the time he reached that construction site mr biden had already in effect won super tuesday and was on his way to frontrunner status he should have been the affable old joe we keep reading about in friendly stories it also reveals an equally curious and disturbing trend mr biden has a regular habit of exploding in anger not at fellow candidates or mr trump but at voters on the campaign trail as he said to the michigan worker don t be such a horse s ass and don t tell me that pal or i m going to go out and slap you in the face one voter in iowa was a damn liar who was too fat and too old to vote for me and so on say what you will about president trump but his tweets and retorts and nicknames have a humorous certainly calculated element to them mr biden s rages and challenges to fistfights or push up contests do not it s a question democrats might usefully ponder do we really know everything worth knowing about joe biden and if no
