apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic seoul ap after 14 years of painstaking labor north korea finally has a rocket that can put a satellite in orbit but that doesn t mean the reclusive country is close to having an intercontinental ballistic missile experts say pyongyang is years from even having a shot at developing reliable missiles that could bombard the american mainland and other distant targets though it did gain attention and the outrage of world leaders wednesday with its first successful launch of a three stage long range rocket a missile program is built on decades of systematic intricate testing something extremely difficult for economically struggling pyongyang which faces guaranteed sanctions and world disapproval each time it stages an expensive launch north korea will need larger and more dependable missiles and more advanced nuclear weapons to threaten u s shores though it already poses a threat to its neighbors top stories democratic clerk charged with

one success indicates progress but not victory and there is a huge gap between being able to make a system work once and having a system that is reliable enough to be militarily useful said brian weeden a former u s air force space command officer and a technical adviser to the secure world foundation a think tank on space policy north korea s satellite launch came only after repeated failures and hundreds of millions of dollars it is an achievement for young authoritarian leader kim jong un whose late father and predecessor kim jong il made development of missiles and nuclear weapons a priority despite international opposition and his nation s poverty mr kim said the achievement further consolidated the country s status as a space power the government s official korean central news agency reported thursday it added that mr kim stressed the need to continue to launch satellites in the future mr kim visited the command center gave the final written launch order and keenly observed the whole processes of the launch on wednesday kcna reported it said the satellite entered into its orbit 9 minutes and 27 seconds after the launch at 9 59 a m south korea s defense ministry said thursday the satellite was orbiting normally at a speed of 7 6 kilometers 4 7 miles per second though it s not known what mission it is performing north korean space officials say the satellite would be used to study crops and weather patterns though pyongyang insists the project is peaceful it also has conducted two nuclear tests and has defied international demands that it give up its nuclear weapons program the u n security council said in a brief statement after closed consultations wednesday that the launch violates council resolutions against the north s use of ballistic missile technology and said it would urgently consider an appropriate response this launch is about a weapons program not peaceful use of space u s state department spokeswoman victoria nuland said even the north s most important ally china expressed regret north korea long has possessed the components needed to construct long range rockets scientists in pyongyang however had been trying and failing since 1998 to conduct a successful launch only this week their fifth try did they do so prompting dancing in the streets of the capital north korea s far more advanced rival south korea has failed twice since 2009 to launch a satellite on a rocket from its own territory and it postponed two attempts in recent weeks because of technical problems each advancement pyongyang makes causes worry in washington and among north korea s neighbors in 2010 u s secretary of defense robert m gates warned that within five years the north could develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states wednesday s launch suggests the north is on track for that said former u s defense official james schoff now an expert on east asia at the carnegie endowment for international peace but he and other experts say the north must still surmount tough technical barriers to build the ultimate military threat a sophisticated nuclear warhead small enough to mount on a long range missile something experts say will be the focus of future nuclear tests and despite wednesday s launch pyongyang also is lacking the other key part of that equation a reliable long range missile if in the future they develop a nuclear warhead small enough to put on a rocket they are not going to want to put that on a missile that has a high probability of exploding on the launch pad david wright a physicist with the union of concerned scientists who has written extensively about north korea s missile program said in an email to create a credible missile program experts say north korean technicians need to conduct many more tests that will allow them to iron out the wrinkles until they have a missile that works more often than it fails pyongyang s past tests have been somewhat scattershot possibly because of the heavy international sanctions the rocket and nuclear tests have generated north korea must build a larger missile than the one launched wednesday if it wants to be able to send nuclear weapons to distant targets analysts said the satellite north korea mounted on the rocket weighs only 100 kilograms 220 pounds according to the office of south korean lawmaker jung chung rae who was briefed by a senior south korean intelligence official a nuclear warhead would be about five times heavier other missing parts of the puzzle include an accurate long range missile guidance system and a re entry vehicle able to survive coming back into the atmosphere at the high speeds 10 000 mph traveled by intercontinental ballistic missiles said jonathan mcdowell of the harvard smithsonian center for astrophysics in massachusetts both are seen as being years off history also shows that first generation long range missiles need dozens of test flights before they are accurate enough to be deployed the world s icbm club has just four countries the united states russia china and france according to markus schiller an analyst with schmucker technologie in germany and a leading expert on north korean missiles if north korea really intended to become a player in the icbm game they would have to develop a different kind of missile with higher performance mr schiller said and if they do that seriously we would have to see flight tests every other month over several years mr wright said the unha 3 rocket launched wednesday has a potential range of 8 000 to 10 000 kilometers 4 970 to 6 210 miles which could put hawaii and the northwest coast of the mainland united states within range but even if north korea builds a ballistic missile based on a liquid fueled rocket like the 105 foot tall unha 3 it would take days to assemble and hours to fuel that would make it vulnerable to attack in a pre emptive airstrike solid fueled missiles developed by the u s and soviet union are more mobile more easily concealed and ready to launch within minutes money is another problem for pyongyang a weak economy chronic food shortages and the sanctions make it difficult to sustain a program that can build and operate reliable missiles i don t think the young leader has any confidence that the home economy could afford a credible deterrent capability said zhu feng deputy director of the center for international and strategic studies at peking university mr zhu said pyongyang s recent launch was a negotiating chip not an immediate threat he said it was intended to stoke tensions abroad in order to improve pyongyang s position in future international negotiations mr weeden said north korea may want to create the perception that it poses a threat to the united states but it is not likely to go further than that i expect north korea to milk this situation for everything they can get he said but i don t think that perception will be matched by the actual hard work and testing needed to develop and field a reliable effective weapon system like the icbms deployed by the u s russia and china but victor cha a former white house director for asia policy warned there has been an unspoken tendency in the united states to regard north korea as a technologically backward and bizarre country underestimating the strategic threat it poses this is no longer acceptable he wrote in a commentary north korea already poses a major security threat to its east asian neighbors it has one of the world s largest standing armies and a formidable if aging arsenal of artillery that could target seoul the capital of south korea nearly 30 000 u s forces are based in south korea a legacy of the 1950 53 korean war that ended with an armistice not a formal peace treaty the north s short range rockets also potentially could target another core u s ally japan darryl kimball executive director of the nongovernmental arms control association said those capabilities rather than the north s future ability to strike the u s still warrant the most attention matthew pennington reported from washington associated press writer alexa olesen in beijing and multime
