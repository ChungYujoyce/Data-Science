rates thereby weakening the appeal of their currencies brazil has raised taxes on foreign acquisitions of its bonds to keep its currency down but the focus is largely on china so far the most aggressive in keeping its national currency artificially weak the u s and europe complain this is costing them trade and jobs and have redoubled their efforts to push china to implement its months old pledge to let the yuan appreciate the imf chief said china s currency was at the root of tensions in the world economy that are becoming a threat and that china must speed up its currency appreciation

said he agrees with u s authorities when they say that a strong dollar is in the interests of the united states the euro broke briefly above 1 40 for the first time in eight months as he spoke more

global economy will require a balancing act countries with huge trade and budget deficits such as the united states will need to boost exports and countries with big trade surpluses such as china must reduce their dependency on exports and boost domestic demand but the u s has argued that china has manipulated its currency to gain trade advantages and helped suppress u s exports the undervalued chinese currency has made chinese goods cheaper for american consumers it has also hurt u s companies by making their products costlier in china chinese prime minister wen jiabao retorted that letting its currency rise would cost china export based jobs and could lead to economic and social turmoil speaking in brussels eu commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said the eu is awaiting chinese action on the yuan we told mr wen very frankly very clearly without pressures that we think china should implement their own commitment of the 19th of june to give market forces more influence on its exchange rate altafaj said it is fair to say that this announcement has not been followed up by concrete action at least with respect to the euro exchange rate and this is for us a crucial issue in times of fragile recovery surrounded by uncertainties mr altafaj said there is a widespread consensus that china s currency is still significantly undervalued the dollar also fell to fresh lows against the japanese currency to 82 12 yen from 82 93 yen the british pound rose slightly to 1 5928 from the 1 5896 fed members have said they are willing to offer more relief for the struggling u s economy
