of the house oversight committee weighs in on fox news sunday this is a rush transcript from fox news sunday july 22 2018 this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated bret baier fox news host i aposm bret baier in for chris wallace president trump invites vladimir putin to the white house for a round two after he walks back comments about russian meddling in the 2016 election begin videotape donald trump president of the united states i have president putin he just said it aposs not russia i will say this i don apost see any reason why it would be the sentence should have been i don apost see any reason why it wouldn apost be russia and i think that probably clarifies things pretty good by itself baier we aposll discuss the fallout from the helsinki summit including the rift within the president aposs own party with congressman trey gowdy chairman of the house oversight committee then sen bob menendez d new jersey we cannot wait to see whether russia attacked us in the 2018 election we know that they are in the midst of making that a reality baier democrats seek details about what happened in putin and trumps one on one and call for tough new sanctions we will discuss with new jersey senator bob menendez the top democrat on foreign relations committee and in case you missed it chris wallace fox news host i have here the indictment that was presented on friday from the special counsel robert mueller may i give this to you to look at sir baier highlights from chris apos exclusive interview with the russian leader and insight and analysis from our sunday panel all right now on fox news sunday end videotape baier host and hello again from fox news in washington the tension following president trump aposs meeting with vladimir putin continues to rise this weekend as the president faces widespread criticism over his handling of russia after he seemed to side with putin aposs denials of election interference at least at first joining me now from south carolina congressman trey gowdy chairman of the house oversight committee mr chairman thanks for being here rep trey gowdy r s c chairman house oversight committee yes sir thank you baier you know after the president aposs meeting with vladimir putin and that much analyzed press conference in helsinki your colleague republican colleague from texas congressman will hurd a former cia officer wrote an op ed for the new york times and it was entitled trump is being manipulated by putin what should we do and in it the texas republican writes quote over the course of my career as an undercover officer in the cia i saw russian intelligence manipulate many people i never thought i would see the day when an american president would be one of them so do you agree with congressman hurd is the president being manipulated by vladimir putin gowdy well will has a background as a cia officer i defer to him on manipulation i can tell you this bret the president has access to every bit of evidence even more than those of us on house intel and will and i serve on intel he has access to pompeo and chris wray and dan coats and nikki haley the evidence is overwhelming it can be proven beyond any evidentiary burden that russia is not our friend and they tried to attack us in 2016 so the president either needs to rely on the people that he has chosen to advise him or those advisors need to reevaluate whether or not they can serve in this administration but the disconnect cannot continue the evidence is overwhelming and the president needs to say that and act like it baier so he eventually set it through the week congressman but what do you think was the evolution there why the hesitation gowdy i don apost know i watched the press conference it wasn apost just that line it was the president missed i think a really good opportunity to distinguish the united states from any other country but especially from russia and i don apost know what was said in a private conversation but i do know this we got a classified briefing this week bret there is no way you can listen to the evidence and not conclude not that the democrats were the victims but the united states of america were the victims we were the victims of what russia did in 2016 and it ought to be a source of unity and rallying around the fact that we are never going to allow this to happen again and we aposre going to punish those who try to do it and there was this equivocation during the press conference that i aposm glad he corrected it but when you aposre the leader of the free world every syllable matters and you really shouldn apost be having to correct it when you aposre the leader of the free world baier as you mentioned after several days of kind of dealing with the rhetorical walk back the white house announced on twitter that the senior task had been tasked to set up a second summit vladimir putin coming to washington this fall and that obviously caught many here in washington by surprise it also caught the president aposs director of national intelligence by surprise who is doing an interview in aspen at the time take a listen begin video clip andrea mitchell nbc news the white house has announced on twitter that vladimir putin is coming to the white house in the fall dan coats director of national intelligence say that again laughter coats ok mitchell yes laughter coats that aposs going to be special end video clip baier now the dni released a statement last night apologizing saying he didn apost mean to be critical or disrespectful in his reaction and response but do you think it aposs strange that the director of national intelligence didn apost know about the invite before it went out gowdy i do think it aposs strange i also think this bret i think that the united states of america sometimes has to meet with people that we don apost have anything in common with i think our president has to meet with the leader of north korea we have to lead meet with the leader from iran but it aposs very different to issue an invitation this country is different we do things differently we set the moral standard for the rest of the world the fact that we have to talk to you about syria or other matters is very different from issuing an invitation those should be reserved for i think our allies like great britain and canada and australia and those who are with us day in and day out they should i think we should be very judicious in who we invite and place that in perimeter ph of acceptance on so i would hope the president would keep that in mind if we are issuing invitations to foreign leaders baier i want to return to the investigation overnight responding to freedom of information requests the department of justice released a heavily redacted fisa court request by the fbi asking for permission to surveil or listen into carter page a fairly low level figure in the trump campaign or orbit but one the fbi suspected according to these documents of colluding with russian agents and may be being one i know you read this months ago but it aposs the first time one of these kind of documents is out in the public domain even heavily redacted what is your take on this gowdy my take is that carter page is more like inspector gadget then he is jason bourne or james bond trump never met him trump never had a conversation with him i aposm sure he aposs been on the fbi aposs radar for a long time well before 2016 here aposs what we aposll never know bret we aposll never know whether or not the fbi had enough without the dossier the unvetted dnc funded dossier because they included it and everyone who reads this fisa application sees the amount of reliance they placed on this product funded by hillary clinton aposs campaign and the dnc so that aposs point number one is the dossier and its use the other thing i hope my fellow citizens will take note of is the fbi missed a really good opportunity to tell the judge exactly who paid for that if you look at the footnote it takes a lot more effort to define it the way they did where you have no idea who funded it then just to come right out and say the dnc hired perkins coie who hired fusion gps who hired christopher steele there done that aposs an easy footnote everybody can follow it but for whatever reason the fbi decided not to represent that to a court baier so carter page is never indicted he hasn apost been brought in gowdy not yet baier he is still walking around gowdy yes and that i mean look this is an investigation all investigations don apost lead to indictments there have been two dozen indictments in this case but carter page is not one of them i have a different standard between investigating something and someone and keep in mind and counterintelligence investigations are never designed to become public so you and i were not supposed to be having a conversation about carter page on national television this case is different he has not been indicted he is presumed innocent he aposll be presumed innocent even if he is indicted i don apost have an issue with looking into people that have cozy relationships with russia that aposs fine that aposs what law enforcement supposed to do i do have an issue when you rely on political opposition research that is unvetted and you represent that to a court and use it to spy on an american baier you have seen this document long ago but are there documents that you know exist that you have yet to see gowdy some the mccabe memos which came up during the lisa page interview crosstalk baier andrew mccabe number two at the fbi who became acting director after comey leaves gowdy right as soon as you become acting director apparently you make a decision to memorialize all of your conversations with the president even while you are applying for the job i hasten to add but i have not seen the mccabe memos there were other references that lisa page made the documents and files that i think congress is entitled to see i aposve seen as much if not more than any other member of congress which is why i am so adamant that russia is not our friend and they tried to attack us baier are you equally adamant that the president is not has not colluded with russia gowdy i have not seen one scintilla of evidence that this president colluded conspired confederated with russia and neither has anyone else or you may rest assured adam schiff would have leaked it so that aposs why they aposve moved off of collusion onto obstruction of justice which is now their current preoccupation baier you mentioned lisa page she and peter strzok these two figures fbi agent and fbi attorney who had been texting back and forth they were lovers had some very heated aggressive anti trump texts one that said we can apost take a risk it aposs an insurance policy another that said an investigation leading to impeachment you and i both know the odds are nothing i thought if i thought it was likely there would be no question i would go over to bob mueller that aposs what he aposs talking about i hesitate in part because my gut sense and concern is there aposs no big there there lisa page was up on capitol hill did she say they were talking about there aposs no there there in the russia case crosstalk gowdy it can be she was a much better witness than peter strzok look she hates republicans including the one you are talking to but she had a credibility about herself and how she answered our questions that peter strzok never bothered to have take a look at that text that aposs from peter strzok and he aposs concerned that there is no big there there he aposs not optimistic that there is not he aposs not hopeful there aposs not this is a career counterintelligence agent who is concerned that this investigation will not lead to impeachment so it aposs already led to indictments it aposs already led to our understanding that russia is not our friend you have a wonderful opportunity to safeguard our 2018 elections none of that was enough for him bret it had to be impeachment and that was his concern is that there was no big there there and that aposs why he was not sure he wanted to participate in this investigation that is sad it is pathetic that a career fbi agent would only be interested in impeachment which is why he has no credibility and she actually does have some baier so trump supporters look at that former cia director john brennan former fbi director james comey what he said what they aposve said and they say they understand why the president feels a little inquisitive about where things are going gowdy yes bret you don apost even have to be a trump supporter to be mindful of the fact that john brennan thinks he aposs guilty of a crime for which he can be hanged that john brennan thinks he should be in the dustbin of history that jim comey thinks impeachment is too good of a remedy and jim comey now thinks that everyone should vote democrat so bernie sanders will be the head of the budget committee and dianne feinstein will be the head of intel i mean these are the people that were supposed to be dispassionately objectively investigating a fact pattern and they have much animus against donald trump as anything i have seen in my eight years in politics add into that peter strzok lisa page and the other unidentified fbi agents who also wanted him to resign or be impeached or thought he was destabilizing so if you are donald trump and you see all of these people in positions of responsibility that think you ought to be that you aposre guilty of treason a crime for which you can be put to death by the way that aposs what john brennan said so what i would encourage the president those are all people from yesterday you have your own people in place now and it is possible to conclude that russia interfered with us and it still does not delegitimize your presidency that aposs where i would encourage the president to go russia is not our friend we need to be very careful dealing with them but that does not take away from the fact that he won the 2016 election much to the chagrin of brennan comey and all the rest baier congressman gowdy thanks for your time today gowdy yes sir thank you baier up next did president trump put the interest of russia above the united states in his summit with vladimir putin we aposll talk to one of the top democrats demanding answers senator bob menendez joins us next commercial break baier top democrats called on president trump to cancel his summit with vladimir putin after the indictments of 12 russian military intelligence officers for interfering in the 2016 election now many are demanding answers to what really happened in helsinki calling for increased sanctions on russia for the president aposs national security team to testify and for president trump to press putin to extradite those 12 agents joining me now new jersey democratic senator bob menendez he aposs the top democrat on the senate foreign relations committee welcome back to fox news sunday senator sen bob menendez d n j senate foreign relations committee good to be with you bret baier thanks for being here you know a lot has been made obviously about this meeting and the news conference in helsinki but here aposs what the president said this week about actual u s policy after this begin video clip donald trump president of the united states look at the sanctions i aposve put on look at the diplomats i threw out look at all of the things that i aposve done nobody else did what i aposve done obama didn apost do it obama was a patsy for russia he was a total patsy look at the statement he made where he thought the mikes were turned off ok a stupid statement he made barack obama former president this is my last election after my election i have more flexibility dmitry medvedev russian prime minister i understand i transmit this information to vladimir end video clip baier so senator do you think u s policy towards russia was tougher under the obama administration or under the trump administration menendez well certainly president obama created the european deterrence initiative after russia invaded and annexed crimea he recommitted to the 2008 commitments nato made to having georgia be part of nato once they were ready and developed he actually imposed a series of sanctions supported by the freedom support act that i helped write and did a series of executive orders so it was incredibly strong at the time i have to say that when i listened to president trump say he aposs been stronger we had to bring him kicking and screaming to the caatsa sanctions the countering america aposs adversaries through sanctions act that had a 98 2 vote in the senate overwhelming vote in the house that he didn apost want to sign he was forced to sign because they had veto proof majorities and even so there are about seven mandatory provisions of that law as it relates to russia that the administration has not pursued so i would simply say that what i saw in helsinki at a moment that the president could have challenged president putin about the reality that his 17 intelligence agencies all unanimously agreed that russia interfered in the 2016 elections that they are in the midst of doing that as we speak in these elections 108 days away that was a moment to challenge him on that on ukraine on what aposs happening in syria and instead the president did not show the strength that an american president i believe should have shown at that moment baier he says that he said that behind closed doors in that cbs interview with jeff glor he what would you like have preferred him do in the news conference publicly menendez well i would have liked him to have said look president putin we know that you interfered in our 2016 elections and that you are doing it now and that aposs not a question that aposs a statement and here are consequences to it if you want to rejoin the world order and observe international law and stop invading sovereign nations like ukraine then we can have a pathway forward but at the end of the day there will be real consequences and i aposm glad that we aposre talking but there are real consequences to your constant engagement in our elections that undermine our democracy i would have liked bret for him to do what chris wallace your colleague did in his interview with president putin baier which we aposll see in just a moment i guess his supporters say he may have done that behind the scenes he may have not set the right things on the news conference menendez no one knows what he said behind the scenes because he took an extraordinary over two hours with only an interpreter not even the secretary of state baier do you think there aposs any upside crosstalk menendez the head of national intelligence baier is there any upside to talking to putin menendez look it depends if you challenge him now we are going to give him you know a red carpet treatment and invite him to washington to me that aposs beyond comprehension you can speak to adversaries but at the end of the day you have to do it in a way in which you challenge them the president seems to want to be chummy with putin instead of challenging him he should be challenging him about violating international law he should be challenging him about the massacre that aposs taking place in syria he should be challenging him about the annexation of crimea and say we will never recognize the annexation of crimea baier but senator you know that you don apost know that he didn apost do that behind closed doors menendez none of us know baier ok so let aposs menendez i have no idea but when you had an opportunity to show the world all of our allies show nato show the free world that you would in fact were not supplicant to vladimir putin but a challenge to him you failed to do so and then to come back you know it aposs too late too little and the wrong continent and now change your tune once you aposre here versus when you are there standing alongside putin baier let aposs turn to domestic politics supreme court nominee that the president put up brett kavanaugh you have said that you will not vote for him democrats are obviously pushing back do you believe democrats can stop the kavanaugh confirmation menendez well i think if the american people understand judge kavanaugh aposs record they will rise up and that will stop his nomination look here is a judge who has written that in fact the president is above the law that he can decide what laws are constitutional or not which i always believed was reserved for the supreme court under our system of government and therefore not obey a law if in fact he believes it aposs unconstitutional he believes the president cannot be investigated while in office this is someone who spent four years with ken starr investigating the clinton administration it aposs amazing to me that he has the view that a president cannot be investigated and so baier so where are the votes going to come on the pushback menendez and so he has a series of challenges i think that when the people in the country know they will raise their concerns with their members of the senate including republicans look our colleagues baier do democrats have regrets that menendez our colleagues dean heller in nevada of course susan collins lisa murkowski who care about women aposs health and others i think will have an opportunity to express themselves as to whether they want to support someone who in fact would erode those basic rights baier do democrats have regrets that senator harry reid moved that vote to only requiring 51 for confirmation menendez i think republicans will regret to moving to 51 on supreme court nominees there will come a moment in which they aposll regret that and you know if this continues we are going to have a senate not as the founders of the constitution and the framers of the constitution imagined it will just be a majority vote institution like the house of representatives and that will dramatically change the country baier senator you are up for reelection in new jersey this year you could face a real race in blue new jersey but the energy and passion and really the grassroots of your party is on the progressive side just over the past few days senator bernie sanders has been campaigning with the newest superstar of your party alexandria ocasio cortez from new york she was campaigning they were campaigning in kansas ms ocasio cortez has said that capitalism will eventually come to an end she said she doesn apost mind being called a socialist in her words there aposs an israeli occupation of palestine and they say sanders and ocasio cortez that their agenda is now the democratic mainstream agenda is it menendez look that aposs their agenda and you know under our democracy everybody has their agenda i aposve seen an extreme right wing agendas that i disagree with equally as well look our agenda as democrats is about ultimately making sure that we have an economy that works for everyone not just the wealthiest not just big corporations our agenda is making sure that we secure our nation including our sacred right to vote that it cannot be affected by countries like russia outside of the world our agenda is making sure that every family goes to sleep at night knowing that they have the health care they need to keep their family healthy and secure that aposs our agenda baier so you don apost think there will be this progressive litmus test in your party menendez listen you know i think that people care about whether or not they have an economy that helps them meet their hopes and dreams and aspirations whether they have health care for their family whether they can get their kid educated without being under a mountain of debt to get a college education those are the things that democrats have been fighting for we aposll continue to do so and i think that has universal appeal baier well senator menendez thanks again for joining us on fox news sunday menendez thank you bret baier up next chris wallace presses russian president putin on many topics after the helsinki summit we aposll have the highlights of that incredible interview next commercial break baier coming up the democratic socialist movement becoming a significant force in national democratic politics begin video clip alexandria ocasio cortez d n y congressional candidate wherever there is working class people there is hope for the progressive movement end vdeo clip baier we aposll ask our sunday panel what the leftward shift could mean for the democrat party coming on fox news sunday commercial break baier following the president aposs summit with vladimir putin in helsinki chris wallace sat down with the russian leader for an extensive interview here are some of the key exchanges begin video clip wallace mr president one of the issues that is standing in the way of more progress as you know are the allegations of russian interference in the u s election you have repeatedly said and you said again today that this was not the action of the russian state but if it was anything it was patriotic russian individuals i have here the indictment that was presented on friday from the special counsel robert mueller that says that 12 members of russian military intelligence the gru and they talk specifically about units 26 165 and 74 455 they say you smile let me finish they say that these units were specifically involved in hacking into democratic party computers stealing information and spreading it to the world to try to disrupt the american election may i give this to you to look at sir here vladimir putin russian president through translator well let me start answering your question with something a little bit different let aposs have a look at it this way people are talking about interference of russia with the election process in the united states i have mentioned this in 2016 and i want to say it now again and i really wish for your american listeners to listen to what i say first of all russia as a state has never interfered with the internal affairs of the united states let alone its elections wallace but sir this is the indictment it shows i have 12 names here it talks about specific units of the gru russian military intelligence is the gru not part of the russian state putin i aposll get to it just have a little bit of patience and you will get a full answer to your question interference with domestic affairs of the united states do you really believe that someone acting from the russian territory could have influenced the united states and influenced the choice of millions of americans wallace i aposm not asking if they influenced i aposm asking whether they tried putin i aposm about to answer this was the first point that i aposm trying to make if you have some patience you will hear the entire response i said this in 2016 and i say it now the idea was about hacking an e mail account of a democratic candidate was it some rigging of facts was it some forgery of facts that aposs the important thing that i aposm trying point that i aposm trying to make was there any false information planted no it wasn apost these hackers that are being discussed i will get back to it just bear with me for a moment as we aposre getting told they hacked a certain e mail account and there was an information about manipulations conducted within the democratic party to incline the process in favor of one candidate and as far as i know the entire party leadership resigned they admitted the fact of their manipulation so that aposs one thing manipulation of the public opinion should stop and an apology should be made to the public at large crosstalk putin instead of looking for those responsible or the party at fault and now to the mentioned things as i said in the press conference wallace but mr president may i just say you are indicating that they stole real money putin don apost you like my answer wallace not counterfeit money so are you saying it aposs ok because of the fact that they took from the dnc from john podesta it was their real e mails so it aposs ok to hack and spread this information out and interfere with the election putin listen to me please the information that i am aware of there aposs nothing false about it every single grain of it is true and the democratic leadership admitted it first point now the second point if you don apost like my answer you can give it to me straightaway and i aposll just keep silence and if you want americans to listen to my opinions could you just wait for a little bit and now for the specific accusations first of all special counsel mueller has accused a certain private company in russia that is not even a very big enterprise the core area of competence is a restaurant and now this company hired american lawyers and defending its integrity and reputation in american court so far american court has not discovered any trace of interference whatsoever do you know it or not millions of americans know about it and now to the individuals from the indictment act we with the united states we have a treaty for assistance in criminal cases an existing treaty that exists from 1999 it is still in force and it works efficiently today i referred an example of its sufficient work crosstalk wallace and i aposm not trying to interrupt putin why would mr mueller wallace i aposm not trying to interrupt be disrespectful putin well let me finish just let me finish you are trying to interrupt but i will finish why wouldn apost special counsel mueller send us an official request within the framework of this agreement our investigators will be acting in accordance with this treaty they will question each individual that american partners are suspected of something why not a singular request was filed nobody sent us a single formal letter formal request crosstalk wallace let me just say i don apost want to interrupt and i want to ask one question i aposm trying to move on to other subjects why do you think robert mueller issued this indictment three days before you and president trump met here at the summit putin i aposm not interested in this issue a single bit it aposs the internal political games of the united states don apost make the relationship between russia and the united states don apost hold it hostage of this internal political struggle and it aposs quite clear to me that this is just an internal political struggle and it aposs nothing to be proud of for american democracy to use such dirty methods and political rivalry wallace last year defense secretary mattis said that russia is the greatest threat russia is the greatest threat to the united states and he has since made it clear an even greater threat than terrorism in march you introduced a new generation of russian missiles including what you called in invincible missile you said that could evade defeat all of our missile defenses and you even released a video that showed the super missile flying over the united states and hitting florida very near where president trump aposs estate is at mar a lago aren apost you escalating the arms race and aren apost you being deliberately provocative putin as far as the footage is concerned they did not specify that the missile is about to hit the united states you have to look at it more carefully secondly wallace it shows florida putin there was not sign florida there was not a caption saying florida take a more careful look at it it was never a caption florida wallace no but you can see it on the map putin it was clear it was flying over the eastern coast of no no no it couldn apost be seen on the map just take a closer look and i aposm not trying to scare your population with make believe threats i aposm pretty sure i can give you as a present this footage and now to the offensive weapons they were not born out of nowhere they were born as a response to the unilateral withdrawal of the united states from the abm treaty from the very beginning we aposve been warning our american counterparts that we aren apost going to join the global antimissile system we see no purpose for it but we aposll do everything to have means to overcome it well the response of our counterparts was that the united states designed this antimissile defense system because it is against it aposs not designed to be guided against you in 2003 or 2004 i think i mentioned one of those systems and there was no response from our american counterparts so what we did now we just demonstrated that we do have means to overcome the system it aposs just a negotiating item i do hope that in terms of strategic stability we aposll be able to find a mutually acceptable solution for both sides and that applies to the inf treaty under the intermediate and shorter range missiles as well wallace i need to ask you domestically not internationally domestically inside russia why is it that so many of the people that opposed vladimir putin end up dead or close to it former russian spy and double agent sergei skripal the victim of a nerve agent attack in england boris nemtsov a political opponent gunned down near the kremlin investigative reporter anna politkovskaya murdered in an apartment building why is it that so many people who were political enemies of vladimir putin are attacked putin through translator well first of all all of us have plenty of political rivals i aposm pretty sure president trump has plenty of political rivals wallace but they don apost end up dead putin through translator not always well haven apost presidents been killed in the united states have you forgotten about well has kennedy been killed in russia or in the united states or mr king what happens in the clashes between police and civil society and some several ethnic groups well that is something that happens on the u s soil all of us have our own set of domestic problems but going back to what happened in russia yes we do have crime and unfortunately there are still some crimes and some extent russia aposs statehood is maturing and there are some side effects and we persecute people responsible for these crimes but since you aposve mentioned the skripal case we would like to get at least some sort of a document evidence about it but nobody gives it to us it aposs the same thing as the accusations with meddling in the election process in america end videotape baier you can watch chris aposs full interview with vladimir putin on foxnewssunday com we do know where chris is and he will be back next week up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the fallout from helsinki and the russian investigation going forward commercial break begin video clip trump dan coats came to me and some others they said they think it aposs russia i have president putin he just said it aposs not russia i will say this i don apost see any reason why it would be the sentence should have been i don apost see any reason why it wouldn apost be russia question is russia crosstalk question is russia still targeting the u s mr president unidentified female press let aposs go make your way out crosstalk sarah sanders white house press secretary the president was said thank you very much and was saying no to answering questions trump i let him know we can apost have this we are not going to have it and that aposs the way it aposs going to be getting along with russia is a positive not a negative now with that being said if that doesn apost work out i will be the worst enemy he aposs ever had the worst he aposs ever had end video clip baier the evolution this week of president trump aposs position regarding russia aposs interference in the 2016 presidential election it aposs time now for our sunday group fox news senior political analyst brit hume columnist for the hill juan williams and the co hosts of benson and harf on fox news radio marie harf and guy benson all right brit the president has been very active on twitter this morning just a few moments ago saying i had a great meeting with putin and the fake news used every bit of their energy to to try and disparage it so bad for our country thoughts brit hume fox senior political analyst well what do we know about that meeting well we know very little because there aposs no record of it of any kind that we know of except in the memories of the two participants and their translators unless russia of course taped it so we don apost have any real way to assess that other than what trump claimed about it and of course his performance as you just showed at the press conference with putin in helsinki was i think newt gingrich stated correctly the worst moment of his presidency and one that i think despite his walking it back and repeatedly saying other things in its aftermath i don apost think he is going to live that down any time soon baier juan a lot of trump supporters point to that there aposs no substantive policy changes they say it was a bad press conference but as far as being aggressive against russia this administration still is juan williams columnist the hill i hope they are i mean obviously the president kind of slow walked the sanctions we couldn apost figure out why it took so long to implement the sanctions but yes there are sanctions in place but let aposs not bury the lede on this story brit which is i think as newt gingrich said as others have said trey gowdy said on your interview with him this morning this is a national disgrace this is unbelievable and the one thing we do know that came out of this meeting was a discussion between president trump and vladimir putin about possibly talking or interviewing michael mcfaul our former ambassador to russia that the russians think was overly aggressive on the human rights front so to me that aposs extremely troubling i think that all of us have to say hey we understand that president trump doesn apost want to delegitimize his election but again to reiterate something trey gowdy said this morning this is about america being under attack and being under attack heading into the midterms in terms of our election and democratic process baier guy guy benson co host benson harf well i think it aposs difficult for the president to go on twitter it aposs easy for him but for us to digest him blaming all of this on the fake news because the fake news simply played in its entirety the press conference that he himself participated in and it was a very very low moment i do think that his pivot eventually to what we saw in the cnbc interview was the thing that the administration ought to be doing which is highlighting not just the sanctions but the diplomatic expulsions the lethal aid to ukraine and other elements that are much more robust of the policy as opposed to the rhetoric that we saw when the president was standing with vladimir putin which was again i think indefensible baier right but as the week went on in middle america how do you think this plays marie harf co host benson harf well i think middle america has tuned out a lot of the conversation about foreign policy because they aposre worried about the economy they aposre worried about education and health care costs so that aposs a separate conversation but it is still very important to digest what president trump is doing on foreign policy put that helsinki press conference in the context of how he treated our nato allies right he went to europe he treated our nato allies very hostilely he really attacked them publicly and then did the opposite and was very weak standing next to president putin in terms of his language so i don apost think this was a rhetorical screw up i think that president trump wants american foreign policy to go in a different direction vis a vis our allies and russia and i think that has influenced the fact that he is not trying to protect the united states now from this happening again and for all americans that should be a concern because we know russia is trying to do it right now and his blinders to russian interference makes countering it harder baier ok brit just last thing on this here aposs what the administration says and his supporters nato has increased its military spending largely because of trump aposs pressure the u s has put in heavy military equipment into ukraine not something that russia would like hume more now baier we have helped liquid natural gas in eastern europe that is destabilizing russia there are things they are doing much beyond this is what his supporters would say the obama administration hume well those points are correct these things are all are in fact happening which is why this is such a paradox between the president aposs behavior in the presence of vladimir putin and the actions he has taken they point in different directions there aposs no getting around that but i think you know until we finally know if we ever do what has actually been said in the meeting with putin and what may be said in the next one that apparently is going to be forthcoming this fall it will be impossible to assess this correctly baier so the president doesn apost often like polls but a new washington post abc poll said post summit his handling of the summit 33 percent americans approve of the president aposs handling of the meeting with putin 50 percent disapprove just to give you a moment in time from that sense let aposs talk guy about this carter page fisa document that comes out overnight which is pretty well it aposs just very rare to see a fisa document at all heavily classified this one heavily redacted what does it tell us what does it mean benson well i will confess that i did not spend all night reading 400 pages of this but i did baier we expected you to laughter benson yes i know i will never be invited back i could lie oh i read the whole thing it aposs amazing the redactions are the key point i aposve seen scrolling through twitter partisans on both sides claiming vindication from context clues oh this means we are right this means that aposs correct there is so much the substance some of the substance is just blacked out for pages so i think the one take away that trump supporters will not like is the degree to which the steele dossier was relied on very heavily to secure this fisa warrant against a u s citizen and a trump associate whether there was more substance underneath that that the fbi was able to verify in terms of mr page aposs past conduct with the russians which i think is deeply suspect remains to be seen baier the president again tweeting looking more and more like the trump campaign for president was illegally spied upon surveillance for political gain of crooked hillary clinton and the dnc ask her how that worked out she did better with crazy bernie republicans must get tough now an illegal scam hume not illegal as far as i can tell it was approved by the judge which is the process it has to go through i mean i think it may well have been improper and i think that as guy suggests and as the document reveals there is stuff in that fisa warrant application that has no business being there that does not make it illegal it may make it improper harf and it was removed three times which means you had to get independent evidence that it was producing usable intelligence and i will say this is not a witch hunt this is not the only thing that is part of the russia investigation and the fisa application wasn apost put in for carter page until he left the trump campaign so the idea that this is part of spying on the trump campaign just isn apost backed up by the timeline baier yes i mean trey gowdy said that carter page in reality is more like inspector gadget than he is jason bourne he is still walking the earth and giving interviews juan i want to turn quickly to politics and this real focus on the left you had the vermont senator bernie sanders and the new star alexandria ocasio cortez campaigning in kansas is the progressive wing of the party driving the democratic party williams oh i don apost think there aposs any question the energy is in what i would call the far left base of the party still injured over donald trump aposs election still can apost believe it right and thinking that the way that you do politics now has to be trump like you have to be aggressive some would say bullying you have to name call you have to set out a very clear aggressive agenda so to me it was astounding to see bernie sanders and ocasio cortez in kansas a state that trump won plus 20 bret so but they are there and they are relying on an agenda that i think lots of democrats think that the democratic establishment is reluctant to embrace things like health care things like tuition assistance for young people with heavy student loans things like a minimum wage hike all of this is true but at the same time this week we had a poll that showed most democrats want a fresh face and that fresh face is guess who joe biden he aposs the top i think he has like 35 percent support as the next candidate for the democrats baier speaking of which the president weighing in on joe biden this week begin video clip trump i dream about biden that aposs a dream look joe biden ran three times he never got more than 1 percent and president obama took him out of the garbage heap and everybody was shocked that he did end video clip baier guy benson well i aposm going to go back to the far left here because that aposs fun but the fact of the matter is there are 194 house democrats 122 of them have signed on as cosponsors to medicare for all which is single payer health care which would cost 32 trillion this is a mainstream totally fantastical view that is taken root in the democratic party and it aposs frightening harf but i will say the democratic party is running candidates across the midwest in michigan and ohio and pennsylvania that are moderate and that fit their districts baier but they are answering questions now on what ocasio cortez says day by day that capitalism is going to fall and that you know socialism is ok harf but that aposs not what they are running on and if republicans think that all these challengers in these swing districts across the midwest are all democratic socialists they are going to be in for a big wake up call in november baier quickly brit hume the far left of the democratic party is donald trump aposs best hope for reelection and if they nominate for president the next time around someone from that part of the party holding the views that you know we aposve just been talking about that would be of inestimable benefit to whoever the republican nominee is i presume trump baier panel thank you chris wallace will be back next sunday i promise and we will be ba
