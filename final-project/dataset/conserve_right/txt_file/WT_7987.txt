coronavirus limits on churches when hundreds of thousands marched through the broiling streets of hong kong in recent weeks they posed a serious challenge for the chinese government but when some of them stormed the legislative council and ransacked the chamber on monday they put their movement s fragile gains at risk what first set off the latest wave of mass protests was a proposed law that would have allowed extradition from hong kong to mainland china on the surface a legal formality it was perceived by a large majority of hong kongers as yet another surreptitious attempt by the government in beijing to erode the enclave s rule of law and autonomy guaranteed under the one country two systems formula the protests by residents of all ages and walks of life were a powerful and inspiring declaration that people raised in freedom will not easily surrender it for china s hard line leader xi jinping the reaction was a humiliating rejection of his basic premise that western liberties and independent judiciaries are incompatible with the people s republic yet so long as the protests were big but peaceful he seemed content to have his captive media grumble about western incitement and otherwise inform the mainland public as little as possible about what was going on in hong kong the beijing backed leader of hong kong carrie lam was left to retreat issuing public apologies and then indefinitely suspending consideration of the contentious legislation all that changed on monday the day hong kong s beijing endorsed officials were to make their annual demonstration of fealty to china at ceremonies marking the anniversary of the handover of sovereignty from britain to china a small group of masked protesters broke away from a peaceful march and attacked the legislature smashing down glass doors destroying official portraits and spray painting slogans in the formal chamber it will be weeks before the legislators can meet there again those masked protesters may well be convinced that peaceful action results only in tactical retreats by a system determined to bring hong kong more firmly under the heel of china s central government when they stormed the legislature ms lam had only suspended consideration of the contentious extradition law and the angry protesters recalled that a 79 day occupation of major thoroughfares in 2014 to demand freer elections the so called umbrella movement achieved nothing durable among the spray painted messages in the legislature was one to ms lam you taught me peaceful protests are futile yet they should be asking themselves whether violent protests can possibly be a better answer the mass demonstrations in hong kong s narrow streets like the umbrella movement before them had confronted china s communists and china s people with the powerful message that people reared in freedom normal people not radicals or rebels do not buy the notion that the rule of law or freedom of speech are affectations of a decadent west that would be harmful in the east further the sight of ms lam publicly apologizing and finally shelving the extradition law was a demonstration of the moral power of the people even if the greater struggle with the mainland was certain to continue the ransacked legislative council by contrast gave the authorities an excuse to crack down on all their detractors china s government assailed the vandalism as totally intolerable and demanded strong countermeasures from hong kong authorities no doubt the authorities are aware that a crackdown would carry a heavy price in global opinion and potentially drive away the many multinational businesses headquartered there the protesters for their part stand not only to provoke a crackdown but also to forfeit the support of most hong kong demonstrators both sides need to consider whether violence is the best way forward it rarely is online https on wsj com 2xxv38x the new york daily news on the closing of rikers island if a cherished criminal justice reform dream of new york progressives closing down the arcane and often inhumane jail complex on rikers island collapses they will have to blame not tough on crime prosecutors or judges or republicans but some of their own closest political allies it is the arrogant missteps and utopian idealism of a handful of left wing new yorkers that now poses a clear and present threat to a project many of these very same new yorkers insist is a moral imperative in the former category we put mayor de blasio and council speaker corey johnson s rushed decision last august to put one of five modern new borough jails actually four after staten island was stupidly ruled out in a residential neighborhood in mott haven on a site long intended for affordable housing rather than on another available site far closer to the bronx county courthouse at the time given that local pols seemed lined up in favor the mott haven site looked like the path of least resistance but then members of the community worried about guarding hard won progress against crime and wise to how the proposed location failed pols own tests revolted thursday bronx borough president ruben diaz jr added his voice to the opposition if that winds up sinking the plan it s on de blasio and johnson for picking the wrong site and shutting the public out of the process a second progressive threat arises in queens where tiffany cab n embroiled in a recount still could end up the next queens district attorney should she succeed her uberprogressive promise of no new jails would

earned 318 000 last year fired men s coach jurgen klinsmann made 3 35 million it s not a performance issue the women s team has run rings around the men s team since 1996 the u s women have won three

2lhce1v the post star on new york representatives in supporting use of intelligence in confrontations with iran july 7 republican members of congress like elise stefanik face many dilemmas in dealing with and reacting to president trump for stefanik a member of the house intelligence committee one of those dilemmas has been trying to support trump and at the same time support the country s intelligence services her solution seems to be to point out how excellent the intelligence services are when their conclusions support trump s behavior and to ignore them when they contradict trump but this becomes a difficult balancing act as so many things do when dealing with a mercurial president constituents witnessed this tricky balance recently when stefanik while defending trump s right to take military action against iran praised the intelligence he was receiving the president had a unique vantage point in terms of advice from military leadership in terms of intelligence that is incredibly precise that congressional leaders do not have i support the president s decision stefanik said her statement was precipitated by trump s decision to launch then abort a missile strike on iran we re glad that as a well informed member of the intelligence committee stefanik believes the president is receiving incredibly precise intelligence back at the end of january however the director of national intelligence dan coats put out the worldwide threat assessment of the u s intelligence community which includes conclusions that contradict trump at every turn we continue to assess that iran is not currently undertaking the key nuclear weapons development activities we judge necessary to produce a nuclear device that report says the report says iran has been abiding by the nuclear deal worked out by the obama administration with an international coalition including china the european union france germany russia and the united kingdom it also says iran s leaders were threatening to break the terms of the deal unless they could realize the economic benefits it promised the reason iran wasn t realizing those benefits in january and still isn t is because trump pulled out of the iran deal trump has attacked his own intelligence services for many things including for saying the iran nuclear deal was working since pulling out he has tightened sanctions on iran engaging in a back and forth that brought him to the brink of bombing the country that context makes it difficult for people like stefanik who try to justify trump s aggression based on intelligence reports when a president repeatedly undermines the credibility of his intelligence services it s hard for a congresswoman to then say with a straight face that he is doing the right thing based on intelligence that is incredibly precise all of this matter because presidents use intelligence for making consequential decisions like launching air strikes on other countries the intelligence must therefore be unbiased we never want to repeat our experience with the invasion of iraq when the country realized too late that the decision to invade was based on bogus intelligence we also need to get back to the constitutional requirement that military action be a joint decision of the president and congress presidents bush obama and trump have justified various military actions with the use of force authorization passed by congress shortly after the sept 11 attacks that authorizations starts with the following the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on september 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons you can tie that 18 year old authorization to our continued military presence in afghanistan but it does not cover starting a war with iran and stefanik knows it we need her to stand up for congress the constitution and the intelligence services against warmongering we ve got more chaos than we can handle right now on the home front the country will be shattered if we get pulled into another war online https bit ly 2jpmue1 niagara gazette on new york state police use of body cams july 7 the death of troy hodge who died after an interaction with lockport police officers last month highlights a larger issue facing communities across the nation including niagara county while the officers involved in the hodge case work for a department that previously purchased body cameras initial reports indicate that in one instance an officer s camera fell off and in another instance the officer did not have their camera activated family members have suggested a taser used by an officer at the scene contributed to hodge s death on june 17 questions also remain about whether hodge was as police allege wielding a knife on the night in question the new york state attorney general is currently attempting to sort out all the details having body camera footage from all of the officers involved would most certainly help in drawing accurate conclusions over the course of the probe larger question still looms where uniformity is concerned why does it seem that so often whether incidents of this nature occur here in western new york or in other parts of the country there are no solid standards regarding the use of body cameras by law enforcement officers lockport police chief steve preisch recently noted that officers in his department are required to use body cameras only during traffic stops the rest of the time he said cameras are activated solely at the discretion of individual officers as preisch also demonstrated for members of the city s police board last week the department s current set of cameras while deemed adequate at the time they were purchased are not as reliable as they probably should be preisch is urging city officials to purchase a new set of cameras and in light of recent events it seems like a wise and necessary investment in the wake of hodge s death preisch has also prepared a draft body camera policy for officers that would mandate their use of body cameras at all times this is a no brainer something all departments across niagara county should consider if they don t have such policies in place already taxpayers have already picked up the tab for body cameras in lockport many especially in light of the hodge incident are probably wondering how one officer s camera managed to fall off during the encounter and why another officer s camera wasn t turned on having a uniform set of standards erases a lot of doubt for all parties involved officials in the city of lockport should find a way to heed the chief s call and purchase a new set of body cameras so officers have operational equipment that serves their interest and the public interest the city won t realize the full return on such an investment unless as preisch is recommending there s a policy in place for officers to use those ca
