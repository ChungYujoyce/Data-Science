apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap the pentagon will cut funding from military projects like schools target ranges and maintenance facilities to pay for the construction of 175 miles of fencing along the u s mexico border diverting a total 3 6 billion to president donald trump s long promised barrier projects in 23 states 19 countries and three u s territories would be stalled or killed by the plan though just 1 1 billion in cuts would strike the continental u s according to a list released wednesday by the pentagon almost 700 million would come from projects in u s territories including puerto rico with another 1 8 billion coming from projects on overseas bases trump s move would take the biggest step yet in delivering on his promise to build a wall to block immigrants from entering the country illegally but it may come at the expense of projects that the pentagon acknowledged may be difficult to fund anew capitol hill democrats outraged over trump s use of an emergency order for the wall promised they won t approve money to revive them top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed cbs evening news fails to air due to technical difficulties a senior defense official told reporters the pentagon is having conversations with members of congress to urge them to restore the funding the official agreed that the department has a lot of work ahead of us considering that congress has given no guarantee it will provide money for the defunded projects the official was not authorized to discuss the details publicly so spoke on condition of anonymity in addition new stretches of fencing proposed along the rio grande and through a wildlife refuge in arizona promise to ignite legal battles that could delay the wall projects as well the military base projects facing the chopping block tend to address less urgent needs like new parking at the u s military academy at west point new york and a variety of small arms ranges at bases in wisconsin and oklahoma but a cyber ops facility in hampton virginia and the expansion of a missile defense field at fort greeley alaska face the ax too trump has so far succeeded in building replacement barriers within the 654 miles of fencing built during the obama and bush administrations the funding shift will allow for about 115 miles of new pedestrian fencing in areas where there isn t any now the wall is being built it s going up rapidly trump said wednesday and we think by the end of next year which will be sometime right after the election actually but we think we re going to have close to 500 miles of wall which will be complete new stretches of fencing are sure to spark legal battles with angry landowners and environmentalists the pentagon plan also fuels the persistent controversy between the trump administration and congress over immigration policies and the funding of the border wall it doesn t take any input from the local communities it will take away from the private property rights said rep henry cuellar d texas we are going to do everything we can to stop the president cuellar suggested democrats will look at a must pass funding bill this month required to prevent a government shutdown oct 1 to try to take on trump but a more likely venue for the battle could be ongoing house senate negotiations over the annual pentagon policy measure lawmakers who refused earlier this year to approve nearly 6 billion for the wall must now decide if they will restore the projects that are being used to provide the money to pay for his xenophobic border wall boondoggle president trump is about to weaken our national security by stealing billions of dollars from our military said rep debbie wasserman schultz d fla who chairs a key military construction panel the house of representatives will not backfill any projects he steals from today one of the senate s most endangered republicans in the 2020 election arizona sen martha mcsally reported that her state is getting nicked for just 30 million from a project that was being delayed anyway georgia where two potentially competitive senate races loom next year would be spared entirely though powerful senate majority leader mitch mcconnell r ky himself facing re election would lose a 63 million middle school at fort campbell we need to secure our border and protect our military we can and should do both mcsally said i went to the mat to fight for arizona projects and succeeded elaine mccusker the pentagon comptroller said the now unfunded projects are not being canceled instead the pentagon is saying the military projects are being deferred congress approved 1 375 billion for wall construction in this year s budget same as the previous year and far less than the 5 7 billion that the white house sought trump grudgingly accepted the money to end a 35 day government shutdown in february but simultaneously declared a national emergency to take money from other government accounts identifying up to 8 1 billion for wall construction the transferred funds include 600 million from the treasury department s asset forfeiture fund 2 5 billion from defense department counterdrug activities and now the 3 6 billion pot for military housing construction announced tuesday the pentagon reviewed the list of military projects and said none that provided housing or critical infrastructure for troops would be affected in the wake of recent scandals over poor living quarters for service members in several parts of the country defense officials also said they would focus on projects set to begin in 2020 and beyond with the hope that the money could eventually be restored by congress the government will spend the military housing money on 11 wall projects in california arizona and texas the administration said in a filing tuesday in a lawsuit brought by the american civil liberties union the most expensive is for 52 miles 84 kilometers in laredo texas at a cost of 1 27 billion the laredo project and one in el centro california are on private property which would

partly on federal land overseen by the interior department including a 31 mile stretch through the cabezza prieta national wildlife refuge in arizona a major wilderness area the 175 miles 282
