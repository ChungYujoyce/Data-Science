this week between the world s two largest economies and it sent the stock market into wild swings based on investors fears of a trade war top stories postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history australian researchers see virus design manipulation this is not a trade war yet it s more like probing actions prior to a battle with both sides gauging how far they can push the other without full blown action said george washington university economist michael moore but this is certainly how they might start the 106 products on china s new tariffs list hit the u s and mr trump where it hurts in agriculture and other industries that do big business in china and dominate regions of the country that make up the president s political base beijing proposed a 25 percent tariff on 106 products including soybeans pork cranberries whiskey automobiles airplanes and plastic for mr trump the tariffs and other get tough trade policies made good on a top campaign promise to crack down on china s trade abuses the tariffs and other moves targeting technology were aimed at china s theft of american intellectual property which has vexed u s companies for decades the president didn t flinch we are not in a trade war with china that war was lost many years ago by the foolish or incompetent people who represented the u s now we have a trade deficit of 500 billion a year with intellectual property theft of another 300 billion we cannot let this continue mr trump tweeted he added when you re already 500 billion down you can t lose that doesn t mean there aren t substantial risks from an escalating exchange of tariffs with america s largest trading partner such as higher prices paid by u s consumers and lost jobs for american workers in affected industries denise bode a tax and trade analyst at a washington law firm said a full blown trade war is possible but it is more likely that mr trump will make a deal it is more the

picking a fight it must be said we have been forced into taking this action said wang shouwen china s deputy commerce minister our action is restrained the value of the u s products was virtually identical to the 50 billion in chinese high tech products identified for tariffs on a list that the trump administration rolled out late tuesday neither list will go into immediate effect the u s tariffs require a monthslong comment and review process china said it too is moving slowly larry kudlow director of the president s national economic council tried to tamp down concerns about a trade war saying a negotiated resolution is more likely he wants to solve this with the least amount of pain mr kudlow told reporters at the white house he also said mr trump isn t bluffing i would take the president seriously on this tariffs issue mr kudlow said there are carrots and sticks in life the white house couldn t allay all the fears sen chuck grassley iowa republican said he agreed with getting tough with china but mr trump s strategy puts his constituents in the crosshairs farmers and ranchers shouldn t be expected to bear the brunt of retaliation for the entire country it s not fair and it doesn t make economic sense mr grassley said the administration knew that if it imposed tariffs on chinese goods china would retaliate against u s agriculture i warned president trump as much in a white house meeting in february today shows that s exactly what happened mr grassley said the federal government has a responsibility to mitigate damages caused by trade policies and he vowed to push the issue in the senate the 1 300 chinese products on the u s tariff list included aerospace pharmaceuticals and electronics beijing had threatened to retaliate when mr trump announced pending tariffs last month china previously responded with a list of more than 120 u s items worth about 3 billion to hit with an import tax after the trump administration imposed tariffs on steel and
