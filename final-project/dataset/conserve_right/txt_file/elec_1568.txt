accused president obama of failing to protect the military from budget cuts and squandering u s leadership in the middle east leaving america standing by as al qaeda has surged to become active in a dozen countries as the two men faced off monday night in their final debate mr obama meanwhile repeatedly accused the republican nominee of being an amateur on foreign policy the subject of the night s debate and touted his own credentials including overseeing the mission that killed osama bin laden and committing u s planes to a no fly zone that aided libyan rebels i know you haven t been in a position to actually execute foreign policy but every time you ve offered an opinion you ve been wrong mr obama said top stories russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni attacking me is not an agenda mr romney retorted the foreign policy focused debate served to highlight just how little daylight there is between the two men on the big basic foreign policy choices ranging from handling the civil war in syria to unequivocally backing israel to using drones to attack terrorist targets to trying to halt iran s nuclear ambitions mr romney even said he backed the same 2014 timeline mr obama has laid out for withdrawing troops from afghanistan a matter where he d tried to draw distinctions in previous remarks at one point mr obama said the key difference between the two candidates was that mr romney embraced the obama administration ideas but you d say them louder but mr romney argued they differ in the overall tenor and tone they would take toward using u s leadership around the world particularly in confronting radical islam and al qaeda we can t kill our way out of this mess mr romney said in the debate at lynn university in boca raton as he sought to draw distinctions between himself and mr obama saying the u s must take more leadership to try to push the muslim world toward moderation we must have a comprehensive strategy to help reject this kind of extremism he again accused mr obama of making an apology tour in the middle east to express regret for past u s actions in those nations and on arabic tv you said that america had been dismissive and derisive you said that on occasion america had dictated to other nations mr president america has not dictated to other nations we have freed other nations from dictators mr romney said but the president called the claim that he s apologized probably the biggest whopper that s been told during the course of this campaign mr obama led off the debate by defending his decision making concerning libya where a terrorist attack on the american consulate in benghazi left four americans dead including the u s ambassador but that issue produced none of the fireworks from last week s debate instead the president turned his fire on mr romney questioning what his foreign policy really is your strategy previously has been one that has been all over the map mr obama said adding that just a few months ago when asked what the biggest international threat was for the u s mr romney said it was russia not al qaeda the 1980s are now calling and asking for their foreign policy back mr obama said mr obama repeatedly tried to push his incumbent s advantage at one point ridiculing mr romney s claim that the u s has fewer ships than at any time since world war ii we also have fewer horses and bayonets the president said the question is not a game of battleship where we re counting ships it s what are our capabilities as the challenger mr romney spent a good deal of time demonstrating he d studied his briefs as he pointed to al qaeda activity in mali and recited the approximate number of nuclear warheads pakistan has assembled and both men tried to turn the conversation to domestic issues which they believe are more salient in voters minds than foreign policy right now saying that the u s s world leadership depends on a strong economy here at home at one point mr obama saying that education had been neglected in the two domestic debates began to talk about education highlighting his plan to hire math and science teachers let me get back to foreign policy moderator bob schieffer pleaded at one point before acceding to mr romney s demand that he be allowed to highlight his own education record on syria while both men proclaimed to have differences they laid out a similar policy of trying to help allies in the region such as turkey and saudi arabia and of trying to get weapons to the right kinds of regime opponents the saudis and the qatari and the turks are all very concerned about this they re willing to work with us we need to have a very effective leadership effort in syria making sure that the insurgents there are armed and that the insurgents that become armed are people who will be the responsible parties the republican said mr obama retorted that s the policy he s already pursuing what you just heard governor romney say is he doesn t have different ideas and that s because we re doing exactly what we should be doing mr obama said after two foreign policy elections in 2004 and 2008 global affairs have shifted to the back burner for much of this year s campaign as the sluggish economy has dominated but recent events in the middle east including the terrorist assault on the consulate in benghazi have raised its salience voters have generally given mr obama higher marks on foreign policy though mr romney does better when the question is narrowed to national security the two men entered the debate with polls showing a close race the washington times zogby poll released sunday showed mr obama leading 50 47 among likely voters while the gallup poll has mr romney leading 51 45 the times zogby poll however found mr romney s supporters were substantially more enthusiastic about backing him than mr obama s supporters were which signals a volatile race that will likely come down to the size of voter turnout mr obama has staunched the bleeding from his disastrous performance in the first debate but didn t appear to get a major boost from what polls said was a win for him mr romney however has clearly benefitted from both debates his favorability ratings have improved dramatically and the real clear politics average now shows him above mr obama for the first time in this race in favorability 50 5 to 50 with no more debates the fight now turns to television ads and to personal appearances by the two men who will spend the final two weeks visiting those states deemed critical to the electoral college math ohio virginia and florida continue to loom as the chief battlegrounds but colorado nevada iowa new hampshire and wisconsin are considered within reach of both mr obama is trying to put arizona and north carolina in play while republicans want to force the president to
