apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic camp h m smith hawaii the top admiral in charge of u s military operations in asia lambasted china this week accusing chinese leaders of actively fomenting instability in the south and east china seas instead of using their expanding economic and military power to create sustainable security in the region china is a regional leader and could be the largest economy in the world very soon said adm samuel j locklear who heads the pentagon s u s pacific command they have a responsibility to lead on creating security in the region he said quite frankly my view is they ve done the opposite of that in recent years see also china flexes muscle with live fire show of battle tanks attack helicopters adm locklear said overall u s china relations remain about 80 percent positive but with the obama administration s self described rebalance of u s foreign policy interests as a backdrop his critical comments on china s role as an agitator in the region signal ongoing and potentially mounting u s military frustration with beijing the admiral s remarks come just a week after the pentagon accused a chinese fighter jet of conducting a dangerous intercept of a u s navy p 8 poseidon plane off china s southern coastline the aug 19 incident which saw the chinese fighter fly within 30 feet of the poseidon triggered fresh concern in washington that beijing may again be flirting with tactics that prompted a meltdown u s china military relations in 2001 when a chinese jet collided with a u s spy plane adm locklear made no specific mention of that or the more recent fighter jet incidents during a roundtable discussion with international reporters organized by the hawaii based east west center on thursday instead he homed in on other actions being taken by beijing including the deployment in may of a chinese oil rig into waters near the disputed paracel islands off the coast of vietnam if you look at the last year in the south china sea there has been a significant attempt by the chinese to change the status quo in their favor he said moving an oil rig into contested waters without first having a dialogue with vietnam about the move is not what a leader would do while china withdrew the oil rig amid outcry from vietnam in july reportedly after finding signs of oil and gas reserves beneath the seabed in the area adm locklear said the incident fit within a recent trend chinese antagonism and muscle flexing toward its smaller neighbors he alluded to beijing s announcement late last year that the chinese military was unilaterally establishing an air defense identification zone adiz over a large swath of the east china sea specifically around a chain of islands long at the center of a territorial dispute between china and close u s ally japan following a harsh u s reaction to the development last november beijing argued that washington was meddling unfairly in east asian affairs and that u s and japanese leaders were overreacting to china s rightful and reasonable expression of power in the region an editorial at the time in china daily a state supported newspaper known to closely track beijing s official positions said japanese and u s hysteria is unnecessary and potentially dangerous because it is based on a serious misreading if not intentional distortion of chinese strategic purposes on thursday adm locklear provided no concrete prescription for how china might be able to provide regional security leadership without inflaming tensions with neighbors like japan and vietnam but he said a key first step would be for beijing to embrace a more transparent posture with its neighbors without more transparency he said washington is watching warily as beijing appears bent on establishing local laws over large expanses of disputed territory in order to give the chinese control over fishing supplies and resources on the seabed regional tensions adm locklear said are stoked by such moves as well as by beijing s lack of desire to go forward with international law forums which the obama administration has spent the past six years attempting promoting as a way to formally and peacefully defuse the potential for a military clash between china and others in the region what we ask the chinese to do is to be more transparent to seek international law forums and participate more openly in them adm locklear said they may have a good argument behind any given action they re taking but they must put those arguments toward international bodies and be more transparent about what actions they re taking and why earlier this month secretary of state john f kerry presented a formal proposal to the association of southeast asian nations asean for china and other members of the association including vietnam and japan to voluntarily halt provocative actions over disputed island s in the region chinese officials responded by claiming that they were already committed to working with asean on regional conflict resolution and suggested that washington has been attempting to intervene in order to sowing discord among nations in the region chinese foreign minister wang yi who met with mr kerry on the sidelines of an asean meeting in myanmar on aug 9 said countries out of the region can reasonably voice their concern but we disagree with them for coming to the region finger pointing i could not understand why some countries out of the region stayed restless to propagate its tense situation mr wang said according to a story published by china s official xinhua news agency on aug 11 is it the
