tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn providence r i ap president trump was just doing what he could to raise spirits when he signed bibles at an alabama church for survivors of a deadly tornado outbreak many religious leaders say though some are offended and others say he could have handled it differently hershael york dean of the southern baptist theological seminary school of theology in louisville kentucky said he didn t have a problem with trump signing bibles like former presidents have because he was asked and because it was important to the people who were asking though we don t have a national faith there is faith in our nation and so it s not at all surprising that people would have politicians sign their bibles he said those bibles are meaningful to them and apparently these politicians are too top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century but the rev donnie anderson executive minister of the rhode island state council of churches said she was offended by the way trump scrawled his signature friday as he autographed bibles and other things including hats and posed for photos she viewed it she said as a calculated political move by the republican president to court his evangelical voting base presidents have a long history of signing bibles though earlier presidents typically signed them as gifts to send with a spiritual message president ronald reagan signed a bible that was sent secretly to iranian officials in 1986 president franklin roosevelt signed the family bible his attorney general used to take the oath of office in 1939 it would have been different anderson said if trump had signed a bible out of the limelight for someone with whom he had a close connection for me the bible is a very important part of my faith and i don t think it should be used as a political ploy she said i saw it being used just as something out there to symbolize his support for the evangelical community and it shouldn t be used in that way people should have more respect for scripture york said that he personally would not ask a politician to sign a bible but that he has been asked to sign bibles after he preaches it feels awkward he said but he doesn t refuse if it s meaningful to them to have signatures in their bible i m willing to do that he said trump visited alabama on friday to survey the devastation and pay respects to tornado victims the tornado carved a path of destruction nearly a mile wide killing 23 people including four children and a couple in their 80s with 10 victims belonging to a single extended family at the providence baptist church in smiths station alabama the rev rusty sowell said the president s visit was uplifting and will help bring attention to a community that will need a long time to recover before leaving the church trump posed for a photograph with a fifth grade volunteer and signed the child s bible said ada ingram a local volunteer the president also signed her sister s bible ingram said in photos from the visit trump is shown signing the cover of a bible trump should have at least signed inside in a less ostentatious way said the rev dr kevin cassiday maloney it just felt like hubris said cassiday maloney pastor at the first congregational united church of christ in fargo north dakota it almost felt like a desecration of the holy book to put his signature on the front writ large literally he doesn t think politicians should sign bibles he said because it could be seen as a blurring of church and state and an endorsement of christianity over other religions it would have been out of line if trump had brought bibles and given them out but that wasn t the case said james coffin executive director of the interfaith council of central florida too much is being made out of something that doesn t deserve that kind of attention he said bill leonard the founding dean and professor of divinity emeritus at the wake forest university school of divinity in winston salem north carolina woke up to facebook posts saturday morning by former students who were upset about trump signing the bibles because they don t view him as an appropriate example of spiritual guidance but leonard said it s important to remember that signing bibles is an old tradition particularly in southern churches leonard said he would have viewed it as more problematic if the signings were done at a political rally he doesn t see how trump could have refused at the church it would ve been worse if he had said no because it would ve seemed unkind and this was at least one way he could show his concern along with his visit he said in this setting where tragedy has occurred and where he comes for this brief visit we need to have some grace about that for these folks contributing to this
