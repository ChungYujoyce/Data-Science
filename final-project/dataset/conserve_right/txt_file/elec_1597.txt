about recall results in the blue collar state washington gov scott walker apos s definitive victory in wisconsin apos s recall election is already reverberating in other state capitals it exposed the shrunken political muscle of the unions that tried to oust him underscoring their vulnerability to attacks from the right and inability to retaliate republicans in some nearby states where anti union measures failed this year say they now plan to use walker apos s victory to mount renewed efforts in 2013 instead of ejecting the republican who slashed state and local government workers apos job benefits and bargaining rights the union instigated recall has made walker a heroic model for conservatives five months before the november election i think it apos s bad news for the labor movement said john russo a labor studies professor at youngstown state university it gives the impression they are not as strong as they once were which they are not labor leaders maintain that the fight was worth it that the massive protests against walker and bitter divisions it created will make other governors and legislators think twice before making similar forays against unions but walker apos s victory is encouraging republicans in other states to push ahead with their own efforts to curtail unions apos power and chop away at the benefits gained for their members over the years gop lawmakers in states such as michigan minnesota missouri and new hampshire are likely to push harder for right to work legislation or other measures that restrict automatic union dues collection no labor fight had so captivated americans since president ronald reagan fired 11 000 air traffic controllers for illegally striking in 1981 a move that encouraged businesses to take tougher stands against unions and helped precipitate a steep decline in union membership i consider it bigger than the air traffic controllers said gary chaison a professor of industrial relations at clark university in worcester mass i think it apos s going to embolden employers in bargaining and discourage workers from joining unions i think it apos s hitting unions on all fronts republicans in some states near wisconsin are paying attention not only is there the momentum in favor of the kinds of reforms that governor walker advocated for and got passed but there becomes a competitive issue said minnesota state sen dave thompson a republican who apos s sponsoring an amendment to his state apos s constitution to make minnesota a right to work state it becomes harder for places like minnesota to compete economically with states that make positive reforms that benefit the business climate and make life easier on taxpayers thompson said in missouri state sen dan brown is hoping the wisconsin recall results will encourage the legislature apos s large yet reluctant gop majorities to move forward next year with bills limiting some union powers brown wants to pare back mandatory wages on public works projects and halt the perpetual deduction of union dues from public employee paychecks by requiring annual written authorization after republicans swept to power in dozens of state legislatures in 2010 unions have spent millions battling anti labor measures across the country they were already smarting this year after indiana became the first state in a decade to pass right to work legislation and michigan banned automatic deduction of union dues from teacher paychecks their loss in wisconsin far overshadowed the unions apos biggest political win in the past year when ohio voters last november struck down in a referendum a law pushed by republican gov john kasich curbing collective bargaining rights for public workers public employee unions suffered two more losses tuesday in california voters in san diego approved a ballot measure that imposes a six year freeze on pay levels used to determine pension benefits for city workers a measure approved in san jose requires city employees to pay up to 16 percent of their salaries to keep their retirement plan or accept more modest benefits afl cio political director mike podhorzer said unions should get more credit for the ohio win and for collecting nearly 1 million signatures to initiate the wisconsin recall walker and his supporters spent 47 million compared with democrats apos 19 million to counter a strong union ground game that pushed voter turnout to levels usually seen during presidential contests this is not an experience many politicians want to go through podhorzer said still the turnout effort fell short of producing the unions apos hoped for results exit polls showed voters from union households breaking 63 percent to 37 percent for democratic milwaukee mayor tom barrett that apos s virtually the same as in the 2010 governor apos s race even though union households represented a bigger greater share of the electorate this time walker had convinced his republican dominated legislature that limiting collective bargaining rights and making union members pay more for their health coverage and pensions was necessary to plug a 3 6 billion state budget shortfall labor leaders claimed he also wanted to cripple unions by banning automatic dues deduction for public employees since the new wisconsin law took effect the state apos s second largest union the american federation of state county and municipal employees has lost nearly half of its members in the state according to internal documents obtained by the associated press the documents show that between march 2011 and february 2012 wisconsin membership in afscme dropped from 63 577 to 34 942 as national union membership has dwindled to just 11 8 percent of the workforce the one growth area in recent years has been among teachers firefighters and other government employees public sector workers now represent more than half of all union members some governors may be reluctant to create the kind of stark divisions seen in wisconsin said nelson lichtenstein director of the center for the study of work labor and democracy at the university of california santa barbara are these governors going to campaign on more attacks on public sector unions lichtenstein said i don apos t think they are it apos s clear they got a lot of pushback it apos s divisive it apos s difficult to be a governor with complete polarization russo the labor professor at youngstown state said the lesson of wisconsin may be to take on unions in smaller steps rather than through sweeping measures as in ohio and wisconsin michigan rep mike shirkey a republican who backed a new law prohibiting schools from deducting union dues from employees apos paychecks said the walker victory provides additional spine stiffening for lawmakers looking at challenging union leaders it basically puts some wind in our sail to continue down the road that we apos ve already been on to advance free market principles across the economy of michigan including in the behavior and performance of union leadership shirkey said unions in michigan are already trying to gather enough signatures to put a measure on the ballot this november that would amend the state constitution to prohibit the right to work laws they fear republicans will pass in new hampshire republicans were unable to override democratic gov john lynch apos s veto of a right to work measure last year but lynch is not running for re election this year and a victory by conservatives could revive that effort new hampshire house speaker william o apos brien will continue to prioritize right to work legislation spokeswoman shannon shutts said in new mexico walker apos s victory could embolden republican gov susana martinez apos s effort to limit that state apos s collective bargaining law through legal action she has won control of a board that oversees public worker contract disputes and in iowa gov terry branstad two seats shy of a gop lock on the legislature said he would propose requiring state workers some who pay nothing toward their health insurance to shoulder 20 percent of their premiums every state apos s situation apos s a little different but we kind of follow what each other is doing and i apos ve been inspired branstad said associated press writers david a lieb in jefferson city mo thomas beaumont in milwaukee and holly
