presidential debates began with a question on the economy and jobs both candidates answered the question with their ideas to boost the economy donald trump says his tax plan may benefit the wealthy but it is also a great thing for the middle class because companies would invest more in building their businesses he says companies want to create jobs but they often move their money overseas because taxes are so onerous secretary clinton directed voters to her website for her economic plan she brought up the site when trump was hammering her on taxes and regulations he said he s going into cut taxes big league you re going to raise taxes big league end of story clinton retorted that she kind of assumed there would be a lot of these charges and claims mrs clinton accused mr trump of not paying some of the people who have worked for him through the years she said she is relieved her father a small business man never had to work for him she said trump stiffed thousands of small business owners and workers through the years trump said tens of thousands of people have worked for him and liked it he defended his businesses saying they have been successful he said he d only not pay someone if their work was unsatisfactory trump stated at one point that clinton didn t have the stamina to be president she suggested he was referring to her gender and reminded viewers of some of his past comments about women she also accused trump of being easily provoked he defended himself saying i have much better judgment than she does i have much better temperament both candidates accused each other of starting rumors claimingpresident barack obama wasn t born in the united states they came to somewhat of an agreement on the subject of not making people on watch lists and no fly lists eligible for guns the gun debate also centered around on going violence between police and minorities trump said america needs law and order especially in inner cities he told viewers that blacks and hispanics are living in hell because it s so dangerous clinton told trump he paints such a dire negative picture both agreed something needed to be the debate could be one of the most watched and even be among some of the highest rated programs ever the 2015 super bowl clocks in at no 1 with 115 million viewers the 1983 series finale of mash brought in 106 million one poll estimates monday s event could rival those numbers topping a hundred million regardless of the count it will be must see tv trump told cbn news his simple goal for monday s epic encounter win that s all i want to do is win trump said but for this outsider winning won t be the result of traditional textbook strategy instead he s expected to stick with what got him here instinct and boldness trump however will need to pass the plausibility test that is whether voters see him as a president many are evangelicals still trying to decide whether they will pull the lever for trump or possibly sit this election out but evangelical leader david barton calls that the wrong approach we have a very selfish view of what we do with voting and i say that in the sense of that most christians think that voting is a right it s not it s a duty barton said and trump s been rallying the troops in the days leading up to this debate it s appropriate that this first attention grabbing debate will be in the new york area both candidates feel right at home in this familiar territory trump tower is located in manhattan clinton s headquarters are 20 minutes away in brooklyn and the debate site at hofstra university in hempstead is only about an hour drive as he has proven trump enjoys mixing it up and getting feisty at debates but he doesn t typically throw the first punch instead he waits until he s attacked and analysts say he s one of the best counter punchers out there so how will clinton get ready to rumble you have to be prepared for like wacky stuff that comes at you she told late night host jimmy kimmel i am drawing on my experience from elementary school while clinton s opponent may be taking a less traditional approach to preparing for the debates she is going by the book the democratic nominee cut back campaigning last week sources say she s going through briefing books rehearsing and studying clips of trump from the republican primary debates taking notes of his style and what gets under his skin clinton s faith adviser burns stridertold told cbn news clinton isn t underestimating trump i run across people partisans and non partisans alike they ll say why are y all working so hard i mean your girl s going to be the next president which my comment is oh contraire strider said we have a very tough race ahead of us and we have two candidates and we have two candidates families that know how to win at the rodeo and it s going to be a tough race for both sides and they re going to go at it strider warned clinton has participated in more debates than any presidential candidate in recent history but it s hard to say how much that experience will help with an unconventional outsider like trump clinton is preparing to face some uncomfortable subjects from her email scandal to bill clinton s infidelity a campaign insider says her team hopes to come up with a memorable one liner that will knock trump off his game and stick in voters minds regarding clinton one of the big dangers to watch for is how she will react to trump s attacks she s been known to get agitated pretty quickly so keeping a calm cool demeanor will be vitally important in this debate for the ages submitted by escamp on august 31 2015 3 04pm stay informed with the latest from cbn news delivered to your inbox
