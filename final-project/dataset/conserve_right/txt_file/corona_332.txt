points on concerns about the pandemic aside from the rising cost of the administration s rescue plan the suggestion of sending checks to americans raised objections in conservative circles such as at the club for growth some republicans have embraced cash stipends for families so they can afford to buy food and pay bills the advocacy group said tuesday this policy should be opposed it provides a giant transfer payment system that imposes net costs on the economy relief for families should be provided through existing government welfare programs and the enhanced unemployment insurance program as for the eye popping cost of the administration s rescue plan mr mnuchin said saving the economy is more important than rising budget deficits congress right now should be concerned about the american workers and small business he said interest rates are incredibly low so there s very little cost of borrowing this money we ll fix the deficit this is not the time to worry about it this is the time that hardworking americans are impacted by government decisions that s when the government has to step up to put money into the economy some conservative republican senators said they supported or were at least open to sending checks directly to workers sen josh hawley of missouri said it was exactly the right thing to do sen todd young of indiana said he is focused on what is most helpful to the individual american worker who is unable to work although lawmakers in both parties agree on the need for significant federal action the path forward in congress isn t clear senate

and others in her party mrs pelosi whose proposal doesn t mesh with a 750 billion relief plan from senate minority leader charles e schumer new york democrat doesn t envision aid for hotels or airlines any relief that emerges for workers and businesses would be added to a bill approved by the house last week to provide paid sick leave and free virus testing which is estimated to cost taxpayers about 105 billion it all began on feb 25 with mr trump s proposal to spend 2 5 billion to help states speed up access to testing that measure grew to 8 5 billion by the time the president signed it on tuesday mr trump emphasized the growing need to speed aid to workers who are being sidelined by the pandemic i don t want people losing their jobs or not having money to live when they were doing very well just four weeks ago mr trump said at the white house so we re going big the president had been pushing for a payroll tax cut through the end of the year but he acknowledged that the impact of such relief would be felt more slowly payroll tax is one way but it does come over a period of months mr trump said the president said he wants to do something that gets money to them as quickly as possible obviously some people shouldn t be getting checks with 1 000 he said mr mnuchin said the president wants checks to be issued within two weeks which seems unlikely americans need cash now mr mnuchin said he suggested there would be an income limit for recipients the threshold was still under discussion we don t need to send people who make a million dollars a year checks mr mnuchin said he underscored the urgency the president has instructed me we have to do this now he said this is no fault to american workers for medical reasons we are shutting down parts of the
