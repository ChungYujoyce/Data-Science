morning call email in a recent episode of the dystopian anthology series black mirror spoiler alert the british police are called to a live crime scene on the line are executives at smithereen an addictive american social media platform caught up in the situation at every step the firm turns out to know more about the perpetrator than the authorities of his sovereign country the officers are public spirited and decent and the criminal is not a straightforward baddie or lunatic but the sovereignties of both state and individual are overwhelmed by the reach of a californian data giant that knows his darkest traumas can listen in to him and can plumb its algorithms to understand his emotional make up the episode could be a dramatisation of the age of surveillance capitalism the celebrated book by the american social psychologist shoshana zuboff seven years in the making it anatomises the rise of instrumentarian power whereby firms capture data about human behaviour process it and turn the resulting information advantage into an instrument of prediction and control it is the tale of a new gilded age in which giant firms real life smithereens such as facebook and google have unfair and undemocratic power over states and individuals zuboff s thesis like the black mirror episode leaves you briefly thinking if only the state could wield the same data power as the top knotted silicon valley billionaires but then images of overreach and authoritarianism swim before your eyes and you think oh god that would be hell it falls not to black mirror to offer a glimpse of that other extreme but to journalists because a world where the state wields even more data power than facebook or google already exists it is xinjiang a mountainous region of north west china and
