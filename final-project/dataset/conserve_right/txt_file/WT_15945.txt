apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion china is flexing its maritime muscles again last week the state newspaper people s daily darkly warned of due consequences if beijing is challenged in the south china sea a few weeks earlier china s top military officer called u s naval exercises in the south china sea inappropriate and chided america for spending too much on defense what s the beef it s simple really china is asserting a sovereign claim to virtually all of the south china sea and the islands in it that s not new but in recent years beijing has become more aggressive about it since february china has launched at least nine incursions into philippines claimed territory and had several run ins with the vietnamese top stories firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore china is exploiting the law of the sea treaty to buttress its claims in all its near seas employing idiosyncratic interpretations of the treaty to which the u s is not a party it argues that u s naval vessels and auxiliary ships should be restricted when operating in what it considers its exclusive economic zone indeed china sees the south china sea not merely as an exclusive sphere of influence but as sovereign territory it s not most of it is international waters yet my colleague dean cheng notes that china s navy is adapting its strategy to this more ambitious idea whereas it used to focus mainly on taiwan an additional goal today is to secure waters from japan s home islands along the ryukyus chain through taiwan and the philippines and to the strait of malacca including the south china sea to control this vast expanse china would need to hold the u s navy at arm s length denying our ships access to international waters should china succeed in this it would make it harder for the u s navy and other forces to come to the aid of taiwan and our allies japan and the philippines if china attacks mr cheng reports that in some chinese government writings the oceans surrounding china are considered blue soil in other words of strategic value comparable to chinese territory the chinese draw lines in international waters the same way fortified lines are drawn on land lest you think that u s naval dominance is so overwhelming we have nothing to worry about think again though still strong u s naval power is waning and the chinese know it secondly the south china sea east china sea and yellow sea are much closer to china than to the u s and a chinese naval force concentrated on controlling close by waters has built in supply and transportation advantages mr cheng says china s military planners know they cannot challenge the u s navy globally but they could give it a run for its money closer to its mainland china is ridding itself of obsolete ships and building a large number of its missile armed fast attack craft these vessels carry sea skimming yj 82 supersonic anti ship cruise missiles well suited for attacking u s naval vessels it also is upgrading its destroyers and deploying its first aircraft carrier the u s cannot let china s actions jeopardize america s commitments to its allies or interfere with our right to navigate international waters china has a right to a navy and self defense it has no right to pretend that it owns the south china sea the main thing standing in the way of beijing s aspirations is the u s navy to ensure freedom of the seas in the pacific the navy needs more resources not fewer yet the recent debt ceiling deal threatens to downscale america s naval forces drastically nor can the navy afford to forgo modernization of surface and subsurface combatants which will happen if draconian defense cuts continue whether china s claims to its near seas will put us on a collision course is an open question but beijing should know that any attempt to change the rules and make that area the maritime equivalent of its exclusive backyard will meet with u s resistance kim r holmes a former assistant secretary of state is a vice president at the heritage foundation www heritage org follow h
