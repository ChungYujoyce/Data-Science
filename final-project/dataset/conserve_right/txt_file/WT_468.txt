apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic caracas venezuela ap venezuelan opposition leader juan guaid wraps up an international tour with a rally in miami on super bowl weekend with the looming question whether the opposition leader can score an important meeting with president donald trump guaid s ability to win face time with trump in a symbolically important meeting will test the young political leader s standing with his most important international ally if trump does not meet with guaid that would raise serious questions about the administration s continuing commitment to venezuela s interim president said michael shifter president of the washington based inter american dialogue think tank it might well be interpreted that trump is hedging on guaid top stories fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century with his support down at home guaid launched the second year of his so far unsuccessful campaign to remove president nicol s maduro by defying a travel ban and slipping out of venezuela seeking to shore up backing from leaders in colombia across europe and canada venezuela has been a top priority in latin america for the trump administration which was a year ago the first among nearly 60 governments to throw their weight behind guaid u s officials called maduro a dictator and hit the state run venezuelan oil firm pdvsa with sanctions among other financial measures designed to push out the socialist leader however maduro remains in control having faced down a coup attempt a brief renewal of mass anti government protests and u s sanctions at various stops on his international trip guaid has met with u s secretary of state mike pompeo u s secretary of commerce wilbur ross and white house adviser ivanka trump the president s daughter but he hasn t yet gotten to the u s president he missed trump at the world economic forum in davos switzerland arriving a day after the u s president left the two will both be in florida this weekend but it is unclear whether guaid is on the guest list for trump s super bowl party at his mar a lago club or invited to any other meetings a trump guaid meeting is under consideration and would likely take place this weekend in south florida according to two people including a senior u s official the official and another person familiar with the discussions spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity because they weren t authorized to discuss the u s president s plans shifter said the lack of a trump guaid session would demoralize the venezuelan opposition that has counted on washington for unwavering support it would also be puzzling to u s allies like colombia and brazil which have worked in concert with the u s in fully backing guaid he said guaid has not delivered the change in venezuela that the trump administration and the country s opposition expected but he is still venezuela s most popular political figure shifter said trump may be frustrated and believe he was misled on venezuela shifter said but there is little cost in meeting with guaid as the democratic struggle enters a new very difficult phase guaid emerged from the opposition in january 2019 to become the first viable challenger in years to maduro the hand chosen successor of the late charismatic leader hugo ch vez the economy continues to shrink after two decades of socialist rule despite venezuela holding the world s largest oil reserves the political and social crisis is driving mass migration as venezuelans abandon a country with shortages of reliable water food electricity gasoline and medical care among basic services guaid claimed presidential powers as leader of the opposition controlled national assembly vowing before cheering masses in caracas streets to overthrow maduro and restore democracy however his plan hitched on flipping the military s loyalty from maduro something that hasn t happened maduro today appears emboldened armed civilian groups loyal to the president patrol the streets on motorcycles

venezuela they have helped venezuela in our time of greatest need and no venezuelan will ever forget that he wrote their commitment has been extraordinary but on behalf of our people i must ask for more guaid s planned rally saturday in miami is expected to draw a large number of venezuelans in the biggest diaspora of expatriates living in the united states it s also a politically important swing state for trump guaido might then make the risky move of returning home although his team has not released details of this plans he completed a similar international tour a year ago returning

venezuela analyst for the eurasia group said aggression by maduro against the opposition in recent weeks such as blocking them from their congressional meeting hall shows maduro is pushing the limits to see if the international community is still watching there s a potential for maduro to be more aggressive toward guaid grais targow said it seems to me he s feeling much more confident in his position today than he was certainly six months ago scott smith on twitter scottsmithap associated press writer
