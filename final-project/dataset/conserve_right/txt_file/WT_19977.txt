apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap president donald trump falsely accused rep ilhan omar of expressing pride in terrorists and misrepresented the record on the economy and health care in his freewheeling north carolina rally a look at some of his claims from wednesday night omar top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed trump quotes omar as saying you don t say america with this intensity you say al qaida it makes you proud al qaida makes you proud you don t speak that way about america the facts this is a wholly distorted account of what the minnesota democrat said she did not voice pride in the terrorist group trump is referring to an interview omar gave in 2013 in it she talked about studying terrorism history or theory under a professor who dramatically pronounced the names of terrorist groups as if to emphasize their evil nature the thing that was interesting in the class was every time the professor said al qaida he sort of like his shoulders went up and he used a menacing intense tone she said her point was that the professor was subtly rousing suspicions of muslims with his theatrical presentation while pronouncing america without the intensity he afforded the names of terrorist groups at no point did she say al qaida should be uttered with intensity or pride and that america shouldn t trump is continuing to assail omar and three other liberal democratic women of color challenging their loyalty to the u s they are reps alexandria ocasio cortez of new york rashida tlaib of michigan and ayanna pressley of massachusetts trump cites a history of omar launching vicious anti semitic statements the facts omar ignited a bipartisan uproar in washington and minnesota during her first weeks in congress this year when she suggested on twitter that members of congress support israel for money many jewish leaders denounced her remarks as reviving old stereotypes about jews money and power a few weeks before her it s all about the benjamins baby tweet a 2012 tweet surfaced in which she said israel hypnotized the world she denied anti semitism was intended and apologized for both episodes ocasio cortez trump on ocasio cortez cortez said that illegal immigrants are more american than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be can you believe that that s what she is saying the facts true except that people who come to the border and ask for refugee status can t be described as illegal immigrants they commit no crime by applying for that status ocasio cortez speaking of woman and children who show up seeking refuge or opportunity said they re acting more american than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be this was from an msnbc interview in january at the rally trump refused to call the new york congresswoman by her full hyphenated surname saying he didn t have time to go with three different names health care trump we are offering plans up to 60 percent cheaper than obamacare the facts the bargain health insurance plans trump talks about are cheaper because they skimp on benefits such as maternity or prescription drug coverage and do not guarantee coverage of preexisting conditions the short term plans the trump administration began offering last year on the federal insurance marketplace provide up to 12 months of coverage and can be renewed for up to 36 months premiums for the plans are about one third the cost of fuller insurance coverage the health plan offerings are intended for people who want an individual health insurance policy but make too much money to qualify for subsides under the affordable care act the trump administration introduced the short term plans which undermine how obamacare is supposed to work after failing to repeal much of president barack obama s health care law trump patients with preexisting conditions are protected by republicans much more so than protected by democrats who will never be able to pull it off the facts democrats did pull it off obama s health care law the affordable care act requires insurers to take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who had medical problems before or when they signed up the trump administration is pressing in court for full repeal of obamacare trump and other republicans say they ll have a plan to preserve protections for people with preexisting conditions but the white house has provided no details economy trump we have the strongest economy in history the facts the economy is not the strongest in the country s history it expanded at an annual rate of 3 1 in the first quarter of this year that growth was the highest in just four years for the first quarter in the late 1990s growth topped 4 for four straight years a level it has not yet reached on an annual basis under trump growth even reached 7 2 in 1984 in fact there are some signs that growth is slowing partly because of trump s trade fights with china and europe factory activity has decelerated for three straight months as global growth has slowed and companies are reining in their spending on large equipment most economists forecast the economy will expand at just a 2 annual rate in the april june period trump is pushing the federal reserve chairman jerome powell to cut short term interest rates to shore up the economy that isn t something a president would do during the strongest economy in history economists mostly expect the fed will cut rates either at its next meeting in july or in september lower rates make it easier for people to borrow and buy new homes and cars the economy is now in its 121st month of growth making it the longest expansion in history most of that took place under obama the economy grew 2 9 in 2018 the same pace it reached in 2015 under obama and simply hasn t hit historically high growth rates trump the lowest unemployment numbers ever the facts again not so the 3 7 unemployment rate in the latest report is not the best in history it s near the lowest level in 50 years when it was 3 5 the u s also had lower rates than now in the early 1950s and during three years of world war ii the annual rate was under 2 trump the best unemployment in our history and likewise women 74 years i m sorry women i let you down it s not in our history but we re going to be there very soon the facts no the jobless rate for women of 3 1 in april was the lowest in 66 years not 74 and it has since increased to 3 3 in june the data only go back 71 years so 74 years isn t a
