house democrats are calling on the inspector general for the department of health and human services hhs to investigate the reassignment of an official charged with overseeing the development of a coronavirus vaccine on wednesday dr rick bright the former head of the biomedical advanced research and development authority barda told the new york times he was removed from his post because he pushed for extra scrutiny of a pair of malaria drugs president donald trump has touted a potential cure for the virus asijr has previously reported the next day rep frank pallone d n j sent a letter to christi grimm the principal deputy inspector general of hhs calling for an investigation of bright s allegations i have been particularly concerned by the trump administration s politicization of public health agencies this most recent action if true further raises serious questions about the commitment of president trump and his administration to science and the public good as the government and the nation work to combat an unprecedented global health pandemic the letter read house democrats call on principal deputy inspector general christi grimm to investigate dr rick bright s

christi grimm to investigate dr rick bright s allegation that political considerations influenced his removal pic twitter com 815boxvk1p pallone argues that removing bright without the presence of his allegations would raise serious concerns however his allegations that political considerations influenced this decision heighten those concerns and demand full accountability pallone continued to note that trump has repeatedly pushed the use of chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to help treat the virus despite the absence of clinical trial data demonstrating the drugs safety and efficacy in treating the disease and against the warnings of his own public health experts he also noted that the national institutes of health nih recommended against the use of the pair drugs as ijr has previously reported now more than ever in the midst of a global health pandemic and with an administration stacked with political leaders who repeatedly pander to a president intent on burying science and dismantling agencies longstanding missions for the public good we must ensure our government s scientific institutions are insulated from political pressure pallone said pallone noted that bright said he would ask for an inspector general review of the manner in which this administration has politicized the work of barda and has pressured me and other conscientious scientists to fund companies with political connections and efforts that lack scientific merit in addition to accepting his request i urge you to investigate the circumstances surrounding dr bright s reassignment he added brightreportedlypraised the acquisition of those two drugs in an internal hhs email additionally politico reports that trump administration officials had been trying to remove bright since last year for incompetence and insubordination the same guy that asked fda to approve emergency use of the drugs this is such nonsense i m so sick of the political games of trump haters may their karma be harsh the only difference between private and public employment regarding reassignments or firing is we don t make the news i m sure he keeps his salary pension and all the other goodies the average worker would not get just another lifelong liberal bureaucrat trying to exert power he doesn t have that s true of about 2 3 of em one question for the dims who has the sole right to hire or fire this moron bright reportedly praised the acquisition of those two drugs in an internal hhs email then he speaks against using it typical democrat can t make up his mind i guess he was ok with it until the president wanted to use it resist resist resist obstruct obstruct obstruct the only politicization of everything is by the dems they call for investigation after investigation for the purpose of trying to find something they can twist and spin for the nov election how many investigations is this that the democrats have asked for three i think has anyone started a pool on when the democrats will call for another impeachment the new democrat strategy impeach everyone they don t like and see if they can use it in the election lying cheating corrupt democrats now they are insisting that we drop off our ballots in locations they designate operated by people they choose a perfect situation for them to pilfer through the votes and dispose of any they don t like dems gotta stop this crap now we ve got corona gate on our hands why not impeach trump again i m sure they will be successful this time look i don t like trump either but the politics must removed from this pandemic it isn t just trump that has been pushing the hydroxychloriquine europeans and asians are pushing it also with their studies showing that it significantly helps contrary to the half baked political study the anti trumpers pulled out of the air last week half a dozen noted virologists refuted the detail results of that study as being fixed against hydroxychloriquine it was rigged like the last 3 dnc primaries totally discounting trump i am more suspicious of people like this bright guy as being inside proxies for big pharm who absolutely want to kill existing cheap plentiful out of patent drugs like hydroxychloriquine pharm wants to make billions on this pandemic and they cannot do it if existing cheap plentiful out of patent drugs like hydroxychloriquine are in the mix so they are going to try and kill this drug maybe somebody at barda saw the same thing as me about bright about pharm or bright may well be a hard left wing guy and barda removed him because he could not keep his political views out of his work whether it be pharm as a client or trump as a target hmmmmm this sounds like the fbi doj cia nsa the last 5 years hmmmmm those people should have all been fired also during the previous administration imho they should all be in jail now come on durham fyi i am not a trump guy i was bernie sanders in 2016 and tulsi in 2020 but we know how that ended damn dems are gonna make me go back and vote for that trump jerk again i will not vote for a old guy with dementia who is owned by special interests and became a nominee because elitists in dnc rigged the primary again you sure know how to pick em don y ya probably not the only bad decisions you ve made in life the most revealing part of this article is buried at the very end politico reports that trump administration officials had been trying to remove bright since last year for incompetence and insubordination so they have been attempting to get rid of this guy for a long time well before covid 19 ever came along and it finally happened and now because of the timing he s trying to make a martyr of himself sick so true mike remember when the democrats were calling for comey to be fired for announcing that the hillarrhoid was under investigation before the election then when the president fired him they complained remember when biden bragged about using withholding aid to the ukraine to get the chief prosecutor fired then changed the story to say that biden wanted him fired because he wouldn t investigate corruption in burisma does it stand to reason that biden would want a company investigated for corruption when biden s son either worked for or was going to work for that company then they falsely accuse the president of doing what biden did despite the fact that the president never mentioned the aid package in the phone call read the transcript two faced liars are what make up the democrats party they will say whatever they can to obtain power and control then their mouthpieces msm constantly repeat their message well isn t it too bad that any agency has to suffer the scrutiny of anyone we have all learned that much of what news tells us is biased and often wrong this idea of hydroxychloroquine helping those who have gotten this virus was never touted as the answer it was merely something that has worked for some people just like we have no true picture of this damned virus and how it totally operates from person to person hydroxychloriquine evidently works for some people but not for others nothing should be ruled out while we await an answer to end this pandemic if it weren t for president trump mentioning these drugs many wouldn t know to ask for them and the deaths would be higher no body knows everything your right no body knows everything hate to disagree with you nancy but philly michael and genital contusion absolutely think they know everything and we must listen to them to save our wonderful country to which i say bwhahahahahahahaahahahha crystsl while the democratic leadership and most members afe corrupt that doesn t give the american fadcist party members the right to carry on their corruption too they are even more corrupt if you csn fathom that the only group who are trying tk do anything at all about corruption are from the progressive left don t trust me fine look it up objectively yourself but it is true we must elect better politicians or we are screwed outnow refusefascism org i apologize for the many typos but at least replying works again thanks for listening alex btw you lose all credibility when you start calling the republicans fascists couldn t have said it better myself your comments cost you credibility your calling republicans fascists does not help your typos have everything to do with your drinking problem this is not new they ve been trying to get rid of this jackoff for over a year and now they have and the dems are trying to use it as a reason to investigate trump again and it ll go nowhere again btw you lose all credibility when you start calling the republicans fascists american fadcist party please explain what a fadcist is you had another typo you should have said the only group who are involved in corruption are from the progressive left that statement would have made sense lying cheating corrupt democrats chuck contusion is not interested in making sense i ve learned that if the dems want to investigate anything or anyone it means they don t want one of their own or their corruption exposed true elect a clown get a circus so true democrats are why stupid people shouldn t vote right on comments are closed
