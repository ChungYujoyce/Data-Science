asia risk could lie ahead as the regional peak travel season takes hold which could multiply the disease diffusion said stephen innes chief asian strategist for axicorp so while the risk is returning to the market the lights might not turn green until we move through the lunar new year travel season to better gauge the coronavirus dispersion the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in china along with cases of a deadly form of bird flu resulted in widespread quarantine measures in many chinese cities and in hong kong more than 8 000 people fell sick and just under 800 people died a mortality rate of under 10 while the ordinary flu kills hundreds of thousands of people each year such new diseases raise alarm due to the uncertainties over how deadly they might be and how they might spread that s especially true during the annual mass travel of the lunar new year festival which begins this week the cost to the global economy can be quite staggering in negative gdp

low 6 1 annual pace in 2019 an interim trade pact between beijing and washington had raised hopes that some pressure from tensions between the two biggest economies might ease and the latest data have showed signs of improved demand for exports the virus outbreak raises the risk such optimism might be premature we expect increased downward pressure on china s growth particularly in the services sector said ting lu and other analysts at nomura in hong kong who based their projections on the spread of the sars virus the growing number of global travelers has contributed to the spread of
