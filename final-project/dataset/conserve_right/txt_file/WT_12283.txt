ndicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the united states is relying increasingly on three transit routes snaking through central asia russia and the caucuses to ship nonmilitary supplies and fuel into afghanistan as the deteriorating relationship between washington and pakistan closes off border crossings according to a senate report obtained by the associated press use of the northern distribution network to supply u s and coalition forces has been crucial in the war against terrorism and its role underscores the political and strategic importance of the central asian nations on the front lines of the conflict in broader security terms the u s has invested millions of dollars in the former soviet states compared with billions spent on afghanistan but even that limited u s assistance could serve as a bulwark against the region s major players russia and china the report suggested top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the study found that just three years ago about 90 percent of nonmilitary supplies to afghanistan went through karachi pakistan today close to 75 percent of cargo is shipped through the northern network about 40 percent of cargo goes through the ground network 31 percent is shipped by air and 29 percent heads through pakistan the study said citing figures from the military s u s transportation command a supply route other than through pakistan has become imperative for the u s pakistan closed its two afghanistan crossings in chaman and torkham in the northwestern khyber tribal area almost immediately after nato aircraft attacked two army posts along the border on nov 26 the strikes killed 24 pakistani troops last year after u s helicopters accidentally killed two pakistani troops islamabad closed torkham for 11 days it reopened the route after washington formally apologized everybody s hopeful we can get something back on track with pakistan sen john f kerry massachusetts democrat and chairman of the senate foreign relations committee said in an interview pakistanis make money off that route that may interest them at some point but on the other hand we can t be prisoners of one relationship with something as vital to our national security interests mr kerry said the 25 page report by the democratic staff of the committee was to have been released monday congressional aides made a field visit to kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan and uzbekistan in october the network involves three routes to ship items including fuel clothes vehicles and other nonlethal supplies one route begins in poti georgia a port on the black sea goes through azerbaijan across the caspian sea and into central asia a second route begins in riga latvia and extends through russia kazakhstan and uzbekistan the third route also starts in latvia and goes through russia kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan and heads into afghanistan via tajikistan the united states has increased its reliance on the northern distribution network the report said but it is not a perfect substitute for the current supply routes in pakistan for example the northern distribution network allows for only one way transit of goods to afghanistan though discussions reportedly are under way to expand the network to support two way transit of cargo leaving afghanistan via the northern routes shipping through the network is also costly an additional 10 000 per 20 foot container compared with going through pakistan separate from the network the u s relies on the manas transit center in kyrgyzstan to transport american and coalition forces manas also serves as an air refueling site for aircraft heading to afghanistan in highlighting the role of the five former soviet states kazakhstan kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkmenistan and uzbekistan the report said modest u s investments in the region could produce a significant payoff especially as the united states looks to stabilize afghanistan for the planned u s drawdown through 2014 the prospect of u s troops leaving unnerves the region the report said afghanistan s neighbors fear the 2014 security transition and withdrawal of coalition forces could mean abandonment the report said it said government officials told the senate aides in meetings that they fear the transition will increase drug trafficking and create a security vacuum that extremist groups such as the islamic movement of uzbekistan and islamic jihad union would fill transitioning security and governance to the afghans does not mean america s departure and i want pakistan to hear that loud and clear said mr kerry who has made several trips to pakistan and i want afghans and the neighbors to hear that loud and clear america is not retreating from its interests we re really trying to be more effective about the way in which we re going to support them the report recommends economic assistance for some of the central asian nations and investments in english language training and public private projects on cross border electricity especially as china russia iran south korea india japan and turkey play bigger roles the report says russia is expanding its influence through military bases and commercial agreements and may redeploy troops to the border of tajikistan and afghanistan china is making financial investments and spending money on infrastructure total u s assistance to the central asian nations including security and economic aid was about 436 million last year compared with about 15 billion for
