ended up killing nearly 800 people the cover up was exposed by a high ranking physician gabriel leung dean of medicine at the university of hong kong said chinese authorities have responded much more quickly this time our underlying assumptions are the force of infection is very different now because so many public health measures have been undertaken and so many interventions have been executed
