apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap robert mueller paused he refused to speculate he made constant references to his report but wasn t sure of a number of things in it the former special counsel s long awaited heavily negotiated testimony wednesday was just what he d promised relentlessly focused on the report he issued in april on president donald trump obstruction and russian meddling in the 2016 election as members of the house judiciary committee strained to hear what he had to say it became clear that the famously apolitical mueller was not going to play their made for tv games yet it was hardly the commanding performance many expected from mueller a former fbi director with a towering reputation in washington on numerous occasions he asked that questions be repeated and at one point he seemed to reach for the word conspiracy as he sought to answer whether his team found evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia a democrat helpfully

trump says americans won t stand for stay at home orders anymore at another time when democrat steve cohen cited the trump quote i m f cked from a specific page of mueller s report and asked whether former attorney general jeff sessions had been the source the former special counsel demurred i m not certain he quietly told the panel the caffeinated crowd in the hearing room hushed chairman jerrold nadler interjected director please speak into the microphone with another reminder and a break mueller later grew more resolute on other questions at one point firmly criticizing trump for praising wikileaks during the 2016 campaign but frequently during his testimony wednesday the former special counsel with a pad of paper and binders in front of him and a former aide at his side seemed to waver on details of his two year investigation and the resulting report that launched questions about trump s fitness for office at some points he delivered terse one word answers he repeatedly referred back to the wording in his report and he at times appeared stilted and halting in his answers throughout mueller s top aide in the investigation aaron zebley sat at the witness table just out of camera range paying rapt attention to the questions and answers and paging through what appeared to be the mueller report in the hearing s first hour nadler asked mueller whether any senior white house officials refused a request to be interviewed by mueller and his team mueller first replied i don t believe so but then added well let me take that back i would have to look at it but i am not certain that that was the case mueller s probe generated more than 2 000 subpoenas and hundreds of warrants and witness interviews creating a sweeping investigative record that could trip up any witness and lawmakers are fond of asking complex sometimes nonsensical questions during their five minutes of questioning certainly democrats had no trouble hearing mueller say what would become their top takeaways including his statement early on that his report did not exonerate trump of obstruction all sides had reason to know generally what to expect the committee s democrats had telegraphed that they were going to focus on five examples of trump s obstruction described in the report and mueller made clear that he intended to give no answers that went beyond what s in the report he also had advised democrats beforehand that he wasn t going to read from his report according to a person involved with the negotiations who spoke about the confidential talks only on condition of anonymity he stuck to that vow denying trump s harshest critics footage that could advance prospects for trump s impeachment and the party s bid to unseat him in 2020 if it s in the report i support it he repeated throughout the day some allies predicted that mueller s performance would be used against democrats director mueller s stutters stammerings and unfamiliarity with portions of his written report will be spliced together and given the viral video treatment for partisan political advantage at the conclusion of today s hearings tweeted james a gagliano who served under mueller at the fbi when the hearing had been underway for two hours david axelrod who served as senior adviser to former president barack obama tweeted this is delicate to say but mueller whom i deeply respect has not publicly testified before congress in at least six years and he does not appear as sharp as he was then trump fuming tweeted again that mueller s probe had been the greatest witch hunt in u s history inside the room it was unclear how much of mueller s understated performance was purposeful through at least one former aide he had telegraphed his intent to stick to the report as blandly and factually as possible and as the day wore on he emphatically stuck to that strategy mueller refused in no uncertain terms for example to comment on the so called steele dossier a package of research from a former british spy that documented connections between russia and the trump campaign i am not going to answer that question sir he told rep greg steube r fla pressed mueller added i am not going to speak any more to it i am not going to answer that and when it came to trump s favorite ways to characterize mueller s investigation the former special prosecutor was clear it is not a witch hunt he said associated press writers eric tucker mary clare jalonick and matthew daly contributed to this report follow kellman on twitter at http www twitter com aplauriekellman for
