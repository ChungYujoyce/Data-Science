thailand let the u s use its territory to launch massive aerial bombardments in vietnam and laos where thai ground forces also fought alongside u s troops after regarding communist china during the cold war years as a sinister foe bent on subversion bangkok s relations with beijing have steadily improved in the past 30 years and have included military cooperation the joint marines drill began just after the end of a 15 day counterterrorism training exercise between thai and chinese special forces in china s southern city of guilin the two armies have been holding annual joint special

friendship 2005 many thais trace their family ancestry to china with the sino thais enjoying prominent and wealthy positions in bangkok s political and financial circles as a result thailand sees improving its relations with china as a pragmatic and profitable and not contradicting its close ties with the u s the chinese thai exercise has attracted attention in nearby singapore a staunch u s military ally but also an island nation reliant on free shipping lanes amphibious military capabilities have application in disaster relief and humanitarian operations but they are designed mainly for complex combat assault missions launched from the sea singapore s straits times reported describing what some in the region fear is the purpose of chinese marine capabilities in china s case the capability would be particularly important in a full scale conflict with taiwan the straits times said china considers taiwan a rebellious province and has vowed to absorb the island which has maintained de facto independence across the 100 mile wide taiwan strait since the communist revolution brought mao zedong to power in 1949 the u s keeps open its right to defend taiwan against any military aggression and has sold taipei billions of dollars worth of weapons china wants to diversify its southern trade routes especially from landlocked yunnan province because its main southern seaport at hong kong is not convenient for some imports and exports and closer relations with thailand would be a major boon for china in terms of trade routes if trade routes can cut straight south across communist laos into thailand then the chinese would gain faster access via thailand s modern transport links to bangkok and the gulf of thailand and speed travel further south to malaysia singapore and indonesia china is also trying to upgrade a southern route from yunnan province through burma and its ports along the bay of bengal offering cheap and easy access to nearby india and the

evolution of international strategic configuration and asia pacific security organized by the china association for military science china s warming relations with thailand were especially noticeable after the thai military seized power in a bloodless 2006 coup and beijing immediately welcomed thailand s new junta a central element of bangkok s hedging strategy is to keep its military alliance

relationship that has developed between thailand and china over the past few decades it is unsurprising that military security links are among china s most well developed in the region second only to burma china s quasi ally mr storey said in a 2008 article mr storey also noted that the number of thai military officers attending educational courses at the national defense university in beijing has increased since 2001 as has the number of pla officers studyin
