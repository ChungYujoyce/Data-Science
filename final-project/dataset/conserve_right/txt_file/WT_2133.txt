apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion if anything concrete has come from the democrat fueled impeachment hearings being spearheaded by house intelligence chairman adam schiff it s this witnesses acknowledge hunter biden s burisma holdings post came in at less than comfortable on the old ethics scale so why isn t capitol hill and the media more focused on this as an investigation impeachment witnesses suggest hunter biden s ukraine ties could be conflict of interest the new york post reported top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed ya think and yet there s a double standard being played here on biden where the quid pro quo intent was obvious where joe biden actually bragged about threatening to hold up 1 billion in u s aid to ukraine unless then president petro poroshenko fired a prosecutor who was investigating in part burisma holdings where hunter served as a board member it s all conspiracy theory and tin hat crazy to suggest anything nefarious to call for deeper scrutiny biden we re told was simply rooting out corruption taking a tough guy approach and after all that s what a good vice president who loves his country should do right but on president donald trump where a quid pro quo with newly elected ukraine president volodymyr zelensky is alleged but denied and unproven it s impeach impeach impeach it s automatically assumed trump by simply referencing biden s son in a july 25 telephone call to zelensky was making a not so veiled threat to tie u s aid for ukraine to an investigation of hunter biden s burisma dealings and of joe biden s influence in ukraine it s automatically alleged that trump was using his presidential position as a platform to bribe for political gain why the different standards when the allegations are so similar it makes one wonder how come a quid pro quo is automatically seen as commendable in a democrat but nefarious in a republican the trail of red flags that the bidens and burisma leave is so so so much longer than the one trump leaves after all here are the pertinent bullet points about the bidens in 2002 mykola zlochevsky co founded the oil and natural gas company burisma holdings located in ukraine but registered in the well known tax haven of cyprus red flag number one during the presidency of viktor yanukovych and while still owning burisma zlochevsky also served as ukraine s minister of natural resources a conflict of interest in itself red flag number two in 2014 amid accusations of money laundering and questions about shady looking gas drilling permit sales and amid a chaotic national uprising and economic crumbling he was forced to flee ukraine red flag number three enter hunter biden joining burisma as a board member as a board member who s paid 50 000 a month according to the wall street journal over the next couple years burisma and zlochevsky faced more scrutiny and investigations in part by a prosecutor general named viktor shokin over these same years image be danged hunter biden maintained his board position red flag number four now enter joe biden circa 2016 that s when he pressured ukraine to oust shokin as an investigator into burisma corruption how by threatening to withhold 1 billion in u s loan guarantees biden recalling his conversation to poroshenko before a council on foreign relations audience in january 2018 said this i looked at them and said i m leaving in six hours if the prosecutor shokin is not fired you re not getting the money and guess what well son of a bitch biden said during this 2018 cfr talk he got fired zlochevsky meanwhile returned to ukraine in 2018 free and clear of any charges whether shokin who was alleged to have been corrupt deserved to be fired or not is not the deeper point the deeper point is this hunter biden didn t resign his burisma board position until 2019 and when he did resign it was to save his campaigning father political face it wasn t because of concerns about ukraine corruption that just begs the question why would hunter want to associate with such a known corrupt entity and for so many years transparency international s most recent corruption perceptions index ranks ukraine 120th out of 182 countries making it the second most corrupt country in europe after russia national interest reported in march similarly a recent freedom house survey assesses the level of corruption in ukraine today as only slightly better than at the height of the presidency of viktor yanukovych who was toppled four years ago in the maidan revolution add to that a 2014 conference in britain where talk centered on recovering money embezzled from ukraine and the freezing of millions of dollars in one of zlochevsky s accounts along with a 2017 conference again in britain where poroshenko begged for help in combating his country s corruption and it s clear ukraine s reputation for corruption is well known it s not as if hunter biden could plead ignorance it matters for various reasons but mostly because we re now watching an impeachment hunt orchestrated by the democrats against a president who s accused of doing something one of their own has actually bragged about doing yet they re turning blind eyes to their own turning blind eyes even while admitting there s certainly something to see there impeachment witnesses concede hunter biden s burisma role raised conflict concerns after rep elise stefanik grilling fox news reported concede yes pursue no not now not during the impeachment inquiry it s true multiple investigations have cleared zlochevsky and burisma of any wrongdoing minus some tax paybacks that is same with both bidens they ve committed no wrongdoing that has brought them trouble with the law but questions linger for a reason perception matters democrats themselves know that they re pinning their whole impeachment hopes on selling perceptions against this president for crying out loud and that s what s most maddening about this whole ukraine mess what s good for the goose certainly isn t being seen as good for the gander adam schiff refuses to allow this committee to call hunter biden stefanik said on capitol hill this week on the one side a long long trail of big money big corruption big chaos big investigations and the bidens and nothing to see here folks go home on the other a telephone call a transcript and trump and it s impeach impeach impeach at best it s a missed story at worst it s a coverup of one hatchet job of another either way it s a double standard and the american people deserve better if what the bidens did in ukraine is no cause for alarm then what trump said during his july 25 call with ukraine s president is no cause for alarm the left can t have it both ways
