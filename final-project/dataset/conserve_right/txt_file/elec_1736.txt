democratic gubernatorial candidate martha coakley might not lose on election day but here are a few questions keeping bay state democrats up at night why is coakley failing to bring out the base is there something about her candidacy that democrats don t like or trust why for that matter are so many democratic partisans in the state wallowing in uncertainty and indecision as wmur s paul mcmorrow recently explained coakley has a slight problem on her hands it s not that baker has made significant inroads among democrats in august he was winning 11 percent of the democratic vote and in last week s poll he was capturing 15 percent baker took 14 percent of the democratic vote against patrick in 2010 but since the end of the summer one fifth of democratic voters have been sitting on the fence undecided between coakley and baker the longer they stay away from home the tougher coakley s path to victory gets democratic voters have been unusually cool to their party s nominee this year at this point in the warren brown senate race a wbur poll had warren up among democrats 72 to 21 with just 7 percent of democrats undecided a suffolk university survey in late september 2012 showed warren capturing 81 percent of the democratic vote with 6 percent undecided compared to those two data points coakley s inability to consolidate the democratic vote looms large her current deficit among independents is in line with the figures patrick and warren posted against baker and brown but coakley can t afford to concede scores of unenrolled voters to baker if she can t make up the difference with a lopsided victory among democrats in other words if democrats abandon her at the polls she s probably going to lose this is why she cannot allow democrats to sit at home and wait for elizabeth warren to run for president before they vote again worse rasmussen reports hot off the press survey released today unlike wbur s offering yesterday shows her already losing needless to say coakley has a lot riding on this race will she be remembered as the bill buckner of politics or as a pioneering glass ceiling shattering state governor we ll know soon enough alabama secretary of state shreds cnn host for saying absentee ballot voter fraud doesn t exist townhall com is the leading source for conservative news and political commentary and analysis copyright townhall com salem media all rights reserved terms under which this service is provided to you
