advocacy has shrunk human rights activists and their lawyers have been detained while internet censorship has increased lgbt activists have turned to a novel tactic submitting statements to the national people s congress china s legislature which is soliciting opinions from the public on a draft of the marriage and family portion of the civil code through friday a lot of people told me that this is the first time they ve participated in the legal process said peng yanzi director of lgbt rights advocacy china one of several groups running the campaign the marriage and family section is among six draft regulations for which the legislature began seeking comments at the end of october as of thursday afternoon the website showed that more than 200 000 suggestions had been submitted

language in the civil code changing the terms throughout from husband and wife to spouses and from men and women to the two parties rather than adding specific language about same sex marriage the revisions seek to eliminate gendered terms from the legislation while activists and experts acknowledge that legalizing same sex marriage is still a far off reality in china they said appeals through the official channel will push the government to take the demand more seriously there s a near zero chance the suggested changes will be accepted and implemented but this campaign makes china s lgbt community s demands for equality harder to ignore said darius longarino a senior fellow at yale law school s paul tsai china center who has worked on legal reform programs promoting lgbt rights in china calls for gay marriage often get dismissed as being too marginal and unimportant to get onto the political agenda or as being inconsistent with chinese traditional culture longarino said few legal protections are available for same sex couples in china one party can apply to be the other s legal guardian but those accompanying rights are just a fraction of those enjoyed by married couples longarino said he gave the example of a lesbian woman who bears a child in china with no way for her partner to become a second legally recognized parent of that baby at a briefing in august a spokesman for the national people s congress standing committee s legislative affairs commission suggested that same sex marriage does not suit chinese society china s current marriage system is built on the basis of a man and a woman becoming husband and wife said zang tiewei director of the commission s research department when asked whether same sex marriage will be legalized this regulation is in line with china s national conditions and historical and cultural traditions zang said as far as i know at the moment most countries in the world don t recognize the legality of same sex marriage
