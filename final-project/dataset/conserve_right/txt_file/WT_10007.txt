through his dual roles as party chairman and commander of the armed forces over the ensuing decades he beat off all potential challengers while continuing the ancient imperial tradition of ruling supreme until his death in 1976 at the height of mao s chaotic 1966 1976 cultural revolution the post of president sat vacant before being formally abolished entirely in 1975 the violent excesses of that decade when loyal party cadres were cruelly punished along with members of the intelligentsia and the old landlords soured many chinese on the idea of cult like devotion to a single leader

leader since mao xi 64 has used the presidency mainly to expand china s presence on the global stage while casting himself as a major world leader his foreign travels have included a high profile appearance at the davos gathering last year at which he sought to present himself as a champion of free trade at home however xi wields authority mainly as head of the party and the armed forces while consolidating power by taking control of an unusually wide range of political economic and other functions the strongest sign of xi s intentions emerged last year when he broke with tradition by not nominating an obvious successor at the party s twice a decade national congress he s cast aside the past two decades of collective leadership most notably by reducing the post of premier from custodian of the economy to mere executioner of his program additional terms seen bringing stability political risk by enabling xi to retain the presidency beyond 2023 the party is sending a strong message that it will adhere to xi s vision of transforming china into fully fledged modern nation status by 2050 under the party s firm guidance that puts an end to any notion of democratic reform while signaling to the u s and others that china will not waver in its quest for regional dominance in a manner that profoundly challenges the post world war ii liberal western political order yet it also undermines the party s stated goals of institutionalizing power and strengthening the rule of law experts say he is a dominant leader who has surrounded himself with loyal acolytes and in a
