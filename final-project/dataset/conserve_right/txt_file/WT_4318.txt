apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion the prospect of president trump being impeached by the house of representatives should not be surprising to people counter to conventional wisdom this impeachment does not expose a corrupt president instead it reveals the rot at the core of an establishment willing to abuse the system to overturn an election ergo impeachment was inevitable if we were correct in our support for donald trump in 2016 if the system was as corrupt and malevolent as we had intuited through the decline of the country under democratic rule then of course their reaction would be to implement corrupt and malevolent mechanisms to reverse trump s election top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots dr

dossier the actions of federal law enforcement agencies to implement the attempted framing of a president and the double dipping in that toxic stew now known as the ukraine scandal are efforts that were meant to lead to impeachment mr trump s election was more than a poke in the eye at the ruling patronizing and malevolent establishment it was a declaration of war against embedded politicians who think being in power is their birthright the shock and rejection by the establishment of the 2016 election were clear from the start a washington post headline on jan 20 2017 the day mr trump was inaugurated read the campaign to impeach president trump has begun the conspirators in this debacle may tell themselves that it s all ok because they re using the system with which to try to overturn your election but that s like telling people because bull dung is on the buffet table that makes it automatically a legitimate entree the abusive behavior various tantrums and lawsuits leaks and threats and the deliberate attempt to overturn the 2016 election by impeachment have all been proof of the vital importance of mr trump s election as the democrats stumble through this outrageous abuse of our system they are also confessing that they know they cannot win the white house in 2020 i have absolute certainty because we re going to make sure it happens that we will retain the majority in the house of representatives what s more serious is that he president trump can t win that is very serious speaker of the house nancy pelosi told an audience while at an event hosted by the atlantic it s almost as though she s hinting at an insurance policy to keep mr trump s reelection from happening then there s rep al green texas democrat who was even more direct about the reason behind the push for impeachment i m concerned that if we don t impeach this president he will get re elected the president does not have to commit a crime to be impeached he told msnbc whatever the insurance policy was that disgraced former fbi agent peter strzok crowed about to his paramour lisa page we know it involved not having mr trump as president the impeachment of mr trump was inevitable because we were right about a system that had deliberately forgotten the men and women of this country and believe that they are the only ones that matter this was the fight in 2016 albeit we knew the reaction to mr trump would be the ultimate confirmation about the malevolence of our own government toward us impeachment has always been the go to effort because it was the only way they could dress up the coup that became their chosen recourse removing mr trump from office in an election year is amazingly brazen as they admit through this process that they want to remove him as a choice for voters this from a group of people who clearly believe they cannot win using the process the founders established impeaching mr trump getting rid of the electoral college and even so called medicare for all and the green new deal are all about giving complete and total power to a small group of people who in their delusion believe that only they have the answers they promote mindless policy prescriptions requiring you handing your entire life and all of your money over to these masters of the universe why because you re too dumb to know you can t be trusted for anyone who is still on the fence about whether or not the impeachment charade reveals the rot in the democratic party and establishment in general ask yourself why are they conducting this process in secret interviews and hearings in private secret accusers no floor vote and announcements by media and democrats that they already have the votes for impeachment so really why go through the charade of hearings in the first place because even they know that what they re doing is a fraud otherwise why pretend and yet they can t help themselves because this is what they ve been doing for decades while all of this is disturbing the fact is it s not new we are simply now watching the system with the curtains pulled back courtesy of our vote and mr trump once again the trump election is exposing the inherent corruption at the foundation of our precious government he is bearing the brunt of their rage and we must stay focused so their corruption and its concomitant soft coup does not prevail tammy bruce
