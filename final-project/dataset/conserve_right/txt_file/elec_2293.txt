the gop keeps bringing a knife to a gun fight the result is we re getting killed we re getting killed even after we won the most historic landslide in modern history it s time to change strategy the media tells us to play nice be gentlemen and compromise look where it s gotten us a bankrupt country with over 18 trillion in debt and income taxes at about the same level as bankrupt socialist greece worse the labor force participation rate is at all time lows and for the first time in history more businesses fail each day than open we are facing the end of the america dream and death of the greatest middle class in world history because we have played nice acted like gentlemen and compromised we re standing around acting like gentlemen while barack obama turns america into detroit like that movie network it s time to open our window and scream i m not going to take it anymore googletag cmd push function googletag display div gpt ad in content 300x250 102 it s time for a gop dream team of street fighters to take on the evil that is destroying america by making us all dependent on big government it s time to kick ass and take no prisoners it s time to get behind one nominee and then name our entire team and announce what that team will do to save the u s economy the middle class and the american dream it s time to inspire passion and enthusiasm by showing we stand for something that something is smaller government lower taxes less spending pay down the debt and giving more power to the citizens let the liberal media try to call that extreme the american people will vote for that vision liberals and the media told us we d lose if we ran an extremist like ronald reagan instead he won in two historic landslides since then every milk toast moderate we ve run george h w bush bob dole john mccain and mitt romney have lost the key to victory is the passion energy intensity and enthusiasm of your base combined with inspiring independents and undecided voters by painting a picture of hope prosperity and patriotism you have to get people excited being moderate doesn t excite anyone although it s a little early for me to endorse anyone here is a look at a potential gop dream team here s a man from the midwest without a college degree and a blue collar mentality here s a man who fought the money and manpower of every union in america and won not once not twice but three times in blue state wisconsin he didn t do it with kindness despite death threats against his wife and children scott walker never gave an inch he turned a 3 billion deficit into a billion dollar surplus then handed the money back to the taxpayers that s a fighter that s courage that s a leader with a spine who won t fold when the biased liberal media tries to slander and destroy him walker s a man bringing a bazooka to a gun fight walker s choices for vice president are plentiful the gop bench is fantastic and diverse from latino men like ted cruz and marco rubio to women like carly fiorina gov susanna martinez and gov nikki haley to libertarian heroes like rand paul to a brilliant african american brain surgeon like dr ben carson to a genius policy wonk like gov bobby jindal the list is long we ve been governed by inept political hacks for far too long it is time for a dream team of experienced committed adults who will kick ass and never fold when the going gets tough the gop presidential nominee needs to name his entire dream team do that and we ll put the fear of god into liberals and the media here is how we differentiate ourselves paint a picture of hope and inspire our base here is how we get to the magic number of 270 electoral votes let s put a true defender of the constitution in a place where he can do just that can you imagine the fear we ll drive into the heads and hearts of law breaking liberals and marxists no compromise no mercy put a libertarian in charge of the economy taxes and the irs watch the u s economy enjoy the greatest expansion in history with a true free market libertarian in charge rand paul is a fighter no compromise no mercy here s the man born to stand up for the honor of the military and defend the greatest
