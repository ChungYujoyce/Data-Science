year old peking university student the u s presidential election is a campaign that gets everyone involved as gao a pop singer and musician known for his syrupy ballads found out many chinese are even interested in the u s electoral college the often perplexing system in which the president is elected not by individual votes but by the candidates state by state performance in a video from his online talk show that was posted on the popular video sharing site youku com gao explained that the college is an attempt to balance the rights of states with the will of the majority the opinion of the state is important so is that of the people gao said he called america s founding fathers the greatest group of people in history as a public performer used to censorship gao was careful not to draw direct comparisons to china s system or its leaders but even explaining america s election system is more than what chinese get from state media for decades china s public knowledge of u s elections was limited to state propaganda which depicts the election as a money game controlled by wall street campaign finance scandals and vote fraud dominate coverage even if chinese don t wholly believe it the repetitive line of state media has an impact on how they view u s politics the coverage is to serve the internal propaganda needs but not explain how the u s election works said chinese media critic zhao chu you hardly see any reports that can clearly explain how the u s election works the less censored internet has changed the game giving chinese space to comment and exchange opinions videos of the presidential debates are available online censorship on the u s election has mostly been in form of guidance from censors state media have been told to play down reports on the election and keep them short and factual according to editors at two media outlets amateur translator guo xiaohui who has produced chinese captions of this year s presidential and vice presidential debates said an unfiltered look at american politics may gradually influence the thinking of people living with censorship he also said it shows not everything in the u s system is positive the two sides are very confrontational and uncompromising he said it would be better off if they can soften a bit like the chinese do others see the u s system as clearly superior i admire the voting rights protected by the u s constitution i pay attention to the fairness and seriousness in the election procedure said li youli a retired manager in a commerce regulatory agency in beijing who learned about u s elections through an english language class china s political system is so backward that it should implement one thing first to unconditionally ensure the basic political right for citizens in a republic the voting rights he said admiration for the u s political system does not necessarily extend to the u s itself u s china relations have been buffeted by tiffs over trade nuclear proliferation and global hotspots like syria and iran romney has promised to label china a currency manipulator if elected a step that could lead to a trade war between the world s two largest economies many chinese resent what they see as scolding by u s presidents politicians and media about china s human rights lapses and its authoritarian system a pew global attitudes project survey released last month found that nearly half of chinese have a negative view of the united states still the survey registered a small increase among chinese who like american democracy up to 52 percent

weibo said he has observed little criticism of the u s election system among chinese web users i don t think chinese people are holding their own political system in such high esteem that they feel they can criticize others said xu he added that even being able to have conversations about voting and democracy is a positive step from the taiwan election to the u s election the chinese are always thinking and debating among themselves
