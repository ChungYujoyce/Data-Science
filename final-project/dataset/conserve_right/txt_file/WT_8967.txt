sign agreements covering politics economy livelihoods and regional cooperation some are expected to expedite major infrastructure projects that will extend beijing s strategic presence to the indian

with various myanmar ethnic rebel groups based along the countries border who are battling battle for autonomy from the central government while china has promoted peace talks between the the rebels and myanmar s government its close ties with some of the rebel groups allow it to retain the option of threatening violence by using ethnic guerrillas as proxies what appears to be a mutually
