wants the trial to examine vice president joe biden and his son hunter aposs conduct in ukraine biden told the des moines register friday he would defy a subpoena to testify at the president aposs impeachment trial biden is now clarifying saying he would honor any legitimate request from congress though he says subpoenas should really go to those responsible for shaking down ukraine he says that aposs the trump house mike mike emanuel rich edson reporting live from mar a lago rich thank you joining me now from louisiana congressman steve scalise the house minority whip welcome back to fox news sunday steve scalise good to be back with you mike mike emanuel congressman we want to begin with breaking news reports out of new york that an intruder with a large knife perhaps even a machete attacked the home of a hasidic rabbi as people were gathered to celebrate hanukkah police say they aposve arrested a suspect your reaction sir steve scalise well it aposs really alarming and we aposre seeing a growing anti semitism it aposs something that we all need to speak out against people of all faiths because you know whether it aposs a synagogue in pittsburgh whether it aposs the home of an orthodox rabbi we all need to stand up and say it aposs wrong to attack people based on their faith and to see this anti semitism growing throughout our country it aposs something we all need to not only be alarmed about but also stand up against mike emanuel is there some kind of government response that aposs logical to this to a wave of anti semitism that we aposve seen in new york steve scalise well i think our reaction needs to be quick and direct that anti semitism is wrong that attacks on people of faith are wrong and that regardless of who aposs attacked we aposre going to stand up against it not try to figure out who did it that aposs law enforcement aposs job and law enforcement is doing a great job by the way of making sure that they aposre getting the suspect we you know and too often in washington you see people trying to figure out somebody aposs motives instead of just saying it aposs wrong and attack it call it out for what it is anti semitism is wrong we need to stand up against it and it aposs unfortunately starting to pop up all around the country more and more so we need to stand up and be very vocal and very united against it mike emanuel okay to your role as one of the top republicans in the house of representatives what are your expectations when congress returns will speaker pelosi cave and send over the articles of impeachment quickly steve scalise well it aposs our duty to turn it over it aposs not like some mechanism she can control the house passed it they shouldn apost have i mean you look at what the evidence was and speaker pelosi wanted to talk about the evidence every one of their witnesses testified under oath saying there was no crime saying there was no quid pro quo maybe she aposs trying to carry out her own quid pro quo by acting as if she aposs got some kind of role in the senate trial they had a weak case i think she knows they had a weak case there was no evidence and no crime committed and yet they still wanted to impeach the president to appease their radical base that aposs what this was about from the beginning they aposve neglected a real agenda for hardworking families by the way and so what you aposre seeing right now is i think pelosi just exposing the fact she has no case and trying to have one more bite at the apple they aposre talking about more impeachments next year how about they focus on lowering drug prices securing our border doing an infrastructure package that they could have done in a bipartisan way they don apost want to do any of that because they aposve become the party of impeachment they have this obsession it seems like with carrying out this political vendetta that they have against the president instead of working with them to get things done at least president trump is working for families and getting creating jobs getting an economy that aposs booming and higher wages in people aposs paychecks that aposs what we should all be focused on mike emanuel do you believe speaker pelosi is overreaching by trying to influence a senate trial steve scalise well it aposs not her role to go over to the senate she could run for the senate if she wants to be a senator but the house has a role the senate has a role it aposs time for the senate to do their job look for months she was saying how important it is they aposve got to remove this president immediately he aposs a threat to their you know their whole way of life and then once they pass the impeachment she doesn apost want the senate to get the papers to start the trial they can apost have it both ways i think people see through the charade it aposs a political charade this is not what our founders intended impeachment to be used for in fact they wrote about it hamilton talked very specifically about the concern that impeachment would be used to carry out a political vendetta instead of to go after a crime there was no crime committed and so now all they aposre doing is trying to just attack the president personally because their field is so weak on the democrat side and the president aposs done such a great job at fulfilling his promises the things he actually ran on doing i wish barack obama and joe biden would have stood up to russia and helped ukraine as much as president trump has helped ukraine selling javelin missiles allowing them to stand up to russia in ways that barack obama and joe biden wouldn apost allow ukraine to do mike emanuel looking ahead you aposve said majority leader mitch mcconnell will run a fair trial in the senate but alaska republican senator lisa murkowski was critical this week of coordination between mcconnell and the white house she doesn apost seem convinced congressman steve scalise well you aposve seen her make statements concerned about what democrats have been doing and saying as well and you know you aposve heard chuck schumer making comments recently in the last two weeks that contradict things that chuck schumer as a candidate for united states senate said in 1998 when he was running saying he was running on a platform in part of acquitting bill clinton when he got to vote against impeachment in the house and then went over to the senate and voted against impeachment there so in the end look the senate aposs going to conduct a fair trial i have confidence in mitch mcconnell doing that there was not a fair trial in the house and i think that was very clear and you see what pelosi did there literally shutting down the ability for the minority to even have a day of hearings which is required under house rules they broke that rule they broke a lot of rules to ram through this impeachment charade just because they have a political vendetta against the president he didn apost commit a crime their star witnesses said under oath when asked can you name an impeachable offense was there any bribery every one of them said no and yet they still carried on the senate will have a fair trial and you aposll see an acquittal everybody knows that it aposs going to end in acquittal what they haven apost done is what i think is just as important they haven apost focused on lowering prescription drug prices which we passed a bill by the way unanimously out of committee every republican every democrat voted to lower drug prices families would be paying those lower drug prices today because the president would have signed the bill pelosi won apost bring that to the floor because of this obsession with impeachment mike emanuel connecticut democrat senator richard blumenthal says there are five to 10 republicans with quote severe misgivings about mcconnell aposs strategy does further delay risk bringing out more senate gop concerns steve scalise well look you know people can question strategy and everybody might have their own tactics of how they aposd go about it every impeachment when you had a republican divided house and senate with the white house they aposve always negotiated with the white house to have a fair process mike emanuel affirmative steve scalise that i think is what aposs missing in this there was never an attempt by the speaker to have any kind of negotiation on a fair process with the white house it was done with a republican house and a democrat president under clinton it was done with a democrat house and a republican president under nixon they negotiated fair terms and processes so that you could have a fair trial they didn apost have that in the house it was very clear that pelosi didn apost want a fair process but in the end it aposs going to end in acquittal and so why don apost we mike emanuel okay steve scalise focus on real things that matter for hardworking families mike emanuel leader mcconnell doesn apost sound like he aposs in any rush meanwhile president trump aposs down at mar a lago stewing is there tension there steve scalise i don apost think there aposs tension i think the president has been focused on delivering for families we just before we left were finally able to get the usmca trade agreement passed it should have been passed months ago by the way mike that mike emanuel affirmative steve scalise that was something that could create over 160 000 jobs for workers all across the country and better trade relations and sending a message to china and pelosi sat on that for over six months because of this obsession with impeachment so the president said look i want to work with congress to get things done they just spend all their time going after him personally because they don apost like him and as he said they don apost like the people who voted for him which i think is a bigger concern that they aposre missing that i think those people are going to speak out again in 2020 and re elect president trump and send in a republican house because they don apost want the house spending all of its time carrying out political vendettas they should be working for those families that president trump is working and delivering for mike emanuel congressman how do you take the fight to the 31 house democrats in districts president trump won steve scalise you aposve got to go back and just continue to talk about the things that we would do if we were in the majority actually delivering for those same families that expect congress to be working for them not fighting over their own personal power in washington and i think that aposs what you see this about is you know they still don apost like the fact that in 2016 donald trump got elected they aposre trying to reverse and negate the votes of those millions of people who elected donald trump as our president and they aposre trying to hurt his ability next year many of them said it publicly that they aposre afraid president trump will get re elected so they have to impeach him but that aposs not why you have impeachment that in fact is an abuse of the power of impeachment and i think they aposre going to be punished for abusing that power next year when they go before the voters who elected them last year mike emanuel to be clear we are not naming the name but do you have any issues with president trump re tweeting the name of the alleged whistleblower steve scalise look the whistleblower should have testified a long time ago in fact they don apost really meet the definition of a whistleblower they never saw a crime and personally from everything we aposve seen the person hasn apost disputed this this person had a political vendetta against the president he supposedly worked for joe biden so has a political axe to grind it aposs a little concerning that you could have somebody anonymously try to take down a sitting president using innuendo and in fact some of these things were false statements false claims that were made and there was coordination with schiff aposs staff maybe even schiff himself which is i think why schiff didn apost want the whistleblower to testify and so a lot of that should come out i think the public ought to know all of those meetings that pelosi and schiff held in secret behind closed doors to remove a duly elected president that ought to be alarming to all americans whether you voted for this president or not that they would try to go behind closed doors and reverse the will of the people in an election so yeah the whistleblower absolutely ought to be known and testify look they tried to take out a sitting president everybody in america has the right to face their accusers mike emanuel affirmative steve scalise why should the president be denied that same constitutional right mike emanuel congressman steve scalise thanks for joining us this holiday weekend see you back on the hill in the new year up next reaction from democratic senator ben cardin on the impeachment standoff and potential renewed arms race with russia commercial break mike emanuel both republicans and democrats in the senate are largely lining up behind a shorter impeachment trial but differ on whether or not to call witnesses joining us now is democrat ben cardin of maryland senator welcome back to fox news sunday ben cardin mike it aposs good to be with you mike emanuel senate democratic leader chuck schumer has been arguing for four witnesses in a senate trial with ties to the white house yet former vice president joe biden has said he will not testify at a senate trial now he aposs saying he would of course obey and subpoena sent to him still do biden aposs complaints about the process undermine leader schumer aposs negotiations with majority leader mcconnell ben cardin well first of all the senate has the sole responsibility for the trial and we have a responsibility to have a fair trial we need to hear from those who have the direct information about the president aposs call with the president of ukraine about the holding up of a presidential meeting about holding up of aid those witnesses need to be heard in the united states senate i think what leader schumer is saying let aposs have at least those witnesses testify along with the documents that would reflect exactly why the funds were held up why a meeting was not allowed with the president of ukraine and exactly the context of the july phone call i think that aposs a minimum for a fair trial in the united states senate mike emanuel isn apost the reality senator that democrats had all the power and leverage in the house but very little of it in the senate just another example of how painful it is to be the minority party ben cardin well in the house of course the president chose not to cooperate but worse than that he told the key witnesses not to testify before the united states congress he refused to allow documents to be produced never before in an impeachment inquiry has that been done by the president of the united states so you had unusual circumstances in the house the senate now has its responsibility the house has sole responsibility on impeachment the senate on removal it s our responsibility and we would hope that our leader would want the senate to operate in a fair manner and hear from the key witnesses and receive the key documents mike emanuel alabama senator doug jones is seen as the most endangered democrat in the senate next year jones says he s focused on doing his job during an impeachment trial begin video clip doug jones if i did everything based on a pure political argument all i d need is a computer to mash a button that s just not what this country is about it s not what the founders intended it s not what i intend to do end video clip mike emanuel you ve said the process cannot be controlled by politics but if you ve got jones up for reelection in ruby red alabama doesn t that make it more difficult for you to win back the majority ben cardin well we ll let the politics play out but we do have a constitutional responsibility this is one of our solemn responsibilities an impeachment process so we have to do what s right under the constitution we ll take a separate oath at the beginning of the trial to act as an impartial juror that s our responsibility we need to do that but at the same time i agree with senator jones we need to continue to do the business of the people of this country unfortunately the house has sent us hundreds of bipartisan bills on health education labor public safety and leader mcconnell hasn t brought any of those bills up on the floor of the senate that was this year next year i hope that he will allow us to take up these important issues so that we can deal with the other issues that are so important to the people of this country mike emanuel well let s get specific about that looking ahead things so polarized right now with impeachment on the hill what do you think realistically can get done in this election year that s upcoming ben cardin well we have to deal with the key issues we have to deal with prescription drug costs we have to deal with infrastructure they re important issues i heard steve scalise talk about that but we also have to deal with labor rights we have to deal with minimum wage we have to deal with our environment these are all issues that have been passed in the united states house of representatives that are sitting on mitch mcconnell s desk mike emanuel you sit on the foreign relations committee north korea promised the united states a christmas gift it hasn t come so far but what are your concerns about more provocative behavior from that regime ben cardin well north korea is a nuclear weapon power they have the ability to use a nuclear weapon the meetings with the two leaders have produced very little in regards to the denuclearization of the korean peninsula so what i want to see i want to see the leader of north korea kim jong un make a full declaration of his nuclear weapon program and make a real commitment to start to dismantle that we haven t seen any of that during the trump administration mike emanuel china russia and iran are right now engaged in military exercises in the gulf of oman and the indian ocean they started four days of exercises on friday an iranian official says the joint drills serve as a signal that relations between beijing moscow and tehran have reached a new meaningful level how alarming do you find that ben cardin extremely alarming we are seeing that russian is continuing its military alliance with countries that are very much against our interests the only reason the president imposed sanctions against russia for its behavior in regard to ukraine its behavior in regard to our own elections was because congress in a bipartisan manner passed very strong sanction bills against russia now we find that russia is starting to operate with iran with china where s the republican leadership in congress to say no we re going to stand up to russia we re going to stand up to iran we re going to stand up to china to make sure that this type of a military threat against the united states is held in check we re not seeing that mike emanuel meanwhile russian president vladimir putin is boasting about a new hypersonic weapon that he claims can evade american missile defense systems do you believe the hype ben cardin i would treat what he says very seriously the president seems to want to embrace mr putin wants to embrace president xi of china kim jong un of north korea this is ridiculous these are people who are enemies of the united states they re trying to bring down our system of government we have to treat their threats very seriously and make sure that we are protect our national security interests mike emanuel there are published reports suggesting the united states is behind the russians with plans to deploy our own hypersonic system by 2022 which some suggest is optimistic do you find that troubling sir ben cardin well what the united states should be in leadership is to try to calm things down globally we are the leader of the free world it s in our interest to not only engage in arms agreements with countries like russia but to expand them so that we have not only a nonproliferation policy but also a policy that will reduce the amount of arms that are around the world particularly nuclear weapons so it is concerning that our intermediate arms agreement inf has the president is withdrawing from that we have new start with russia which deals with their nuclear weapons what s the future of that we need u s leadership to engage the international community make it safer for all mike emanuel senator there aposs been that awful news out of new york of an intruder with a knife attacking an hasidic rabbi aposs hanukkah celebration your reaction to what appears to be the latest in a wave of anti semitic attacks in the new york area ben cardin mike this is extremely tragic i am the representative for anti semitism of the organization for security and cooperation in europe aposs parliamentary assembly i also serve on the u s holocaust memorial museum we see a rise of anti semitism globally and what is first required is that leaders must stand up and condemn any marginal any action against marginal groups it aposs not only words it aposs actions to make clear that those responsible will be held fully accountable and that we work together to keep our community safe but it aposs our language it aposs our actions this is the rise here in the united states is something that should be of concern to every person in this country mike emanuel governor andrew cuomo is on the scene there in new york he aposs calling it an act of domestic terrorism do you agree with that assessment sir ben cardin i do i think these individuals are acting not just out of a hatred towards one person but a hatred towards anyone who aposs different and to me that is what terrorism is about so i agree with governor cuomo i think this is an act of domestic terrorism mike emanuel senator cardin thank you very much happy new year to you see you back on the hill ben cardin thanks mike mike emanuel up next we aposll bring in our sunday group to discuss the impeachment standoff in the battle between democrats in congress and president trump commercial break mike emanuel coming up senator amy klobuchar riding on the momentum of the last debate visits every county in iowa begin video clip amy klobuchar i now have the most endorsements of any elected and former elected unintelligible in the country in iowa end video clip mike emanuel we ll ask our sunday panel about her strategy to crack into the top tier coming up on fox news sunday commercial break begin video clip chuck schumer we have a slogan in america that aposs at the core of our justice it aposs called speedy and a speedy and fair trial end video clip begin video clip donald trump we have the majority and now they want mcconnell to do wonderful things for them i mean he aposs going to do what he wants to do end video clip begin video clip mitch mcconnell i aposm not anxious to have this trial so if she wants to hold onto the papers that aposs go right ahead end video clip mike emanuel senate minority leader chuck schumer making a push for the senate to issue subpoenas demanding testimony and documents ahead of the president aposs impeachment trial while senator mitch mcconnell declares talks at an impasse and it aposs time now for our sunday group former republican congressman jason chaffetz from the washington post charles lane marie harf executive director of the serve america pac and fox news politics editor chris stirewalt great to have you all jason you heard congressman scalise and senator cardin talking impeachment do you expect speaker pelosi to essentially cave when congress returns in about a week or so jason chaffetz it aposs interesting to me that the democrats are asking for critical documents but it starts with actually presenting the articles into the united states senate i aposm shocked and if you really look at it what you have is this unique position where the accused donald trump and the republicans they will actually want to start this process where those that are making the accusations nancy pelosi adam schiff and the like they won apost even send over the documents so they can start that process i think they aposre poll testing it i think they the democrats are holding this back for a reason but it doesn apost serve our country very well mike emanuel chuck you had vice president biden saying i aposm not going to testify in a senate trial then he kind of backpedaled a bit and said of course i will comply with a subpoena is he hurting leader schumer aposs ability to negotiate with senate majority leader mcconnell charles lane i don apost think so i think he probably ended up where he should have started namely saying we aposll cross that bridge when we come to it however if they present me with legitimate process i will probably obey it i think what it illustrates is that this whole business of impeachment is a little bit of a drive by shooting for joe biden because his name and hunter s keep getting dragged into it on the question about nancy pelosi aposs strategy here you know i kind of started out thinking this was all a little too clever by half on her part but now i sort of see what she aposs up to i think she is trying to see if she can sew a little division in republican ranks she aposs giving donald trump and mitch mcconnell an opportunity to say slightly different things about the process mike emanuel affirmative charles lane lisa murkowski has come out kind of as a wild card and i think she aposs keeping her options open to see how this develops now of course that aposs all political stuff that aposs not exactly the constitutional part but as leader mcconnell is fond of saying it is a political process marie harf affirmative mike emanuel chris as we watch the house democrats didn apost seem too concerned about whether republicans were getting anything or any of anything they wanted in terms of impeachment process is there any reason to believe that leader mcconnell is going to give schumer anything chris stirewalt if he has to they aposre in your gallimaufry of clips and quips there the key sentence donald trump said mitch mcconnell will do whatever he wants male speaker laughs chris stirewalt and that aposs exactly what from was the president of the united states speaker of the house knows the truth mitch mcconnell is the one who aposs going to get to decide this what pelosi is doing is applying maximum pressure right now on mcconnell to try to drive a wedge between him and trump because trump and his squad want total chaos right they want absolute pandemonium they want to have matt gaetz swinging from the chandeliers marie harf laughs chris stirewalt on the senate side to make it just as wild a zoo as possible and drag joe biden in drag hunter biden in do the whole thing that aposs what they that aposs what team trump wants what team republican wants what the gop wants is keep it quiet keep it cool and don apost force 40 bad votes on susan collins and thom tillis and every other vulnerable senator how can pelosi keep it up i don apost know marie harf yeah mike emanuel do you expect some tension or something to bubble over between the white house and leader mcconnell at some point chris stirewalt she aposs going to keep putting firecrackers in their shoes and we aposll see what happens mike emanuel marie your foreign policy background we aposve got the russians the chinese and the iranians doing military exercises right now that alliance and then you aposve got the north koreans promising this christmas gift what aposs troubling you most at this point marie harf well i was thinking about this question this morning and a lot of things trouble me as we go into 2020 obviously the alliance that we aposve seen in these exercises iran working more closely with russia and china a lot of countries working separately from the united states whether it aposs on climate change whether it aposs on the iran negotiations quite frankly the united states has really been on an island because of a lot of president trump aposs rhetoric and a lot of his behavior so i aposm worried about what iran will do if there aposs potential for conflict there if that aposs the negotiations aren apost handled well they aposre really only negotiations in name right now there aposs not a lot of movement there i would say the same about north korea and the final issue which is a foreign policy issue is these tariffs we had a new fed report out this week that says the tariffs that president trump put in place cost manufacturing jobs they caused prices to be higher they caused job losses in many different sectors that is both a foreign policy issue and a political issue that donald trump is going to have to grapple with heading into 2020 all of those things make me concerned and of course in the foreign policy world there aposs always the prospect of something we don apost know right some crisis something we don apost foresee we can apost mike emanuel sure marie harf foresee with so much political division here at home how we would handle a crisis right now how this president would handle it feels very i think concerning to a lot of people mike emanuel jason what did you think jason chaffetz well as somebody who worked for senator kerry secretary of state kerry i can understand that you aposd feel that way but i tell you those of us that are supportive of what the president is doing look to china and the fact that we aposre making progress on a trade deal with china does bode well not only with our negotiations and work with north korea but also around the world and the usmca makes us stronger in this hemisphere than ever so the president has a lot to point to the world has been fairly calm cool and collective things can blow up in a moment it is concerning with what the iranians are going to do in such close proximity there in the gulf of oman but i got to tell you i think the president has scored a lot of victories he was able to plus up the defense budget he aposs doing the space force which is important for our long term health and prosperity in our abilities i think that concerns the russians so the president does have another side to this story mike emanuel chuck are you concerned about the north koreans perhaps ending this moratorium and obviously we saw this president take a different approach than some of his predecessors by talking directly with the north korean leader thoughts on north korea at this stage charles lane well i guess back in april kim jong un announced like we need something by the end of the year he was kind of getting a little perplexed i guess about this on again off again thing that president trump was throwing at them and this the negotiations have essentially gone nowhere since then and then we get the idea of the christmas gift which didn apost quite come but basically there aposs an end of the year deadline to be followed by a january 1st annual address by kim in which he aposs going to announce all sorts of new policies and i think it was interesting that this week he sort of prepared the north korean ruling party with a big event where they talked about the hardships that they may have to go through next year which tells me that they aposre perhaps preparing for the sanctions not being lifted because they themselves do something that the u s can apost ignore that will be regarded as provocative but i think you know it aposs like everything else with north korea they talk they often talk very tough they often talk very bellicose terms and then kind of under deliver marie harf but with both iran and north korea their programs whether it aposs missiles or their nuclear programs have both progressed over the last year because these negotiations haven apost gone anywhere they stalled charles lane there have been a number of missile tests yes marie harf that aposs right charles lane in north korea and i think i was 13 this year marie harf affirmative mike emanuel so chris heading into a presidential election year when the entire house is on the ballot and much of the senate will it take a significant foreign policy crisis to get everybody aposs attention to get everybody kind of refocused and not so hyper partisan chris stirewalt one of the things i love most about the american electorate is that it could care less about foreign policy unless it hurts them or their family or their lives immediately american voters one of the reasons we aposve been able to have or used to have for so long a broad bipartisan consensus on big foreign policy issues is that it doesn apost move voters particularly whether they have this or that meeting or this treaty or that treaty it aposs not that big of a deal until americans are dying or the gas prices go up or there aposs some disruption in their lives american voters tend to ignore it but for the partisans it aposs sometimes hard to take advantage of the opportunity of actually working together marie harf and it aposs interesting we aposre in the middle of the longest war in american history in afghanistan we still have troops fighting and dying there talking about when it hits home mike emanuel affirmative marie harf there are real negotiations now that have some promise there that aposs the thing to watch in 2020 whether we can actually bring home our troops some of whom were born after the attacks of 9 11 and are fighting in afghanistan now we don apost talk about it enough mike emanuel although an army sergeant was killed christmas eve his dignified transfer happened christmas day marie harf yeah mike emanuel and the taliban claimed responsibility for it so tough negotiations there panel we have to take a break here but when we come back just a little over a month to the first in the nation vote we aposll discuss amy klobuchar aposs pitch to rural america and whether iowa could swing back blue in 2020 commercial break begin video clip amy klobuchar i want to tell you how excited we are to have made all 99 counties today cheers every one in iowa but the point of this which is you should learn something about me i kept my promise end video clip mike emanuel senator amy klobuchar trying to break into the top tier in the democratic race giving voters in iowa a second look by visiting all the hawkeye state aposs 99 counties and we are back now with the panel let aposs take a look at the real clear politics average of polls in the hawkeye state with amy klobuchar running fifth even though she has campaigned in all 99 counties marie is iowa make or break for this midwestern senator marie harf probably i think that democratic voters look at joe biden a lot of them really like him but they think maybe if there aposs a moderate who aposs a little younger maybe has a little more speed on their fastball because they don apost they aposre concerned that bernie and elizabeth warren cannot win a general election so someone like amy i think has to do well in iowa she aposs from the midwest but you know iowa isn apost necessarily make or break in general just ask president santorum or president huckabee mike emanuel right marie harf how well their iowa wins you know showed how they could do in a primary but i do think amy klobuchar might surprise us because people are looking for someone democratic voters are looking for someone that can win a general election they aposre worried biden can apost they aposre worried mayor pete can apost and they aposre worried the far left candidates can apost amy klobuchar may be the one to benefit from this mike emanuel okay so fox news politics editor laughter mayor pete is leading in iowa in the polling according to the rcp average how many tickets out of iowa are there chris stirewalt well it depends on who now the big danger for joe biden is that somebody wins both iowa and new hampshire and it ain apost him right it aposs if amy klobuchar won iowa and then bernie sanders won new hampshire that aposs fine regional favorites and on and on and then biden can still by super tuesday stretch his legs and go out and be the national candidate and win the danger for biden is somebody like buttigieg wins iowa then finds a way to win in new hampshire where also he aposs led in polls recently that sets biden up for trouble it puts biden in the same position in a lot of ways that hillary clinton was with barack obama in 2008 iowa means more for democrats than it does for republicans for republicans it aposs sort of a one off for democrats barack obama john kerry others know that this is the launchpad into success mike emanuel and for biden there aposs super high expectations and a challenge to meet them right chris stirewalt absolutely and the overlaid with this concern now that he continues to mishandle things like will i testify in front of the well of course you aposre going to testify in front of the senate mr former president of the senate and the fact that it takes him so long to get to the obvious answers should be disquieting to democrats mike emanuel all right chuck so elizabeth warren aposs fundraising has dipped about 30 percent in the fourth quarter from 24 6 million to 17 million in the rcp average she aposs running fourth in both iowa and new hampshire are voters in that left lane of the democratic party choosing senator bernie sanders over her charles lane i think actually there aposs sort of maybe like a split left lane there aposs perhaps not as much interchangeability between warren and sanders voters as we thought i mean these are nuances visible only to those voters i suppose but she said i am a capitalist and he aposs out there saying a socialist and that sent a signal and so i don apost think they are interchangeable as much as we thought it seems like more that warren kind of soared as somebody who was lapping over into the non left lane for a while and then she lost some of that to pete buttigieg when he came up i mean his rise really is a pretty amazing story of 2019 we no one really saw that coming but that also makes you think that perhaps he aposs volatile that if amy klobuchar is going to move up it might be by taking votes away from buttigieg because buttigieg is like the alternative a lot of people have picked he aposs the alternative to biden because maybe they thought he was too old and an alternative to the others warren and sanders because they thought he was too left and amy klobuchar can do that too for some voters so he aposs now starting to take some fire people are going negative on him at the debates who knows maybe she aposll peel off some of his voters mike emanuel how do you think the biden campaign folks are feeling at this point there aposs been great expectations obviously do you think they aposre playing the long game at this point thinking that eventually he aposll get his mojo if he doesn apost get a win right off the bat charles lane i think they have to be reasonably happy actually with how well he aposs held on to basically frontrunner status despite all the inevitable gaffes that you get with joe biden he aposs got a bedrock of support in african american voters and to a large extent latino voters who are the key to the democratic base and if he rolls up a big win in south carolina after iowa and new hampshire i think which is very foreseeable he would be in good shape mike emanuel speaking of latino voters mayor pete aposs talking and trying to break in with latino voters he aposs talking about a path to citizenship doing something on that in his first 100 days he aposs also tweeting on christmas day about jesus saying today i join millions around the world in celebrating the arrival of divinity on earth who came into this world not in riches but in poverty not as a citizen but as a refugee that got the attention of a lot of christian leaders jason your thoughts on mayor pete aposs pitch to latinos jason chaffetz he aposs been doing a lot of pandering lately no doubt about it i don apost think he can run all the way to the finish line i do think he aposll do well in iowa he has to if he can apost win in iowa you know where is he going to actually actually win i think there aposs room for two maybe three people that are coming out of iowa but i aposve got to tell you i do not see i think the big story there is that the democrats don apost just neatly line up behind each other when they start dropping that that far left radical aoc bernie sanders you know wing of the party they don apost neatly get behind say a joe biden moving forward i think there aposs a lot of animosity there a lot of resistance there and when you had michael moore this week say that he felt like joe biden was sort of the hillary clinton of the year i just don apost feel the energy that you felt with barack obama you could just sense the intangibles that they were coalescing around somebody and here we are some about 35 days away from iowa and we really don apost know who the top in the top 5 who is going to pull it out mike emanuel marie are you stunned by bernie sanders apos comeback i mean it wasn apost that long ago he had a heart attack in the middle of his presidential campaign i think a lot of people were thinking he might not have the endurance to go much further in the campaign and he seems to be doing a lot better at least with those left voters marie harf yeah he aposs hanging in there it aposs interesting though i think donald trump taught all of us that you can survive things politically that we never thought you could in the past including a heart attack during a presidential campaign i aposm not concerned that 35 days out from iowa we don apost have a clear frontrunner i think these primary processes tend to play out often in a way that aposs helpful for the party i aposm actually glad that my party doesn apost just fall in line behind who the frontrunner is i like that we aposre having a debate in the party about how we fund health care how we deal with the military how we protect our country those debates are good i do though want to make sure that voters stay focused on the number one priority and that s beating donald trump and so if joe biden is the nominee i hope that democratic voters and all those independents who voted for democrats in 2018 even some moderate republicans that helped us take back the house that those principles are still applied as they look at this presidential election in places like iowa where democrats took a number of house seats it s going to be a key state in the presidential election all of those same issues we re fighting over whether it s prescription drugs whether it s national security those are all going to be on the ballot and it ll be very interesting to see how those play out especially if it s someone like elizabeth warren who s more far left mike emanuel chuck what if an impeachment trial drags a bit and you ve got a bunch of senators who would like to be in places like iowa and new hampshire charles lane yeah you know there s a part of me that wonders if in the back of her mind nancy pelosi is trying to just hold this thing off until the iowa caucuses i mean we haven t seen any evidence that that would be at least an unintended consequence of not filing the impeachment papers until early february when the state of the union takes on no it s going to be a little bit of a bump in the road if there is an impeachment trial in january because bernie sanders amy klobuchar elizabeth warren among the top tier and then you even have people like michael bennett you know cory booker would have to sit there literally silent because those are the rules of the senate if there s anything anybody running for senate hates it s having to be silent for six hours at a time laughter mike emanuel right jason chaffetz but this whole impeachment debacle has taken and sucked all the energy and all the attention away from these candidates who are out there supposedly talking about these issues you never see that on the news it is a total distraction they are not getting the name recognition that they need going into iowa and beyond and i think that s really hurting them chris stirewalt one thing marie harf i think the conversation on the ground though in iowa to your point jason is very different right people on the ground aren t talking about impeachment they re talking about the fact that democrats passed 400 bills including on prescription drugs including on usmca jason chaffetz no they re talking marie harf that mitch mcconnell is not moving elizabeth warren jason chaffetz usmca marie harf is not talking impeachment chris stirewalt i do think marie harf on the campaign trail chris stirewalt we met with mayor pete buttigieg the other day at the post and one thing he did say was that people out in iowa aren t asking a whole lot about impeachment on the road and i do think there is a way in which it kind of generally mixes up the messages of the democratic party although to be sure it does fortify the base and that mike emanuel chris briefly chris stirewalt biden is a net winner out of this the impeachment stuff is bad for him because it talks about his son s sketchy conduct but it s good for him because it keeps the focus off the race that s good if you re the frontrunner the less attention paid to the race the better and that s why he s gone wire to wire mike emanuel all right thank you panel see you next sunday up next we revisit a few of the interesting people who were power players
