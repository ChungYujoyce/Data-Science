southeast asian countries over islands in the south china sea the strategic implications and importance of the waters of the south china sea and the freedom of navigation is vital to both vietnam and the united states capt ross myers commander of the george washington s air wing said aboard the ship sunday as fighter jets thundered off the flight deck above i m certain that the chinese government

the supercarrier made its way throught the south china sea along vietnam s eastern coast u s navy officials said sunday china claims the entire sea and the disputed spratly and paracel islands over

important fishing grounds and is believed rich in oil and natural gas reserves mrs clinton announced that the united states has a national interest in seeing the claims resolved the problem is that china has now committed herself publicly to sovereignty of the south china sea and to push that back if only to the status of a claim that is not enforced is going to be very difficult said arthur waldron an international relations specialist at the university of pennsylvania so we are playing catch up reminding the chinese that we have not collapsed into post great powerdom yet and that we
