apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic washington ap siding with public health experts dire projections president donald trump on monday defended his decision to extend restrictive social distancing guidelines through the end of april while bracing the nation for a coronavirus death toll that could exceed 100 000 challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days trump said during a rose garden press conference he called refraining from public outings our shared patriotic duty during the outbreak the comments came a day after trump made a dramatic course reversal and announced that he would not be moving to ease the guidelines and get the economy back up and running by easter as he said last week he hoped to do top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens sex at birth hungary bans people from legally changing their gender in the face of stark projections from his team and searing images of overwhelmed hospitals in his native new york city trump instead extended to april 30 the social distancing guidelines which had been set to expire monday many states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings the worst that could happen is you do it too early and all of a sudden it comes back trump said during a nearly hour long call in interview with fox friends as members of his coronavirus task force fanned out across other media outlets to warn the virus spread was only just beginning trump s impulse to reopen the country driven by pleas from business leaders met a sober reality check from health experts including dr anthony fauci the government s top infectious disease expert who on sunday said the u s could experience between 100 000 200 000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic that warning hardened a recognition in washington that the struggle against the coronavirus will not be resolved quickly even as trump expressed a longing for normalcy it would not have been a good idea to pull back at a time when you really need to be pressing your foot on the pedal as opposed to on the brakes fauci said monday on cnn describing how he and dr deborah birx the coronavirus task force coordinator had convinced trump to reconsider we showed him the data he looked at the data he got it right away fauci said it was a pretty clear picture dr debbie birx and i went in to the oval office and leaned over the desk and said here are the data take a look he just shook his head and said i guess we got to do it americans are now being asked to prepare for at least another 30 days of severe economic and social disruption with schools and businesses closed and public life upended a majority of americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus and employment claims have already skyrocketed trump said it was pretty unlikely that he would need to issue a nationwide stay at home order adding he was in touch with governors on their actions trump spoke with the nation s governors monday as did other members of his administration birx told the governors that it s several weeks away from the peak of the curve for the united states trump said that modeling projected substantially more deaths if the nation did not incorporate social distancing i thought that was a very important study they did and it sure solved a lot of problems in my own mind and maybe in your minds trump said in an audio that was obtained by the associated press republican gov larry hogan of maryland voiced appreciation for the 2 2 trillion economic stimulus bill that trump signed into law last week and the president s acknowledgement that states will need more help but he also emphasized that governors are still frustrated about a scarcity of medical supplies governors also remain unsatisfied with the availability of testing kits to screen patients for the virus health and human services secretary alex azar said the u s had now tested more than 1 million samples for the coronavirus but it wasn t clear if that figure represented actual patients or samples processed with a population of over 330 million 1 million patients tested would represent about one third of 1 percent of all americans by comparison south korea has tested roughly twice as many people as a percentage of its population still trump boasted testing was at a level that no other country has reached public health experts have estimated the u s should be testing between 100 000 and 150 000 patients daily to track and contain the virus azar said the u s is testing nearly 100 000 samples per day vice president mike pence said nearly three weeks ago that 4 millions tests were being distributed around the country i can tell you that every single governor in this united states understands the importance and the fact that we are way behind the curve on test kits said washington gov jay inslee the federal guidelines that trump elected to continue recommend against group gatherings larger than 10 and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home people are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants bars nonessential travel and shopping trips for more than a week trump had been bombarded by calls from outside business leaders who urged him to begin reopening the nation s economy at least in places with low infection rates and warned of catastrophic consequences that could damage his reelection chances if it remained shuttered for much longer trump told fox friends that nobody was more worried about the economic impact on the country than he was but he said we want to do something where we have the least death trump who has largely avoided talk of potential death and infection rates cited projection models sunday that said 2 2 million people or more could have died had social distancing measures not been put in place and he said the country would be doing well if it can hold the number of deaths down to 100 000 in addition to the numbers trump said he was moved by harrowing scenes from new york particularly hard hit elmhurst hospital in his native queens he described the images he d seen on television with body bags all over in hallways i ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks freezer trucks because they can t handle the bodies there are so many of them i ve seen things that i ve never seen before but experts warn that those scenes could play out across the country as the virus spreads birx and fauci said even areas that have so far been spared must prepare for the eventuality that they too will become hot spots with undetected cases likely in existence now fauci said on abc s good morning america that smaller u s cities are now ripe for the kind of acceleration that has occurred in new york if you look throughout the country there are a number of smaller cities that are sort of percolating along fauci said it looks like it s low level it starts to accelerate then it goes way up the u s had more than 140 000 covid 19 cases reported by monday morning with more than 2 500 deaths according to data compiled by johns hopkins most people who contract covid 19 have mild or moderate symptoms which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia sometimes requiring hospitalization the risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies in the fox friends interview trump also said his administration was considering providing hazard pay for medical professionals who are on the front lines of the pandemic treasury secretary steven mnuchin agreed telling fox business network in a separate interview that the idea makes a lot of sense and is definitely something we ll put in the next bill some lawmakers have said a fourth economic relief package eventually will be needed meanwhile house speaker nancy pelosi said monday she wants the house to be ready as soon as it returns perhaps in late april to approve a fourth bill boosting the economy and strengthening the response to the virus she said she wanted the package to improve broadband bolster hospitals and state and local governments and increase direct payments to americans pelosi said it should also strengthen safety requirements for first responders and medical workers and broaden workers leave for caring for relatives for weeks trump had minimized the gravity of the pandemic and pelosi on sunday accused trump of denial in the crisis and called it deadly trump lashed back on fox monday morning she s a sick puppy in my opinion trump said i think it s a disgrace to her country her family associated press writers alan suderman in richmond virginia rachel la cort
