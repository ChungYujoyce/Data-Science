preparation for major health crises including pandemics according to a 2018 paper on such funding though the coronavirusoutbreak still had washington and states across the country scrambling to muster supplies and respond when it hit numbers from a paper in the academic journal health security released in late 2018 indicatethat the government spent between 10 billion and 12 billion each year from 2010 to 2018 across several agencies on programs that contribute to biosecurity the management of pandemic influenza and emerging infectious diseases and multiple hazard and general preparedness programs that assist in readiness for and response to different types of health threats including diseases like the coronavirus covid 19 seems to be the kind of problem the u s was preparing for but a debate has raged in washington over whether the money was spent effectively coronavirus what to know a breakdown of federal government spending aimed at preparing for health crises data federal funding for health security in fy2019 health security trump set to preside over record spending deficits as coronavirus costs explode ventilators which were few in bad shape are now being produced in the thousands and we have many to spare president trump said in a wednesday tweet thread alluding to how the u s did not have the resources it needed at the outset of the pandemic we are helping other countries which are desperate for them likewise after having been left little we are now doing more testing than all other countries combined and with superior tests face masks shields gloves gowns etc are now plentiful democrats have countered that gop driven budget cuts early in the decadesqueezed areas like the stockpile of personal protective equipment ppe trump was also faulted for initially downplayingthe coronavirus threat as did many in the media and some democrats like new york mayor bill de blasio but even when state and federal responses kicked into full gear they struggled to get medical supplies like ventilators and ppe to front line health care workers additionally federal and state governments are still working to secure enough coronavirus teststo open their economies with some reaching out to other countries in maryland apos s case south korea the white house coronavirus task force said last week it is working to expedite the production of a coronavirus vaccine but it is still unclear when such a vaccine could become available with some estimates placing the timeline at about 18 months despite prior plans that aimed for a faster timetable at least for unknown flu strains the strategic national stockpile has only helped on the margins and the trump administration has had mixed success at best in using the defense production act to get domesticindustries to produce ventilators testing swabs and ppe treasury to borrow 3t for coronavirus relief adding more debt in 1 quarter than all of 2019 our country is unable to meet an immediate need for critical medical supplies and personal protective equipment in the face of a crisis scott paul the president of the alliance for american manufacturing said in a new york times op ed the absence of adequate domestic production capacity for things like face shields and respirators coupled with the frailty of on demand global supply chains and our utter reliance on them for everything from the ingredients in our medications to partsof breathing machines has left us dangerously exposed during an international health emergency the slow coronavirus response from all levels of government particularly the federal government came despite significant funding over the past decade for programs across multiple agencies including the defense advanced research projects agency darpa under the department of defense dod the centers for disease control and prevention apos s emerging and zoonotic infectious disease programs under the department of health and human services hhs the national institutes of health nih biodefense and emerging infectious disease research program also under hhs and others the health security paper titled federal funding for health security in fy2019 also recorded government spending in preparation for nuclear and chemical threats which fox news has excluded from this analysis it also analyzes the president apos s 2019 budget data which is excluded as well because presidential budgets donot reflect actual or estimated spending the government apos s struggles dealingwith increased hospitalizations and demand on medical equipment werelargely cited as reasons why widespread economicshutdowns were needed as government officials and health experts stressed the need to flatten the curve of coronavirus infections in the united states the resulting economic hardships forced congress to take drastic measures to prop up the economy and americans apos everyday finances including the 2 2 trillion cares act which is ballooning the federal deficit to a projected 3 7 trillion for 2020 according to the congressional budget office with three other coronavirus spending bills already passed and another potentially 1 trillion plus piece of legislation being considered counties defying state coronavirus apos stay at home apos orders and reopening for business penn state assistant professor of public policy simon haeder who specializes in health policy noted some of the shortfalls and highlights in u s preparation for the coronavirus haeder specifically complimented themanyhighly trained and educated workers largely because of programs run by the centers for disease control and prevention cdc available in the u s to plan responses strong research capabilities at americanuniversities and creative members of the private sector willing to respond to the public health crisis i think we had good infrastructure in place or we had people thinking about this the cdc has good training programs i think that was one of the benefits we had he said the cdc hasa special training program that trains people and puts them back into the community asdoctors researchers and those kinds of things that are supposed to spot developments on the ground as they happen and i think we are ahead of a lot of other countries when it comes to that underscoring haeder apos s point the global health security index which is put together by the nuclear threat initiative an organization that works on both nuclear security and biosecurity ranked the u s asthe most prepared of 195 countries ranked to deal with threats to its health security but he said as states begin to reopen their economies the u s is notin a much better place than it was at the outset of the pandemic a month ago or two months ago we didn apos t have a solution to the virus wedon apos t have any treatment that really works and we don apos t have any way to vaccinate people haeder said now we were able to withstand the initial onslaught of what was coming but the same problem exists today we don apos t have any treatment and we don apos t have any vaccine and the only thing we apos ve done is we apos ve not overwhelmed in most places the health care system yet by flattening the coronavirus curve with economic shutdowns it apos s a common misconception that business closures and stay at home orders aimed at flattening the curve are meant to reduce the total number of people who will fall ill because of the coronavirus rather these curve flattening measures are meant largely to reduce the number of people who are sick at any given time thus avoiding a surge in cases that overwhelms the health care system and causes otherwise preventable deaths because not all patients are able to access lifesaving critical care file this april 23 2020 file photo shows president donald j trump s name printed on a stimulus check issued by the irs to help combat the adverse economic effects of the new coronavirus outbreak in san antonio ap photo eric gay file treasury to borrow 3t for coronavirus relief adding more debt in 1 quarter than all of 2019 outside of a few hotspots the u s has largely accomplished the goal most hospitals are not overwhelmed and the death rate from the coronavirus in the u s is either in line with or lower than that of other countries but that has come withthe drastic economic costs stemming from the large scale shutdowns that made it possible according to haeder despite what the government spent in the past decade to deal with health threats it neglected to ensure there was a supply of medical meansto keep the coronavirus from upending daily life in the way it has we could keep more things open longer if our capacity to respond to this would have been higher haeder said for sure the curve that you apos re able to sustain medically is a lot higher if you apos re prepared achieving that capacity haeder said would mean more concerted efforts to store things like ventilators and n95 masks moving the production of many medical products back to the u s from india and china and ensuring that u s industry has the ability to quickly ramp up the production of essential items when called upon the headquarters for centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta georgia ap photo ron harris alarm bells sound over historic deficit spending as coronavirus bills could near 5t those measures of course would cost even more money but haeder says they would be worth it considering the united states apos yearly health preparedness expenditures are dwarfed by the economic costs of responding to the crisis the cares act aloneoutsizes the government apos s yearly spending on health preparedness by a factor of about 200 we apos re hit with two things right now he said we apos re hit with the fallout from the medical issue of dealing with the virus but it apos s made much much worse from the economic side because the economic side will be with us for a very long time there apos s a massive dip in income lots of people lost their jobs lots of them will have lost their jobs permanently the debt has massively increased and we could have dealt with a lot of that off hand if we would have been better prepared the kind of efforts that would have allowed the u s to remain largely open or at least more than it has would be expensive haeder said but he said no and laughed at the suggestion that their cost could approach 2 2 trillion while i can apos t give you any numbers i think you can make a sound case that spending just a little bit of money upfront is gonna be a really really good investment haeder said mentioning that there are ways like rotating stocked up supplies and selling them before they expire to cut costs haeder also suggested thata lack of planning and organization on how governments and institutions coordinate their responses contributed to the severity of the pandemic in the u s when people got on jared kushner apos sgood side they were able to get stuff and you know when they could explain that they really needed it i don apos t think that apos s a good way to handle a nationwide catastrophe but i think we really need to think about how we put those lines of communication and lines of resources in place from a government to government perspective haeder said mcconnell schumer spar over health of lawmakers as senate convenes for first time in weeks such measures involving more planning than spending money on tangible things would also be a lot cheaper than economic stimulus after the fact trump critics often note that the obama administration created a pandemic playbook and a council to prepare for and coordinate pandemic responses the trump administration eliminated the council and merged its responsibilities withother bodies during a reorganization of the national security council and it did not use the playbook of course there is rarely much appetite from lawmakers to funnel any amount of taxpayer money into preparing for invisible undefined threats that may appear sometime in the future there are other issues more palatable to voters like tax cuts entitlement programs or infrastructure calls for increased health preparedness for future health crises have emerged in the wake of recent ones there are already people using the phrase never again about the coronavirus but if the current pandemic follows the same pattern as past health scares those calls may die down eventually an example of this phenomenon can be found in new york city which in 2006 under former mayor michael bloomberg moved forward with an aggressive plan to prepare for a pandemic similar to the coronavirus but in a story first reported by propublica the city never purchased even half of the ventilators that it planned to and those it did buy were eventually auctioned off because of the costs of maintaining and storing them and the company that manufactured the ventilators stopped making the model the city bought click here to get the fox news app the city also stocked up on n95 masks but the city apos s health department told propublica they all expired and it became cost prohibitive to replace them in any meaningful quantity despite the costs and challenges haedersaid improving stockpiles of medical equipment and government planning wouldbe a good investment for the next timea coronavirus level pandemic hits the argument that i apos m making is if you apos re prepared then your measures to deal with this don apos t have to be so draconianand we would have been able to keep more stuff open longer and keep interaction to a degree up longer and keep businesses open get all the stories you need to know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox
