increased costs for consumers and businesses devastated trade and plunged the western world deeper into the depression that was already under way focused exclusively on domestic politics president hoover and members of congress triggered an international catastrophe the story began on oct 27 1928 when hoover said he would welcome higher tariffs for agricultural commodities the following year the house ways and means committee announced there would be hearings so lobbyists could plead for higher tariffs the announcement set off a mad scramble and soon it became apparent that higher tariffs couldn t be limited to agricultural commodities every conceivable interest group wanted higher tariffs to prevent american consumers and businesses from taking advantage of better values available

duties an average of 59 percent on more than 25 000 agricultural commodities and manufactured goods smoot hawley was a factor in the subsequent plunge of the stock market and the doubling of
