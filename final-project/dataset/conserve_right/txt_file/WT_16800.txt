mass destruction represents a very important step forward that shows mr kim s sincerity about reopening the nuclear talks the united states and its allies want a demonstration of sincerity from north korea leonid petrov told the associated press arguing that the ball is in their court now but he warned that north korea may halt its conciliatory gestures if the united states fails to issue clear guarantees for pyongyang s survival in the future another expert hailed the reclusive nation s willingness to freeze its missile and nuclear tests but noted there was no clear mention of the north s uranium enrichment program which also can make nuclear weapons the north already has weaponized plutonium and enriched uranium is something that can be proliferated in an easier manner said yang moo

billion cubic meters of gas a year to the south russia s state controlled gas monopoly gazprom said the pipeline is likely to carry gas from the giant offshore fields near the pacific island of

pacific ocean however it has since routinely tested short range missiles and it launched a long range rocket in april 2009 the 2009 rocket test drew widespread international sanctions and condemnation and an angry north korea retaliated by pulling out of the six party nuclear talks north korea is believed to have enough weaponized plutonium for at least six atomic bombs and in november it revealed a uranium enrichment program that can give the country a second way to make atomic bombs north korea has carried out two nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and is believed to be working toward mounting a
