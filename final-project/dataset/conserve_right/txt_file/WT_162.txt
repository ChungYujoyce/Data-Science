coca cola general mills and clorox warned that prices for personal health products could increase if price gouging continues over the coming months more and more americans will become unwilling and or unable to pay excessive prices for these products wrote bryan zumwalt the group s executive director this will decrease the likelihood that individuals will take recommended and necessary preventive
