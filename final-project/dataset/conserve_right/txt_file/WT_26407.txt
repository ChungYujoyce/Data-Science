tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn washington ap president donald trump s posthumous slam on sen john mccain flips reality on its head when it comes to who gave veterans the option to see a private doctor at public expense mccain didn t get the job done for our great vets trump said wednesday i got it done actually mccain got it done top stories n j governor throws curveball on pandemic reopening this isn t going to be quick oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump routinely takes full credit for enacting the choice program ignoring the fact that it was signed into law by president barack obama in 2014 this time his boast came as part of a broad brush denunciation of mccain the senator from arizona vietnam war naval aviator and tortured prisoner of war who died in august of brain cancer trump the vets were on my side because i got the job done i got choice and i got accountability for many decades they couldn t get it done it was never done i got it five months ago i got it done choice remarks at an army tank factory in lima ohio the facts what trump got done was an expansion of the program achieved by mccain and sen bernie sanders most prominent among the lawmakers who advanced the legislation signed by president barack obama mccain was a co sponsor of the 2014 legislation to overhaul the department of veterans affairs following the scandal at va s medical center in phoenix where some veterans died while waiting months for appointments for medical care he was a key negotiator for the legislation establishing the veterans choice program working with sanders the co author of the bill sanders was then chairman of the senate veterans affairs committee mccain didn t rest after the law was enacted he fought to expand the program and achieved that too in his last months trump signed the expansion into law in may it s named after three veterans who served in congress one of them is mccain it s called the john s mccain iii daniel k akaka and samuel r johnson va maintaining internal systems and strengthening integrated outside networks act of 2018 trump instead of waiting in line for two days two weeks two months people waiting on line they re not very sick by the time they see a doctor they are terminally ill we give them choice if you have to wait for any extended period of time you go outside you go to a local doctor we pay the bill you get yourself better go home to your family and we got it passed we got it done the facts as he does routinely trump exaggerated what s been accomplished with his expansion veterans still must wait for weeks before they can get private care outside the va system the program currently allows veterans to see doctors outside va if they must wait more than 30 days for an appointment or drive more than 40 miles 65 kilometers to a va facility under new rules to take effect in june veterans are to have that option for a private doctor if their va wait is only 20 days 28 for specialty care or their drive is only 30 minutes but the expanded choice eligibility may do little to provide immediate help that s because veterans often must wait even longer for an appointment in the private sector last year then secretary david shulkin said va care is often 40 percent better in terms of wait times compared with the private sector in 2018 34 percent of all va appointments were with outside physicians down from 36 percent in 2017 the va also must resolve long term financing because of congressional budget caps after the white house opposed new money to pay for the program as a result lawmakers could be forced later this year to limit the program or slash core va or other domestic programs also key to the program s success is an overhaul of va s electronic medical records to allow seamless sharing of medical records with private physicians a process expected to take up to 10 years va secretary robert wilkie has said full implementation of the expanded choice program is years away find ap fact checks at http apne ws 2kbx8
