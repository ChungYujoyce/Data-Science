different from what donald trump and hillary clinton seemed to say when clinton said i want us to invest in you what i heard was i will spend your money better than you will also i heard i will spend lots of your money when trump said our economic problems are china s fault what i heard was blaming china wins me votes when clinton told trump my father printed drapery fabrics what i heard was donald you are a spoiled rich kid when trump replied my father gave me a very small loan i heard trump saying anything less than 200 million is a pittance it s actually not clear what trump received from his dad trump claims it was 1 million others say 200 million anyway is a million dollars a small loan when clinton said i m going to have a special prosecutor to enforce the trade deals we have i heard kiss my ring and pay my foundation if you want your trade deal approved when trump said president obama has doubled our debt i swear i heard trump promise i ll triple it when clinton said i think it s time that the wealthy and corporations paid their fair share what i heard was good thing bill and i are broke because we re going to soak the rich like they ve never been soaked before when clinton said trump s taxes must be something really important even terrible that he s trying to hide what i heard was my emails on the other hand were just a minor mistake and nothing i m trying to hide next question when trump said i was the one that got obama to produce the birth certificate and i think i did a good job what i heard was since hillary and her staff spread the lie first i m blameless when clinton said barack obama is a man of great dignity i swear i heard her add quietly despite me smearing him in 2008 when trump said i was just endorsed by 200 admirals and generals what i heard was i wish members of the military supported me the way they support libertarian presidential candidate gary johnson when clinton said putin is playing a tough long game here i swear i heard hillary say i guess my reset with russia was a bad idea when clinton said she ll do much more with our tech companies to fight isis what i heard was i ll force facebook and twitter to shut down parts of the internet when clinton said she ll take out al qaeda leadership what i heard was i don t know exactly who they are but i ll kill a bunch of military age males when trump said i did not support the war in iraq what i heard was except when i did when clinton said a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes i heard a man provoked by a tweet should not be near the nuclear codes clinton got some things right when trump said my strongest asset is my temperament i heard viewers laughing when clinton complained that trump said women don t deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men i wondered so hillary believes that women should get equal pay even when they don t do as good a job if only there were some way both clinton and trump could lose oh right there is governor gary johnson s in the race but the most reliable predictor of future events the betting odds see electionbettingodds com doesn t give him much of a chance the bettors don t give donald trump a great chance either as i write clinton is favored 68 7 percent to 29 6 percent during the debate trump s odds dropped 5 percent i didn t think he performed that badly but i must be wrong the bettors are generally right we may as well get used to hearing the title president hillary clinton copyright 2016 by jfs productions inc next tennessee department of

things in office her record speaks for it s self it is known how terrible clinton is and boy is she ever it is not known how terrible trump would be i disagree clinton is a known quantity of shittiness trump is a proto fascist his belief in the state as the arbiter of all things and the need for a strongman are evident every time he speaks he represents the absolute worst elements in american politics trust in big govt solutions and disrespect for current institutions except none of what you said is real it s all made up like a progressive fairy tale you said it buddy what we need

my father gave me a very small loan i heard trump saying anything less than 200 million is a pittance it s actually not clear what trump received from his dad trump claims it was 1 million others say 200 million i really really doubt the loan was 200 million fred trump died in 1999 and his estate was worth around 300 million then there s no way he had 200 million to loan to anyone regardless of familiy affiliation some 20 25 years before that 1 million is still tone deaf it is 20 years income for most people of all the things to give a shit about why does this matter because voters are less concerned with policy then they are with the personality of a candidate true although bill and hill have lived off and been protected by the taxpayers since the 80 s most people have to work 20 years to accumulate enough capital to become players in the manhattan real estate market unfair i agree hipster but my point had more to do with stossel repeating a rather unlikely figure given his usually reliable bullshit detector i m surprised he even mentioned it we should abolish inheritance everyone should start life at year zero with zero dollars minus what they owe the government for the national debt people should be deprived of the incentive to work hard so their children have more children should be taken away from their birth parents and raised by the state it is totally unfair that some kids are given a head start by having good parents while so many have crack smoking whores raising them time to end the lucky sperm club i kept hearing a bunch of precocious children granted it was the nice guys and not the debate so i didn t want to strangle another random homeless person just so the voices would stop plus the popcorn tasted better as i write clinton is favored 68 7 percent to 29 6 percent i feel sick though i would feel the same way if trump had the majority either way we are fucked both reveal some very discouraging things about the electorate that aspect of this election is even more depressing than the terrible candidates the fact that we are seeing these two despicable clowns on the national stage says a lot and it isn t good i guess gruber nailed it although it wasn t the electorate who chose them just majorities in each party which is still sickening the good thing is both of these people are the most unpopular candidates in history if it s any consolation hell trump won by getting pluralities not majorities i was less pessimistic about a possible trump victory until i saw the debate now i feel like rowdy roddy piper when he first put the sunglasses on when i heard stossel say we may as well get used to hearing the title president hillary clinton i heard hide all the sharp objects and strong meds i heard you remember that ar you had your eye on better go on and buy it sooner than later also might not be a bad idea to buy a large plastic cooler that s watertight and suitable for burying just in case you need to lose some guns for a few years my father printed drapery fabrics no hillary his employees printed drapery fabrics your father was an executive in the textile industry and he got there as a salesman not from the factory floor and there s nothing wrong with that just don t tell me lies that i can refute with two minutes on google no no he actually silkscreened the drapes personally just like al gore s mother you know the mining foreperson used to sing him songs about coal to put him to sleep while he dreamed of inventing the internet the message is fundamentally different for the two candidates clinton is appealing to the notion of fairness of making the world a better place in other words she is cynically counting on the naive college freshman mentality to grant her more power to enrich herself at our expense nothing new to see here just like every lefty ever she spouts platitudes and punctuates them with policies that will achieve the exact opposite more living wage jobs living wage raise the minimum wage to 15 despite trump partially deflecting blame on china he laid plenty of it on our pols he is absolutely right about lowering taxes and cutting regulation with the right amount of it in the right places the economy would take off like a rocket also his message of america first is dead on we don t hire a president to make the world a better place we hire him to work for us to look after the interests of the citizens of the united states there is a lot to dislike about trump but if he does half of what he says he will be the best president since reagan we hire a pres to run the federal govt this notion that the pres should look out for the interests of citizens is how we got so fucked up the potus runs the govt citizens will take care of themselves if the federal government is not there to serve the citizens then why have it it is not a separate entity that exists for its own sake stop laughing dammit no really quit doing that the notion that the federal government is there to serve the citizens in some general way is a lot of how we got into this mess the federal government is there to serve the few functions outlined in the constitution which is mostly to provide national defense and to provide a structure where the states can cooperate while maintaining a lot of independence if the federal government is not there to serve the citizens then why have it ideally to provide for the common defense provide a basic set of laws aimed at protecting people s individual negative rights and punishing those who would violate the rights of others providing courts for the peaceful resolution of disputes and grievances and that s about it stop laughing dammit i m being serious you forgot promote the general welfare the phrase that negates any limitation on the federal government are you expecting congress to start manning up sometime in the next century i asked nicely for y all to stop laughing we hire a pres to run the federal govt thank you i get so fucking sick of seeing dumb asses talk about the president like he s some kind of fucking elected monarch it s doubly depressing to see that shit being spouted by someone on a libertarian website you d think a self described libertarian would know better but apparently not we could certainly do worse clinton and if he cheeses it in the next debate that s exactly what we re going to get his performance wasn t catastrophic though if he sufficiently preps for the next one and performs well he can recapture the momentum two bad debates in a row will doom him though it wasn t catastrophic but it was bad he could have mopped the floor with her ass she handed him a hundred gotchas that he missed them he let her lead him off in the weeds several times when he could have slapped her down hard oh really you have ms venezuela in the audience where is monica lewinski why didn t you invite her how about paula jones where is she tonight that would have shut her shit down in fact there wasn t a single thing she brought up that he couldn t have turned against her on his tax returns are you implying i did something illegal i played by the rules i am not the one currently under investigation by the fbi etc he could have mopped the floor with her ass someone could have but i m not so sure donald trump could have maybe he doesn t have the skill to grab those gotchas in real time maybe his personality makes him easy to lead into the weeds i mean he seems to do it on his own often enough being a good candidate and or president is about more than having good ideas you have to sell those ideas and defeat opposing ones even if trump has good ideas i don t think he does he s not very good at defending them his personality may be a strength among some of the electorate but it s also a huge liability that s part of what at least some of the people who comment on his demeanor and temperament are talking about rand paul re suthenboy there is a lot to dislike about trump but if he does half of what he says he will be the best president since reagan hopefully it will be the good half very few know about and not the basket of deplorable policies he is flaunting around to get the bucktoothed vote wealth empowers people it gives them options freedom really is a zero sum game the bigger the govt gets the smaller we get and vice versa reduce taxes cut regs that is all he has to do we get bigger clintons plan increase taxes across the board when we already have the highest corp taxes in the world and companies are climbing over each other to get out of the country unemployment goes up we get smaller and smaller we hire him to work for us to look after the interests of the citizens of the united states i d much rather we hired him to do the simple job described in the constitution the only interests the president should be serving are defense of the country when necessary checking congress through vetoes and basic executive functions different words same thing yeah i don t think we disagree much on the proper role of the president but stating it as serve the interests of the citizens just seems to invite a broad interpretation to me i am referring to what motivates the president not the details of the methods and means they are allowed i think trump s current motivation is appropriate as opposed to cankles whose motivation is purely selfish i m just very opposed to the notion that we need a leader of any kind i don t want some kind of elected king i want a chief executive who will do the necessary parts of the job and then shut the fuck up it s kid of sad to me that a lot of libertarians not necessarily you seem to think we need some kind of strong leader in a president i suppose maybe they need to be able to act as a leader if there is an actual war that threatens the territory of the country but outside of that no thanks he is absolutely right about lowering taxes and cutting regulation with the right amount of it in the right places the economy would take off like a rocket trump is also courting the naive college voter apparently and you seem willing to swallow this line trump has some cuckoo ideas using iran s power of north korea to influence their nuclear and space programme for example what impressed me was trump s disavowal of a nuclear first strike i doubt any major candidate can match that either clinton or anyone who s run in the past for me the election boils down to two things individual rights and fiscal conservatism both candidates are equally bad on the first just in different ways on the second point there really is no comparison when it comes to completely fucking things up in terms of the economy and the national debt trump will likely be far worse than clinton according to respected third party estimates http crfb org papers promise ary update and the last thing we need is another ronald reagan in terms of annual average increases in federal spending bush i bill clinton and barack obama all increased spending less according to this report by cato http www cato org blog presidential spending 0 sort of the opposite of hearing the dog whistle john rather than hearing the secret message the candidates want you to hear you heard the secret message they re trying to cover up it s dog whistles all the way down when clinton said a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes i heard a man provoked by a tweet should not be near the nuclear codes clinton got some things right zing anyway is a million dollars a small loan yes i keep having to tell people that yes 1 million is a small loan for a business when i was doing sba loans for a commercial bank right out of college 1 million was pretty common for people trying to get a startup off the ground exactly i had a small business selling construction equipment there was never a time when we didn t have well over 1 million in inventory on our lot during the early spring it was usually about 10 million for a business especially something like commercial real estate a million dollars is small change as a retort to people who think that s excessive i d point out that the more regulations you pile on top of business the higher the initial start up loan will need to be as regulations directly or indirectly add costs apparently people are too stupid to connect the dots the betting odds on jimmy carter winning were something similar i believe he won i really don t want to believe the conspiracy theory that trump is a clinton plant but dammit the donald that debate performance makes it really hard to believe otherwise i really don t want to believe the conspiracy theory that trump is a clinton plant but dammit the donald that debate performance makes it really hard to believe otherwise it s worth repeating what is it with you and the squirrels lately i suspect he was coached to not appear mean to the fragile old lady and he took it a bit too far will stossel himself try to sponsor any debates or has he soured on the idea or have his bosses soured on the idea the chances of clinton showing up at a debate without a moderator who is a plant for her team is vanishingly small i heard pretty much the same things but when everything is said and done clinton s actual economic political and social programs suck a lot more than trump s that remains true even if clinton were the nicer more informed more eloquent candidate instead of the disassembling corrupt amoral jerk she actually is we may as well get used to hearing the title president hillary clinton grabs bottle of scotch starts chugging i too may have alcohol poisoning on election night i expect hillary to win but i worry more about the house flipping if the blue cult turns out in large enough numbers i cannot believe people came across thinking clinton actually did worse at the debate she actually articulated her ideas regardless of how much you might think they re wrong ideas and had clearly prepared trump was an incoherent angry mess barely able to form a complete sentence after the first 15 minutes and could not stick to what could have been a powerful theme that clinton is just part of a political establishment that s been selling you out for decades unless you have a deep seated emotionally based hatred of clinton or are somehow invested in trump financially or emotionally i honestly do not see how you think trump did better hillary sure was rehearsed compared to trump plus almost everything that came out of her mouth was a lie i ve made 64 000 so far this year working online and i m a full time student im using an online business opportunity i heard about and i ve made such great money it s really user friendly and i m just so happy that i found out about it heres what i do http www max43 com let s all remember that the snap polls the ones taken right after the debate ended the ones from before the spin cycle really got under way trump won decisively and what s with this when trump said i did not support the war in iraq what i heard was except when i did who cares what trump thought about going into iraq trump was a civilian his position didn t matter the person accusing him of supporting that war voted for it and soldiers went and died hillary s comments about trump are usually like that she made bad decisions and caused harm to the usa or got americans killed and its trump s fault sort of ot but has anyone read gj s nyt piece today http www nytimes com 2016 09 d way html it s pretty good but the comments are infuriating i guess i shouldn t be surprised given that 98 of nyt readers are democrat zombies when clinton said a man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes i heard a man provoked by a tweet should not be near the nuclear codes as opposed to a woman who can be provoked by an independent movie to the point where she wants to limit the reach of the first amendment when i heard clinton say blahblahblah i heard i m a teapot short and stout when i heard trump say blahblahblah i heard i m a lumberjack and i m ok i laughed out loud at this the nicest thing about having stossel as a sort of libertarian translator is not having to watch teevee and listen to those lying looters in the first place i am making 89 hour working from home i never thought that it was legitimate but my best friend is earning 10 thousand a month by working online that was really surprising for me she recommended me to try it just try it out on the following
