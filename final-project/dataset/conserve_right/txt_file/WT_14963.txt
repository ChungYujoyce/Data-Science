apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic new york ap the reaches of the galaxy far far away might not be quite as vast as previously thought in a box office blip that echoed through the multiplexes solo a star wars story didn t fare well over the memorial day weekend amassing an estimated 103 million in ticket sales from thursday night to monday most movies dream of such openings but the standard for star wars is different as is the bottom line solo which switched directors mid production cost more than 250 million to make and it was expected to debut with around 150 million for the first time the star wars juggernaut was humbled at the box office the opening marked the worst debut in the franchise s history and disney s stock slid 2 5 percent in trading tuesday top stories dr phil slammed for saying shutdowns deadlier than covid 19 people s lives are being destroyed oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots no one yet needs to run panicked through the streets yelling save the wookies but for the first time since disney acquired lucasfilm in 2012 for 4 05 billion the profit potential within george lucas space saga no longer appears limitless instead of opening up a new han solo trilogy the disappointing arrival of solo only intensified the questions bubbling around one of the movies biggest properties is there a filmmaker beside j j abrams that can win over both die hards and new fans how slavish should subsequent sequels and spinoffs be to the originals is there anyone in china who cares a lick about lightsabers i think they knew they had a problem a long time ago said jeff bock senior box office analyst for exhibitor relations what 75 percent of the directors are fired and don t finish the film you ve got internal problems those problems came to a head on solo where filmmakers phil lord and christopher miller were replaced during shooting by ron howard who steered the film in a less irreverent comic direction that stayed closer to the script co written by lawrence kasdan the veteran star wars scribe of the empire strikes back and return of the jedi once envisioned as a western style prequel romp solo became an existential battle over the tone of star wars as lucasfilm struggled to find a balance between old and new if this is the business of movies now and these are the ones that are actually in theaters then it s got to be this push and pull constantly kasdan said in an interview ahead of the film s release there s an added thing when you make a star wars movie you run into people in england and in marin county but mainly in england who have been working on it off and on for 40 years that s like entering a cult you have the same people who worked on chewie s costume in the original film still working on it finding a way to propel star wars forward while maintaining spiritual ties to lucas hallowed original trilogy is only going to get more complicated up next is episode ix which j j abrams has taken the helm on after colin trevorrow was jettisoned but after that film which in december 2019 will close out the third star wars trilogy a fleet of sequels and spinoffs are planned last jedi writer director rian johnson is developing another trilogy in the main line of films game of thrones creators d b weiss and david benioff will write and produce a separate batch of star wars films jon favreau is writing and executive producing a live action series for disney s upcoming streaming platform james mangold logan is to write and a direct a boba fett film rumors have long swirled about an obi wan kenobi spinoff and disney will next year add star wars villages to its theme parks the litany of releases has for some diluted the power of star wars solo followed the last jedi by just five months leading some to wonder if moviegoers are showing signs of star wars fatigue these first three films that we released did more than 4 billion this is our fourth movie now in what is our fourth year of having the lucasfilm franchise said dave hollis distribution chief for disney it feels a little premature to talk about fatigue we re also planning our releases for star wars movies in the same rooms where we re planning movies for the marvel cinematic universe and we had thor black panther and infinity war in november february and may and they were all wildly successful but whether star wars can be marvel ified remains unclear while the novelizations merchandising and collective cultural force of star wars remains a mammoth industry it all feeds primarily off that original trilogy of films 64 percent of the audience for solo was over the age of 25 and its international footprint is also missing one very big toe china where lucas first movies weren t released has shown scant interest in new star wars installments the last jedi survived only a week in chinese theaters solo which earned a relatively paltry 65 million overseas did even worse opening with just 10 1 million in the world s second largest moviegoing market an untenable black hole for any global blockbuster today china in particular requires a longer conversation and probably a longer deployment of a strategy to introduce in many instances characters that other countries have had the benefit of growing up with said hollis so it will take some work bock believes lucasfilm needs to get more creative with star wars trust filmmakers to experiment try an r rated film and do whatever it takes to boost popularity in china if that means hiring dwayne johnson for the next one then that s what you do says bock he s the franchise fixer but the best solution for star wars might be even simpler a full half and arguably the clearly weaker half of the star wars canon follows events leading up to a new hope solo rogue one and lucas little loved 1999 2005 trilogy all function as preludes for what s the come so whatever changes need to be made in the star wars universe lucasfilm could start with this look to the future and give up the prequel follow ap fil
