month are being billed as a referendum on president trump but don t tell that to red state democrats who are shying away from their party s red meat attacks against the commander in chief while many democrats have become reflexively against all things trump the party s senate candidates in states that the president easily carried two years ago have steered clear of the heated anti trump messaging that is firing up the base elsewhere as the national democratic party has devolved into an angry mob it s put red state democrats in an increasingly difficult position said bob salera a spokesman for the national republican senatorial committee but no matter what these vulnerable dems say back home the fact is their failure to denounce their party s anti trump theatrics makes them complicit and voters can see right through their empty rhetoric top stories russian fighter jets intercept u s navy patrol aircraft over mediterranean australian researchers see virus design manipulation cdc now says it may be possible for covid 19 to spread on surfaces the high stakes fight over the confirmation of supreme court justice brett m kavanaugh forced senate democratic incumbents to pick sides just weeks before the nov 6 election while republicans are looking to defend a slim 51 49 seat majority sen joe manchin iii of west virginia who is running against republican state attorney general patrick morrisey was the sole democrat to break with his party and vote for mr trump s nominee others sought to delicately split with mr trump as republican voter enthusiasm spiked during a two week confirmation ordeal in which justice kavanaugh weathered uncorroborated accusations of sexual misconduct from his high school and college days sen joe donnelly indiana democrat defended his no vote in a debate monday he said he voted yes on neil gorsuch s confirmation to the supreme court and on 77 percent of mr trump s judicial nominees mr donnelly said senators are tasked with helping president trump to make the best decision i go against my own party all the time he said that is a regular for me i have been with president trump 62 percent of the time that is what we are supposed to do i don t think it is about party former state rep mike braun his republican opponent in november countered that mr donnelly has a track record of falling in line with the liberal leaders of his party and lining up against the trump agenda when it matters most he voted for obamacare originally he voted against its repeal he voted for the iran deal he voted against tax reform mr braun said then here he voted against judge kavanaugh he says here for other reasons but he did it because he takes his marching orders from senate minority leader chuck schumer the same guy who has been running his campaign from afar meanwhile in missouri a state on the front line in the battle for control of the senate sen claire mccaskill tried to fly under the radar by generalizing her opposition to mr trump in a fundraising email the day before the confirmation vote she warned vaguely that senate republicans seem determined to lead us in the wrong direction pushing forward on the worst parts of president trump s agenda republican challenger josh hawley said monday that ms mccaskill can t escape her anti trump record she has ridiculed president trump in the most personal terms she has ridiculed his weight she has ridiculed him for wanting to build a wall calling it embarrassing he said she has mocked his agenda of course and is doing everything she can to resist it the mccaskill campaign did not respond to mr hawley s remarks ms mccaskill and sen jon tester montana democrat defended their no votes on the basis of justice kavanaugh s views on dark money in politics not the sexual misconduct accusations mr tester also raised concerns about the nominee s views on fourth amendment protections former tennessee gov phil bredesen a democrat had multiple chances to vilify mr trump in a recent debate with republican rep marsha blackburn in the open race for a republican held senate seat instead he opened his remarks by knocking mr schumer saying it is time to end his stint leading the chamber s democrats mr bredesen blamed the new york democrat for adding to the hyperpartisan climate that has engulfed washington and is preventing congress from finding sensible solutions on tough issues it has just become a government of people standing on opposite sides of the room shouting at each other and not making any progress he said people certainly are going to have a choice and if what people want if what the people of tennessee want is more of that hard nosed partisan politics take no prisoners draw lines in the sand make no compromises i m not your guy mo elleithee a former top aide on hillary clinton s 2008 presidential campaign said the strategy employed by red state democrats makes sense trump is doing the most negative advertising for himself on a day to day basis said mr elleithee who now runs georgetown university s institute of politics and public service so what democrats are doing is offering an alternative and that is the key here meanwhile mr schumer labors to keep democratic voters fired up about losing the kavanaugh battle to americans the so many millions who are outraged by what happened here there s one answer vote he said during the senate debate sen cory a booker a new jersey democrat eyeing a 2020 presidential run also wants to keep mr trump front and center in the midterms how long until we answer the president s hate with our
