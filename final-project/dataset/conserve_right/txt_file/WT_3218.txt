apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic ciudad juarez mexico ap an exodus of migrants fleeing drug cartel violence and corruption in mexico has mired hundreds of immigrants in ramshackle tent camps across the border from el paso and brought new chaos to a system of wait lists for asylum seekers to get into the u s migrant tent camps have been growing in size at several border crossings in ciudad juarez driven by a surge in asylum seekers from regions in southern mexico gripped by cartel violence one camp in juarez is populated by about 250 mexican asylum seekers who are living in increasingly cold conditions as they wait for u s authorities to let them in to the country top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots ravi zacharias may be the greatest christian expositor of the 21st century trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time they are among thousands of immigrants along the border waiting in mexican cities often for several months at a time under daily quotas set by customs and border protection officials that govern how many people get to request asylum at each location the wait lists are typically run by local mexican officials and organizations in consultation with the u s government but the mexican immigrants rejected the lists in juarez and opted to organize their own system at each port of entry officials in both countries agreed that mexican immigrants should have their own waiting list and not one managed by government authorities in mexico because many of them are fleeing corrupt government authorities in mexico american officials told us you know what we can t deny mexicans entry in the end it s the country that they re fleeing said enrique valenzuela director of ciudad juarez s centro de atenci n a migrantes the latest developments in ciudad juarez appear to be the first time that cbp has honored multiple lists in a single city spawning a new level of confusion and competing camps with hundreds of mexicans at each one as temperatures fall below freezing critics of president donald trump s immigration policies have condemned the wait list system and a separate program known as remain in mexico that has sent tens of thousands of migrants back in mexico as their immigration court cases to play out customs and border protection officials say they have no role in operating the lists and are merely performing queue management at border crossings based on capacity to process asylum seekers on tuesday evening in juarez smoke wafted from wood fires across the sea of blue and black plastic tarps as mothers cobbled together dinner for their families at the end of the camp cars filling six lanes of traffic honked and jockeyed for position coming and going from the bridge of the americas a border crossing bustling with tractor trailers taxis and commuters the most common reason the camp s occupants flee their homes in mexico is the inability to pay protection money to local gangs a father from ciudad hidalgo michoacan said he closed his mechanic s garage after gangs demanded higher and higher monthly fees until he couldn t make the payments and they threatened to kill him in the two months he s lived here in a plastic tent with his wife and 8 year old daughter they ve endured the fluctuating temperatures of the desert and inclement weather that ranges from dust storms to rain a narrow trench around the tent aims to keep runoff from flooding the place where his wife and daughter sleep in a single week one lives through every climate he says the immigrant who asked his last name not be used anticipates staying here until january and the temperatures are already approaching freezing the mexican government has set up shelters that have capacity but he can t go there because he ll lose his place in line cities like juarez have had to manage growing migrant populations since the start of the trump administration s efforts to push people back and make them wait south of the border despite a commitment from both the u s and mexican governments to safeguard migrants from other countries the encampments and shelters appear to have little support outside of pastors and local aid groups on both sides of the border the first mexican migrant camp in juarez started at the base of a bridge where shootings muggings and stabbings are common many opted for the camp in the park because it was less dangerous in matamoros mexico roughly 700 miles 1 126 kilometers from ciudad juarez an estimated 2 000 people are waiting in tents next to a border bridge there s little access to running water sanitary living conditions or healthcare one small nonprofit global response management started issuing flu vaccines this week after purchasing them from a local pharmacy at roughly 50 a dose some desperate parents have sent their children alone to the bridge to brownsville because the u s government exempts children deemed unaccompanied from being rejected under the wait list system or remain in mexico program the parents hope their children will eventually be placed with a relative on the other side the wait lists are being challenged by immigrant advocacy groups in courts and by migrants themselves some of whom have been storming guarded areas of the border to force customs and border protection

so before they make a decision that way she can go to high school without worrying about getting picked up by the mob boss maybe he ll forget her that was our tent but now there s somebody in it her mother says pointing to an asylum seeker who has her former place in line i don t know where we re going to sleep the camp sits on the edge of a towering monument to benito juarez the pro capitalist
