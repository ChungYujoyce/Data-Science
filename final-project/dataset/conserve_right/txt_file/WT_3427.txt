policymakers president trump said that children trapped in failing government schools would be forgotten no longer and urged congress to pass his education freedom scholarships proposal which would improve education for america s children under the president s efs proposal taxpayers could make voluntary contributions to scholarship granting organizations which would be identified and approved by states and these organizations would give out scholarships to students that could be used for a wide variety of educational options taxpayers making contributions would receive a non refundable dollar for dollar tax credit efs would not be a top down federal program but would allow states to decide whether to participate and how to select eligible students education providers and allowable

private high school sat next to president trump at the roundtable event and said the scholarship he received from a similar efs type program in ohio changed my life the scholarship allowed walter who is african american and who struggled in public school to escape an environment that resulted in prison or worse for so many of his peers this is life or death he told the president and for him the only difference is that i had a way out through the scholarship my education said walter allowed me to get out of that situation walter now wants to devote his life to reforming america s education system so that other children are able to receive the same benefits of school choice that he has received recent polling data show that overwhelming majorities of americans especially in minority communities want the school choice that walter had a december 2019 poll by realclear opinion research surveyed more than 2 000 registered voters and asked them if they would support or oppose a tax credit scholarship program such as efs their response was loud and clear an amazing 70 percent said they would support an efs type program further that support was the same among whites african americans and hispanics with seven out of 10 in each group supporting such a program that broad based support for school choice is a big reason that florida gov ron desantis who was elected by a very narrow margin in 2018 is now one of the most popular governors in the nation with sky high support among african americans and hispanics in may mr desantis signed legislation creating family empowerment scholarships that could be used by low income and middle class families to pay for tuition at private schools the new scholarship program was especially needed because demand for the popular florida tax credit scholarships a program which allows corporations and taxpayers to contribute to non profit scholarship funding organizations had outstripped supply more than 100 000 low income florida students receive florida tax credit scholarships to attend around 1 800 private schools yet 13 000 children were on the waiting list for an ftc scholarship it is estimated that the new family empowerment scholarships will assist 18 000 students in 2019 20 and thousands more in the future due to an escalator clause in the law african americans and hispanics make up 71 percent of the first cohort of students receiving the family empowerment scholarships while 87 percent are low income according to mr desantis students receiving one of florida s various scholarships for four or more years are 40 percent more likely to graduate from college than their similarly situated non scholarship peers as he signed the family empowerment scholarships bill into law mr desantis said i personally believe as a matter of philosophy that parents know what s best for their kids like mr desantis mr trump understands that school choice is essential to improving education for our nation s children and that pushing proposals such as education freedom scholarships is smart politics especially when potential rivals such as elizabeth warren have adopted aggressive anti choice platforms
