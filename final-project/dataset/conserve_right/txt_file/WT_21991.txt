apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic miami former vice president joseph r biden slapped down a younger rival who urged him to pass the torch putting the generational rift in the party at center stage in the democratic presidential debate thursday rep eric swalwell of california used his first turn in the debate spotlight to recall how he first became interested in politics as a 6 year old boy after hearing a democratic politician call for the passing of the torch to a new generation he identified that politician as mr biden and then called on the now 76 year old former vice president to follow his own advice i m holding onto that torch shot back mr biden drawing laughs from the crowd see also kamala harris attacks joe biden on race the exchange underscored the chief argument that he s too old and a political relic against sending mr biden now the frontrunner for the nomination by a wide margin to take on president trump it also one of several times the democratic hopefuls traded sharp jabs over health care taxes and how far to the left the party should move in another feisty exchange sen kamala d harris of california challenged mr biden to defend his 1970s opposition to busing children to integrate public schools an issue that has dogged mr biden with a democratic base that is heavily nonwhite see also democrats embrace health care for illegal immigrants do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in america said ms harris who is black and recalled how as a girl she was bused to integrate california public schools mr biden said he opposed the department of education playing a larger role in busing and blamed her city council for opposing the efforts on a local level that is where the federal government must step in she said there are moments in history where states fail to protect the civil rights of all people as the front runner mr biden walked onto the stage with a big target on his back and the most to lose in the first faceoff with his lesser known rivals expectations have been high for barack obama s former sidekick since even before he formally threw his hat into the ring mr biden has sat atop the polls with a wide lead since joining the crowded field in late april but he has been plagued by missteps and gaffes he suffered criticism about his handsy treatment of women flip flopping on his longtime opposition to taxpayer funding of abortion and fond recollections about his working relationships with staunch segregationist democratic senators in the 1970s including joking about their use of the racially charged epithet boy the debate served as a crucial test for him to show he still at the top of his game several times mr biden answered wandered but at other times his answers were sharp other also were playing defense sen bernard sanders who is 77 but champion of the party s energetic far left wing came under fire for his push for a medicare for all government run health care system and a slew of other new benefits that would require higher taxes pressed by the moderators mr sanders conceded that his plans for medicare for all government run health care and other benefits would require a tax increases for the middle class people who have health care under medicare for all no premiums no deductible no co payment no added out of pocket expenses yes they will pay more in taxes but less in health care he said the 10 candidates on the stage for the second night of debate found key areas of agreement they all despised president trump and they all wanted more rights for illegal immigrants all the democrats on the stage raised their hands to show that they would grant government health insurance to illegal immigrants plowing new ground well beyond the boundaries of obamacare our country is healthier when everybody is healthier said pete buttigieg mayor of south bend indiana even mr biden said he would extend coverage to illegal immigrants a reversal from his stance in the obama administration when democrats considered and specifically rejected the idea as too controversial and unfair you cannot let people who are sick no matter where they come from no matter what their status go uncovered mr biden said it s the humane thing to do the episode caught the attention of mr trump who was watching the debate while attending a g20 economic summit in south korea all democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare he tweeted how about taking care of american citizens first that s the end of that race the president was on the minds of the democratic hopefuls mr biden blamed mr trump for enormous income inequality in the u s and mr sanders called mr trump a pathological liar and a racist the candidates on stage embodied various fissures in the democratic party they stood on opposing sides of a generational divide and an ideological split between mr biden s moderate brand and mr sanders democratic socialist policies that have pushed the party to the far left the party however remained unified in its fierce disgust of mr trump and a determination to oust him in november 2020 the democratic national committee capped the number of candidates in the debates at 20 and split them between two nights with randomly selected 10 candidates on stage each night that left five candidates watching from the sidelines mr biden who has consistently topped the polls was center stage he was flanked by mr sanders ms harris and mr buttigieg they were joined by new age guru marianne williamson former colorado gov john hickenlooper entrepreneur andrew yang sen kirsten e gillibrand of new york sen michael bennet of colorado and mr swalwell in wednesday night s debate sparks flew between some of the candidates but they refrained from jabs at mr biden the fireworks however illuminated the same divisions on the second night including how far left to go with government run health care immigration and free tuition at public colleges sen elizabeth warren took the center podium on the first night she was flanked by former rep beto o rourke of texas and sens cory a booker of new jersey and amy klobuchar of minnesota on the edges of the stage wednesday stood new york mayor bill de blasio former rep john delaney of maryland former obama administration housing secretary julian castro rep tim
