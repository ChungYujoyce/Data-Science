tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn russia probe analysis opinion one of life s greatest questions is if god created all who created god and one of life s other greatest questions is how can jews vote for democrats president donald trump put it this way they re either ignorant or they re disloyal and while the media circus performers have been having lots of fun running and screaming with that one the fact is the president has got a point it s not like others haven t wondered the same haven t been wondering the same top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time the prevailing voting mindset for american jews has seemed to be that even when democrats do wrong democrats do no wrong as first lady hillary was a prized jewish keynoter until she kissed suha arafat the jerusalem post wrote in april 2015 just days after hillary clinton announced a run for the white house the story went on to remind how clinton in 1998 famously countered decades of u s policy by saying in a satellite interview with israeli palestinian and jordanian teenagers i think it will be in the long term interests of the middle east for palestine to be a state a year later on nov 11 1999 while visiting ramallah and attending a press conference with her presidential husband and palestinian leader yasser arafat clinton leaned in close and planted a kiss on the cheek of suha arafat the world gasped truly the world is still gasping it s been 20 years and getty images still sells the reprint permission rights to a large size of that photo for 499 yet 71 of jews still voted for clinton not trump in 2016 then there was former president barack obama obama s tense relationship with benjamin netanyahu colors his legacy on israel the los angeles times wrote in september 2016 for obama and netanyahu a final clash after years of conflict the new york times wrote in december 2016 nicolas sarkozy obama bemoan netanyahu over open mic cnn wrote in november 2011 that story went on to cite france s president sarkozy saying of bibi i can t stand him he s a liar and obama then responding you re tired of him what about me i have to deal with him every day yet in 2008 elections 78 of jews voted for obama versus 22 for sen john mccain of arizona yet in 2012 elections 69 of jews voted for obama versus 30 for massachusetts gov mitt romney this follows historical lines american jews tend to favor democrat candidates with 71 of jewish voters choosing democrat candidates and only 25 choosing republicans since 1968 jewish virtual library reported and the website my jewish learning reported that since 1930 the jewish community has been a solidly democratic constituency at the national and state levels of government why why is that when it s democrats by and large who ve been far less of a friend to israel than republicans one answer the american liberal jews whose identity has been stamped three generations ago by their grandparents under fdr continue to picture themselves as enlightened and the true inheritors of the mantle of jewish concerns for social justice wrote norman berdichevsky in a post on new english review called american jews paradoxical allegiance to the democratic party in september 2010 so it s an inherited loyalty the democratic party was widely regarded for the first 150 years of its existence on the national scene as the party of slavery and segregation berdichevsky went on nevertheless the democratic party machines in the big cities were successful in providing services jobs and patronage to new immigrants to new immigrants like the jewish people democrats successfully posed as the protectors of immigrants and painted the republicans as the party of elitists berdichevsky wrote so it s a factually twisted loyalty one that s furthered by the reality that most american jews have little or no fluency in hebrew and are therefore removed from the affection of their own nation and by extension by america s long running support for israel berdichevsky continued in other words american jews don t know the history of their country so they don t have a deep rooted love for their country so they care little about america s open love for their country or in even other words in trump words for example i think any jewish people that vote for a democrat i think it shows either a total lack of knowledge or great disloyalty he said his rhetoric sparked a firestorm within some jewish circles but he s on to something and the thing he s on to isn t even that firestorm y it s actually a well reported well considered frequently discussed question and it s a question that s high time to hit head on whatever the democrat party may have been in the minds of the jewish people in the past the truth is it s now become a welcome mat a breeding ground for anti semitic views for anti semitic people it s become the party of democrat ilhan omar the party of democrat rashida tlaib muslim congresswomen with pro bds movement views records of rhetoric that are decidedly anti semitic and ongoing stated sympathies that lie squarely with the palestinians over the israelis with the creation of a palestine and a devil may care attitude toward the fate of the state of israel trump s rhetoric may be the newsmaker but his rhetoric shouldn t distract from the real issue thatdemocrats have become the party of anti semitism and it s time american jews acknowledged and fought back with votes cheryl chumley can be reached at emailprotected or on twitter
