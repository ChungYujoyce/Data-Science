making any final decision yet but at this point i just can t do it kasich s choice to dodge the convention in cleveland piles on his opposition as it is being held in the very state of which he is governor sen rubio s spokesperson olivia perez cubas blamed rubio s absence on his late decision to jump into a re election bid to retain his seat in the u s senate cnn reported her statement that the former 2016 presidential candidate previously planned to attend unlike kasich rubio has indicated he will support the republican nominee then there s the bush that sought to be the third to serve as

discussion as comparisons are made between the prosecution against him for mishandling of classified information and the fbi investigation of former secretary of state hillary clinton that found that she showed gross negligence in mishandling classified information sen richard burr expressed uncertainty as to whether he will attend in june according to cnn sounding as it was not likely he said i m
