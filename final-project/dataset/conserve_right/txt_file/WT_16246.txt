should be evaluated objectively and fairly by the international community the interview coincided with a series of events organized by chinese officials including briefings for foreign reporters by economists and other researchers seeking to change minds abroad they have emphasized china s importance as a market its plans to end ownership limits in its auto industry and other regulatory changes but none of those moves directly addresses the policies that prompted u s president donald trump to impose penalty tariffs on chinese goods washington says beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology american officials say chinese plans for state led development of global champions in robotics and other fields violate beijing s free trade commitments and might erode american industrial leadership the cabinet press office said shen couldn t address those complaints because his office has no role in technology policy the trump administration has imposed 25
