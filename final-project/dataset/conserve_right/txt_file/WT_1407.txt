apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic forget about joseph r biden the race for the white house in 2020 looks more and more like a contest between president trump and his predecessor barack obama the former president has returned to politics with a vengeance inserting himself in ways previously unthinkable for those who have occupied the oval office and calling his successor a lawless incompetent along the way mr obama has upstaged his former sidekick and shifted the narrative of the 2020 presidential race from biden takes on trump to obama era versus the trump years top stories doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots it s a recast of the contest welcomed by mr trump who is more than happy to talk about how his administration s efforts have been held back by the failings and political machinations of his predecessor on everything from the economy to the coronavirus pandemic to the russia investigation in recent days that s meant mr trump pushing what he calls obamagate an unsubstantiated suggestion that mr obama led an illegal conspiracy to persecute and prosecute him and his aides during the 2016 presidential campaign the 44th and 45th presidents both historic in their own ways have been on a collision course for years dating to mr trump s pursuit of the birther theories questioning mr obama s qualifications for the white house in 2008 that then led to mr obama s skewering of mr trump at the 2011 white house correspondents dinner mr obama later watched as mr trump became president and began unraveling the legacy of his eight years in office freezing u s participation in the paris climate accord canceling the massive free trade trans pacific partnership puncturing obamacare and attempting to revoke the daca deportation amnesty for illegal immigrant dreamers president obama has to be stung at the leveling of his administration s deeds said mike mckenna a former top aide in the trump white house pretty much everything they did the trump administration has undone and usually added in some salt for the wounds so part of this is personal plus mr obama has more skin in the game this time than he did in 2016 with mr biden on the ballot he cares whether biden wins that wasn t the case with hillary mr mckenna said the obama team meanwhile says mr trump s obsession with his predecessor eats him alive inside trump s fact free fixation on obama dating back to birtherism is so absurd and stupid that it would be comic if it wasn t so tragic benjamin j rhodes a former deputy national security adviser under mr obama recently said on twitter mr obama had already been notably more active than most past presidents in criticizing his successor but with mr biden now the party s presumptive nominee mr obama has become more vocal first in a leaked conference call he said the decision to drop prosecution of former trump national security adviser michael flynn was an affront to our basic understanding of rule of law he continued his assault in a pair of commencement speeches over the weekend blasting mr trump s handling of the coronavirus crisis more than anything this pandemic has fully torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they re doing mr obama said the trump administration meanwhile declassified information showing almost 40 top obama officials including mr biden himself sought to unmask flynn in 2017 by tying his name to secretly surveilled conversations with a top russian official the obama administration is turning out to be one of the most corrupt and incompetent in u s history mr trump said on twitter he added remember he and sleepy joe are the reasons i am in the white house mr trump has demanded the republican controlled senate explore his theory that flynn was targeted as part of a broader obama administration deep state coup to undermine him and his administration an alleged plot mr trump has dubbed obamagate but attorney general william p barr on monday said he doesn t see an ongoing justice department probe resulting in a criminal investigation of either mr biden or mr obama though it could snare others kathleen sullivan a former democratic national committee member from new hampshire said mr trump is trying to smear mr obama because he feels threatened and has hated him since the correspondents dinner cheap psychology yes but trump has spent three years trying to eviscerate obama s legacy ms sullivan said also trump has a real problem with projection he obsessively projects his failings onto everyone else doug heye a gop strategist said mr trump also sees value in distraction amid the coronavirus clearly trump spoils for a fight and when he does he knows the media is going to cover that fight to a great extent mr heye said so if the conversation for an hour throughout the day on tv is about obama and trump fighting each other and not that 89 000 americans are dead you ve changed the conversation and his base loves it steve cochran a democratic national committee member from virginia said mr trump is insanely jealous of barack obama because obama is everything he is not handsome respected popular and an effective leader who brings out the best in people inspiring them to succeed both men are aware of the stakes if obama wins this round trump knows he loses mr cochran said former republican rep tom davis of virginia said mr obama has taken a more partisan role as an ex president than predecessors such as george w bush who left office promising to remain mum and did so until deep into the obama years he stayed out of it tried to be supportive and he held his tongue mr davis said that is what people used to do and i think it is an example of how politics has just gotten more polarized and more partisan and this

his strength isn t as an exciting candidate so someone has to excite the base yougov a polling outfit says 56 of americans have a positive opinion of mr obama significantly higher than mr biden s 40
