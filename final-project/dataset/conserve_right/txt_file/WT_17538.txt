s the small detail that makes all the difference i want everyone who gets into this car to feel special and empowered by its quality and craftsmanship i like that it feels luxurious but also has quite a classic edge to it as well as a contemporary feel land rover director of design gerry mcgovern said working with victoria in our design studio at gaydon certainly created a buzz within the team but we quickly recognised our similar design tastes and ambition for this car for example at the first meeting victoria herself inspired the use of rose gold she was wearing dark clothes and no jewellery apart from a rose gold man s watch i was struck by the juxtaposition of the masculine watch on a very elegant feminine wrist we both agreed it was the ideal way to introduce a softer touch to this bold assertive exterior colour scheme throughout the process we were keen to ensure that the vehicle would appeal equally to both men and women in fact victoria always maintained that she wanted david to be proud to drive this car we fully enjoyed working with victoria and i am confident this special edition will appeal to discerning luxury consumers globally the range rover evoque special edition
