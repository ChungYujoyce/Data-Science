tration should be indicted for persecution of michael flynn ever present social media may seem like a member of the family at times but that doesn t mean that people trust it almost two thirds of all likely voters 63 say they don t trust facebook to treat its users equally for example the new poll conducted by the media research center finds that the suspicious sentiment was even higher among self described conservatives the survey found that 77 of conservatives distrust facebook twitter also got an iffy review 53 of likely voters and 63 of conservatives do not trust twitter to be fair none of this is lost on conservatives who are aggressive players in the social media world and canny veterans of the shadow bans or outright ejections that can occur when posting and commenting at a given site none of this is lost on president trump top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste

large chris cillizza who cites new numbers from a washington post abc poll that give president trump a 44 favorability rating his best on record the news organizations said only joe biden has a statistical lead over the president in theoretical 2020 match ups with all the democratic contenders what the post abc numbers remind us is that trump won t be running against an idealized democratic candidate in 2020 he ll be running against a flesh and blood person with strengths and weaknesses and judging from the poll numbers he has a decent chance of beating that eventual nominee writes mr
