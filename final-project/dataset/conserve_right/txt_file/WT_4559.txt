apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic the obama justice department and the fbi twice debated whether to give the trump campaign a defensive briefing on russia but decided not to according to the department s inspector general report supporters of president trump say such a heads up could have changed history and short circuited an investigation given that no trump loyalists were found to have collaborated with russian hacking after a nearly three year fbi probe in the first discussion fbi director james b comey reached out to attorney general loretta e lynch who didn t act and considered a briefing down the road in an odd twist mr comey told the inspector general that he didn t remember the discussion top stories trump dismisses hydroxychloroquine criticism pelosi she s a waste of time hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots the second discussion ended with an fbi decision not to conduct a true defensive briefing instead after opening an investigation they sent a counterintelligence agent to penetrate the trump campaign to probe any collusion with russia the campaign received no alert about moscow s computer hacking or social media warfare against democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton the visiting agent later wrote a report on form 302 which is completed in criminal investigations the incident the event the meeting was a briefing and the fbi considered and decided to send that agent there to do the briefing justice department inspector general michael e horowitz told the senate judiciary committee on wednesday so the agent was actually doing the briefing but also using it for the purpose of investigation the fbi debated conducting a true defensive briefing in july 2016 before it opened crossfire hurricane the code name for the trump investigation but agents decided not to because it might tip off trump wrongdoers according to mr horowitz s extensive report the inspector general found 17 instances of inaccuracies or omissions in affidavits used to persuade judges to approve four foreign intelligence surveillance court wiretap warrants on trump campaign volunteer carter page in the end special counsel robert mueller conducted a grueling probe that put mr trump and his aides under investigation by 40 fbi agents and 19 prosecutors mr mueller said in march that he did not establish a trump russia conspiracy and no trump supporter was charged with collusion the report by mr horowitz gave this account of mrs lynch s involvement in spring 2016 she attended an fbi security meeting where mr comey and then deputy fbi director andrew mccabe pulled her aside and brought up the name carter page a recently announced trump national security adviser mr page would go on to become one of the most prominent figures in the trump russia saga mr page s history included living and working in moscow in 2015 the justice department announced charges against three russian spies in new york one of whom had tried to recruit mr page mr page was not accused of wrongdoing the horowitz report disclosed that he instead was a cia asset the inspector general s report said according to lynch comey and mccabe provided her with information indicating that russian intelligence reportedly planned to use page for information and to develop other contacts in the united states and that they were interested in his affiliation with the campaign lynch told us that her understanding was that this information from comey and mccabe was preliminary in that they did not state that any decisions or actions needed to be taken that day she said that they discussed the possibility of providing a defensive briefing to the trump campaign but she believed it was preliminary and something that might happen down the road mr horowitz said mrs lynch also provided office of the inspector general investigators with classified details j d gordon a former pentagon spokesman and a trump campaign national security adviser said a briefing on mr page would likely have resulted in cutting ties and the trump russia hoax would not have been as powerful after mr trump sewed up the republican presidential nomination mr page received campaign permission to travel to moscow in july to deliver a public university commencement address third world type setup that visit became fodder for conspiracy theories pushed by former british spy christopher steele based in london mr steele was hired by fusion gps with funds from the democratic national committee and the clinton campaign he told the fbi that mr page met with two kremlin figures and discussed bribes he said mr page worked as a team with campaign manager paul manafort to conspire with moscow none of those allegations proved true in a dossier that today has been roundly discredited mr comey disputed mrs lynch s recollection and flatly said there was no such discussion comey told the oig that he did not recall having such a conversation with lynch and that he did not think it was possible for such conversation to have occurred in the spring of 2016 the report said an australian diplomat had not yet tipped the fbi that a trump adviser in london george papadopoulos said over a glass of wine that he heard that moscow owned dirt on mrs clinton that message alone without any other evidence triggered the crossfire hurricane investigation to start on july 31 2016 mr comey also said that he did not recall himself having any knowledge of carter page s existence until the middle of 2016 the report said mr mccabe provided the same testimony he didn t remember such a discussion the fbi held its second discussion about briefing the trump campaign in july bill priestap who headed the counterintelligence unit took steps to open crossfire hurricane he said the campaign could have solicited information about papadopoulos talk in london so he didn t want to tip off anyone mr priestap told the inspector general had we provided a defensive briefing to someone on the trump campaign we would have alerted the campaign to what we were looking into and if someone on the campaign was engaged with the russians he she would very likely change his her tactics and or otherwise seek to cover up his her activities thereby preventing us from finding the truth on the other hand if no one on the trump campaign was working with the russians an investigation could prove that because the possibility existed that someone on the trump campaign could have taken the russians up on their offer i thought it wise to open an investigation to look into the situation the inspector general s report says mr priestap had not chosen which trump people he would investigate he later targeted mr page papadopoulos manafort and retired army lt gen michael flynn the inspector general said the fbi had no information from u s intelligence agencies that any trump campaign worker was involved in russian interference only the australian message mr mccabe told the inspector general that the fbi did provide a counterintelligence briefing to the clinton team because it was hit by russian hacking trump supporters say today that opening such a broad intrusive probe based on one snippet of information was wrong what s more they say the fbi never found any hacking collusion if we would have received a genuine defensive briefing i believe mr trump would have fired the four individuals under fbi investigation on the spot mr gordon said trump russia would never have become an issue looking back it was clearly a third world type setup sen lindsey graham south carolina republican and chairman of the senate judiciary committee said at mr horowitz s hearing wednesday that the lack of a defense briefing showed political bias the fbi was spying on the trump campaign they were not working to protect him mr graham said in contrast hillary clinton s campaign was given a proper defensive briefing which further shows the fbi had political bias and their motive was to get hillary elected president while simu
