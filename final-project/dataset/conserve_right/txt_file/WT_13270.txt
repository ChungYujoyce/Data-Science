apitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic analysis opinion what may come as a surprise to some people is that simply buying stocks and bonds does not make you an investor it takes the act of both buying and selling of financial securities be they stocks bonds mutual funds or exchange traded funds to make you an astute investor what separates a buyer of stocks from savvy investor in my view is knowing when to exit a position after all until you ring the register the only profits you have are on paper or the computer screen these days the same is true in knowing when to cut your losses on a losing position and moving on to find a viable opportunity to recoup any losses top stories oregon becomes first state to offer free abortions for all including illegal aliens firm tests uv light treatment that trump was mocked for mentioning hydroxychloroquine rated most effective therapy by doctors for coronavirus global survey at the outset of this column i wrote that it takes a lot of work to make a build an investment thesis narrow the list of related investment candidates and make the investment selection knowing when to sell requires a similar thought process but it also has one other common field mine which is falling in love with or becoming emotionally attached to the company in which you have invested your hard earned dollars becoming attached with a company and its stock can blind you to what may be really going on with the company or in the industry it s easy to say be objective or remain cold blooded over your investment choices but one of the risks in becoming attached or holding on too tight is the inability to let go that inability may result in not booking profits when you should or remaining in an underperforming position for me i tend to look for inflections in the reward to risk profile to determine when to enter or exit let s look at an example in the past several weeks shares of rare earth element company molycorp inc have made an impressive move on an absolute basis and a relative one compared with the s p 500 the vast majority of that share price increase came in the past few weeks as china cut export quotas for rare earth elements by 35 percent in the first half of 2011 subsequent headlines along with molycorp being not only one of a few new sources of rare earth materials in the medium term but a domestic supplier as well were the primary drivers in my opinion even though the short to medium term fundamentals are intact i find the reward to risk profile in molycorp shares far more balanced at current levels when several things are considered first on wednesday president obama will meet with chinese president hu jintao with the aim of improving the relationship between the two countries while i do not expect any immediate shift the subsequent tone and potential policy changes as they pertain to rare earth element export quotas from china bear watching keep in mind it was the political and trade related aspects of rare earth elements as well as the scarcity factor that drove molycorp shares up over the past several weeks any reversal or softening in china s position would likely pressure rare earth element companies and their respective share prices second and more specific to molycorp the lock up period associated with molycorp s july 2010 initial public offering expires on thursday this risk in my view given the rapid rise in mcp shares is that insiders will seek to monetize their positions per data from nasdaq insiders own approximately 67 million shares or more than 80 percent of molycorp s common share count lastly we have to remember that rare earth element companies at the end of the day are mining companies as such we have to consider the valuation when looking at these types of companies on a price to peak earnings perspective other mining companies have peaked at an average of 12 times peak earnings generated over the 2002 2010 period while factoring in a modest premium to account for scarcity at the current share price molycorp would have to deliver peak earnings of 3 75 4 per share currently wall street expects molycorp to generate earnings per share of 2 60 in 2012 aside from keeping our eyes on peak earnings potential at molycorp we will also keep a watch on new production and capacity increases from other rare earth companies including rare element resources avalon rare metals and lynas corp as i see it the net view on molycorp share is this while long term fundamentals are in place for rare earth elements over the short to medium term these factors the meteoric rise in the shares over the past several weeks coupled with potential change in export policy the lock up expiration and peer valuation metrics shift the reward to risk profile to one that is more risk heavy some investors may be swayed by the news flow and keep their positions but as i mentioned at the outset savvy investors know when to enter and exit investment positions there is no shame in booking profits and few like to talk about losing money in the market good luck and good hunting chris versace the thematic investor is the director of research of think 20 20 an
