look at political claims that take shortcuts with the facts or don t tell the full story washington ap president barack obama and republican rival mitt romney spun one sided stories in their first presidential debate not necessarily bogus but not the whole truth they made some flat out flubs too the rise in health insurance premiums has not been the slowest in 50 years as obama stated far from it and there are not 23 million unemployed as romney asserted top stories coronavirus hype biggest political hoax in history purge stifles anti trump resistance at white house odni postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud here s a look at some of their claims and how they stack up with the facts obama i ve proposed a specific 4 trillion deficit reduction plan the way we do it is 2 50 for every cut we ask for 1 in additional revenue the facts in promising 4 trillion obama is already banking more than 2 trillion from legislation enacted along with republicans last year that cut agency operating budgets and capped them for 10 years he also claims more than 800 billion in war savings that would occur anyway and he uses creative bookkeeping to hide spending on medicare reimbursements to doctors take those cuts away and obama s 2 50 1 ratio of spending cuts to tax increases shifts significantly more in the direction of tax increases obama s february budget offered proposals that would cut deficits over the coming decade by 2 trillion instead of 4 trillion of that deficit reduction tax increases accounted for 1 6 trillion he promises relatively small spending cuts of 597 billion from big federal benefit programs like medicare and medicaid he also proposed higher spending on infrastructure projects romney obama s health care plan puts in place an unelected board that s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have i don t like that idea the facts romney is referring to the independent payment advisory board a panel of experts that would have the power to force medicare cuts if costs rise beyond certain levels and congress fails to act but obama s health care law explicitly prohibits the board from rationing care shifting costs to retirees restricting benefits or raising the medicare eligibility age so the board doesn t have the power to dictate to doctors what treatments they can prescribe romney seems to be resurrecting the assertion that obama s law would lead to rationing made famous by former alaska gov sarah palin s widely debunked allegation that it would create death panels the board has yet to be named and its members would ultimately have to be confirmed by the senate health care inflation has been modest in the last few years so cuts would be unlikely for most of the rest of this decade obama over the last two years health care premiums have gone up it s true but they ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years so we re already beginning to see progress in the meantime folks out there with insurance you re already getting a rebate the facts not so concerning premiums obama is mixing overall health care spending which has been growing at historically low levels and health insurance premiums which have continued to rise faster than wages and overall economic growth premiums for job based family coverage have risen by nearly 2 400 since 2009 when obama took office according to the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation in 2011 premiums jumped by 9 percent this year s 4 percent increase was more manageable but the price tag for family coverage stands at 15 745 with employees paying more than 4 300 of that when it comes to insurance rebates under obama s health care law less than 10 percent of people with private health insurance are benefiting more than 160 million americans under 65 have private insurance through their jobs and by buying their own policies according to the administration about 13 million people will benefit from rebates and nearly two thirds of that number will only be entitled to a share of it since they are covered under job based plans where their employer pays most of the premium and will get most of the rebate romney on the failure of obama s economic policy and the proof of that is 23 million people out of work the proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty the proof of that is we ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps the proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can t find work the facts the number of unemployed is 12 5 million not 23 million romney was also counting 8 million people who are working part time but would like a full time job and 2 6 million who have stopped looking for work either because they are discouraged or because they are going back to school or for other reasons he got the figure closer to right earlier in the debate leaving out only the part timers when he said the u s has 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work but he was wrong in asserting that obama came into office facing 23 million people out of work at the start of obama s presidency 12 million were out of work his claim that half of college graduates can t find work now also was problematic a northeastern university analysis for the associated press found that a quarter of graduates were probably unemployed and another quarter were underemployed which means working in jobs that didn t make full use of their skills or experience obama it s important that we take some of the money that we re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild america the facts this oft repeated claim is based on a fiscal fiction the wars in iraq and afghanistan were paid for mostly with borrowed money so stopping them doesn t create a new pool of available cash that can be used for something else like rebuilding america it just slows down the government s borrowing romney at the same time gasoline prices have doubled under the president electric rates are up the facts he s right that the average price has doubled and a little more since obama was sworn in but presidents have almost no influence on gasoline prices and certainly not in the near term gasoline prices are set on financial exchanges around the world and are based on a host of factors most importantly the price of crude oil used to make gasoline the amount of finished gasoline ready to be shipped and the capacity of refiners to make enough to meet market demand retail electricity prices have risen since obama took office barely they ve grown by an average of less than 1 percent per year less than the rate of inflation and slower than the historical growth in electricity prices the unexpectedly modest rise in electricity prices is because of the plummeting cost of natural gas which is used to generate electricity obama gov romney s central economic plan calls for a 5 trillion tax cut on top of the extension of the bush tax cuts that s another trillion dollars and 2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn t asked for that s 8 trillion how we pay for that reduce the deficit and make the investments that we need to make without dumping those costs onto middle class americans i think is one of the central questions of this campaign the facts obama s claim that romney wants to cut taxes by 5 trillion doesn t add up presumably obama was talking about the effect of romney s tax plan over 10 years which is common in washington but obama s math doesn t take into account romney s entire plan romney proposes to reduce income tax rates by 20 percent and eliminate the estate tax and the alternative minimum tax the tax policy center a washington research group says that would reduce federal tax revenues by 465 billion in 2015 which would add up to about 5 trillion over 10 years however romney says he wants to pay for the tax cuts by reducing or eliminating tax credits deductions and exemptions the goal is a simpler tax code that raises the same amount of money as the current system but does it in a more efficient manner the knock on romney s plan which obama accurately cited is that romney has refused to say which tax breaks he would eliminate to pay for the lower rates romney what would i cut from spending well first of all i will eliminate all programs by this test if they pass it is the program so critical it s worth borrowing money from china to pay for it the facts china continues to be portrayed by romney and many other republicans as the poster child for runaway federal deficits it s true that china is the largest foreign holder of u s debt but it only represents about an 8 percent stake and china has recently been decreasing its holdings according to the treasury department some two thirds of the 16 trillion national debt is owed to the federal government with the largest single stake the federal reserve as well as american investors and the social security trust fund obama independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet gov romney s pledge of not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle class families the average middle class family with children would pay about 2 000 more the facts that s just one scenario obama s claim relies on a study by the tax policy center a washington research group the study however is more nuanced than obama indicated the study concludes it would be impossible for romney to meet all of his stated goals without shifting some of the tax burden from people who make more than 200 000 to people who make less in one scenario the study says romney s proposal could result in a 2 000 tax increase for families who make less than 200 000 and have children romney says his plan wouldn t raise taxes on anyone and his campaign points to several studies by conservative think tanks that dispute the tax policy center s findings most of the conservative studies argue that romney s tax plan would stimulate economic growth generating additional tax revenue without shifting any of the tax burden to the middle class congress however doesn t use those kinds of projections when it estimates the effect of tax legislation romney on cutting the deficit obamacare s on my list i m going to stop the subsidy to pbs i ll make government more efficient the facts romney has promised to balance the budget in eight years to 10 years but he hasn t offered a complete plan instead he s promised a set of principles some of which like increasing pentagon spending and restoring more than 700 billion in cuts that democrats made in medicare over the coming decade work against his goal he also has said he will not consider tax increases he pledges to shrink the government to 20 percent of the size of the economy as opposed to more than 23 percent of gross domestic product now by the end of his first term the romney campaign estimates that would require cuts of 500 billion from the 2016 budget alone he also has pledged to cut tax rates by 20 percent paying for them by eliminating tax breaks for the wealthiest and through economic growth to fulfill his promise then romney would require cuts to other programs so deep under one calculation requiring cutting many areas of the domestic budget by one third within four years that they could never get through congress cuts to domestic agencies would have to be particularly deep but he s offered only a few modest examples of government programs he d be willing to squeeze like subsidies to pbs and amtrak he does want to repeal obama s big health care law but that law is actually forecast to reduce the deficit romney simpson bowles the president should have grabbed that obama that s what we ve done made some adjustments to it and we re putting it before congress right now a 4 trillion plan the facts at first the president did largely ignore the recommendations made by his deficit commission headed by democrat erskine bowles and republican alan simpson he later incorporated some of the proposals largely the less controversial ones he did not endorse some of the politically troublesome recommendations such as trimming popular tax deductions like the one for
