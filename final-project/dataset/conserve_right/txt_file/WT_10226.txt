security officials to impose sanctions on thales alenia space tas fearing the penalties would undermine a white house led effort to loosen technology export controls the officials who spoke on the

at 74 congress was alerted to the case by security officials in the administration who are concerned about apparent interference from political appointees in the state department opposed to sanctioning the french firm on monday three senior house republicans wrote to secretary of state hillary rodham clinton stating that the satellite exports to china appear to be illegal under u s trade controls according to administration and congressional officials the state department s investigation of thales began in may 2008 and has been stymied by the french government s refusal to allow the company to cooperate in the probe china was blocked from buying u s origin military goods including satellites in 1989 after the chinese military s bloody crackdown on unarmed protesters in beijing s tiananmen square international traffic in arms regulations itar also requires export companies to obtain licenses for sales of military related u s goods to china directly or via re export from third countries u s officials are concerned that china s military will use the technology china s space program is run by the chinese military which is building up space communications intelligence navigation and targeting systems for use with its anti ship ballistic missiles and other high tech weapons the investigation was launched by the state department s directorate of defense trade controls after thales offered satellites for sale specifically the spacebus 4000 c2 as itar free or freely exportable under u s rules u s officials however say the satellites sold to china contain restricted high tech parts that require licenses before they are exported to third countries a state department official confirmed the investigation the department continues to look into exports of items regulated under the u s munitions list to thales alenia space to see if there is any definitive evidence that would contradict claims that the satellites were itar free the official told the washington times state department technology security officials met with tas officials as recently as this month and continue gathering information with an eye toward resolution of this matter the official said house republicans expressed in their letter to mrs clinton concern for efforts to protect the united states from the increasingly aggressive activity in space of the people s republic of china members of the house and senate were briefed twice this year on the probe they said given that this investigation has been open since 2008 and state department personnel appear to have concluded that there is a high probability that tas illegally exported itar controlled technology to china when does the department expect to take a final action which under law may include a denial of any licenses for the export of united states munitions list usml technology the lawmakers wrote the misperception that there is an itar free satellite on the market is of deep concern to u s industry a thales spokesman referred questions to the company s director of communications markus leutert who did not return an email or telephone call seeking the company s response tas spokeswoman sandrine bielecki also did not return several calls and emails spokesmen for the french and chinese embassies could not be reached for comment the letter to mrs clinton was signed by republican reps ileana ros lehtinen of florida chairwoman of the house foreign affairs committee michael r turner of ohio chairman of the house armed services strategic forces subcommittee and frank r wolf of virginia chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee on commerce the lawmakers also asked the state department to provide a copy of the counter space technology list which identifies technology that could be used in space warfare as you know china is actively engaging in cyberespionage against american companies and the u s government the house republicans said china frequently uses this technology to bolster its military and to aid its commercial enterprises that is among the reasons that the state department s enforcement of the u s export control regime including the itar is of significant importance to the national security and economic competitiveness of the united states a congressional commission headed by then rep christopher cox california republican in 1998 determined that two u s satellite

were constrained by french law and commercial secrecy considerations a u s official said the state department is troubled by the perception of tas continued lack of cooperation particularly given that the sb 4000 c2 is not in fact itar free and was exported to china between 1999 and 2008 nearly 60 u s export licenses and agreements worth an estimated 42 million were approved for thales to buy hardware and technology for spacebus 3000 and 4000 series satellites a congressional aide said administration officials are blocking the imposition of penalties against thales because they are concerned that it will undermine the effort to loosen controls on high technology u s exports president obama in august 2010 announced a major program to reform u s export controls as a way to
