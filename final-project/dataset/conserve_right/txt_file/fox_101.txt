this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated chris wallace fox news anchor i aposm chris wallace we aposre live in des moines ahead of the iowa caucuses where the shadow of impeachment reaches all the way from capitol hill begin videotape rep jerry nadler d ny they complain about process but they do not seriously contest any of the allegations against the president sen chuck schumer d ny the mcconnell rules seem to be designed by president trump for president trump wallace democrats wrap up their opening arguments and president trump aposs lawyers finally get their turn pat cipollone white house counsel we will show you a lot of evidence that they should have showed you wallace we aposll discuss the battle over calling witnesses with alan dershowitz a member of the president aposs defense team it aposs a fox news sunday exclusive and we aposll ask our sunday group back in washington to break down new fox polls on whether the president should be removed from office then andrew yang d presidential candidate i feel bad for my competitors that have to head to d c for this impeachment trial wallace presidential candidate andrew yang joins us here in iowa to talk about staying alive in the democratic race plus who will win in just eight days we aposll ask a special iowa political panel and our power player of the week turning his on screen roles into off screen causes all right now on fox news sunday end videotape wallace you are looking live at the river center in downtown des moines the site of our town hall tonight on fox news channel with mayor pete buttigieg and hello again today from iowa just eight days before the caucuses where americans will decide the first contest in the race for the 2020 democratic nomination the impeachment of president trump is throwing some candidates a curve ball forcing the four senators in the race to stay in washington for the senate trial today we have new fox polls on impeachment and democrats apos push for witnesses forty eight percent of voters in our new nationwide survey say senate already has enough information while 44 percent say more witness testimony is needed in a moment we aposll speak with alan dershowitz a member of the president aposs defense team but first let aposs bring in kevin corke with the latest from the white house kevin kevin corke fox news correspondent chris in a vigorous defense of the president his legal team this week warned senators against removing him from office less than ten months before americans vote on whether or not to give him a second term begin videotape cipollone for all their talk about election interference that they aposre here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in american history corke white house counsel pat cipollone the head of the president aposs defense team said saturday that democrats apos efforts to remove the president from office would set a very very dangerous precedent in an election year cipollone let the people decide for themselves that aposs what the founders wanted that aposs what we should all want corke but democrats in only the third presidential impeachment trial in u s history argued that the president should be removed for encouraging ukraine to interfere in the upcoming election by allegedly pressuring its leader to dig up dirt on leading democratic contender former vice president joe biden rep adam schiff d ca they don apost contest the basic architecture of the scheme they do not contest that the president solicited a foreign nation to interfere in our election to help him cheat corke schiff aposs assertion comes as a newly revealed 2018 video appears to show the president at a donor event with two men at the center of the impeachment inquiry talking about removing the u s ambassador to ukraine this as a majority of those in the latest fox news survey say they believe the president should be removed from office 50 44 end videotape corke that survey 48 democrats 42 republicans by the way sources tell fox news it is highly unlikely the president aposs legal team will take as much time as the house did in mounting its defense that means chris we could see a vote on possible witnesses and perhaps even the articles themselves sometime late this week chris wallace kevin corke reporting from the white house kevin thank you joining us now a member of the president aposs defense team alan dershowitz professor emeritus at harvard law school and author of the new book guilt by accusation professor the democratic house floor managers used their entire 24 hours to make their case against president trump how do you think they did alan dershowitz impeachment defense team member i think they presented the strongest case they could present on their facts but they didn apost come close to alleging impeachable offenses remember the constitution requires treason there aposs no treason bribery there aposs no allegation of bribery other high crimes and misdemeanors which means other high crimes and misdemeanors that are akin to treason and bribery they completely failed to meet that high constitutional standard and therefore it would be unconstitutional to remove a president based on the allegations that were made against him in the articles of impeachment wallace so let aposs assume for the sake of this discussion that everything that the floor managers argued is true that president trump used the power of his office the military aide a meeting with ukraine aposs president to pressure ukraine to get to investigate to get oppo research on his one of his main rivals for 2020 joe biden assuming just for this argument that all of that is true you aposre saying it aposs still not an impeachable offense dershowitz well the defense team tomorrow will show that it aposs not true that many of the issues that were presented are were presented incompletely remember there are three things that the senate has to decide one is there sufficient evidence of what they claim two does it constitute a high does it constitute first of all an abuse of power and third does abuse of power constitute impeachable offenses but the legal argument is that since they didn apost allege any impeachable offenses since they only alleged abuse of power and obstruction of congress and those are vague open ended criteria of exactly the sort the framers had rejected back in the constitutional convention that yes even if the factual allegations are true which are highly disputed in which the defense team will show contrary evidence but even if true they did not allege impeachable offenses so there can apost be a constitutionally authorized impeachment that aposs the legal constitutional argument now obviously lawyers always crosstalk wallace let me let me interrupt if i can sir dershowitz sure wallace because i want to press on the question dershowitz sure please wallace of the constitutional argument you base that argument in large part in prior interviews on the case made by former supreme court justice benjamin curtis in the impeachment trial of president andrew johnson back in 1868 briefly what do you think is the argument that justice curtis made that aposs so important here dershowitz what he argued is that when you look at all the provisions in the constitution regarding impeachment that clearly the framers intended that the criteria be high crimes and misdemeanors that is existing criminal statutes now i don apost think he meant that for example if a president bribes somebody but the bribery occurred outside of the statute of limitations or outside of the united states so that he couldn apost technically be prosecuted that that would necessarily mean he couldn apost be impeached but the conduct has to be criminal in nature it can apost be abuse of power it can apost be obstruction of congress those are precisely the arguments that the framers rejected remember one of the framers introduced an argument saying that maladministration which was a common law in england a ground for impeachment should be included in the constitution and madison said if you do that you aposre going to turn the united states republic into a parliamentary style democracy like in britain where the president serves at the pleasure of the legislature and they didn apost want that wallace but dershowitz they rejected that they instead imposed very stringent criteria for impeachment that haven apost been met in this case wallace i want to argue this with you a little bit because dershowitz sure please wallace it seems to be are two excuse me two problems with your argument about the johnson impeachment trial first of all johnson had clearly broken the law the tenure of office act when he fired his own secretary of war and secondly i look back at all of the arguments made by the senators who decided to vote to save because he was only saved by one vote by the republican refusance ph they didn apost talk about that at all that wasn apost the argument that was key to them whether or not the impeachable offense was a crime what some of them argued that the law that he had broken was unconstitutional some argued who would replace him but the specific argument by justice curtis that you keep citing was not a factor dershowitz well professor bowie ph at harvard law school who wrote a piece about this in the harvard law review forum takes exactly the opposite position he aposs a historian and he looked at the debates and he says that among the seven senators who dissented republicans who hated johnson but decided that if you allowed these grounds for impeachment to go forward it would undercut the constitution he said several of them did cite and refer to the argument and one of them said if you allow crime to be defined in the bosom of every senator as distinguished from in the law books you would be inviting allowing impeachment to become regularized as a political tool wallace let aposs dershowitz so respectfully chris i disagree those republicans did look at curtis and one of them said quote curtis gave us the law and we followed it wallace well crosstalk dershowitz so i do think curtis apos arguments are substantial but even if you reject curtis apos arguments you then have to come and say that abuse of power which virtually every presidents since washington has been accused of wallace let me dershowitz by political enemies would be criteria and it aposs not go ahead wallace i don apost mean to interrupt you but we have limited time and i want to talk to about the framers because you keep bringing them up dershowitz right i do wallace in federalist 65 dershowitz right wallace alexander hamilton certainly one of the framers argues that a criminal offense is not essential to impeachment let me put up what he says dershowitz right wallace the subjects of its jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the misconduct misconduct of public men or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust dershowitz right wallace another founder george mason brought up the case of a former british official in india who had been accused of mismanagement again in either of these cases is there any mention of breaking a specific criminal statute dershowitz well let aposs start with mismanagement yes that was a criteria in england and that was rejected by the united states that was one of the elements that was introduced by the framers and it was rejected by votes like nine to two crosstalk wallace but that aposs not true george mason is one of the people who came up with high crimes and misdemeanors dershowitz i understand but he rejected crosstalk wallace to include to include things like misconduct and abuse of power dershowitz no absolutely wallace and then you have alexander hamilton dershowitz absolutely not wallace who talked specifically about misconduct and abuse dershowitz i will i will spend some time on the hamilton matter in my talk when clinton was being impeached people who opposed clinton aposs impeachment cited the same quote as saying no no no that shows you have to narrow it not broaden it what he was saying is the subjects of the jurisdiction namely high crimes and misdemeanors treason bribery those are crimes that involve public people they are political in nature they are abuse of power hamilton wasn apost trying to expand the criteria from the constitutional criteria he was actually trying to contract it arguing that in fact in addition to having crimes like treason and bribery you have to show that it involves a breach of public trust i will lay this all out tomorrow very carefully in a very scholarly way crosstalk wallace i look forward to that but i but i do want to point out that we want to listen to a couple of the people who in you bring up the clinton impeachment trial who argued exactly the opposite of what you aposre arguing today let aposs listen to them dershowitz uh huh begin video clip rep lindsey graham r sc it doesn apost even have to be crime it aposs just when you start using your office and you aposre acting in a way that hurts people you aposve committed a high crime dershowitz it certainly doesn apost have to be a crime if you have somebody who completely corrupts the office of president and who abuses trust and who poses great danger to our liberty you don apost need technical crime end video clip dershowitz well you don apost need a technical crime you don apost need a technical crime wallace professor dershowitz let me let me ask about this dershowitz sure wallace because when you argue that case that what didn apost have to be a crime in the clinton impeachment i find it very hard to believe that you had not studied the only other presidential impeachment in history which was the johnson impeachment so suddenly discovering that the key issue is what justice curtis argued in 1860 you aposre too good a lawyer not to have studied that back in 1998 dershowitz well remember in 1998 the issue was not whether you need a crime because president clinton was charged with a crime he was charged with perjury crosstalk wallace but you just said we just put the sound bite up where you said it doesn apost have to be a crime dershowitz well i did say that then and i aposve done all the extensive research i aposve been immersing myself in dusty old books and i aposve concluded that no it has to be a crime it doesn apost have to be a technical crime now remember that congressman nadler changed his view congressman then senator schumer changed his view larry tribe back in 1998 said a sitting president couldn apost be prosecuted now once trump got elected he said a sitting president can be prosecuted that aposs what scholars do that aposs what academics do we do more research we need to find crosstalk wallace you talked ph about what lawyers do which is depending on the fact facts of the case and the side they aposre arguing they find an argument to make dershowitz well i aposve made this argument way way way before i was put on the given the role to argue the constitutional case i made that argument in the article of the wall street journal i made that argument wallace professor i want to ask you one last question dershowitz sure wallace because we are running out of time a tape has just been discovered which appears to show a giuliani associate lev parnas having a conversation with president trump back in 2018 about then u s ambassador to ukraine marie yovanovitch let aposs listen to this exchange dershowitz uh huh great begin audio clip lev parnas giuliani associate she aposs basically walking around telling everybody wait he aposs going to get impeached just wait it aposs incredible donald trump president of the united states get rid of her get her out tomorrow i don apost care get her out tomorrow take her out ok do it end audio clip dershowitz perfect example of what is not impeachable conduct the president has full authority to fire an ambassador for any reason he chooses to crosstalk wallace let me just ask you this works better if i ask the question and then you answer it professor dershowitz sure wallace which is given the fact that president trump says he doesn apost know parnas and you can see what appears to be a discussion back and forth and the fact that they aposre specifically discussing getting rid of yovanovitch the ambassador who was really holding up the effort to try to get ukraine to investigate biden and the democrats i aposm not asking if it aposs an impeachable offense clearly that conversation isn apost how damaging do you think that tape is dershowitz well i only want to speak to what aposs an impeachable offense i think we aposre not talking here about political damage that aposs exactly what voters ought to be deciding on that aposs why the election ought to go forward voters would have taken into account that tape hear both sides of it decide how to vote you acknowledge that aposs not an impeachable offense and i would say that much of what was presented by the democrats were not impeachable offenses they were campaign ads designed to try to show that you should vote for a different candidate that aposs fine let aposs put it up to the voters let aposs not destroy our heritage of our constitution by expanding the criteria for impeachment beyond that which the framers accepted wallace professor dershowitz thank you thank you for your time and we will be watching your arguments on the senate floor tomorrow sir dershowitz thank you wallace up next we aposll bring in our sunday group back in washington for the latest on impeachment and the push for witnesses as fox news sunday reports from des moines the site of our town hall tonight with mayor pete buttigieg commercial break begin video clip nadler so far i aposm sad to say i see a lot of senators voting for a cover up voting to deny witnesses and absolutely indefensible vote obviously a treacherous vote rep adam schiff d ca cbs news reported last night that a trump confidant said that gop senators were warned vote against your president vote against the president and your head will be on a pike end video clip wallace house impeachment managers jerry nadler and adam schiff applying pressure on senate republicans perhaps too much pressure to get their votes to call witnesses in the trial of president trump and it aposs time to have our sunday group in washington a cofounder of the federalist ben domenech fox news national security correspondent jennifer griffin and former democratic congresswoman jane harman director of the wilson center ben a few of the key swing or republicans like lisa murkowski of alaska who democrats have been counting on to vote their way to call witnesses to put them in a majority 51 votes so they can get some witnesses say they were offended by those remarks as we begin week two of the senate trial is calling witnesses more likely or less likely ben domenech the federalist i think it aposs less likely chris for a lot of different reasons but i think that was really a huge error on the part of the house managers they aposve been advancing a case that i think they made as strongly as they as they really could but in the end there they resorted to the kind of behavior that i think was more in line with making ads back home as opposed to trying to convince any of those republican senators to come along with them i think that was a huge error on their part and i think it aposs going to allow for a lot of these different members to say hey look this looks even more partisan than it did when they started we have some room here in order to not vote for additional witnesses we think they aposve made a strong case but we aposre not convinced wallace congresswoman i want to put up one of those new fox polls that we released this morning let aposs put it on the screen as we said earlier 48 percent now say the senate already has enough information to decide the case while 44 percent say they need more witness testimony same question basically that i just asked ben jane harman wilson center director yes wallace did the house floor managers lose ground this week harman no i think those two quotes were unfortunate the one i love was adam schiff aposs if truth doesn apost matter we aposre lost i thought his quote on thursday was amazing but the extra nasty rhetoric on both sides is not helpful the clock is ticking in this sense the iowa caucuses are on february 3rd and trump wants to deliver the state of the union message on february 4th so this week is going to see a lot of pressure to shut this down my view is that there is a way to call witnesses i think some republicans will press for this it only takes 51 votes let aposs do this right let aposs make the process fair and senators have a right to make their own decisions i wasn apost persuaded by alan dershowitz i thought your interview was excellent chris he was alan was my harvard law school professor but i think there is enough information if senators want to vote to remove wallace jennifer we understand that the white house defense team which is going to begin its argument in earnest tomorrow is going to go hard after joe biden and his son hunter biden a part of this is obviously part to make their argument that when the president was asking for an investigation they aposre going to say it was really interested in corruption in ukraine given the fact that the u s was going to provide hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid but isn apost part of this also to try to scuff up joe biden who still at this point it looks like the most likely rival democratic nominee for president trump in the 2020 election jennifer griffin fox news correspondent absolutely chris i think that if you look at who the real jurors are in the senate impeachment trial it is not the senators who were sitting there it is the american people who will be voting in the fall and both parties republicans and you saw this in the defense that was laid out yesterday even though it was just a precursor to what we will hear tomorrow they are going to try to make this about joe biden and all eyes are going to be on can they do what the president was accused by democrats of doing by trying to dig up dirt on joe biden and so there is no real upside if there is any sort of deal to bring witnesses the republicans have already said they will insist on bringing hunter biden and joe biden if the democrats get john bolton and mick mulvaney that is a nonstarter and both parties see that what the caucuses coming up the democrats certainly feel that the four senators who need to be out in iowa campaigning are hurt the longer this goes on and there are many many people on both sides who just feel this needs to be over with quickly because it is not playing well with the public and they want to leave this to the ballot box in some ways wallace ben you said in your first answer you thought some of the statements were more for campaign ads than they were to try to persuade the jurors in a trial even if they are not able to if they lose on impeachment the democrats do can they conceivably gain by forcing some of these swing seat senators in purple states like susan collins of maine or cory gardner in colorado to take a tough vote either one on calling witnesses or two on whether to acquit or remove the president if they can put them in a political box might that help in terms not of the president but in terms of their chances for winning reelection in november domenech you know i think that someone like cory gardner he really has no path other than sticking with the president i really doubt that he aposs going to break away as much as there aposs been attention focused on him i actually think that there aposs a number of senators on the democratic side of the aisle who are also going to try to split their votes or find some way to send a message including joe manchin from west virginia kyrsten sinema from arizona and a number of other senators as well i also think we do need to keep this in mind sort of going forward what aposs going to happen in the next 10 days you aposre going to have in addition to that iowa vote you aposre probably going to have this wrap up within the next week you aposre going to have a vote probably going to be bipartisan against removing the president and you aposre going to have the president then give a state of the union address and i think that aposs all going to create a lot of momentum going into 2020 in ways that we don apost fully understand yet what it aposs going to do to the situation but it aposs going to have a big impact harman yes wallace let me bring in i aposve got about a minute left congresswoman harman you know even if they don apost remove president trump this does have an impact there are 30 whatever 33 35 senators up for reelection do you think that is perhaps on chuck schumer aposs mind you know maybe if i play this right i can move up from senate minority leader to senate majority leader harman there aposs no question that that aposs on his mind i also think that mitch mcconnell is in tough shape or somewhat tough shape in kentucky and he doesn apost need president trump criticizing him before he went as primary so one more fact chris there could be a motion to censure that takes 51 votes and that aposs being talked about how that comes up is not clear that was attempted in the clinton impeachment it failed it was after the vote to acquit in the senate but there might be some play there and i think a whole bunch of senators on both sides would exhale if they could find a way to get that done because nobody applauds the conduct that we know about wallace thank you panel see you next sunday when we come back we are live here in iowa with entrepreneur andrew yang who aposs on the trail here ahead of the first in the nation vote as fox news sunday continues live from des moines iowa commercial break wallace coming up democratic candidates crisscrossed the hawkeye state making their final arguments ahead of the first vote of 2020 begin video clip yang my administration will be able to draw people in from both sides of the aisle inaudible end video clip wallace we aposll ask candidate andrew yang about his strategy for the iowa caucuses chris wallace fox host we aposre live in des moines iowa just eight days ahead of the first contest in the race for the democratic nomination in a moment we aposll speak with presidential candidate andrew yang but first let aposs get the latest on the shape of the race from peter doocy here in iowa peter peter doocy fox correspondent good morning chris circuits have been trying to keep caucus goers interested while senators have been stuck in d c at the impeachment trial like alexandria ocasio cortez for bernie sanders begin videotape rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny all of us have power we just need to use it doocy voice over but during a brief break in that trial senators broke for iowa sen bernie sanders i vt presidential candidate we learned this morning that the the senate would adjourn before 1 00 got on a plane and here we are doocy a new national fox news poll of democratic primary voters finds joe biden down four points since december but still in first place and bernie sanders up three points since last month in second place followed by warren michael bloomberg pete buttigieg and andrew yang andrew yang d presidential candidate we need you to caucus with this campaign on february 3rd to make sure this message does not die here in iowa doocy late saturday warren found out she won the endorsement of the des moines register sen elizabeth warren d ma presidential candidate and iowa has a big decision to make a really big decision you aposre you aposre going to lead the nation on this there are a lot of people around the country who are afraid doocy as biden split his week in between new hampshire and iowa joe biden d presidential candidate every four years as some of you heard me say before democracy begins here in iowa end videotape doocy the two polling leaders are both very familiar to voters here in iowa and they aposre both hoping for different outcomes than last time because last time sanders ran in 2016 he narrowly lost and the last time biden ran in 2008 he did not break 1 percent here and dropped out caucus night chris wallace peter doocy on the campaign trail here and iowa peter thank you and joining us now democratic presidential candidate andrew yang welcome back to fox news sunday sir andrew yang d presidential candidate thanks for having me chris it aposs great to be here wallace no one has invested more in iowa than you have in these last few months let aposs take a look you aposve held 151 events here and spend 5 million in ads and yet in the latest real clear politics average of polls in the state you aposre running sixth with a little bit over 3 percent support for an entrepreneur and i know you you pride yourself on that that is not a good cost benefit analysis yang well chris the last poll that people consider the most authoritative had us at 5 percent and rising and we aposve been getting bigger crowds higher energy we aposre going to surprise a lot of people on caucus night on february 3rd i can guarantee you that i had a democratic operative right here in the state who said that from what he aposs hearing on the ground the polls underestimate our support and were going to grow and grow and peak when the voting starts wallace ok you know a lot of candidates who don apost do well say that you aposve also spent a lot of time and a lot of money in new hampshire so let me ask you the the direct hard question if you don apost finish in the top three or four in iowa or new hampshire is it time to drop out yang well you know chris and many people who have been paying attention to this race know that we aposve been growing faster than any other candidate in a campaign we have resilient grassroots support and we aposre going to be competing all the way through super tuesday and into the spring because we have a message that americans know to be true that we aposre in the midst of the greatest economic transformation in our country aposs history and we need a new way forward that will actually work for americans in every part of the country from rural towns to big cities wallace well let aposs talk about that and let aposs talk about issues your big idea is universal basic income what you call a freedom dividend of 1 000 a month for every adult in the country but a number of progressives for instance alexandria ocasio cortez who is supporting your opponent bernie sanders she says it aposs regressive and that it is not enough to to make up for the basic income inequality in this country yang well americans know instinctively that if you put a thousand dollars a month into our hands it would find its way right back into our main street economies make our families stronger healthier mentally healthier it would create hundreds of thousands of jobs it would improve the buying power increase the buying power of over 90 percent of americans and when i talk to iowans right here in creston and other parts of the state they see that their main street stores are closing that they aposre getting sucked dry because tech companies like amazon are soaking up 20 billion in value a year and not paying a dime in taxes this is not working for people here in iowa and around the country this is why we need the freedom dividend to actually put buying power directly into our citizens apos hands wallace the other big complaint about this idea is that instead of being on top of some government assistance programs that the freedom dividend would be instead of some of those government programs on your website you talk about quote consolidating some welfare programs to pay for the freedom dividend and your spokesman says freedom dividend is meant to be an alternative to means tested welfare programs like food stamps and housing vouchers so liberal critics say that basically this freedom dividend is going to keep struggling americans still struggling yang well i talked to a family here in iowa and what their frustration is is that the better they do the less they get in benefits that doesn apost work for families it doesn apost work for the american people so with the freedom dividend if you get this thousand dollars and you start working and doing better then you get to keep everything you make this way the incentives are aligned with both the family and our country and many people are frustrated with the makeup of our current program we have to be able to improve on what we have in a way that will actually boost both families and the economy wallace i want to change subjects dramatically for you your wife evelyn came out publicly recently and shared a very painful story about the fact that when she was pregnant she was molested by her own doctor here is some of what she had to say begin video clip evelyn yang wife of andrew yang i didn apost tell andrew or my family because i didn apost want to upset them i thought this happened to me i can i can process this i can deal with it i can compartmentalize it end video clip wallace she says that when she finally told you that you quite understandably cried i guess my question is how painful was it for you to when you realized that she had decided to go through this by herself without sharing it with you for some months yang it was extraordinarily painful chris the fact is i was away many of the times when she had these appointment with her doctor and so i felt like i aposd failed her i felt like if i aposd been there then this would not have happened to her and it aposs heartbreaking that this happened to evelyn it aposs heartbreaking that it happened to anyone and i aposm so incredibly proud of the fact that wallace what what do you hope let me ask though let me just ask you this though what do you hope women and men take from evelyn aposs story yang well first evelyn aposs story is not unique to her we aposve had this outpouring of support and gratitude from many women who frankly have been in similar situations and so what we have to do as a country is acknowledge that these situations happen more often than we aposd like to believe and that institutions instead of protecting the doctor in this case should be doing what they can to protect ourselves our wives our daughters our mothers we can do better than this as a country and the gratitude and support that evelyn has received over the last number of days has been really inspiring that we can do better wallace finally you decided to say this week that you thought that the democratic national committee had made a big mistake in deciding not to hold any presidential debates on fox i guess really two questions one why did you decide to say it and two after you did what was the reaction from the dnc yang well it came up at an event here in iowa someone asked how we aposre going to bring the country together and i thought well if you aposre going to bring the country together you have to start by talking to americans and i pointed out this example of where the dnc decided not to have any of the presidential debates on fox which i thought was a mistake and i haven apost had a direct conversation with the dnc they aposve been in touch with people from my team but i think it aposs this common sense you know to me hopefully the dnc will adopt a different approach in the future because we have to bring the entire country together the problems that face us affect all of us and we need to to come together as a country to solve them wallace mr yang thank you we appreciate your coming on thank you for your time and safe travels on the campaign trail sir yang thank you chris hope to see you in person here in iowa where going to surprise a lot of people february 3rd wallace we like being surprised when we come back we aposll bring in a pair of iowa insiders and what they aposre hearing from voters in the final week before the iowa caucus plus what would you like to ask the panel about who will win iowa just go to facebook or twitter at fox news sunday and we may use your questions on the air commercial break begin video clip unidentified female joe biden is the strongest candidate to do it he beats trump by the most nationally and in the states we have to win this is no time to take a risk we need our strongest candidate vote biden beat trump end video clip wallace well that is the latest joe biden ad that aposs been running on television almost nonstop in the three days we aposve been here in iowa and we aposre joined now by a panel of iowa political insiders dave price who tv political director and brianne pfannenstiel chief politics reporter for the des moines register and welcome to both of you brianne pfannenstiel chief political reporter the des moines register thanks for having us dave price political director who tv thank you wallace so brianne let me talk about to you first about the the biden ad no issue no policy just electability vote biden beat trump is that a winning message here in iowa pfannenstiel well we aposve seen a lot of fluctuation in iowa on the issues on the leaders but the one thing that aposs remained really consistent from the very beginning is democratic caucus goers telling us that beating trump is more important than anything else it aposs more important than finding a candidate who agrees with them on everything so in that sense this is an incredibly important message this idea of electability is exactly what democrats are looking for right now wallace dave i want to ask you about another one of the leading candidates there was this exchange this week between elizabeth warren and a dad here in iowa who had saved his own personal money to send his daughter to college take a look begin video clip unidentified male i just wanted to ask one question my daughter aposs getting out of school i aposve saved all my money she doesn apost have any student loans sen elizabeth warren d ma presidential candidate god bless you unidentified male am i going to get my money back warren of course not unidentified male so you aposre going to pay for people who didn apost save any money and those of us who did the right thing get screwed end video clip wallace so dave that was a pretty powerful moment price no doubt yes wallace and i i guess the question is warren seems to be falling back a little bit in the polls in iowa did that exchange with that dad and also the sort of dustup with bernie sanders and her refusal to even shake his hand after the iowa debate has that hurt her here in iowa price well that that video clip i think illustrates the conversations we aposve heard we aposve had with a lot of people on this topic right because you have some of these people no doubt warren has a passionate following bernie sanders has a passionate following but there are those here kind of pushing back against that idea about free stuff amy klobuchar talks about this all the time that that aposs not the way to win these people who left the party to go support trump in apos16 to try to get them back wallace here aposs the latest and it keeps changing here aposs the latest real clear politics average of polls here in iowa as you can see biden and sanders basically tied for first buttigieg and warren knotted up a little ways back but but the polls are all over the place there aposs a new new york times poll today which has bernie sanders bernie sanders seven points in the lead ahead of biden or ahead of buttigieg rather so let me ask you both as two of our experts here on the ground looking at the ground games talking to voters sensing the passion of their supporters i aposm not asking you for a winner but how do you handicap this race with eight days to go brianne pfannenstiel well you aposve definitely seen bernie sanders rise in these polls and that aposs kind of reflecting what we aposve seen on the ground for a really long time and that aposs the enthusiasm of his supporters our last des moines register poll showed that his supporters are more locked in they aposre more excited to caucus for him than any of the other candidates about half of his supporters say they aposre extremely enthusiastic that aposs 17 point ahead of elizabeth warren his next closest competitor in that metric and that really matters in a caucus wallace but does that does that contradict what you said in the first answer about biden the idea that they want somebody who can beat trump pfannenstiel well bernie sanders apos supporters believe that he can beat trump and that aposs what you know what they aposre looking at right now so we aposve seen him rise we aposve seen elizabeth warren level off from her point earlier on but iowa aposs ground game matters their organization on the ground matters so if she if she has an edge it aposs this field operation that she aposs built in this state that may help her on caucus night wallace and david what about biden what about buttigieg buttigieg at the end of the year was in first place now you can see him in fourth place the times poll he aposs in second place biden and buttigieg what aposs your sense of them price if you look at organization and the juice here right now and a good example last night joe biden had an event in a des moines suburb of ankeny a couple hundred people there it was all about electability as you all talked about before that aposs not super sexy right but they aposre looking up polls and his argument to people is i can beat trump here aposs how i can do it bernie sanders last night was about a half hour north of des moines in ames which is where iowa state university is they counted 1 800 people there there was clearly a tremendous difference with that juice with that energy there with pete buttigieg you may have some who question nationally whether he aposs ready for the job is he too young for the job all that kind of stuff he has a lot of organization they aposve been doing a lot of training to get ready for caucus night and to train people on when you go into this room since these caucuses are so unique and you can walk in there in the first round and support somebody but then change your mind perhaps if your candidate is not viable doesn apost have enough strength in that room and go to somebody else so being somebody aposs second favorite can be really important they aposre training people extensively on how to capitalize this they may not win the first round but they think they can do well in the second round and they have the organization they have the enthusiasm wallace and briefly dave what about klobuchar because she seems coming from the neighboring state of minnesota she aposs been down in the polls price put up lately wallace but up lately doesn apost but doesn apost she have to do well in iowa to to really carry on price that would be the expectation and the polls seem to be going in her direction she aposs be here a lot yang aposs been here a lot as you mentioned but she aposs been here a lot but the pressure you would think is really steep on her to get that top three to really make a charge to come out of here wallace we asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of who is going to win in iowa we got a slightly different question on twitter from rocky53 why is iowa relevant why do we start there when it aposs not as diverse the way the country is isn apost it a false start i aposm sure you aposve heard this before brianne how do you answer rocky pfannenstiel well the question of why it aposs relevant it aposs relevant because it aposs first that aposs that aposs the point it aposs the first vote it aposs the first real metric but i think you know a lot of people would look at the first four states together as a whole that they paint a more reflective state of the country and its diversity that there is no real perfectly diverse state that is perfectly reflective of the country but one thing that is beneficial to starting in iowa is that it aposs manageable this is a state that candidates can travel in you can come here and compete even if you don apost have millions of dollars and a war chest ready to campaign you can get out you can do the shoe leather face to face retail politics you you don apost have to have a ton of ads right at the beginning so the idea that it gives a level playing field wallace dave how and i aposm sure you get asked this all the time too why iowa price go back to 2000 you win the iowa caucus you get the democratic nomination for president it aposs that simple you don apost always become president like barack obama did republican side it hasn apost worked out that way the last three cycles they aposve nominated somebody who aposs won the caucuses rather who did not get the nomination later so there aposs a track record here you have to do well in iowa to get that nomination wallace and we aposve got just a minute left brianne from the iowans apos point of view how important that they get this moment every four years where the whole political world focuses on them how how important to iowa voters pfannenstiel iowans take this incredibly seriously we joke about it but it aposs true you meet so many so many caucus goers out on the trail who say i haven apost decided who i aposm going to support yet because i haven apost met them all so they want to shake their hand they want to look them in the eye they want to see them in person and they take that responsibility really seriously wallace and and compared and i aposve got 30 seconds for this compared to others there seems to be a since people are really undecided this time and could change their mind in the last eight days price and quick anecdote we aposve been following a group of nine undecided democratic caucus goers for three months ok we just met with them the last time only four of the nine have finally decided you still have five undecided some of them still have four people on their list and at the end it goes back to what brianne said early at the end of the day more than anything they want to beat donald trump they aposre not sure who can do it wallace brianne dave thank you both we aposll see how the world turns in just eight days up next our power player of the week he plays bad guys on tv but works for good in real life commercial break wallace and we aposre back now from the river center here in des moines iowa in the age of social media celebrities are finding new ways to connect with fans and use their star power for good here aposs our power player of the week begin videotape ian bohen actor and advocate social media has given us a voice that we normally didn apost have and that is incredible powerful wallace actor ian bohen is talking about channeling his on screen roles into off screen causes these days he plays ryan on paramount network aposs runaway hit yellowstone and he spent years as a villain on mtv aposs teen wolf a cult hit with teens affected by bullying bohen that show was largely about inclusivity about being an outcast and still being ok wallace on camera how much good do you think you can do as an actor advocate bohen i aposve met lots of of young kids at conventions that used to cut themselves and have had multiple suicide attempts and they aposll come to me and same watching the show that you did and the topics that were on it made me want to change and i aposm here today wallace voice over we met bohen when he was in washington for another cause the vettys an annual award ceremony honoring veterans bohen the suicide prevention vetty is given to the person or group that has demonstrated a significant impact or towards reducing veteran suicide wallace bohen aposs role on yellowstone sparked his latest cause yellowstone national park he recently filmed a tour with scientists to call attention to the park aposs environment wallace on camera is there a tangible impact of climate change on yellowstone bohen if it starts to get hotter earlier and things melt when they they shouldn apost it changes what food sources are available and that aposs when things get really out of control wallace voice over acting on yellowstone has brought bohen aposs career full circle his first big break was playing young wyatt earp in kevin costner aposs apos90s movie about the law man now he aposs back on the frontier with costner bohen and we aposre playing the same cowboy stuff and we still kind of tell the same stories and it aposs it aposs it aposs fun wallace on camera what has he taught you about acting as a career bohen one that you can apost only focus on one line of work unidentified male run you aposre not a reserve agent anymore bohen and how you carry yourself on set is really how people are going to respond to you more than anything and if you can keep those two things going and you aposve got a little talent and a little luck you aposre probably going to be all right wallace voice over bohen is diversifying he directed two short films and is aiming for more bohen so get on board be epic with me wallace in the meantime he says doing some good in real life hasn apost taken the fun out of playing bad guys on screen bohen we aposre howling ph for a cure when you can play a bad character you can excuse your bad behavior wallace on camera do you have bad behavior you need to excuse bohen personally i i have
