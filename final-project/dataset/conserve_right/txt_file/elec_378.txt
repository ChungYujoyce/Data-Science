 sign in his rejection of the obama clinton weak america was the clincher manage newsletters joe biden gets racist media immediately forgive forget the wuhan virus mask war joe biden the perverted magic eight ball that is always wrong the voting dead analysis opinion four years ago you could have almost seen bill clinton s thought bubble as he watched barack obama s weak and listless performance against mitt romney during the first presidential debate i can t believe we lost to this guy mr clinton never would have mailed it in the way mr obama did he may have lost some of his old magic but he s still got the golden touch his wife however never had it and clearly never will as evidenced by her plodding and grating debate performance against donald trump this week at the same time mr trump was aggressive projecting authority even when he was on relatively shaky ground unlike others who have opposed her he didn t care that she was a clinton or a democrat or a woman he didn t defer to her offer special treatment or allow her a wide berth for clintonian parsing top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots you are not going to die from covid 19 postal worker charged with mail in voting fraud relishing his outsider role he positioned her squarely in her role of status quo incumbent by doing so and by clearing the bar of appearing a reasonable man and plausible president he lived to fight another day because he s never done this before voters give him a lot more running room to make mistakes and find his bearings the fact that he more than held his own on the biggest political stage on earth is astounding the traditional metrics don t apply to this candidate or this election year which is why he was able to walk away not just intact but perhaps stronger in terms of political strengths mr trump appeared every bit the non politician the gifted television presence the spontaneous and charismatic force of nature mrs clinton showcased her deep resume while presenting herself as the next historically unprecedented choice riding the next identity politics wave in terms of political weaknesses mr trump whiffed on hitting her on her private email server the clinton foundation leveraging her public position to enrich herself benghazi her serial lying about all of this and more he had flashes of impatience and defensiveness and often lapsed into self reference when he should have kept his answers focused on the future of america mrs clinton meanwhile was predictably dissembling non transparent and obtuse while permitting the unknowns particularly about her health to remain unknown she looked every inch the global elitist and condescension dripped from her every pore not a good look for her in terms of major narrative vulnerabilities mrs clinton could not speak convincingly of the clinton foundation her server or email scandals nor of her portfolio as secretary of state libya benghazi specifically the russian reset the rise of china the iranian nuclear deal the failure to support key allies such as israel the decision to release known terrorists from guantanamo bay it helped that she wasn t asked about these things by the moderator lester holt who posed general questions to her while asking pointed questions to mr trump which forced him on the defensive she also could not speak convincingly of the economy or obamacare given that she is the grandmother of socialized medicine and obamacare is already in its predicted death spiral again she got an assist from mr holt who didn t bring it up mr trump struggled to speak convincingly about russia or ukraine or nuclear doctrine but one of his best moments was when she tried to suggest that he s unprepared for the presidency the question he said isn t whether she was in the game it s how she played it and what results she produced we are now less wealthy less prosperous less safe less secure less powerful on the flip side mr trump enjoyed major narrative advantages including the most feeble gross domestic product growth since the end of world war ii under mr obama and the attendant weakness in jobs and capital formation illegal immigration and bad trade deals that have disadvantaged the working and middle classes the breakdown of law and order in many american communities and the need to defeat the corrupt rigged system reorganize relations with allies and foes and reawaken american morale he managed to exploit some of this though it would have been more powerful if he had simply pointed to the smoking ruin of the obama clinton economy and foreign policy and said we tried it your way mrs clinton had the narrative advantage of the first clinton administration economy 1993 2001 the experience of having dealt with world leaders mr obama s popularity and beating up on wall street her failure to capitalize on many of these narrative strengths was a major communications failure debates however are less about the nuances of policy and more about style tone well timed zingers and demonstrating the ability to think on one s feet he sprinted through the questions with the speed and agility of a leopard she plodded through them with all of the grace of a three legged rhinoceros the scene is now set for the balance of the campaign the race remains in the air barring some unforeseen plot twist in the end however mr trump did one critical thing that went largely unnoticed he stated implicitly which he should have stated far more explicitly that we don t have to settle for the crippled america mr obama and mrs clinton have given us the power to turn it around rests with us and by making that clear mr trump scored the only point that really matters monica crowley is editor of online opinion at the
