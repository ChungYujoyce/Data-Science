trade deal during the 90 days that trump agreed to suspend u s tariff hikes said a ministry spokesman gao feng huawei technologies ltd the biggest global supplier of network gear used by phone and internet companies has been the target of deepening u s security concerns under trump and his predecessor barack obama washington has pressured european countries and other allies to limit the use of its technology the united states sees huawei and smaller chinese tech suppliers as possible fronts for spying and as commercial competitors the trump administration says they benefit from improper subsidies and market barriers trump s tariff hikes on chinese imports stemmed from complaints beijing steals or pressures foreign companies to hand over technology but american officials also worry

said it complies with all laws and rules where it operates including export controls and sanctions of the united nations the united states and european union meng s arrest also threatened to inflame disagreements over iran and trump s decision to break with other governments and re impose sanctions over the country s nuclear development geng the foreign ministry spokesman said china objects to unilateral sanctions outside the united nations china has said it will continue to do business with iran despite the possible threat of u s penalties meng is a prominent member of china s business
