uld be indicted for persecution of michael flynn socialism tempts as capitalism struggles during covid 19 pandemic russia probe analysis opinion prominent liberal fareed zakaria insists that donald trump has been profoundly unconservative because he s abandoned what republicans used to call the core of their agenda limited government but it s hard to take the charge seriously even though some conservatives have sent his piece around for comment to see if he s onto something yet no politician in recent memory has restricted the reach of government at both the federal and state level more than the current occupant of the oval office mr trump s drastic shrinking of federal economic regulations opening vast expanses of federal lands for energy exploration drawing overseas businesses home with tax breaks and passing major tax cuts for corporations and individuals have generated an explosion of well paying jobs personal wealth and soaring wages as well as the lowest level of unemployment for minorities on record some 7 million new jobs have been created during mr trump s presidency and more than 100 million american shareholders have watched the market jump 55 percent since his election you d think mr zakaria would be celebrating mr trump s low tax pro growth economic agenda as not only core republicanism but virtually reaganesque increasing prosperity by stimulating market forces without enacting high taxes and big government programs is of course how conservatives try to keep government limited top stories democratic clerk charged with altering nearly 200 midterm elections ballots doj warns gavin newsom california over coronavirus limits on churches fox news host jeanine pirro accuses fbi director of having role in deep state mr zakaria concedes that mr trump has delivered what conservatives have wanted in the realm of social and cultural policy such as appointing judges tightening rules related to abortion and asylum etc but suggests they have little to do with taming the leviathan really stacking the courts with judges steeped in the philosophy of federalism is of course precisely the way to limit government on both the economic and cultural fronts mr zakaria may ignore the threat but democratic party presidential candidates along with their media support groups are panicked over the president s court selections the washington post is so alarmed that it headlined its recent lead story trump s judiciary impact expands young appointees ensure rightward tilt for decades sen amy klobachar minnesota democrat a top tier presidential candidate pronounced that should mr trump be ousted in 2020 the new democratic president would have to immediately fill existing vacancies to reverse the horrific nature of these trump judges states in republican hands are passing laws to protect freedoms that democratic politicians judges and justices are eager to eliminate on the stump the party s presidential hopefuls are pledging that if they win the white house laws limiting the killing of babies leaving the womb alive will be a thing of the past while seizing guns from law abiding citizens may be a thing of the future they also threaten to confiscate a family s life time of savings the wealth tax place severe curbs on our religious liberties by removing tax exemptions from churches and punish those who may tolerate but refuse to celebrate exotic sexual lifestyles university of virginia law professor douglas laycock a staunch supporter of gay marriage points out in an interview in national review that house democrats have just approved the equality act which if passed into law means that religious schools would be heavily regulated with respect to sexual orientation and gender identity under this bill a religious doctor may be required to perform gender reassignment surgery and give hormonal treatments to those desiring to transition to a different sex it goes very far to stamp out religious exemptions that currently exist mr laycock tells national review and religious schools would probably be viewed as public accommodations even if they refuse all federal funding would the equality act require almost all religious and public schools mr laycock was asked to give transgender students the right to compete on the sports teams of their preference and full access to bathrooms showers locker rooms of their preference probably he responded reviewing several cases that the u s supreme court has narrowly decided in favor of religious believers columnist hugh hewitt thanked the president for choosing justices siding with those protecting religious liberty the stakes are immense as mr hewitt notes since the high court will make rulings this session that will affect tens of thousands of faith based schools without conservatives on the courts the democrats are also likely to open the gates to a new flood of illegal immigrants seeing as how they favor what can only be described as open border policies which mr zakaria regards as just some immigration and asylum or cultural issue no it is clearly an economic law and order and limited government issue many states are being overwhelmed financially by illegals who are findng their way onto their welfare rolls and into jail cells and malignant gangs president trump has been filling the courts including the u s supreme court and the crucial appellate courts at such a clip that even if he loses next year the courts will be in a strong position to block democrats at all levels of government from emasculating the states as defenders of our freedoms which is why the limited government crowd will likely vote republican in 2020 despite fareed zakaria s energetic effort to convince them otherwise allan h
